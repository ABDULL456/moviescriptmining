FADE IN: 
EXT. STAR-FILLED SKY - NIGHT                                  1 
Studio logo transitions into a CONSTELLATION in space. Cam pulls BACK, as more stars enter frame, forming a starfield. 
SPLINTER (V.O.) A sensei once counseled a grief- stricken boy, as his older brother 
prepared to leave for battle. N STARS - Begin to see a DOZEN or so stars, almost forming a zig-zagged line. Cam continues to adjust. 
SPLINTER (V.O.) 
He said, "Child, why do you cry? You are both part of a family. And a family is a bond that cannot be broken by war. By strife. By force or neglect. N STARS - Cam slows its truck-out to a gradual stop as we see the pattern beginning to form. As if following the stars' pattern, the CAM LOWERS as we find ourselves going into- 
S 
EXT. SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS 
PLINTER (V.O.) And more importantly, you are brothers. And brothers you shall remain, despite time... argument... 
O LOWER - framing the tops of JUNGLE, moonlit and surrounded by mist. A mountain range peaks over the horizon. 
SPLINTER ..and even... distance. 
SUPER TITLE: SOME STINKING JUNGLE IN SOUTH AMERICA CAM RESTS atop an old CHURCH ROOF. The peaceful scene is suddenly stopped by a MACHINE GUN BURST! CAM CRANES over the 
O roof revealing - 
EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS 
A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group of VILLAGERS. 
O N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs 
to her side. She's mad. Her son cries. 
WOMAN VILLAGER You monsters! UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see- - COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her. 
PANTERA We appreciate the generous donation for the continued protection of your village. ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's precious crops. WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately LUNGES at Pantera, just as- -SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck. 
PANTERA After all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA. They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING. 
EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 
The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the food. The Jungle looms ominous around them. 
H IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling high above... as if from someone's POV. ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around. 
PANTERA Idiota! Watch where you're going! 
HEY! NOT BELOW THE-OOOFF!! OW!! End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on the floor doubled over from the "playing". A beat, then- -one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey. 
LITTLE GIRL 
KEEEEYA! (turns and walks back) This was the best birthday ever, Mommy! Mikey GROANS as we- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - SUNSET/LATER 
Beautiful downtown autumnal street. Parked in front, we see the "COWABUNGA CARL" PARTY VAN loudly decorated in kid- friendly colors with an embarrassing and low-tech looking TURTLE HEAD ON TOP. PUSH IN on upstairs apartment window. 
S 
OCCER MOM (O.S.) Thanks so much. You're worth every penny. I have to tell all my friends about you. You'll love their kids too. 
INT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Mascot Mikey is standing at the door, holding a fistful of cash, still in full costume. 
MICHAELANGELO I can only hope they're as lovely as the rugrats you got here. ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then- throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids quickly smile to cover. 
MICHAELANGELO (through gritted teeth) Such... angels. Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV. 
SOCCER MOM Okay! Everyone say good-bye to Cowabunga Carl! BYE! 
MICHAELANGELO (put-on voice) Hyuk! Cowabunga dudes! Bye! 
KIDS 
BYE!!!!!! ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes. 
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Heheh... score. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head. His trademark orange bandana spills out. He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance. Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car whizzes by. WIDER - the van takes off down the street. 
DONATELLO (O.S.) Hey, hey, hey... don't forget the face thing. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER 
CLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS Left. Reacts. OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a ventriloquist to "hide" his identity. Don follows on a small surveillance cam under the rearview mirror. 
MICHAELANGELO Yes... sir. 
DONATELLO (O.S.) That's a good boy. 
MICHAELANGELO All's I'm saying Donnie is that no one would notice if YOU did one of these gigs every now and again. 
DONATELLO (O.S.) But you add such... panache to the character. Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He rubs his sore neck. 
MICHAELANGELO Well, if panache is French for "punching bag", I'd have to agree with ya. 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - MONITOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's, monitors and TV tubes. Cables run everywhere. In front of them is DONATELLO - our resident tech-head turtle. 
DONATELLO Close enough. I - uh-oh- ON MONITOR - Don watches Mikey through a TRAFFIC CAM in front of the van. Don is jacked into every major security and surveillance camera in the city. 
SPLINTER Ahh! Butter creme frosting! Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental. 
DONATELLO Master. No cake. You remember your last cholesterol tests. 
SPLINTER But I- (changes attitude) -Donatello! I am your Master! 
DONATELLO Nice try, sensei. But you can still be my Master... with low cholesterol. Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away, Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes Splinter a smaller wrapped piece. 
SPLINTER He-heh. You have done well, my son. Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses it with the rest.                                  C 
UT TO: 
EXT. ROOFTOPS - SUNSET 
The street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along the edge of the building, reaching a row of GARGOYLES. AN ALONG GARGOYLES - Still. Concrete. Creepy. Just as we pass the fourth, we barely notice it's WHITE EYES OPENING. QUICK SNAP BACK TO GARGOYLE - Only now it's gone. Something strange is coming to town... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW JERSEY HARBOR - SUNSET 
Large freighters. Lots of activity. PUSH IN on a steamer as a crane lowers a LARGE VERTICAL CRATE to the dock - it THUMPS down hard. 
APRIL (O.S.) Careful! That isn't some box full of fish! CAM LOWERS - as APRIL O'NEIL leaps down into frame. Dressed in jungle expedition gear with her head wrapped in a bandana. She takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate. ON BOX - Labelled "O'Neil Cargo". Something ominous about the crate. PUSH IN on it as April steps in front. Admires it with pride. Turns, takes out a cell phone, and hits speed dial. ON PHONE DISPLAY - "Calling HOME". It rings. 
APRIL (impatient mutter) Where are you? 
INT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
A spacious NYC loft - tons of bookcases work as room dividers. Piled with artifacts, unopened crates of all sizes, boxes of maps, and a general organized mess. A hockey game BLARES from a TV set. CAM PANS ACROSS ROOM - The telephone continues to ring just as we reach the KITCHEN - with piles of dirty dishes and fast food. And then a path of strewn clothes that gets messier and messier until we reach - - CASEY JONES, snoring on a sofa. He finally wakes up, clamors for the phone, tripping over mess in the process. 
C 
ASEY 
(GROGGY) Talk to me. 
APRIL Hey. It's me. I'm back. Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch. 
CASEY Was that today, babe? April's disappointed. Same old Casey. 
O 
APRIL Yes. It was today that I returned to you after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month. 
(BEAT) I thought you were going to meet me down here? 
CASEY I'm sorry, babe. I must've- 
APRIL Forget it. I'll take a cab. A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted. 
CASEY I missed you? April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in his chair, shaking his head. 
CASEY Good goin', Case. Back at the dock, April is back to business. 
APRIL Howie! Get this on the truck for delivery! Let's go! P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd swear we almost hear... LOW GROWLING. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIKEY'S BEDROOM - LATER 
Mikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on TV - bored. He puts down the controller and yells to the ceiling. 
DONATELLO You are such a Neanderthal. Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick and startled, eyes wide. 
APHAEL I rest my case. 
S 
PLINTER 
(SCOLDING) Raphael! If bullying is the only way to argue your point, then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with. 
APHAEL (gritted teeth) Yes, sensei. (to Mikey) And quit touchin' my stuff. Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the second floor. 
DONATELLO (too-late-retort to Raph) That was just a startle response and isn't really an indication of fear! Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC... ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song. 
RAPHAEL (O.S.) 
AAAARGH! AND STOP TOUCHING MY 
STEREO TOO, MIKEY!!! Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room. Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two. 
DONATELLO It's an involuntary thing your body does when stimulated like that. (no response) What? It's true. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT 
A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels fold out under the carriages. CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG- GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to the water and RELEASES! 
INT. SEWER PIPE - MOMENTS LATER 
Disgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat... inhales, then SMILES WIDE. 
LEONARDO Mmm... home sweet home. 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - NIGHT 
All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered in junk food wrappers. Donnie sleeps with an "TECH HEAD" magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap. ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor. The place feels different... but still feels like home. 
S 
He tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor, avoiding the potential noise-making mess below him. He sneaks to- 
INT. SPLINTER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious. 
SPLINTER Enter. Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter. 
LEONARDO I have completed my training, master. I am prepared for the next stage. 
SPLINTER That you are, my son. You must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life. THAT will be the most challenging training of all... plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION. Leo is touched. CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES, watching the entire scene... jealous. 
SPLINTER I've missed you, Leonardo. 
L eo hugs Splinter. 
LEONARDO I've missed you too, father. 
SPLINTER I'm afraid much has changed in your brothers' spirits since you have left. But now that you are home, they will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been lacking. The family needs you. ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard. 
LEONARDO Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei. 
WINTERS ASSISTANT The board is waiting. 
WINTERS Excellent. He walks to the large bay windows that overlooks the city. 
EXT. WINTERS OFFICE 
Now outside the window, he smiles at the view. 
WINTERS Tell them I'm on my way down. He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING - Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up and down the front of the building, allowing him access to any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk. WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish gated entry. A true work of modern architecture. 
WIPE TO: 
INT. WINTERS LOBBY - DAY 
We see the wonder of everything Winters - mixing of old artifacts with modern day aesthetic and implementation. The ceilings are vast and there is no mistaking the worth of the man and his company. 
W inters' Elevator Office lowers into a balcony level building overseeing the main lobby. He walks down a stairwell and through the lobby, five Assistants following him. 
INT. BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Winters walks in the room. CLOSE ON him as he stops at the head of the boardroom table. 
INTERS Gentlemen! Let's begin. 
T 
CAM PULLS BACK along the impossibly long table as DOZENS OF BOARD MEMBERS stand up. When it reaches the end, it looks as though Winters stands at the head of an ARMY AT ATTENTION. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - AFTERNOON 
Leo walks along the upper floor of their lair. As he passes Mikey's room, his brother pops out with his skateboard. We follow them as they walk down to the TV area. 
MICHAELANGELO Leo... what's up, bro? 
LEONARDO Just enjoying being home. hey walk past Donnie's Chop Shop room as - BOOM! - something explodes and smoke pours out under his door. 
DONATELLO (O.S.) 
NOBODY PANIC! I HAVE IT ALL UNDER 
CONTROL! Mikey and Leo COUGH, leave the smokey area. 
LEONARDO Say, what's up with April and Casey? I expected them to drop by after I got back. 
MICHAELANGELO We don't see much of `em anymore. April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be, I dunno, "different" lately. Maybe he doesn't like having to put the toilet seat down now that they've moved in together. 
LEONARDO They're living together now? They get to the living room area. Mikey walks to the edge of a jury-rigged HALF-PIPE he built in an old water slough. Mikey continues as he skates back and forth. 
MICHAELANGELO To be honest with ya, they're kinda buzzkills to be around. 
LEONARDO Is Casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing? 
K 
MICHAELANGELO Dunno. Haven't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to roost. WOOOOHOOOOOOOO! 
LEONARDO "Nightwatcher"? That some new comic book you're hooked on, Mikey? RAPHAEL walks in. Picks up Mikey's scrapbook as he passes the sofa and slugs it in Leo's chest. 
RAPHAEL This should explain most of it. The legacy of the city's newest hero. Compliments of the fanboy over there.    M 
The doors open in Winters Lobby. April struts in, owning the place. Casey struggles pulling the pallet holding the LARGE CRATE behind them. As she passes reception- 
RECEPTIONIST Mr. Winters. April O'Neil is here. 
INT. WINTERS OFFICE 
His darkened office is especially alpha-male - BIG GAME HUNT trophies adorn the walls, as do SUITS OF ARMOR from all time periods and random strange ARTIFACTS spanning history in glass cases. Winters sits at his large desk as the large doors open and April and Casey spill in. 
WINTERS Miss O'Neil. You are a vision. Thirty days in a jungle, and beautiful as ever. He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her. Casey's eyes widen - is THIS what his girlfriend does? 
APRIL Hello Max. 
(BEAT) This is my... friend, Casey Jones. 
WINTERS Chris! How's it going? Winters nearly crushes Casey's hand in his grip. 
CASEY Actually, It's Ca- 
WINTERS (ignoring, back to April) So how was your trip? 
APRIL You know, the typical - corrupt government officials, double crossed by a jungle guide, all ending in a heart-pounding chase. Winters and April chuckle. Cam adjusts to show Casey between them in the bg, looking uncomfortable and out of place. 
APRIL But it was all worth it. beat - excited) I found it. The fourth General. Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly HIGH FIVES her. 
CASEY Yeah-ha! The fourth General. 
APRIL (hushed gritted teeth) The crow-bar. 
CASEY Oh. He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks open the front panel. INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK - the front panel falls to the floor. CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back. 
WINTERS 
(SOFT) ...the gods be praised. ON BOX - We finally see the statue - GENERAL AGUILA - a seven- foot towering wall of granite and obsidian. Eagle warrior armor reflecting a South American design... though not from a specific time period. Winters rubs his hand over the stone. 
W 
APRIL Can I ask you a question? 
WINTERS (not looking away) 
Y es. Of course. 
APRIL I've been so grateful for the opportunities you've given me lately. I'd probably be still selling antique curios if you hadn't visited my shop that day. (off of box) But I have to ask... why the fascination with these particular works of art? I'd never even heard of the Legend of Yaotl until we met. He looks up. The cam PANS RIGHT. It travels past an SUIT OF ARMOR in the FG. Goes to BLACK. Continue PAN until we're in- 
EXT. FLASHBACK BATTLEFIELD - 3000 YEARS AGO 
-the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits. Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed. Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized. 
WINTERS (V.O.) It was a time long before the Mayans, April. Long before the Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was a time of legends. A time of greatness. The true mother culture of Central America. Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc. 
INTERS (V.O.) There was a man named Yaotl. More a force of nature than man. And together with his Four Warrior- Priest Generals, they pillaged every culture in their path. QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl. Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form. 
WINTERS (V.O.) And for every culture they destroyed, they drank in all the magic and knowledge known to them. 
(MORE) 
O 
WINTERS(cont'd) They became a warring hurricane, gathering more power and knowledge with each conquest. GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS. 
WINTERS (V.O.) Then they came across a culture rich with science, magic and their own technology. A South American version of "Atlantis". 
WIDER - Don and Mikey are already sitting there. 
MICHAELANGELO So nice of you to join us, gentledudes. 
DONATELLO And by the way, I prefer the classic military corner tuck for my bedsheets. 
M ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge... only Leo doesn't twitch. Suddenly- 
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Whoa! Whawazzat?! The others rush over to the edge with Mikey. 
ICHAELANGELO You dudes see that up there? OFF HIS LOOK - We see LARGE SHADOWS moving with in a large I- BEAM CONSTRUCTION SITE. The movement is coming from one of the higher floors. 
MICHAELANGELO So what now, captain? 
LEONARDO We need to come up with a plan. 
RAPHAEL Later! Raph RUNS OFF toward the action. 
LEONARDO 
RAPH!!! But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then- 
MICHAELANGELO Welcome home. 
EXT. I-BEAM HIGHRISE CONSTRUCTION 
The boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale up the few more stories to the top. They stand on a scaffold underneath the floor of the activity. ON WALL - Deep CLAW MARKS are carved into the steel, much like by April and Casey's loft. Don notices. 
DONATELLO Guys, I've got a bad feeling... 
L 
M 
RAPHAEL Ahh, let's take a tiny peek. They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge. 
MICHAELANGELO Well, there's a good/bad news scenario for ya. CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor. 
MICHAELANGELO Good news is that there are a buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot kicked out of `em. CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses them around like stuffed animals. 
ICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Bad news is WHAT's kickin' the snot out of `em... ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below) 
D 
ONATELLO An interesting conundrum. Do we hold dear the value of life and help the Foot regardless of our tumultuous past? 
MICHAELANGELO I vote for sitting back and enjoying the show. (to Leo) Whaddaya say, leader boy? ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered. 
RAPHAEL Nah. We kick butt. Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the Bigfoot Monster is confused as well. ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai. 
EONARDO Who are YOU?! ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks back at the Turtles... 
R 
The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it, not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below! aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper trouble. The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact. The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many flights of floors. Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom floor to await the others. SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor. 
RAPHAEL Nice of ya's ta join me. But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the Creature closes in- 
MICHAELANGELO 
YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!! The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles. 
WINTERS Are we... cool? The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse. 
WINTERS Ninjas. No sense of humor. (to Generals) So how did we fare? CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is wheeled into the light. Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight. 
WINTERS (close, quiet) So it begins... It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily. Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw. Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He merely grins at the creature. 
WINTERS (to General Aguila) Were there any problems? AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four. 
GENERAL AGUILA None, my lord. 
WINTERS (to Karai) You see, now THAT'S a good soldier. You two should compare notes. Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not used to being handled like this. 
K 
KARAI Just what is this all about? 
WINTERS Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt. (re: Generals) I now have the power and know-how, but I need the speed and stealth of an organization such as your own. Not to mention an organization that values discretion. 
KARAI But of course. 
WINTERS You see, I have nine more beasts like this that should be coming to town very soon. Thirteen in all, to be exact. The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell. 
ARAI But... why? Why here? Why now? 
WINTERS Instinct, mostly. They're animals at their core. (looks off, distant) And they recognize something familiar in the air... in the stars. 
(BEAT) What can I say? I'm a lover of animals. The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad 
W we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness. 
INTERS So you go and get to know each other. And don't forget... play nice. The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door. They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand. 
KARAI Not now. Our business will be handled at a later time... 
D 
R 
C 
After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet. Tired. Contemplative. 
UT TO: 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 
Three brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table. 
MICHAELANGELO Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night? Oi, my head... Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY. 
DONATELLO Was it just me, or did that creature look familiar? 
RAPHAEL We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner. 
LEONARDO Fact remains, Raph, that we should have never been there in the first place. 
APHAEL Well, I suppose that we shoulda let Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city... oh wait... HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call, fearless leader. 
ONATELLO Come to think of it, it WAS pretty strange to see the Foot too. And who was that woman? 
MICHAELANGELO I dunno, but she sure gave Leo a run for his money. 
QUICK SHOTS - Nightwatcher gearing up. ightwatcher emerges from a MAN HOLE. Walks to a long- forgotten and shadowed underside of a BRIDGE. He points up with a REMOTE - chirp! Slowly, his MOTORBIKE begins to lower on retractable grappling hooks. 
O N BIKE - Explodes out of a BACK ALLEY and into the night. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY BACK ALLEYS/STREETS - NIGHT 
Various shots of Nightwatcher tearing all over the city. On bike and on foot. Angry. Trying to work it out of his system. He's swallowed it all up to this point... getting harder. 
BEGIN MONSTER HUNTING MONTAGE 
Aggressive and driving music. Various shots of the Stone Generals capturing a laundry list of CREATURES that are coming into the city. See the tech, detail and precision that the Winters' operation works. Foot Ninja act as living "tracking devices" around the city. - The Generals capture a Sloth-like creature, jumping in throughout rafters above. The Foot try to help by blocking exits. - The Generals capture a werewolf-like creature in the high- speed subway tunnels. The Foot maneuver the subway car. - General Mono takes on a large scale YETI-like monster. A WWE-sized match set in a large abandoned warehouse. - Close calls, as humans come close to seeing the monsters... but rarely do. We see small house pets swiped away. Fleeting glimpses of limbs, claws and teeth in the shadows all over NYC. Meat trucks torn open and their contents "stolen". - Intermix quick shots of Generals and collars clamping, cells locking, etc. 
- See more cells being filled in Winters Basement. ONLY 3 
EMPTY CELLS REMAIN. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Quiet part of the neighborhood. Their lights are fully on. 
APRIL (O.S.) You sure you don't want to spar a bit? 
INT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
April is dressed in work-out gear on a grouping of floor mats. She twirls a wooden KATANA as part of a floor routine. Wow - she's actually pretty good! Casey eats a bag of chips with one hand, does curls with a dumbbell with the other. 
CASEY Nah. Ever since you started with the blade weapons you, um... you kinda scare me. 
APRIL Suit yourself. (she stops - a beat) Case? 
CASEY Yeah? 
APRIL 
(AWKWARD) Are you happy? I mean, with your life. With me. Casey pauses a beat. Tries to be upbeat. 
CASEY Yeah. Sure. (beat - serious) You? April thinks just as much. 
APRIL Yeah. They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss. April doesn't notice. Awkward. Casey changes his mind. 
CASEY (walks to the window) I'm going outside for some air. 
N 
N 
Casey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better. 
APRIL (to herself) Be safe. 
EXT. LOFT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 
Casey climbs up from the fire escape. Checks to make sure he's alone. He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out - A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK! He slips it on. Does a few warm up swings. Cricks his neck. 
EXT. NYC ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS 
All is still, until the panicked face of a BURGLAR enters frame. Being held by his collar. 
BURGLAR 
CASEY Could use a little... help here... 
RAPHAEL 
(WEAK) Hey April... how ya been? 
M 
Raph passes out as we- 
WIPE TO: 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - KITCHEN 
Splinter and the other three are finishing up dinner. They close the pizza box. 
ICHAELANGELO My compliments to zee chef. 
(BEAT) Le brrrraaaaaaapp! Mikey walks to the fridge of leftover birthday cake. 
MICHAELANGELO Anyone for dessert? 
EVERYONE (sick of cake) 
NO!! The phone suddenly rings. Don rushes over to the jury-rigged payphone on the wall. 
DONATELLO 
COWABUNGA-CARL-PARTY-SERVICES- Cowabunga-dude. (face falls) Waita-slow down April. What happened to Raph? 
(BEAT) We'll be right there. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER 
ON WINDOW - One by one, Leo, Don and Mikey slip into the window. They spot Raph on the futon, being tended to by April 
M and Casey. Mikey looks around. 
ICHAELANGELO Whoa... I am in the wrong line of work. Nice pad, kids. Don immediately starts checking Raph out. 
DONATELLO His vital signs seem to be okay. (opens his eye) Pupil dilation is normal. Raph weakly pushes Donnie's head away. 
C 
RAPHAEL 
(WEAKLY) Get the... frig offa me. 
DONATELLO Temper is normal too. (to others) He's going to be fine. Health-wise, I mean. Otherwise, he's still the same old Raph. 
(BEAT) Whoa. ON RAPH'S SHELL - Two Obsidian Disks are wedged in his back with a Tranquilizer Dart. Donnie wedges out the Obsidian Disk with pliers. LOSE ON - Disk. It's beautiful and deadly. Don examines. 
DONATELLO Some sort of stone... probably obsidian, I think. 
(CLOSER) There's an engraving on it. Looks... South American. Aztec? No. It's definitely not Mayan. April swallows hard. 
APRIL It can't be. 
DONATELLO What can't be, April? April sits down on the floor with the disk. Trying to figure things out. Casey leans down to her. 
LEONARDO Do bad guys still try to do that? 
DONATELLO Yes, however they're usually mortgage re-fi companies. 
(THEN) What about it, April? You just finished working with the guy, right? Does it make sense? 
APRIL Guys! It's a legend! 
R 
MICHAELANGELO Is that "legend" like the ginormous freakin' hairball that attacked us? 
APHAEL Or "legend" like the moving statues and flying creature that attacked me n' Casey? 
APRIL Okay. Fine. I'll help for now... until we prove you're all insane. 
LEONARDO Or until we prove Winters is up to something more than collecting art. 
DONATELLO I'll work with April and see if these Stars of Kikin she told us about can give us any clues. 
RAPHAEL I say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person! 
LEONARDO Raph, that would be the worst idea yet. We hang back. Analyze. Formulate a plan, THEN storm your castle. Are we clear? Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway. Casey stops him. Quieter moment. 
CASEY Raph. Don't do it, man. 
(BEAT) I spent my whole life running out of rooms ticked off at the world. I wish I could take most of `em back. Sometimes, just takin' a breather is the best thing to do. ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is growing up. Raph knows he can't win. 
RAPHAEL Yeah... whatever. - and bolts out the door. 
CUT TO: 
A 
INT. SEWERS - MOMENTS LATER 
Cam is moving fast... really fast down the pipes. Raph EXPLODES into frame, running faster than us. He lifts up a BACK PACK... He pulls it open, revealing his Night gear. - as he grabs an overhead PIPE and flips up and outta sight. 
EXT. STAR-FILLED SKY - NIGHT 
We see the same stars we've been tracking move closer into alignment... only now it means so much more to us. CAM LOWERS, as we find ourselves- 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - EVENING 
Donnie looks through a thick book on ASTRONOMY. 
PRIL (O.S.) Think this is all of them, Donnie. ON DOOR - April walks in, holding a 3-foot-high stack of yellowed documents. 
APRIL I cleaned out my archives on ancient South America. Might have found something useful. She takes out a hand-drawn map. 
APRIL A map of the stars, as recorded by an Aztec Shaman. They pinpoint the location of the Stars of Kikin... even though the names changed. 
DONATELLO For use in an Aztec calendar. (picks up map) So, if we can cross-reference our current star field, positioning of the Stars of Kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the Aztec 
CALENDAR- 
APRIL -along with taking into account the point of origin of the first occurrence, we should know where another portal could take place. (to herself) Max, what are you up to? 
Leo paces back and forth in the main area. Splinter walks in. Mikey plays video games on the main TV. 
SPLINTER Leonardo, time cannot be moved faster by wearing a groove in our floor. 
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT 
Nightwatcher runs along the rooftops. He pauses. He lifts his visor to feel the night air on his face. He sees WINTERS TOWER in the distance... practically egging him on. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PETE'S DINER - CONTINUOUS 
Classic Diner design, Pete's Diner is closed for the evening. The last light goes out. 
INT. PETE'S DINER - CONTINUOUS 
A greasy DINER COOK finishes cleaning up the tables. He suddenly hears a noise in the back. Big CLANK. KITCHEN - He walks to the back. He hears the noise... now from inside the WALK-IN FREEZER. He slowly approaches it. ANOTHER NOISE. He moves to open INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens. The man's face peers in. His eyes go WIDE. He SCREAMS!!! 
EXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS 
Nightwatcher hears the scream. Runs to the source and looks down at Pete's Diner. Sees the commotion inside. Uses his bolo chain and a power cable to form a ZIP LINE down the street as- 
INT. PETE'S DINER - MOMENTS LATER 
-KERSMASH! He goes through the front window! He stands, cat- like. Ready for anything. The room is only lit by the neon signage behind the counter. Suddenly - Night creeps to the freezer. He can hear the CHEWING and the SNARLING behind the thick door. He takes out a spiked brass- knuckle. Ready. Places a hand on the door... and opens it. ON DOORWAY - The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen meat. Chewing with pieces flying everywhere. Disgusting. It turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking DEMON... but "cute" in a bizarre kinda way. Music builds as go- WIDER ON SIDE VIEW - Night stands there. The horrible demon creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too! Face off with Raph as we realize- -it's only THREE FEET TALL! 
NIGHTWATCHER Hey there little fella. All that commotion for just little ole y- The Demon SCREAMS! It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor behind a row of tables! 
NIGHTWATCHER (O.S.) 
WAHH! OOOF! AAAGGH! OW!! WHOAAA!!! Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all over the diner as the Demon pummels him. CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward, mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN. 
T he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped up on cocaine. A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his pocket. And waits... until... ...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside! WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner! 
A 
NIGHTWATCHER (victory taunting) Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't mess with the Nightwatcher! Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary. 
DINER COOK Pl-pl-please don't hurt me! 
NIGHTWATCHER Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST 
SAVED YOU! 
DINER COOK Please, sir. I have kids. Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor. He picks it up, puts it on the counter. 
NIGHTWATCHER There ya go, pal. Make sure this is safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME? 
DINER COOK 
TAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT 
ME, PLEASE! 
NIGHTWATCHER 
LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN' 
CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A 
HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY? (points threatening) 
I JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE! Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window. CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders of LEO. ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register. CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him. 
B ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying to figure out his next move. 
In another part of the city, the Generals have caught the Demon from Pete's Diner. As they carry him to the caravan, their RADIO COMM goes off. 
KARAI (O.S.) The Foot report of strange activity five blocks north of your location. 
GENERAL SERPIENTE The final creature. 
EXT. ROOFTOP DEAD END - CONTINUOUS 
Camera RISES UP until we reach the rooftop where Leo and Raph continue to duke it out in the rain. They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball of anger, unleashing everything on Leo. 
R 
It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai 
MILLIMETERS FROM HIS EYEBALL! Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then stops. He collapses back. Almost ashamed of what he's done. Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant heavily. The rain dies down. Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother. He suddenly STOPS and looks back at Leo, small in the distance. CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight back... but is too wiped from Raph. GATO POV - "reading" Leo on the ground. He frowns. 
GENERAL GATO It is neither monster nor human. CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile. 
GENERAL AGUILA Then he shall perfectly serve our purposes... let us inform our commander that the final creature has been captured. ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets TRANQUILIZED with the Generals' dart cannon. 
RAPHAEL 
LEO!!! Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and catch his brother. 
RAPHAEL 
L eo!!! Hang on!! But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph. 
APHAEL 
NOOOOOOOO!!!! Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - MORNING 
April and Don are poring over books at the kitchen. Mikey paces behind them. Raph storms in, barrels past them all. 
S 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - TRAINING DOJO 
Raphael walks to Splinter, practicing himself in the dojo. Raph holds his Sais in one hand, his bolo chain in the other. Clenches both tight. 
SPLINTER Raphael? What is the matter? 
RAPHAEL 
(RANTING) I was out, and did... something... something happened and I- ARRRGH!!! Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo. Splinter is unfazed, but he won't take any more. 
SPLINTER Raphael! Kneel. Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father. 
RAPHAEL I did something... I did something really stupid, Master Splinter. 
SPLINTER Go on... 
RAPHAEL 
(SEMI-RAMBLING) I know why you chose him now. I know that there's a reason why he's the better son and I'm not. 
(THINKS) And I think I made things worse tonight. (beat - calming down) A WHOLE lot worse... I know you must be ashamed of me, father. Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of Raph. 
APRIL (models it) Picked it up on my last trip to Japan. You... like it? 
CASEY Oh... oh yeah. They share the moment. Seeing what they forgot about each other when they first met. It's enough for them to smile. 
APRIL Where's your mask? 
M 
E 
CASEY (faking confusion) Mask? What mask? April runs into the other room and comes back with her hands behind her back. She takes out a NEW MASK for Casey - cool, crisp and a badass paintjob. 
CASEY No way... 
APRIL I was saving it for our anniversary. 
CASEY 
(BEAT) Thanks. Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss her... Then a MUSICAL TUNE (first bar of the TMNT series) plays on a car horn outside, interrupting them again. 
APRIL That's our ride. 
INT. VEHICLE - NIGHT 
CAM PULLS BACK from the back seat. Everyone is in "the zone". Splinter and Don sit in the back seat. Pulling further toward the front, we see April and Casey. nd on Raph in passenger seat and Mikey driving. 
RAPHAEL You know I ain't much on speeches. 
(BEAT) But we can do this. Leo, or no Leo. (looks around) Not because of our individual strengths... but because of how we function as a team. 
ICHAELANGELO I love you man. 
RAPHAEL Don't push it. (to April) April, this is going to be dangerous. You sure you're in? 
APRIL I feel responsible, fellas. I found the Generals for him. 
O 
CAM CONTINUES TO PULL OUT - as the familiar jingle of Cowabunga Carl fades in and we see the Cowabunga Carl Party 
R Van in full view. 
APHAEL (O.S.) Nice an' incognito there, Mikey. 
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Well, I didn't see you offering any suggestions... besides- (imitates Splinter) - a true ninja can hide in plain sight, my son! 
SPLINTER (O.S.) I heard that! Van takes off as the CAMERA SLOWS in the street, watching it drive away. NYC civilians point to the sky, worried. PUSH IN on a TV/STEREO STORE WINDOW - Simon's Electronics. ON TV - Broadcasting a news report. Weather alert. Black clouds brew over head. 
BUBBLY WEATHER REPORTER (O.C.) Scientists are calling it the fiercest storm of the new millennium, with Dopler Radar readings coming in off the charts. Authorities are imposing a curfew to avoid possible civilian harm. Stay tuned for more in minutes. FURTHER DOWN THE STREET - We see Winters Tower and the darkest clouds of all beginning to collect overhead. 
INT. WINTERS LOBBY 
Winters stands with Four Generals in his office, overseeing the portal. Ready. 
INT. WINTERS GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Karai walks down the center path of the garden, flanked by a DOZEN FOOT NINJA. She motions for them to take position. 
KARAI As ordered - no one gets in. No one interferes. No one bears witness. SUDDENLY - the security alarm from the front gate BUZZES. Karai waits a beat. It buzzes again. She walks to the SECURITY PANEL by the front gate. N MONITOR - We see CASEY standing there, obscured by a LARGE WOODEN CRATE IN FRONT OF HIM. Karai coldly opens the gate. 
C 
INT. WINTERS LOBBY 
Our six Heroes all tear into the lobby. They turn back, an army of ninjas closing in on them! 
MICHAELANGELO What do we do, dudes?! 
DONATELLO I'm working on it. Raph grips his sais with renewed strength. Casey looks around, putting things together mentally. Tension builds! 
RAPHAEL We get ready for round two. ON CASEY IN CORNER - He reaches into his back, takes out a hockey stick and - SMASH!!! - kills a LOBBY VASE. Suddenly, sirens blare as the OUTSIDE BUILDING SECURITY SHUTTERS SLAM DOWN just like in Act I! The Ninjas are locked out! 
RAPHAEL Yeah! Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles. 
APRIL Nice work, Jones. 
CASEY I have my moments... 
DONATELLO Look! OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens. 
DONATELLO And that would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume. 
(BEAT) Cool. They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell. 
MICHAELANGELO Leo! Is that you? RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way. 
MICHAELANGELO I guess that would be a "no". ON RAPH - He finds Leo! 
DONATELLO Out of the way, please. 
D on places a small EXPLOSIVE on a key lock. Raph pulls Leo out. LIFELESS. 
RAPHAEL Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo, please wake up! Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as... 
LEONARDO (O.S.) Wh-wh-what took you s-so long? WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat. 
RAPHAEL Listen, I - I'm sorry. 
Leo forgives him. Moment is suddenly broken by an OS 
SMASH!!!! ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the window of his elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding BRONZE STATUE... particularly the sword part. Closer... closer... and... ..just misses it. WHUMP! He crashes onto the floor. 
MOTIONLESS. ON GROUP - They just stare at him. Back up to the office, nearly 150 feet above them. ON BALCONY ABOVE - Aguila looks down. Snarls. 
INT. WINTERS LOBBY 
Winters' body still lays on the floor. This is bad. 
CASEY Is he... is he dead? Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes Winters' limp body. Nothing. 
MICHAELANGELO Yup. He's WAY dead, dude. WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room. ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine! Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice those around him. 
WINTERS 
(GROANS) Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts them at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him. 
WINTERS Fascinating... 
SPLINTER Mister Winters. We mean you no harm. 
RAPHAEL No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to give you piercin's in places you never imagined if you don't tell us what's going on. 
O 
GENERAL AGUILA 
NO! YOU WERE WRONG. 
BEAT) And you are weak. 
GENERAL AGUILA (to Karai) Destroy them. Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS - military/ninja style. 
APRIL What does THAT mean? 
KARAI It means we're going to help you. WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building, leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind. 
KARAI My soldiers will find the thirteenth monster. And you will bring it back here. Hurry - we don't have much time. Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still hurting. April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind with the Four Foot. They run out into the garden, just in time to see the other Foot disappear into the night. 
CASEY I got shotgun! BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles quickly look at one another. Know what they have to do. They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his backstabbing Generals. Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him, defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don. 
RAPHAEL If you mess with one of us- (looks around) -you mess with all of us. Aguila smiles at their chutzpa. 
GENERAL AGUILA Challenge accepted. 97   The Portal worsens behind them. Sound and sight. The Eight 97 are ready to fight. ...and the fight BEGINS! The Turtles leap, pounce and strike with all the exuberance and intensity they've ever had. Winters moves to help the Turtles. Suddenly a WALKING STICK across his chest stops him! 
SPLINTER They must face them alone. As brothers. Winters debates it in his head for a beat - WHAM! - a tentacle from the portal slams down next to him! 
WINTERS Alright. We have more important things to do! ON PORTAL - A small DEMON makes its way out of the portal! Winters runs and flips through the air and then CLOBBERS IT with his bare hands, sending it back down! He lands on the other side. 
WINTERS Help me push the cells into the portal! Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS 
CASEY (O.S.) This has got to be the suckiest vehicle to save the world with. - as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner. Tinkling musical notes chime along with the speed. Appropriately lame and embarrassing. INSIDE VAN - Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are crammed in the back. Awkward silence. 
CASEY So... anybody from out of town? 
W 
E BEGIN TO INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LOBBY FIGHT, 
AND CASEY/APRIL MONSTER CHASE... LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle. Utter commotion. Mikey is paired with Serpiente. Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue. Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo's knocked shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with swords and bladed weapons of all kinds. 
LEONARDO Come to daddy. MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action. Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body. He pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight. 
C 
C 
Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS. It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be aware of their environment to avoid defeat. 
RAPHAEL Sensei! How you guys doing?! ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in. About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems to be having FUN. 
SPLINTER Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL! BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC. 
KARAI My troops have located the final monster. At the harbor docks. 
ASEY Oh, I got this one covered. Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES over the harbor warehouses until we see - - the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE. It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene. 
I NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at each other. 
ASEY Huh. Now there's somethin' you don't see every day... They pile out of the van. 
CASEY (off of monster) Well, I guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to Winters' Tower. 
WINTERS 
LOOK OUT! Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back into the Portal! ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle. ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken... and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them. 
Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal. 
GENERAL AGUILA 
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE- WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion! 
RAPHAEL I thought he'd never shut up. WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence. 
MICHAELANGELO 
HOLY CRAP!!! 
RAPHAEL 
WE DID IT! 
TURTLES 
YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT! The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud. ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out last beside them. 
CASEY (caught - looks at both) Oh. I, uh - HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks. 
APRIL Don't try to tell me for one second that you didn't enjoy tha- Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like they should have been kissing all along. They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed. 
MICHAELANGELO 
AWWWWWW.... Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment. Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps forward - 
KARAI You are every bit the warriors I was informed you were. You have passed. 
ON TMNT - they're confused. 
LEONARDO Passed what? 
RAPHAEL You know us? 
KARAI I've known OF you for some time. (beat, to Leo's question) Savor your victory tonight. For soon we will have further business together. 
SPLINTER What kind of business? 
KARAI The kind that involves familiar faces from your past... ON TURTLES - They all look at each other. 
RAPHAEL She doesn't mean... They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED. Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner. Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly. 
RAPHAEL Winters? ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned. Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is spotted red with his M own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek. 
ICHAELANGELO I'm never usually that happy to be bleeding. 
DONATELLO You would be if you were an immortal who couldn't bleed for three thousand years... Winters looks at all the Turtles. 
WINTERS Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You've made a very old man, very very happy. 
MICHAELANGELO So, um, what happens now?

Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck. 
Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across   the bathroom. The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny. 
Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards. Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side. 
The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram. In sharp f-g., the                 Lizard         crumples          forward        on    her        knees, foaming blood. 
Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram. 
In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action. c0NT1NuED

NARRATOR 
No one would have believed in the early years of the21st century, that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own. That as men busied themselves about their various concerns, they observed and studied. Like the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro about the globe, confident of our empire over this world. Yet, across the gulf of space, intellects, vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our plant with envious eyes. And slowly and surely, drew their plans against us. 
EXT. DOCK - CARGO BAY - DAWN 
Ray (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down the stairs. 
SAL 
Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa! 
Ray turns away and laughs because he already knows what he is going to say. 
SAL 
I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00 I got half of Korea coming in. 
RAY 
No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour blow! Call Tadesko. 
Camera follows them walking down the street. 
SAL 
Tadesko can't move 40 containers in an hour. I need somebody who can do double picks. 
RAY 
I wish I could help you Sal. God damn union regulations. 
SAL 
(getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position here! 
RAY 
Come on, you remember the union regulations, Sal. 
SAL 
(angrily) You know what your problem is? 
Sal stops on one side of the street while Ray continues walking. 
RAY 
(joking) I can think of a couple of women who'd be happy to tell you. 
EXT. RAY'S CAR - DRIVEWAY - DAWN 
Ray gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as Tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair, extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and Ray's ex-wife Mary Ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. Robbie (15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes (but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.) and Rachel (10, still dressed in Barbie color scheme clothing, long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car. 
RAY 
Is it 8:30? We say that? 
MARY ANN 
We said 8:00. 
RAY 
(changing subject) Hey, this is one safe looking vehicle you got yourself here Tim. Congratulations. 
TIM 
Thank You. 
RAY 
8 o'clock huh? 
MARY ANN 
Mary Ann, let me get this. 
MARY ANN 
I can get it. 
RAY 
(rushes to close his bedroom door, as if hiding something) Excuse me. 
Ray gets his door closed as Mary Ann goes into Rachel and Robbie's room. 
INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RACHEL AND ROBBIE'S ROOM - DAWN 
Mary Ann and Ray go into the room where Robbie is laying on his bed listening to his MP3 player. Rachel sits down on her bed. 
MARY ANN 
A little old to still be sharing aren't they? 
RAY 
I don't hear any complaints. 
MARY ANN 
No, I do. 
Mary Ann walks over to Robbie on his bed and grabs his MP3 player. She un-plugs the headphones and the music stops. Ray sits down on a desk chair. 
MARY ANN 
Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie to make sure he's listening) ...on the French occupation of Algeria due Monday which he's yet to begin. It would be nice if he were done by the time we got back so we don't have to keep him up all night on Sunday. 
Mary Ann looks at Robbie who promptly says... 
ROBBIE 
I just got to type it up. (makes typing motion) 
MARY ANN 
No, you just got to start writing it first. 
ROBBIE 
(interrupts her) I love you mom! 
Mary Ann kisses him. 
MARY ANN 
I love you. (begins walking over to Rachel) Listen to your father. 
Mary Ann hugs Rachel and promptly notices... 
MARY ANN 
Oh, no shoes on the bed. 
INT Ray's House - Walking Down Stairs - Dawn 
MARY ANN 
We'll be at my parent's house in Boston but don't call the house line, because you know. Well the point is I've got my cell phone. So if anything comes up, or if you have any questions just call. 
RAY 
Believe it or not, I can handle it. 
MARY ANN 
I'll leave the phone on. 
RAY 
Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for you. 
Mary Ann opens door and proceeds to walk out the door. She stops to say... 
MARY ANN 
You think? 
RAY 
Yeah. 
MARY ANN 
Take care of our kids. 
That why you act like such a dick? 
Ray throws the ball and Robbie purposely misses, shattering a window behind him. Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up the stairs back into the house. Ray stares at Rachel who stares back. 
RAY 
What? 
RACHEL 
That's not how you're going to get through to him. You want him to listen to you... 
RAY 
(interrupts her) What are you? Your mother or mine? 
RACHEL 
Where are you going? 
RAY 
To sleep. I work for a living. 
RACHEL 
What are we supposed to eat? 
RAY 
You know, order. 
INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - DAWN 
Ray takes off his shirt, seems to loose his cap with it, and takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep. 
INT Ray's House - Living room -  Day 
Rachel is flipping TV channels as Ray walks down the hall after his nap. He sits down and sees Rachel picking at a splinter. Rachel has his hard hat on. 
RAY 
What's the matter? 
RACHEL 
I got a splinter. 
RAY 
Where'd you get it. Come here. 
RACHEL 
On your porch railing. 
RAY 
What, you want me to... (beat) You want me to take that out for you? 
RACHEL 
Absolutely not! 
RAY 
Well, come here let me see it. 
Rachel shows him but doesn't let him touch it for fear he may pull it out. Rachel and Ray ad lib as she stops moving it and he looks at it. 
RAY 
It's gonna get infected. 
RACHEL 
No it wont. 
RAY 
Yes, it's gonna get infected. 
RACHEL 
No, it won't. When it's ready, my body will just push it out. 
RAY 
Push it out? 
RACHEL 
I want to go inside. 
RAY 
It's okay. 
RACHEL 
I want to go inside. 
RAY 
Okay, you go ahead. 
The friend's baby starts to cry... 
FRIEND 2 
That's enough weather for me. (begins walking inside) 
RACHEL 
I don't want to go by myself. 
BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house. BAM! The lighting continues. BAM! 
RAY 
Kind of fun, ain't it? 
RACHEL 
No. 
RAY 
Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of July. 
RACHEL 
No it's not. 
Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house. BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!! Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING continues. 
INT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day 
Ray and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes Rachel scream. 
RAY 
It's okay. You're fine. 
RACHEL 
It hit right behind our house. 
RAY 
Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there again because lighting doesn't strike twice in the same place. 
BAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump. 
RAY 
Oh, SHIT! 
They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues. They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor under the table as the lighting goes on. 
RACHEL 
Where's Robbie? 
RAY 
I don't know. 
RACHEL 
Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you okay? 
BAM! The lighting continues. 
RAY 
Where's the thunder? 
RACHEL 
Why won't it stop? 
Pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all is silent. 
Yeah. 
RAY 
Good, because your sister is in the house, I want you to go in that house and I want you to stay with her. Okay? (break, as he starts running down the street) And the next time you take my car with no driver's license and no permission, I call the cops. You better be there when I get back. 
Robbie doesn't move in fear. Ray gets angry that he is not going. 
RAY 
Robbie. (snaps his hands together) 
Ray begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards away. 
RAY 
Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it, dead? 
MANNY 
All of them, everything, look at this... (taps the starter motor) starter's fried. 
RAY 
Lightning hit it? 
MANNY 
Not even close. I thought if I changed it... you got any idea what's going on? 
RAY 
I'm on my way to find out. Try umm... try changing the solenoids. 
MANNY 
Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right see, I told you that, the solenoids. 
Everyone who's car is fried is checking their car to see what went wrong. Ray joins about 30 people walking down to where the lightning started hitting. Ray's friends join him. Cops walk by. 
COP 1 
Let us through. Let us through here. 
FRIEND 3 
Hey, what up, Ray? 
RAY 
(joking) I should of known you two were behind this. 
FRIEND 3 
Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor hood 
RAY 
Can you blame him? 
FRIEND 4 
You see it? 
RAY 
Yep, you got power where you are? 
FRIEND 3 
Nope, nothing. 
RAY 
It's the cars though. That's the thing. 
FRIEND 4 
Solar Flare, that's what this guy told me. 
RAY 
A solar flare? 
FRIEND 4 
Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma, they turn into solar flare flashes. It's the only thing that can kill all of the electronic stuff. 
FRIEND 3 
Can I say something? 
The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides behind a building as the machine walks by. 
EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH -  EVENING 
Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say... 
ROBBIE 
What happened? 
Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the kitchen, not responding. 
RACHEL 
What's going on? 
Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on the stool at the island. 
RACHEL 
Dad, what's the matter? 
ROBBIE 
What's all that stuff all over you? 
Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie. 
Rachel reaches through a leg of the island to pull at Ray's hood on his shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his head toward Rachel fast enough to make some of the white powder poof off as if jerked back into reality. Robbie jumps as well in fright. 
RACHEL 
What's all the stuff? 
ROBBIE 
Hello? Ray? 
Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing it off, he begins mentally planning what to do. 
Walking back into the kitchen... 
RAY 
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds. 
Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over at the force Ray used. 
ROBBIE 
(questioning) What? Wait. I have no idea what's going on... 
RAY 
(while Robbie asks) ... all the food from the refrigerator and the cupboard, put it in here. 
ROBBIE 
I think we are having a bit of a shock here...what's going on, just tell me... 
RAY 
Just do it. 
Ray runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try to get it to work. 
RAY 
Rachel, sweetheart... 
RACHEL 
Dad, you're really scaring me. 
RAY 
I need you to get your suitcase... 
RACHEL 
Dad. (break) Dad! 
RAY 
The one that you brought, bring it to me, okay? 
Ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP. 
RAY 
Can you do that for me, darling? 
Rachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing while Robbie grabs her hand as reassurance. 
ROBBIE 
Will you hold my hand? 
RACHEL 
Yes. 
ROBBIE 
Are you gonna be okay? 
RACHEL 
(relatively calm) Yes. 
Robbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front. 
ROBBIE 
(taking a breath to calm himself) I want to know everything you know. 
Ray looks into Robbie's eyes who is looking straight forward on the road. 
RAY 
This thing, this machine, it crawled out of the ground and started torching everything, just killing everybody. 
ROBBIE 
What is it? (break) Is it terrorists? 
RAY 
No, this came from some place else. 
ROBBIE 
You mean like Europe? 
RAY 
NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!! 
Ray swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the driver's side. 
RAY 
That machine, it was already buried. 
Ray looks into the sky. What for is unknown. 
RAY 
Maybe it came down in the lightning storm. 
ROBBIE 
Wait a minute... you just said it was buried. 
RAY 
No, the machine I'm talking about was buried. But, what came down in the lighting storm, what operates it. That's the... that's the.... You know. The.... 
Robbie jumps back into the passenger's seat as Rachel scoots forward in the back seat. Robbie is looking toward the sky. 
RACHEL 
The what? 
ROBBIE 
Why aren't there any helicopters or airplanes? 
RAY 
Hey Rache. How you doing there girl? (to Robbie) How she doing? 
ROBBIE 
How you doing? 
RACHEL 
I'm fine. 
ROBBIE 
(to Ray) She's good. 
ROBBIE 
Wanna stay here? 
RACHEL 
Yeah. Good night, love you. 
ROBBIE 
Love you, Rache. 
Ray takes out his gun and puts it under a pillow of the sofa as he sits down. So Robbie and Rachel wont notice. 
INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Bushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought the stairs. 
A close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his breathing becomes more erratic. 
RACHEL 
Is the lighting back? 
RAY 
No, this is something else... 
Just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls. Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves everywhere. 
A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even louder. 
ROBBIE 
(screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND? 
RAY 
I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!!! 
RACHEL 
IS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!! 
The lighting grows more intense as does the sound. 
RAY 
WE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE, THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO?? 
Robbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows Rachel down the stairs who runs. Robbie goes back to get Ray. 
Ray realizes he has forgotten his gun. 
RAY 
WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! 
Ray and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through the windows. Flaming debris follows after. Ray gets the first door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages, after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of the furnace room. 
The door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark, you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around them. 
RACHEL 
Are we still alive? 
INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - FURNACE ROOM - DAWN 
Ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges it to be safe to go outside the furnace room. 
He walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top floor because the second floor was completely torn off. 
The camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the remains of different sections of an airplane. 
EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - YARD - DAWN 
Ray sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue cart through the aisle. 
RAY 
Down here! 
The man continues hauling the cart. 
RAY 
Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger? 
The cart comes flying down the fuselage doorway as the man creeps down the floor to the ground. 
MAX (NEWS CAMERA OPERATOR) 
Ray shakes his head no. 
REPORTER 
Oh, that's too bad, it would have been a really great story. 
She closes the door on him. 
Black blend to: 
INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAWN 
Ray is talking to Rachel... 
RAY 
Look at me. Look at me. 
Rachel and Ray are putting on their coats. 
RAY 
You keep your eyes only on me, you understand? 
Rachel has her big eyes on him as she nods yes. 
RAY 
Don't look down, don't look around me. I'm taking you to the car and you're gonna want to look around. But you are not going to, are you? 
She shakes her head and whispers "no". 
INT. (BUT DUE TO CRASH IT IS NOW EXT.) MARY ANN'S HOUSE - DEBRIS FIELD - DAWN 
Ray is carrying Rachel to the van. Robbie is walking along behind them looking at the devastation. 
RAY 
You're doing good. You're doing good. Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right to Boston, and we're gonna see your mom. 
RACHEL 
I'm not gonna look, dad. 
RAY 
That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay, listen, I want you to close your eyes. Got them closed? 
RACHEL 
Um-Huh. 
RAY 
There you go. Keep em' closed for me. 
Camera follows Robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment of the devastation. Ray starts the car and turns it around to pull out. 
RAY 
Robbie, get in. 
Robbie does not react at all. Ray becomes agitated. 
RAY 
ROBBIE!! GET IN!!! 
RACHEL 
Why are you yelling? 
Ray gives him a mean look as Robbie realizes that they must go. 
RAY 
(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get in! 
They pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey. 
EXT. VAN - DAY 
Ray is reading the map while Robbie looks out the window. They are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them. 
ROBBIE 
Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike? 
RAY 
Because I don't want everybody to see we've got a working car. (going over the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson until we find an open bridge or ferry, then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then take the back roads across Connecticut all the way to Boston. 
Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under the road. 
RAY 
Listen. Every time you don't listen to me, I'm telling your mother, okay? I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm making a list! 
Rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs her. 
RAY 
I told you to stay where I could see you! 
RACHEL 
I'm sorry! 
Ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van. 
Army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting.... 
ROBBIE 
STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!! 
Some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly. 
ROBBIE 
WAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! 
Robbie is getting soaked as the tank's tracks roll over the large puddles of water. Robbie is not giving up hope that one may let him on. 
ROBBIE 
WAIT!!! STOP!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! YOU HAVE ROOM!!! 
SOLDIER 
Watch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF RUN OVER!!! 
Ray sees Robbie trying to get on with them. He has had enough of Robbie and goes up to him to tell him.... 
RAY 
WHAT!?!?!  ROBBIE, YOU WANT TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION? 
Robbie, who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop. 
RAY 
THERE'S NOTHING LIVING IN THAT DIRECTION, ROBBIE!!! 
ROBBIE 
WHAT DO YOU CARE?!?!? YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT BEFORE!!! YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT!!! 
RAY 
OKAY, HARD ASS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU'RE IN CHARGE NOW, YOU TELL ME WHAT WE'RE DOING!! 
ROBBIE 
WE CATCH UP WITH THESE SOLDIERS, WE PICK UP WHOEVER ELSE ISN'T DEAD AND WE GET BACK AT THEM!!! WE GET BACK AT THEM!! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!!! 
RAY 
WELL, NOW LET'S TRY ONE THAT DOSEN'T INVOLVE YOUR TEN YEAR OLD SISTER JOINING THE ARMY! YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT??? 
Ray and Robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each other as the tanks continue rolling by. 
ROBBIE 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US THE TRUTH??? 
RAY 
YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT! 
ROBBIE 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY TO GO!! 
RAY 
YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT?!?!?! 
ROBBIE 
YOU WANNA COME OFF ALL WISE AND SHIT!! YOU ONLY CHOSE BOSTON BECAUSE YOU HOPE MOM IS THERE AND IF SHE'S THERE, YOU CAN DUMP US ON HER!!! YOU CAN DUMP US ON HER THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO CARE ABOUT YOURSELF!!! WITCH IS EXACTLY THE WAY YOU LIKE IT!!! 
Robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline keeps him fighting at Ray. They both can be seen with the air from their nostrils flaring like a bull. Rachel rushes in as an attempt to get Robbie to realize what he's doing. 
The three of them fasten their seatbelts. 
ROBBIE 
Be careful. 
People bang on the windows louder as they shout "give me a ride". 
RAY 
I'm sorry, I can't. Please get away from the car. 
A police man jumps on the hood and bangs on the window. 
RAY 
HEY!! 
POLICE MAN 3 
Stop the car!! 
RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER 
GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!! 
POLICE MAN 3 
You could carry 20 people in there! STOP THE CAR!!! 
Rachel is panicking and starts to do the "arms" process to stay calm. 
RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER 
GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!! 
Ray hit's the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side of the van. Ray speeds away now and gains some speed just as someone throws debris into the windshield which breaks it. Rachel screams in panic. 
RACHEL 
(screams) AHHHH!! 
RAY 
Oh hold on!! 
Robbie and Ray see a woman standing dead in their way holding a baby. They swerve to miss her. 
ROBBIE 
Look out! Look out! 
RAY 
(seeing a telephone pole) Oh, GOD! 
The van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches about 20 feet. The transformer on the top of the pole begins to arc and spark. The crowd is now rocking the van from side to side shouting at about a riot level. 
INT. VAN - DUSK 
RAY 
Are you okay? 
Rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted open by a crowd member. The driver and passenger side windows are then promptly busted. Robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass. A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the hole in the front windshield. He is so desperate to get in the van he rips his hands to shreds. A crowd member suggests to "push it". He does so and the glass falls through. 
The passenger side door is opened and Robbie is pulled out by the rioting crowd. 
ROBBIE 
(screams) AHHHHH!!!! RAY!!! 
RAY 
ROBBIE?!?! ROBBIE?!?!? 
Ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him out of the driver's side window. 
RAY 
NO, JUST WAIT!!! WAIT!! STOP!!! JUST STOP!!! 
RACHEL 
DADDY!!!! 
A man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and tries to grab Rachel. Ray pulls the man out and throws him back into the crowd. 
RAY 
Rachel!! (grabs guy) GET OUT OF THERE!!! 
RAY 
Please, all I want is my daughter. 
RIOT MAN 3 
(surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car. 
RAY 
I just want my daughter. Please just let me take my daughter, can I.... All I want is my daughter. 
RIOT MAN 3 
Yeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take her, yeah, yeah.... 
Ray grabs Rachel out of the car as the riot man gets in the driver's seat and closes the door. 
RAY 
Robbie!! 
Robbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street. The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van. 
INT. DINER - DUSK 
The three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound. He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They are all soaked from the rain. 
They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. The van drives away. 
Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has none. 
Walking Down the Street - Dusk 
They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their stories of assumption. One man says... "Europe's got it the worst...." while another man says "We've got it the worst......" while some people "don't give a shit who it is....." 
RACHEL 
Looks like the power's still on here. 
RAY 
Yeah, power's still on because nothing bad has come up from under the ground. 
A rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just like cars. They wait. 
A train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train, as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue walking. 
EXT. FERRY DOCK - DUSK 
Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank woman says over a megaphone... 
WOMAN 
Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative, thank you but we already have more blood than we can use. Again... (repeats message) 
Shots of the herded people boarding the ferry. 
Solders are heard and seen saying "this way" and "keep it moving folks". 
HARBOR MASTER 
Please move forward calmly, the boat can make more than one trip. Please move forward calmly, take your time, don't rush. (repeats) 
SHERYL 
Ray! RAY?!?! 
RAY 
Sheryl? 
SHERYL 
Yeah. 
Ray and Sheryl hug as they are re-united. 
SHERYL 
Oh, my gosh, are these your kids? 
RAY 
Yes, this is Rachel. 
SHERYL 
Hi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter, Nora. 
Ray, Sheryl, Nora, and Rachel exchange handshakes. 
RAY 
LISTEN TO ME! 
Rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over the hill. 
RAY 
DON'T DO THIS! I LOVE YOU! 
ROBBIE 
I NEED TO BE HERE! I NEED TO SEE THIS!! 
RAY 
I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BUT YOU DON'T!!! 
ROBBIE 
LET ME GO!!! 
RAY 
YOU DON'T!!! 
ROBBIE 
PLEASE LET ME GO!!! 
Rachel is approached by people. They think she's alone so they try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib). 
RAY 
I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!! YOU CAN HATE ME..... 
Robbie tries to fight to get up but Ray keeps him pinned to the ground. 
RAY 
... YOU CAN HATE ME. BUT I LOVE YOU!! 
ROBBIE 
LET ME GO PLEASE!!! 
RAY 
I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!!! 
ROBBIE 
DAD!! 
Ray sees the couple trying to get Rachel to go with them. For a second, Ray doesn't know what to do. 
RAY 
Just listen to me! 
ROBBIE 
I need to be here! I want to see this! 
RAY 
Wait, stay. Stay for Rachel. Stay for your sister. 
ROBBIE 
Please let me go! You need to let me go. 
Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple. Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders. 
Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill. Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple. 
RAY 
GET OFF!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! 
WOMAN 
We thought she was alone... we.... 
She doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls over the hill. 
RAY 
Robbie?!?! 
Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!! A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet. 
Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"? 
RAY 
(shakes his head in displeasure because he can't think of it) I don't remember that one. 
RACHEL 
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"? 
RAY 
I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one either. 
Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught. 
RAY 
(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby. So don't put me down. Because I've got the fastest set of wheels in the town. Something comes up to me that don't even try.... 
Rachel turns back over as Ray continues singing... 
RAY 
(continues singing) ... If I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly. She's my little deuce coupe. You don't know what I've got... just my little deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't know what I've got.... 
Rachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland taps two glasses together and says... 
HARLAND 
Peach schnapps. 
Ray gets up and begins walking towards him. 
HARLAND 
Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole case of this shit. 
Harland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down. 
RAY 
Thank you. 
Silence falls over for a period. 
HARLAND 
I'm sorry about your son. 
RAY 
We got separated... he's gonna meet us in umm... in Boston. 
Ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask... 
RAY 
Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did you loose anybody? 
HARLAND 
All of them. 
Another pause. 
HARLAND 
(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy. 
RAY 
(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier. 
They shake hands. 
HARLAND 
I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks. You're welcome to stay, both of yous. 
Ray gets up from the conversation. 
RAY 
I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep. 
HARLAND 
(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause) Those machines, those tripods they got... They buried them... right under our feet. Since before there were even people here. They've been planning this for a million years. We're beat to shit. 
Ray looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may hear what he may say next. 
HARLAND 
You miss your mommy? I had a little girl nearly your age. You know, if anything happens to your daddy, I'll take care of you. 
Ray is very angry that Harland is saying things like that to his daughter. 
RAY 
Rachel! 
Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay. 
RAY 
(distinctly angry, but not yelling) You don't have anything to say to her, do you understand? If you want to talk to somebody, or ask somebody a question, you ask me! 
HARLAND 
(also angry at Ray) What exactly is your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna do. How about you? You gonna sit here, wait for them to come get you? Is that your plan? 
Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing miscellaneous things. 
HARLAND 
Maybe you want to get caught. Couple of days hiding in a basement too much for you, I bet. You'll probably turn yourself right in! 
The robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops. 
RAY 
Listen. It stopped. 
HARLAND 
(paying no attention) Maybe you'll be okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll train you as their pet. You know, train you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks... 
RAY 
(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?! 
Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye opens and lights turn on for it. 
Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch. Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with her. 
The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince him not to. 
Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward the noise. They run to a different spot. 
Robot gets closer... 
Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and sees nothing. 
It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise. The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole. 
Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement. They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts of the basement. 
Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens but the gun is pulled back by Ray. 
RAY 
(dead silent) Give me that! 
Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around. 
Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. Still silently.  Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp. 
The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. 
Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens scurry out through the open hole. 
Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says.... 
HARLAND 
You and I... I don't  think we are on the same page. 
INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY 
The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the mist that is entering the window.  After a moment.... Ray retracts his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood. 
HARLAND 
RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! 
RAY 
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!! 
Harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of blood. 
They both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray has a horrified look on his face. 
Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared for what he has to do. 
Ray puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing go erratic. 
RACHEL 
What are you doing? 
RAY 
Whatever you hear... don't take this off. 
RACHEL 
Dad?? 
RAY 
Rach? 
RACHEL 
Dad? 
RAY 
What was that song... that lullaby I didn't know? 
RACHEL 
Hushabye Mountains 
RAY 
Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it. 
RACHEL 
(begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze.... 
RAY 
Don't stop. 
RACHEL 
... On Hushabye Mountain... 
RAY 
That's my girl. 
RACHEL 
... For far away my baby goes... 
Ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. Then walks back to Harland. He is still digging and chanting "not my blood" 
RACHEL 
... it fills the sails ... 
Harland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway. 
RACHEL 
... of boats that are waiting ... 
Ray closes the door behind him as he steps in. 
RACHEL 
... Waiting to sail your worries away 
Rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the door. 
RACHEL 
... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye Mountain ... 
Rachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter. 
RACHEL 
... Wave goodbye to the cares of the day and watch your boat, from Hushabye Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby Bay. 
All is silent for a while. Ray opens the door and walks out. Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is sitting on the stairs. 
Rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. They both sit there in silence. 
INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK 
She seems to be frozen. 
RAY 
Rachel. 
RACHEL 
Dad? 
Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all the people around and the door opens to take another person up. Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this and latches onto Ray's arm. 
SOLDIER 2 
Pull me! Pull me!!! 
People all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join. 
SOLDIER 2 
We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me! 
Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is seen by the soldier. 
SOLDIER 2 
EVERYBODY DOWN!!! 
Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb out. 
Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a way that meant how did you do that. 
Boston City Limits - Freeway - Day 
Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering them to "keep moving." The crows are now eating the red plant which appears to be dying rapidly.  Ray picks up a piece, of dead plant. 
RACHEL 
What happened to it? 
Ray crumples the plant in his hand. It turns to dust and blows away. 
RAY 
It's dying. 
Watching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half struck into a building. 
RAY 
What happened? 
SOLDIER 3 
I don't know, something's happening to them. Please keep moving. 
Ray goes up to another soldier for information. 
RAY 
Something's happening to them? 
SOLDIER 4 
Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir. 
Ray asks another soldier down the road for information. 
RAY 
Excuse me, excuse me, what happened here? You guys take it down? 
SOLDIER 5 
No sir, it was behaving erratically, walking in circles then it went down on it's own about an hour ago. (to people) Now let's keep moving, don't stop do not stop! Keep moving! 
Rachel and Ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other people. 
RACHEL 
How is it dead all by it's self? 
RAY 
Rachel, I'm not sure. 
Seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be heard telling everyone "calm down and get in the tunnel". 
Ray notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot. The robot's shields are down. As he goes to tell someone, the robot makes the viberating sound. 
RAY

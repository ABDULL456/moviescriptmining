W I L D  A T  H E A R T a love story 
written by David Lynch 
based on the book by Barry Gifford 
And now the story of Sailor and Lula..... 
1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to maximum R.P.M. up the street. 
CUT TO: 
2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE 
The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS. 
CUT TO: 
3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed bump. 
The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab. 
In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by. 
The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like the end of the world. 
The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of blood forms out his nose. 
The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing howl for one entire city block. 
CUT TO: 
4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY 
Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby. 
OLD WOMAN Oh my God! ... Why they doin that? 
OLD MAN Who the hell knows.  What you have in your mouth? 
The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand. 
OLD MAN Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth out ... doctor said.  What you tryin to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!! 
The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies. 
CUT TO: 
5. WASP NEST 
A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other. 
CUT TO: 
6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY 
The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across the livingroom and answers the phone. 
MARIETTA Hello...  Who is this?... 
CUT TO: 
7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY 
A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman - speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench. 
SAILOR (into phone) ...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk to Lula? 
CUT TO: 
6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY 
MARIETTA Theres no way in hell you can speak to her and... 
CUT TO: 
7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY 
SAILOR (feeling a smile coming on) What?... 
CUT TO: 
6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY 
MARIETTA ...Yes you heard me...  Dont ever call back here again. 
Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Mariettas twenty-year old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs. 
The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her 80 Black Camaro out and away.  The garage door closes automatically. 
CUT TO: 
15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY 
Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and disappears. 
CUT TO: 
16. INT. BEANY THORNS GARAGE - DAY 
Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beanys 67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Birds front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY 
Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out. 
CUT TO: 
18. INT. SOUTHERN TIME BAR - DAY 
Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER... 
MARIETTA Wheres Johnnie?  Hes not in his office. 
BARTENDER Havent seen im yet today, Marietta. 
MARIETTA (slightly hysterical) Well I gotta find him - right this minute! 
CUT TO: 
19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY 
Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing out a cloud of dust.  Theyre both smiling. 
LULA Hey baby... 
SAILOR Peanut... 
They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket. 
SAILOR Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks, baby...  Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom? 
LULA Bout fifty thousand times.  I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?...  I hear Powermads at The Hurricane. 
SAILOR (smiling) Stab it and steer. 
Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust. 
CUT TO: 
20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY 
Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the fan creak. 
LULA Did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in?...  Did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone? 
SAILOR I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The rest of you, too, of course.  But the way your head works is Gods own private mystery.  What was it you was thinkin? 
LULA Well, I was thinkin about smokin actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade.  When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now Ive just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer. 
SAILOR I guess I started smokin when I was about six...  My mama was already dead from lung cancer... 
LULA What brandd she smoke? 
SAILOR Camels, same as me...  Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness. 
LULA Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I never would have guessed it. 
SAILOR Its okay.  I hardly used to see them anyway.  I didnt have much parental guiding.  The public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin. He was a good ol boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time. 
LULA Id stand by you, Sailor ... through anything. 
SAILOR Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant ask for more than that. 
Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth. 
LULA You move me, Sailor, you really do. You mark me the deepest. 
Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts. 
SAILOR Youre perfect for me, too. 
LULA You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies.  He had a long nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever tell you how he died? 
SAILOR In a fire, as I recall. 
LULA Started he couldnt remember things? Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask...  But I dont know.  Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces. 
CUT TO: 
CUT TO: 
28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY 
Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway from where he lays on the bed. 
LULA Sailor, you are somethin else, honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon Id be startin to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it. 
SAILOR But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen. 
LULA Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt really an uncle.  He was a business partner of my daddys?  And my mama never knew nothin about me and him - thats for damn sure.  His real name was somethin kind of European, like Pucinski.  But everyone just called him Pooch.  He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised moren a little. 
SAILOR Howd it happen, peanut?  He just pull out the old toad and let it croak? 
Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while she teases her hair. 
LULA Youre terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know? 
SAILOR I cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth. 
Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of the sink. 
LULA I said you can be too crude sometimes? I dont think I care for it. 
SAILOR Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed. 
LULA Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin her hair dyed?  And I was alone in the house. 
CUT TO: 
29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
We see what she talks about. 
LULA (voice-over) Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know?  Where I was makin a jelly and banana sandwich?  I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter. 
CUT TO: 
30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY 
SAILOR Didnt he say somethin? 
Lula shakes her head.  She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and throws it into the toilet. 
ECU of cigarette in toilet. 
LULA Not really.  Least not so I recall now. 
Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls down the hole. 
ECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls. 
SAILOR So howd he finally nail you?  Right there in the kitchen? 
LULA No, he picked me up. 
CUT TO: 
31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAIDS ROOM - DAY 
We see what she talks about. 
LULA (voice-over) He was short but powerful.  With hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used.  We did it there on an old bed. 
CUT TO: 
32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY 
SAILOR We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt he force you? 
LULA Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle, you know?  I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess theres all different kinds of rapes.  I didnt exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didnt seem all that terrible.  It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there.  I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off.  Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich. 
SAILOR And you never told nobody about it? 
LULA Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after.  And he never did anything else to me.  I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry? (pause) 
CUT TO: 
33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY 
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a 54 Ford Pick-Up and a 64 Chevy Station Wagon.  No survivors.  Balls of flame and grinding metal. 
CUT TO: 
34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY 
LULA Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby...  That government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space... 
SAILOR Here she goes again... 
LULA Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin.  Seems to me the government could do somethin about it.  One of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray. 
Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette. 
SANTOS But where in the head?...  Not the chin, I hope. 
MARIETTA No...  In the brains...  What little Im sure he has. 
SANTOS You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun. 
MARIETTA Yes. 
SANTOS Through the forehead? 
MARIETTA Yes. 
SANTOS Wrong!  Its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head ... right toward the bridge of the nose ...  Lots and lots of irreparable damage. 
MARIETTA See!  I knew you had it all under control. 
SANTOS Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut? 
MARIETTA Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first... Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that town. 
SANTOS On one condition... 
He pauses and smiles strangely. 
SANTOS You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut. 
MARIETTA (whisper) Santos...  No...  Please, Santos... 
SANTOS Youre not tellin me that youre sweet on him? 
MARIETTA No...  But... 
SANTOS One day hes gonna find out what were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble. 
They stare at each other for a moment. 
SANTOS Im gonna take your silence as a yes... 
MARIETTA Santos...  I cant... 
SANTOS Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed. 
MARIETTA You fucker, dont you ever touch Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you. 
SANTOS (laughing) Put your shoulders back. 
MARIETTA What? 
SANTOS Put your shoulders back, I said. 
Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of her. 
SANTOS You got nice tits. 
MARIETTA Someones gonna see us. 
SANTOS (smiling as he starts to feel her breasts) Thats just another part of the price to pay. 
MARIETTA Santos...  You kill that Sailor, otherwise hes gonna turn my baby against me. 
Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up towards his. 
SANTOS Look at me...  Theres no turning back on this...  Im gonna kill Sailor... Thats for sure. 
CUT TO: 
36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT 
We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign. 
One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the bass drum. 
The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula. They thought theyd seen everything. 
CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the man a fully extended Reno point... 
SAILOR Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl?  Or are you gonna save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her? 
IDIOT PUNK Dont fuck with me, man.  You look like a clown in that stupid jacket. 
SAILOR This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom. 
IDIOT PUNK ...Asshole. 
SAILOR (as he moves toward the Idiot Punk) Come here. 
LULA Sailor, honey... 
The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back tears and holding his cheek. 
SAILOR (helping him up) Im sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl. 
IDIOT PUNK (to Lula) Im sorry. 
ECU of doctors nose and ears ... HAIR! 
LULA (voice-over) Afterwards...  Momma says... 
We see Marietta standing next to the doctor. 
LULA (voice-over) ...I hope you appreciate my spendin six hundred dollars, not countin what it cost us to get here and back...  This mans the best damn abortionist in the South. 
CUT TO: 
39. INT. CAPE FEAR MOTEL - NIGHT 
SAILOR You tell the boy who knocked you up? 
LULA It was my cousin, Dell, done it?  His folks used to visit with us summers. 
SAILOR What happened to him? 
LULA Oh, nothin.  I never let on to mama about Dell bein the one.  I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was?  I didnt tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didnt see the point. Somethin terrible happened to him, though.  Six months ago. 
SAILOR Whats that, peanut? 
LULA Dell disappeared.  Dell was learnin a hard lesson.  What I learned from observin Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. Hed startin behavin weird?  Like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin? 
CUT TO: 
40. EXT. CITY STREET - CHATTANOOGA - DAY 
DELL, wearing a soiled double-knit suit stops a LADY in the street, and smiling about the fact that earlier that morning hes placed a cockroach on his anus, he speaks to the woman. 
DELL Howre ya doin? 
CUT TO: 
41. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT 
LULA And just seemin real spacey and actin funny. 
SAILOR Actin funny how? 
LULA Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dells mama?  She found cockroaches in Dells underwear. 
CUT TO: 
42. INT. AUNT ROOTIES HOUSE 
CU of Aunt Rootie - unfolds a pair of dirty jockey shorts and several cockroaches fall out. 
CUT TO: 
43. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT 
LULA One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus? 
SAILOR Hell, peanut... 
LULA One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.?  She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin sandwiches in the kitchen. 
CUT TO: 
44. AUNT ROOTIES HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
In the dark kitchen, AUNT ROOTIE finds Dell making sandwiches - slicing them on the diagonal. 
AUNT ROOTIE Whatre ya doin? 
DELL Makin my lunch!!! 
LULA (voice-over) Dell told her he was makin his lunch and goin to work.  Hes a welder?  And she made him go back to bed. 
We see Aunt Rootie cross the kitchen - take the knife away from Dell and lead him out of the kitchen. 
CUT TO: 
45. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT 
LULA Then hed carry on about the weather? Talk about how rainfalls controlled by aliens livin on earth.  Also how men wearin black leather gloves... 
CUT TO: 
46. INT. AUNT ROOTIES HOUSE - DELLS ROOM - NIGHT 
Dell, crying uncontrollably, is in the center of the room squatting like an indian in his jockey shorts.  He has a long ruler stretched out in front of him which hes using to press down on the top of a lone black glove on the floor. 
LULA (voice-over) ...are followin him around. 
SAILOR Probly the rain boys from Outer Space. 
CUT TO: 
47. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT 
LULA It aint so funny now, though.  December before Christmas?  Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him.  He was missin for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit. 
INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT 
SAILOR Its a problm I dont thinks gonna go away too soon though...  Peanut, Im thinkin of breakin parole and takin you out to sunny California. 
LULA Sailor! 
SAILOR You up for that? 
LULA Id got to the far end of the world for you, baby...  You know I would. 
SAILOR Those toenails dry yet?  We got some dancin to do. 
We drift down Lulas long white legs to her blood red toenails. 
CUT TO: 
54. INT. THE HURRICANE BAR - NIGHT 
CU of Lulas dancing feet in black spiked-heel sandals exposing blurred blood red toenails.  Lula and Sailor are at it again - dancing as if plugged in to the main power plant. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
55. INT. BAR - BACK OF THE HURRICANE - NIGHT 
Drenched in sweat, Sailor and Lula sit at a corner table chug-a-lugging Rolling Rock during the bands break.  Lula notices a girl in the corner eye-balling Sailor.  She splits her attention between the girl and Sailor. 
LULA ...Thats an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy. 
SAILOR Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez.  At that age you still got a lot of energy. 
LULA You still got plenty energy for me, baby. 
Lula has had enough of the girl staring at Sailor. 
LULA Take a picture, bitch...  Itll last longer. 
GIRL Oh yeah? 
LULA Ill slap those eyes right outta your head. 
The girl gets up in a huff and leaves. 
LULA Sorry, baby...  Whens the first time you done it with a girl who wasnt hookin? 
SAILOR Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kids house whose parents were out of town.  A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me. CUT TO: 
56. INT. JUNIOR TRAINS FRIENDS HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAVANNAH 
We see what he talks about. 
SAILOR (voice-over) She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma. 
CUT TO: 
57. INT. BAR - BACK OF THE HURRICANE - NIGHT 
LULA Whatd you say to her? 
SAILOR Told her my name.  Then she said somethin like, Its so noisy down here.  Why dont we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves? She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day. 
CUT TO: 
58. INT. JUNIOR TRAINS FRIENDS HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
We see what he talks about. 
SAILOR (voice-over) When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind. 
CUT TO: 
59. INT. BAR - BACK OF THE HURRICANE - NIGHT 
LULA Oh, baby.  What a bad boy you are! 
SAILOR (laughing) Thats just what she said.  I had a boner with a capital O.  I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines.  She was a wild chick.  She was wearin bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides.  You know, them kind that doesnt go all the way down your leg? 
LULA You mean like pedal pushers? 
SAILOR I guess. 
CUT TO: 
60. INT. JUNIOR TRAINS FRIENDS HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT 
We see what he talks about. 
SAILOR (voice-over) She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air.  I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it. 
CUT TO: 
61. INT. BAR - BACK OF THE HURRICANE - NIGHT 
LULA Youre excitin me, honey.  Whatd she do? 
Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he looks the men over quickly. 
JOHNNIE (cautiously) Alright...  By all means.  Make yourselves at home. 
DROP SHADOW (as he sits down) Muchas gracias. 
REGGIE My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula. But please do call me Reggie.  This is my friend, who we call Drop Shadow.  He is always with me. 
Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes. 
JOHNNIE Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya. 
Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their meal before saying anything more. 
REGGIE You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut? 
JOHNNIE Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte, North Carolina.  Here on business. 
Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth. 
DROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras. 
REGGIE Do you know Honduras, Johnny? 
JOHNNIE Only that its supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year. 
REGGIE Yes, thats so.  But there is not much to destroy. 
DROP SHADOW No big buildings like in New Orleans. 
JOHNNIE Whattaya do there? 
REGGIE (laughs) Oh, many things... 
DROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance shop. 
REGGIE But I am also with the government. 
Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich. 
JOHNNIE In what capacity? 
REGGIE In many capacities. 
DROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the Secret Service. 
Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands a card to Johnnie. 
JOHNNIE (reading aloud) General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666. 
REGGIE He is my sponsor.  The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras. 
DROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his operatives. 
Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish. 
REGGIE That is my permiso. 
DROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill. 
REGGIE Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. (laughs) 
JOHNNIE Of course. 
Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie. 
DROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to carry a .45. 
REGGIE United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase. 
Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on the floor beneath his chair. 
JOHNNIE Why are you in New Orleans?  If you dont mind my askin. 
REGGIE Certainly not.  We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA. 
DROP SHADOW He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing. 
REGGIE We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen. 
Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave. 
JOHNNIE (extending his hand) Its been a real pleasure.  I wish you both buena suerte wherever you go. 
Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand. 
REGGIE The same to you.  If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us.  The Hondurans are great friends of the American people.  But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first? 
JOHNNIE I couldnt say, which one? 
Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line. 
DROP SHADOW (grinning) Who cares? 
BUCK Club Zanzibar. 
SAILOR You say its straight ahead a mile? 
BUCK About.  Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway.  State Road 86. 
SAILOR Thanks. 
Sailor and Lula drive off.  Buck and Billy go back inside the Red Devil station.  Guess who is over the corner cleaning nuts and bolts with a toothbrush and gasoline ... Its DELL! 
CUT TO: 
98. EXT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT 
The Club Zanzibar sits in the darkness on the left hand side of the road.  A string of multi-colored lights is hung over the front.  Sailor parks the Thunderbird across from the club and cuts the engine. 
SAILOR You ready for this? 
LULA Well find out in a hurry. 
CUT TO: 
99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT 
When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif. Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar. Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by the arm. 
LULA Come on. 
They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his hand that way while he speaks... 
BARTENDER ZANZIBAR This is a friendly place, son.  You folks just relax and have a nice time. 
LULA (bound and determined not to be intimidated) You got yourself a deal. 
BARTENDER (to Sailor) Thats a real jacket...  By that, I mean a real stupid jacket. 
SAILOR This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom. 
BARTENDER Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo. 
The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table near the door. 
LULA Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That band is too good? 
SAILOR Uh huh. 
LULA You notice that woman when we come in?  The white woman sittin by herself? 
SAILOR Yeah. 
LULA Well, she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that I could tell.  What you make of that? 
SAILOR Honey, we bein strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we dont want to make nothin of nothin. 
LULA You think shes pretty? 
Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more. Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender. 
SAILOR I tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones.  Face aint bad, though. 
Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle. 
SAILOR Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin botherin you? 
LULA Mama.  I been thinkin about her. Shes probly worried to death by now. 
SAILOR Moren likely. 
LULA I want to call her and tell her Im okay.  That were okay. 
SAILOR I aint so sure its a great idea, but thats up to you.  Just dont tell her where we are. 
LULA (to Bartender) Pardon me?  Yall got a phone here I can use? 
BARTENDER ZANZIBAR Cant you read?

Sailor and Lula are in a Shell station just outside of Houston.  Sailor is filling the Thunderbird with regular.  An OLD MAN sits near the pumps listening to the radio playing a sad big band tune.  Lula starts to slowly snap her fingers to the beat and the old man gives her a beautiful smile. 
LULA (smiling and snapping her fingers) How much we got left, honey? 
SAILOR Under a hundred. 
LULA You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work? 
SAILOR Not in Houston.  Wed be better off in some place more out of the way. 
LULA You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.

146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY 
The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock. 
SAILOR BOBBY!!!!  STOP IT, MAN!!!

147. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY 
Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels out, knocking the deputy down.

148. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY 
Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around and points it at Sailor. 
BOBBY Youre next, fucker. 
The second old man is reaching under the counter. 
Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol. It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door. 
148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY 
The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store. 
Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy orders him to stand up.

149. INT. IGUANA COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY 
Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County Courthouse Building when Marietta and Santos walk in.  As soon as she sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses her. 
MARIETTA Oh baby, I was beginnin to think I was never gonna see you again. 
Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos. 
MARIETTA Youre comin home, precious.  Santos gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport. 
LULA Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here. I just cant leave him. 
Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are pale. 
MARIETTA Oh, yes, you can. 
Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble. 
SANTOS Your mamas been real worried bout you, honey.  Me too...  Can you give your old friend Santos a hug, too? 
Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, orange, and silver.

150. INT. WALLS UNIT - DAY 
Sailor lays on his jail bed reading a letter from Lula. 
LULA (voice-over) 
Dearest Sailor Darling, 
The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby. Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old when you get out. 
I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to show for it.  Our child!! 
I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that. 
Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as soon as I can. 
Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin at the two of us in a different light - whatever that means. 
Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you. 
Time dont really fly honey does it? 
Love, your Lula 
P.S. I miss dancing...

151. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY 
Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor. 
SAILOR (voice-over) 
Dear Lula, 
It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. And Pace being your family name and all is just right. What about a middle name if it is a boy after my granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound so bad do you think? 
LULA Like you, sweetheart.  You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose.  Only difference is your color hair is like mine. 
PACE My daddy aint never killed nobody, has he, mama? 
LULA Course he aint never killed nobody. Whyd you say that, Pace? 
PACE Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin. 
LULA And? 
PACE Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man. 
LULA Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never committed no murder.  Musta been you didnt hear grandmama proper.  He made some mistakes, is all.  Your daddy aint always been so lucky...  Were almost at the depot, honey.  Sit back a minute. 
CUT TO: 
157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING 
Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the engine. 
PACE Why we sittin here, mama? 
LULA Thinkin a second, baby. 
Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten minutes past six. 
PACE Im scared, mama. 
LULA Why, honey? 
PACE Case daddy dont like me.  What if he dont like that I dont got his color hair. 
LULA Pace, your daddyd love you even if you didnt have no hair at all. 
CUT TO: 
158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING 
Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette. 
LULA Still partial to Camels, huh? 
Sailor smiles. 
SAILOR First pack of tailor-mades I had in a while. 
He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand. 
SAILOR You must be my son. 
LULA Shake hands with your daddy. 
Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go. 
SAILOR Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read a lot about you. 
Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them loose.  Sailor tries to smile. 
LULA You hungry?  Pace and I aint had dinner yet. 
SAILOR Lead the way. 
Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car. 
CUT TO: 
159. INT. LULAS CAR - NIGHT 
Lula drives. 
SAILOR No rag top, huh? 
Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns off the engine and gets out of the car. 
PACE Whats wrong, mama? 
SAILOR (turning to Pace and patting his head) Dont worry, son.  Just stay here. 
Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the hood. 
LULA Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant help it.  Give me a minute and Ill quit. 
SAILOR Boys frightened, Lula.  This aint no good. 
LULA Really, Sail, Ill be okay. 
SAILOR Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on. Ill walk back to the depot. 
LULA Whatre you talkin about?  Thats your son in there. 
SAILOR He aint never known me, Lula, so there aint much for him to forget. Not seein each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too. 
LULA How can you say that, Sailor?

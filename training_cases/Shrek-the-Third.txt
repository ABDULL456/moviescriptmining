Final Screening Script 
INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT 
A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open plains. The wind blows back his golden mane. 
PRINCE CHARMING Onward Chauncey, to the highest room of the tallest tower! Where my princess awaits rescue from her handsome Prince Charming. 
Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background. In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front of a cheaply painted backdrop. 
The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the audience. 
GINGERBREAD MAN This is worse than Love Letters! I hate dinner theatre. 
PINOCCHIO Me too. 
Pinocchio's nose grows as he is caught in the lie. 
Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower. 
PRINCE CHARMING Whoa there, Chauncey! 
He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He strikes a dramatic pose. 
A Princess leans from a tower window. 
ACTRESS Hark! The brave Prince Charming approach-ith. 
Prince Charming puffs his chest out. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 2. 
PRINCE CHARMING Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay the monster that guards you and take my place as rightful King. 
An old couple at a table look confused. 
OLD LADY (to old man) What did she say? 
Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores him. 
A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage. 
OGRE Grrrrrrr! 
The crowd erupts into applause. The Fairytale Creatures cheer. 
FAIRYTALE CREATURES (CHEERING) Woooo hoooo!!! 
GINGERBREAD MAN Yea! Shrek! 
At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the monster. 
PRINCE CHARMING Prepare foul beast to enter into a world of pain with which you are not familiar! 
He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake. 
WAITER (SINGING) Happy Birthday to thee. 
PRINCE CHARMING Do you mind? 
Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on stage. It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade. 
GINGERBREAD MAN Do you mind? Bo-ring! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 3. 
The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again. The tower facade starts to topple. 
PRINCE CHARMING (CLEARS THROAT) Prepare foul beast- 
Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade falling. He cringes. 
The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes his mangled sword at the audience. 
PRINCE CHARMING (shaking his sword again) Someday you'll be sorry. 
HECKLER (O.S.) We already are! 
They laugh again. Prince Charming throws down his sword, picks up his hobby horse and exits. 
OGRE Grrrrrrr! 
The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage. 
INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it. He opens it.

The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked. 
CUT TO: Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 7. 
EXT. BOAT DOCKS - DAY 
Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal Navy. 
Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks. 
Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their heads as they leave. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of them. 
DONKEY Well, since you're filling in for one, you might as well look like a real King. Can somebody come in here and work on Shrek please? 
Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow. 
RAUL (AHEM) I will see what I can do. 
He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools. 
Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair. 
A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes. 
We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash. 
Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked. 
FIONA Ow! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8. 
Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to reveal that the lips are Shrek's. 
A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and tighten up the zipper all the way. 
A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn, Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP! 
A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is tightened. 
A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's belt. A mole is placed on his cheek. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER 
REVEAL: Shrek and Fiona standing awkwardly in outrageous Renaissance outfits. 
Donkey gasps. 
DONKEY Oh! 
Puss rolls his eyes. 
PUSS Yeah, wow. 
Fiona is uncomfortable. 
FIONA Uh, is this really necessary? 
RAUL (TO SHREK) Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona. 
SHREK I'm Shrek, you twit. 
RAUL Whatever. 
PUSS Okay peoples! This isn't a rehearsal. Let's see some hustle. 
DONKEY Smiles everyone, smiles! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 9. 
Off-screen, the Master of Ceremonies announces the couples arriving at the party. 
Fiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood. 
SHREK I don't know how much longer I can keep this up Fiona. 
FIONA I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better. 
Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh. 
FIONA Shrek? 
SHREK Yeah. 
FIONA You look handsome. 
SHREK Ah. Come here, you. 
She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles back. 
FIONA Honey, please calm down... 
Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside. 
SHREK Calm down? Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut out for this, Fiona and I never will be. 
Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to Donkey. 
DONKEY I think that went pretty well. 
Shrek startles. 
SHREK Donkey! 
Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door. 
DONKEY Aww, come on now Shrek! 
Shrek slams the door shut. 
Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on his pillow. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 13. 
PUSS Some people just don't understand boundaries. 
Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the blinds. 
Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries to calm him down. 
FIONA Just think... a couple more days, and we'll be back home in our vermin-filled shack, strewn with fungus, filled with the rotting stench of mud and neglect. 
This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath and exhales. He smiles. 
SHREK Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled." 
FIONA And, uh... maybe even the pitter- patter of little feet on the floor...? 
SHREK (LAUGHS) That's right. The swamp rats will be spawning. 
FIONA Uh, no... you know, what I was thinking of is a little bit bigger than a swamp rat. 
SHREK Donkey? 
FIONA No, Shrek. Um... what if - THEORETICALLY - 
SHREK Yeah? 
FIONA They were little ogre feet? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 14. 
SHREK Oh. (NERVOUS LAUGH) 
Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed. 
He slowly emerges from behind the bed. 
SHREK Honey? Let's try and be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop and they cry and then they cry when they poop and they poop when they cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra cry and they extra poop. 
FIONA Shrek. 
She grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes. 
FIONA Don't you ever think about having a family? 
Shrek takes her hand. 
SHREK Right now, you're my family. 
There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open, revealing a Royal Page. 
Shrek springs up. 
SHREK Well, somebody better be dying. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KING'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing. 
KING HAROLD I'm dying. 
The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit. Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen comes to the King's aid and he settles down. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 15. 
QUEEN Harold. 
KING HAROLD Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian. 
The Queen is used to these kind of non-sequiturs. 
QUEEN Of course darling. 
The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter. 
EXT. CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 
The knights of Far Far Away march toward the castle as the flag is lowered to half-masked. 
EXT. POND - LATER 
Close on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen, and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box ("Ye Olde Footlocker") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out into the water. 
An overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily pads. The camera tilts up to reveal a frog choir, singing "Live and Let Die." The Princesses, Donkey, Puss and the Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly. 
Shrek puts his arm around Fiona. 
The funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse. Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen sadly gazes at the pond. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

CUT TO: 
EXT. POISONED APPLE BAR - NIGHT 
Prince Charming rides up to the Poison Apple Bar. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 19. 
INT. POISONED APPLE BAR - CONTINUOUS 
Smoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing "I've Never Been To Me" by Nancy Wilson. 
The bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch of empty beer mugs. 
Prince Charming enters the bar. 
A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming. 
Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White) playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck. Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool, and sits. 
Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He clears his throat. 
PRINCE CHARMING What does a Prince have to do to get a drink around here? 
Mabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster with a smiling beer wench. 
PRINCE CHARMING Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly stepsister I'll never know. 
He winks at her. She glares at him. 
PRINCE CHARMING Where's Doris, taking the night off? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 20. 
MABEL She's not welcome here and neither are you. 
She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel. 
MABEL (CONT'D) What do you want, Charming? 
PRINCE CHARMING Oh not much, just a chance at redemption... (LAUGHS) And a Fuzzy Navel. 
Prince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons. 
PRINCE CHARMING And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends! 
Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug. 
CAPTAIN HOOK We're not your friends. 
Prince Charming grows nervous. 
The Villains all approach Prince Charming. 
From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his shoulders and pins him on top of the bar. 
PRINCE CHARMING Ahh! 
Captain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming's neck. 
CAPTAIN HOOK You don't belong here. 
PRINCE CHARMING You're right; oh, I mean you're absolutely right, but I mean, do any of us? 
CYCLOPS Do a number on his face! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 21. 
PRINCE CHARMING No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are more alike than you think. 
Prince Charming turns to the Evil Queen. 
PRINCE CHARMING Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves saved Snow White and then what happened? 
EVIL QUEEN Oh, what's it to you? 
PRINCE CHARMING They left you the un-fairest of them all. And now here you are, hustling pool to get your next meal. How does that feel? 
He breaths heavily, trying to compose himself. 
DONKEY Shrek. Shrek, are you okay? 
SHREK Oh... I can't believe I'm going to be a father. 
Donkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to the ship's railing. 
SHREK How did this happen? 
PUSS Allow me to explain. You see, when a man has certain feelings for a woman, a powerful urge sweeps over him... 
SHREK I know how it happened. I just can't believe it. 
Shrek walks away. 
Donkey leans over to Puss. 
DONKEY How does it happen? 
Puss rolls his eyes at Donkey. 
CUT TO: 
Donkey sees Shrek at the back of the boat staring out at the distant horizon. He walks up next to his friend. 
DONKEY (SINGING) And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, (MORE) Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 31. DONKEY (CONT'D) Little boy blue and the man in the moon. 
Shrek rolls his eyes. 
DONKEY (CONT'D) "When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then, Dad-" 
Shrek cuts Donkey off. 
SHREK Donkey, can you just cut to the part where you're supposed to make me feel better? 
Shrek slumps against the rail. Puss hops up on the railing and whispers into Shrek's other ear. 
PUSS You know I love Fiona, Boss. Right? (CONFIDENTIALLY) But what I'm talking about here is you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice- cold pitcher of mojitos, and two weeks of nothing but fishing. 
Puss makes a "let's go fishing" gesture by casting an imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to whisper in Shrek's other ear. 
DONKEY Man, don't you listen to him. Having a baby is not going to ruin your life. 
SHREK It's not my life I'm worried about ruining. It's the kid's. 
Donkey and Puss pause as Shrek rants. 
SHREK I mean...when have you ever heard the phrase "as sweet as an...ogre" or "as nurturing as...an ogre" Or how `bout..."you're gonna' love my dad...he's a real ogre." Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 32. 
DONKEY Okay, okay I get it! Nobody said it was going to be easy. But at least you got us to help you out. 
SHREK That's true. 
He thinks for a moment. 
SHREK I'm doomed. 
DONKEY You'll be fine. 
SHIP CAPTAIN You're finished. 
Everyone turns to look at the Captain who clears his throat. 
SHIP CAPTAIN Uh, with your journey. 
He points to shore. A majestic castle stands proudly on a nearby bluff.

EXT. WORCESTERSHIRE ACADEMY - DAY 
Shrek, Puss and Donkey stand at the entrance to the castle.

DONKEY Wor-ces-ter-shireee. Now that sounds fancy. 
SHREK It's Worcestershire. 
DONKEY Like the sauce!? Mmmm... It's spicy! 
The drawbridge to the castle lowers. 
DONKEY Oohh! They must be expecting us. 
They start over the drawbridge. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 33. 
A horse whinnies behind them. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss jump out of the way as a medieval school bus storms by. The kids on the back of the bus scream when they see Shrek. 
DONKEY What in the shista-shire kind of place is this? 
SHREK Strong, handsome, face of a leader. Does Arthur look like a King or what? 
Shrek steps forward. 
TEENAGER (ARTIE) Ow. 
Shrek looks down, his foot planted square in the chest of LANCELOT's opponent. Shrek steps back. 
SHREK Oh. Sorry. 
The kid doesn't budge, his arms and legs still sprawled out where he hit the ground. 
TEENAGER (ARTIE) Did you just say you were looking for Arthur? 
Shrek, Puss and Donkey turn back around. 
PUSS That information is on a need to know basis. 
DONKEY It's top secret, hushity hush. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JOUSTING RANGE - KNIGHTS AREA 
The Knight commands his troops. 
KNIGHT (LANCELOT) Now gentlemen let's away... to the showers! 
JOCKS Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo! 
Shrek approaches the Knight. 
The Knight's horse rears up and he falls off. The horse gallops off. The Knight looks up at Shrek in fear. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 37. 
SHREK (CONT'D) Greetings your majesty. This is your lucky day. 
KNIGHT (LANCELOT) So what for like are you supposed to be? Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun or something? 
SHREK Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant leprechaun... You made a funny. 
Shrek scoops up the Knight, tosses him over his shoulder, ogre-style. 
KNIGHT (LANCELOT) Unhand me, monster! 
SHREK Stop squirming, Arthur. 
KNIGHT (LANCELOT) I'm not Arthur! 
Shrek stops and holds Lancelot above his head. Lancelot tries to regain his dignity. 
LANCELOT I am Lancelot. 
Lancelot points across the school yard. 
LANCELOT That dork over there is Arthur! 
He points to the TEENAGE ARTHUR, skulking away across the school yard. 
SHREK Hey! 
Artie turns his head briefly, but keeps on walking. 
Shrek sighs and dumps Lancelot to the ground. 
LANCELOT Aaah. 
Shrek storms off towards the school. Puss and Donkey catch up. One of the female students steps in front of Shrek. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 38. 
GUINEVERRE Ahem! This is like totally embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly... 
The other girls giggle. 
GUINEVERRE And she thought perchance thou would wanna ask her to the Homecoming Dance or something... 
SHREK Uh, excuse me? 
GUINEVERRE It's like whatever. She's just totally into college guys and mythical creatures and stuff. 
She pops her gum. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - LATER 
Shrek and Puss search the hallways, looking for Artie. 
SHREK Oh Arthur! Come out, come out wherever you are... 
Off-screen we hear mumbling from inside a locker. Shrek and Puss look as Donkey pushes the locker door open. He has been stuffed inside. Off-screen we hear some students laughing. 
DONKEY Yeah, you better run, you little punk no good-niks, `cause the days of "Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers" are over! 
SHREK I'm not here to eat him. 
STUDENTS AWWW. 
SHREK It's time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies. You're the new King of Far Far Away. 
ARTIE What? 
The students react with surprise and disbelief. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 42. 
LANCELOT Artie a King? More like the Mayor of Loserville. 
BOHORT Nice one Lance! 
They high five. The tuba player plays a Wha-wha-wha. 
LANCELOT Burn. 
Everyone laughs. 
ARTIE Is this for real? 
SHREK Absolutely. Now clean out your locker, kid. You've got a kingdom to run. 
ARTIE So wait, I'm really the only heir? 
Shrek pauses for just a moment, then... 
SHREK The one and only. 
ARTIE Give me just a second. 
Artie turns back to the crowd and delivers a heartfelt speech. 
ARTIE My good people, I think there's a lesson here for all of us. Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, hey, maybe this guy has feelings. Maybe I should cut him some slack. Because maybe, just maybe... this guy's gonna turn out to be, uh...I dunno...a King! And maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him -- that's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team. 
Artie points and Lancelot and his buddies look horrified. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 43. 
ARTIE And Gwen... oh Gwen. I've always loved you. 
GUINEVERRE Ew. 
ARTIE Well good friends, it breaks my heart, but, enjoy your stay here in prison while I rule the free world baby! 
SHREK Alright, let's not overdo it. 
ARTIE I'm building my city people! On Rock and Roll!

Prince Charming gets in Pinocchio's face. 
PRINCE CHARMING You're telling me you don't know where Shrek is? 
Pinocchio is still a little nervous. 
PINOCCHIO It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume that I couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect. 
Pinocchio thinks he has the upper hand. 
PRINCE CHARMING So you do know where he is! 
PINOCCHIO On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less, not definitely rejecting the idea, that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty that...

He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e. Rorschach inkblots). 
Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire. 
DONKEY Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls. 
MERLIN Okay. Monster, go for it. 
Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare begins to take shape in the smoke. He blows the image away. He covers his fear and changes the subject. 
SHREK I see a rainbow pony. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 66. 
MERLIN Excellent work! (THEN) Now! The boy! 
ARTIE This is lame. 
Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head. 
ARTIE Ow! 
MERLIN You're lame! Now just go for it. 
He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it. 
ARTIE Okay. There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest. 
Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to change as he stays focused. 
MERLIN Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it! 
ARTIE Wait, the dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone? 
Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more worked up. 
ARTIE It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. It.. it's gonna fall! 
Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him, stunned. 
MERLIN Whew, proper head case you are, aren't you? Really messed up. Whoa. 
Merlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 67. 
ARTIE Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what? 
Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie. Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists. 
SHREK (CLEARS THROAT) Look Artie...um- 
Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the shack where Merlin peeks out. 
MERLIN (loud, over the music) Just thought I might help set the mood! Y'know for your big heart to heart chat! 
Everyone stares at him. 
He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's quiet again. 
SHREK I know what it's like to not feel ready for something. 
Artie looks at him. 
SHREK Even ogres get scared...you know, once in a while. 
ARTIE I know you want me to be king, but I can't. I'm not cut out for it and I never will be, alright? 
Shrek takes this in. 
ARTIE (CONT'D) Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble. He dumped me at that school the first chance he got and I never heard from him again. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68. 
SHREK My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either. 
ARTIE Well, I doubt he was worse than mine. 
SHREK Oh yeah? My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me. 
Artie looks at Shrek. 
A large group of armed Far Far Away Guards surround them. 
Prince Charming smiles at Fiona. 
PRINCE CHARMING But why would I want to do that? 
RAPUNZEL Grrrr! 
PRINCE CHARMING Woof! 
He looks back at Rapunzel lovingly, and the two share a long kiss. Fiona and the other Princesses are shocked. 
FIONA What? 
PRINCE CHARMING Say hello ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away. 
Cinderella claps excitedly. 
CINDERELLA Yaaaaaaaaay! 
The Princesses stare her down. 
FIONA Rapunzel, how could you? 
RAPUNZEL Jealous much? 
Prince Charming eyes up the Princesses. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 72. 
PRINCE CHARMING Soon you'll be back where you started... scrubbing floors or locked away in towers; that is, if I let you last the week. 
RAPUNZEL But Pooky, you promised you wouldn't hurt them! 
PRINCE CHARMING Not here, "kitten whiskers." Daddy will discuss it later. Now forgive us, we have a show to put on. 
FIONA Shrek will be back soon Charming, and you'll be sorry. 
He stops and flashes a sadistic smile. 
PRINCE CHARMING Sorry? Don't you realize --once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away he's doomed? 
Prince Charming leads Rapunzel out. She looks back at them apologetically. Everyone wears a look of defeat. 
The guards march them off. 
Fiona and the princesses are locked away in a prison cell. Fiona looks through the bars of the cell, feeling helpless. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE OF FAR FAR AWAY - DAY 
Shrek startles awake. He sits up and scratches his head, looking around. He realizes it's morning. 
Behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch. Suddenly, the tree branch that was holding the bird flicks it off. 
Shrek senses the movement behind him and turns around to find everything is normal. He turns back around to wake up everyone. 
The trees start to advance toward Shrek. 
The log Artie is sleeping on suddenly sits up, knocking Artie, who is still asleep, to the ground. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 73. 
ARTIE Ow! 
The tree turns around to reveal an Evil Tree. Donkey finally wakes up. 
DONKEY Ahhh! 
The Evil Trees continue to advance. A piano is heard. The trees part and Hook is revealed to be playing the piano. 
The music builds to a dramatic finale. Captain Hook turns away from his keys and faces them. 
DONKEY Look out! They've got a piano! 
CAPTAIN HOOK Kill `em all. Except the fat one. 
He stares hard at Shrek and aims his hooked prosthetic. 
CAPTAIN HOOK King Charming has something special in mind for you, ogre. 
Shrek is perplexed. 
SHREK "King Charming?" 
CAPTAIN HOOK Attack! 
Pirates charge forward, swinging in from the tree branches. 
PIRATES AAAARGH! 
One lands and gets his peg-leg stuck in the ground. 
The pirates close in. Shrek grabs one and throws him to the side. 
MERLIN (CONT'D) Mumble, grumble, interrupt my healing. Mumble, mumble. 
Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts to sob. Merlin stops and turns around. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 77. 
MERLIN Oh. What, what's with you? 
Artie continues to cry. 
ARTIE It's just so hard. You know? They really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard... 
Merlin is visibly uncomfortable. 
MERLIN C'mon, take it easy. 
Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable. 
ARTIE No! I don't think you understand! There's a mean person doing mean things to good people- 
SHREK Oh, have a heart old man! 
Artie grabs him, now desperate. 
ARTIE And they really need your help to get them back! So why won't you help them? 
MERLIN Oh. 
Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line. 
Merlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do. 
MERLIN Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my things. 
Merlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers. Shrek is impressed. 
ARTIE Piece of cake. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78. 
SHREK Well, well, well. You want some eggs with that ham? 
Shrek smiles. 
Merlin returns holding a spell book. 
MERLIN Now, I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects. 
DONKEY Side effects!? 
MERLIN Don't worry, whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be, it'll wear off eventually... I think. 
Merlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey. 
DONKEY Ah! 
MERLIN Oops. 
Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look. 
DONKEY Are you sure this is a good idea? 
SHREK Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his- 
MERLIN Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy zoom zoom. Let's help our friends get back, um... soon! 
Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers. Shrek, Puss, Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke. 
MERLIN Woah! It worked!

Donkey adjusts himself, feeling hung over. 
DONKEY (CONT'D) (in Puss' body) Oh man, I haven't been on a trip like that since college. 
SHREK Donkey? 
DONKEY (in Puss' body) What? Is there something in my teeth?

SHREK You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay? I was. 
ARTIE But you said the King asked for me personally. 
SHREK Not exactly. 
ARTIE What's that supposed to mean? 
Shrek becomes defensive. 
SHREK Look, I said whatever I had to say, alright! I wasn't right for the job, I just needed some fool to replace me, and you fit the bill. So just go! 
Artie is stunned. 
ARTIE You were playing me the whole time. 
Shrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more. 
SHREK You catch on real fast kid... Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought. 
Puss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in Puss' body) covers his mouth and signals him to stay quiet. 
ARTIE You know, for a minute there, I actually thought you - 
PRINCE CHARMING What? That he cared about you? He's an ogre. What did you expect? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 90.

CINDERELLA Just stay out of this! 
SNOW WHITE Who cares who's running the kingdom anyway? 
FIONA I care. 
Fiona steps forward and challenges them. 
QUEEN And you should all care too. 
Suddenly, the cell door flies open. Donkey and Puss (in each other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind them.

Charming is stunned. 
PRINCE CHARMING This was supposed to be my happily ever after.

Shrek looks at Fiona and at his friends and smiles. 
SHREK ...cause I'm not giving up mine.

ALL Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 114. 
Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and Puss, still in each other's bodies, watch as Artie gets carried away. 
In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around confused, clutching his show ticket. 
MERLIN Uh, excuse me, that's my seat. 
Suddenly he is thrown back against the front of the stage as Donkey and Puss confront him. 
PUSS (in Donkey's body) Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The time has come to rectify some wrongs! 
DONKEY (in Puss' body) Although I have been enjoying these "cat baths." 
PUSS (in Donkey's body) Please say you didn't. 
MERLIN Uh... alright, alright...look.. 
Merlin rubs his hands together. 
MERLIN You're gonna feel a little pinch, and possibly some lower intestinal discomfort, but this should do the trick. 
Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the magic. He lets loose with a bright burst of magic. It takes a moment for Donkey and Puss to recover. They eye each other cautiously. 
PUSS Are you..? 
Donkey lifts his hoof and inspects it carefully. 
DONKEY I'm me again! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 115. 
Puss checks out his own paws. 
PUSS And I am not you! 
Donkey and Puss give each other a big hug. 
DONKEY Alright! 
The two of them turn and walk away together. 
Merlin is behind them, smoking fingers and all. Suddenly his eyes grow wide. 
MERLIN Oops. Ah, never mind. 
We see that Donkey still has Puss' tail and Puss had Donkey's. Merlin slips away. 
Shrek and Fiona watch Artie in the distance. 
SHREK What'd I tell ya? I think the kid's going to be a great King.

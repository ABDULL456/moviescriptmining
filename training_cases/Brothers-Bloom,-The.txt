1   EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE                                      1 
Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country road. A car chugs over the horizon. 
NARRATOR As far as con man stories go, I think I've heard them all. Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers, tales drawn long and tall. But if one bears a bookmark in the confidence man's tome, twould be that of Penelope, and of the brothers Bloom. 
2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2 
The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a country house. 
Both in black.   Each with a suitcase. 
NARRATOR At ten and thirteen Bloom and Stephen (the younger and the old) 
3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3 
The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating breakfast. 
NARRATOR had been through several foster families. 
The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the crap out of him. 
NARRATOR (cont'd) Thirty eight, all told. 
4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4 
CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER 
"Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE", "MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING". 
4   CONTINUED:                                                  4 
NARRATOR Mischief moved them on in life, and moving kept them close. 
5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5 
The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand. 
NARRATOR For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen Bloom, and both had more than most. 
The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the brothers suspiciously. 
6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6 
A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey. 
NARRATOR Another home, another main street. Stephen looked around, then summed the burgh up thusly: 
STEPHEN Bloom, we've hit a one hat town. 
NARRATOR One theater. One car wash. One cafe. One park. One cat. Which, through some mishap, had one leg. 
The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street with its one leg. 
STEPHEN Sweet Jesus. Look at that. 
7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7 
A group of children flee the school joyfully. 
NARRATOR One school, which meant one tight- knit group of local well-off kids. 
8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8 
The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket Pops. 
NARRATOR Their pocket-change bought rocket pops, 
9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9 
The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go, while Stephen counts out pennies. 
NARRATOR The brothers, 
Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a scowl. 
STEPHEN Pixie Stix. 
10   EXT. PARK                                                   10 
The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops. 
NARRATOR They were the `they'. All well loved, rooted, happy as you please. 
Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too happy nursing their Pixie Stix. 
NARRATOR (cont'd) Always there. In every town. 
Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette. 
STEPHEN The playground bourgeoisies. 
20   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              20 
Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks homeward in the warm twilight. 
21   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                            21 
BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE. 
22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22 
Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to: 
Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the coolers" 
Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler. 
STEPHEN Oh - kay. How's it going on the playground front? 
BLOOM It's great. 
STEPHEN So, on to step eleven, then.   The Tale. You tell them - 
BLOOM Wait... 
Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted. 
NARRATOR Must the numbers rattle on?    Must the fiction end? 
BLOOM I think I need more time to win their- 
STEPHEN Bloom. They're not your friends. They're part of this, and this aint real. Remember, it's a con. And when it's done, we've just got us. And we'll be moving on. (beat) So, the tale. You tell them there's a 
23   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           23 
Bloom holds court with the kids. 
BLOOM hermit in the woods. A one eyed, steel toothed vagabond... 
24   INT. ATTIC                                                24 
Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic 
BLOOM ...with blood red eyes? 
STEPHEN (nods) That's good. He stopped you coming home from school... 
25   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           25 
BLOOM ...and told me of a cave. 
GIRL What kind of cave? 
BLOOM A cave of wonders. 
BOY Pffft ha. 
GIRL Shut up, Dave. 
BLOOM At noon on every Sunday, there appears a ball of light, which flutters like a butterfly... 
GIRL A will-o-whisp? 
BLOOM That's right. It guides you 
26   INT. ATTIC                                                26 
STEPHEN ...if you can keep up... 
27   EXT. PARK                                                 27 
BLOOM ...to where the treasures lay. 
BOY So where's this cave? 
GIRL Yeah, where? 
28   INT. ATTIC                                                28 
STEPHEN Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say. He got this greedy glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech... and said he'd tell for thirty bucks. 
Something in Bloom's face falls. 
29   EXT. PARK                                                 29 
The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet. 
EXCITED BOY Well that's just two bucks each! 
The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the girl's joyful gaze. 
NARRATOR So Sunday came... 
30   EXT. WOODS                                                30 
Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark woods, led by Bloom. 
30   CONTINUED:                                                  30 
NARRATOR (cont'd) `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent' percentage deal. 
37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37 
Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy Sunday clothes hang, each tagged. 
NARRATOR `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry clean shop. 
And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute. 
38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38 
Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside him. 
STEPHEN So how's it feel? 
Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in the distance. 
NARRATOR In truth, young Bloom won't know for twenty years just how he felt. 
HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The brothers pick themselves up. 
NARRATOR (cont'd) And so, we'll skip ahead now in our story. 
Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop. 
STEPHEN Let `em melt. 
The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand, strides down the alleyway. 
Stephen in front. 
38   CONTINUED:                                                 38 
Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at the children playing in the sun.

40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40 
Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves. 
TITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER 
A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of the flaming books. 
YOUNG MAN He gets the scarab, you get the money, I get the girl... so in the end, everyone gets everything he wants. 
Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the young man folds to the ground. 
A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while behind him the rest of the library roars in flames. 
VOICE (O.S.) Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god are you... oh god he's dead, Victor's dead... you've killed us! We had it he was right it was all in the bag and now we're dead, why? Why, you stupid son of a bitch? 
The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston hard. 
40   CONTINUED:                                                 40 
CHARLESTON Cause the Turk was right. After seeing her, after that night on the airstrip, after Cairo everything changed, and he couldn't see the play through that one milky eye, but the Turk was right about one thing, that there's nothing beautiful about money. She's beautiful. 
MCGUIRE This isn't happening... 
CHARLESTON He'll never have her now. She's free. And I'll never see her in scarlet again, her chestnut hair, but it's worth the money and my job and his life and the rest of my life that she's free. 
MCGUIRE Charleston. I can't be here... 
CHARLESTON You're not here. Neither of us are. It's Mowcher's gun. 
MCGUIRE Mowcher is at the bottom of the Spree with a cowl in his neck! 
Charleston gets to his feet. 
CHARLESTON They won't find him for a week, and the Albino will chalk it up to Davey, he won't talk. We're clean. 
MCGUIRE Listen to you - four months ago you were an investment banker! Now you're nothing. The Scarab's lost. The money's gone. It'll rot in the Peruvian earth. It's gone. 
Charleston limps to the flaming doorway. 
40   CONTINUED: (2)                                            40 
CHARLESTON The man named Charleston you met nine months and a thousand years ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead. If we see each other again it'll be as strangers. As for the money... let it rot. 
He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires squealing. 
Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN, early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod. 
MCGUIRE Wow. 
He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none. 
MCGUIRE (cont'd) Wow is the word you're both looking for. Wow. 
The Asian woman nods slightly. 
Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink. 
She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the bullet bouncing off her. 
THE TURK Where is Bloom? 
In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck with a queen of hearts he can't play. 
A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face through the curtains. 
ROSE There you are. Hiding? 
BLOOM Yeah. 
ROSE I've been learning.      Stephen likes to talk about you. 
BLOOM Did he tell you the cave story? 
44   CONTINUED: (3)                                            44 
ROSE Is it true? 
BLOOM What else did he tell you? 
ROSE I'm not going to tell it as good as Stephen. You two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in St. Petersburg, where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the Diamond Dog. And he was your Fagin and Stephen was his Artful Dodger, but it ended suddenly and badly. 
BLOOM Stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier. 
ROSE Why did he do that? 
BLOOM And then the Brothers Bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves. Sounds romantic. 
ROSE It does. 
She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a kiss. 
Bloom's eyes stay open. 
BLOOM You want to know how Stephen did it? With Charleston? 
ROSE It's not the first thing on my mind. 
45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45 
A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf. 
BLOOM (O.S.) He positioned me in the same spot where, seven years ago, Charleston's wife stood and told him she was leaving. 
The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place. 
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd) He chose my outfit to mirror her suit. 
Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the Wife's outfit. 
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd) He even phonetically matched my final words to hers. 
WIFE This is the end. Charelston, you've always been a dunce. 
Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room. 
BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK) So in the end, everyone gets everything he wants. 
BANG. 
46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46 
BLOOM That's what he does, he writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and imbedded symbolism and shit. And he wrote me as a vulnerable anti- hero. And that's why you think you want to kiss me. It's a con. 
He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar towards the exit, passing Stephen. 
46   CONTINUED:                                                     46 
BLOOM (cont'd) I need air. 
STEPHEN Who doesn't? (plays a card) That's the big 2. 
47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47 
Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square. 
Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt bright red with fake blood, face long as hell. 
Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled face. 
He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom. 
As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile. 
Stephen paces out into the street. 
STEPHEN We missed the sunrise.    That would've been nice. 
They walk across the street to the Tiergarten. 
48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48 
Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom trailing behind, lost in thought. 
On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips' owner heads for the apartment door. 
51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51 
Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment. 
A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom. 
Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip. 
A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian. 
STEPHEN She's right, you know. 
BLOOM Why are you here, Stephen? 
STEPHEN Put on your face, let's eat. 
52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52 
Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the cheek and sends them off. 
53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53 
A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside. The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares. 
BLOOM How'd you find me? 
53   CONTINUED:                                                      53 
STEPHEN The Chink. 
BLOOM How'd the Chink find me? 
Stephen's eyes:       "Are you joking?" 
STEPHEN How've you been? 
BLOOM Great. 
STEPHEN I've done a lot of thinking the past three months. You don't want out. You think you do but you don't. Here, c'mere. I want to show you something. 
BLOOM I'm quits, Stephen. 
Stephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows. 
BLOOM (cont'd) Where are we going? 
STEPHEN New Jersey. 
BLOOM (sighs) Well lemme get my jacket.

CUT TO: 
55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55 
A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road. 
BLOOM Looks like an etching from a Bronte novel. 
55   CONTINUED:                                                 55 
Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to a plaster deer in the front yard. 
BLOOM (cont'd) Huh. Look at that. Well thanks. I'm gonna head back to Italy. 
STEPHEN Big money. Inheritance. Dad died early, Mom died two years ago after ten years fighting an illness that I can't pronounce. 
BLOOM How much? 
The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros. 
BLOOM (cont'd) Jesus. 
STEPHEN Look out. 
Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke. 
Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a non-Lamborghini way. 
Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy. 
56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56 
Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their rental car, an old school Cadillac. 
In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one. 
BLOOM What am I doing here, Stephen? I have one rule, and you've never even tested it. 
56   CONTINUED:                                                     56 
STEPHEN Stick with me. 
BLOOM It's gotta warp the image though, right? 
66   CONTINUED: (2)                                            66 
PENELOPE No, yeah it does. That's what - the Taj Majal taken by a fat tourist with diarrhea and a point- and-shoot camera can be the flattest, dullest, "here's us at the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go stick our thumbs up our asses" picture. But you can look at the most menial everyday thing, and depending on how your pinhole camera eats the light, it's warped and peculiar and imperfect. It's not reproduction, it's storytelling. 
BLOOM It's a lie that tells the truth. 
PENELOPE I dunno about truth. A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you, the less you know. 
BLOOM What's changed between now and twenty minutes ago? Cause this is kinda like a conversation. 
PENELOPE Huh.    Well shit. 
67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67 
Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house and ending up at the driveway. 
BLOOM Well, I should, uh, it's late. So. I meet a lot of people in my job I have to professionally act interested in. It's a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone. 
PENELOPE Are you leaving? 
BLOOM Yeah. 
67   CONTINUED:                                                  67 
PENELOPE Are you coming back? 
BLOOM Well next time I'm in town. We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few months. 
During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a small slit of exposed skin. 
Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush crosses her still face. 
When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls. 
BLOOM (cont'd) Paris and Greece, I think. I've gotta get a hat. Thanks for the pinhole camera demonstration. And for the good conversation. Goodbye Penelope. 
PENELOPE Goodbye Bloom. 
He drives off.    She stands in the doorway, watching him go. 
68   EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY                                        68 
A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles. 
BLOOM I need another day with her. 
STEPHEN You'll have two weeks on the boat. 
BLOOM I need another day to get her on the boat, she isn't hooked. That bit I skipped where we were talking in the backyard, it was ten minutes on the optics of lensless photography, we didn't really talk. 
68   CONTINUED:                                                      68 
STEPHEN It isn't the talking that hooked her. 
Bloom turns from the road. 
BLOOM I think you're wrong. 
A screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look. 
BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd) Though every time I say that, you end up being comically right. That's her, isn't it? Yeah. 
Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon. 
Bloom meets her. 
PENELOPE Hey. 
BLOOM Hi.    What are you doing here? 
She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band. 
PENELOPE You left this money in my kitchen. 
He doesn't take it. 
BLOOM Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks. 
PENELOPE Oh. (beat) Hey, where's this boat going? 
69   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                   69 
The good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward. 
70   EXT. DECK - DAY                                                 70 
Bloom and Penelope stroll the deck. 
70   CONTINUED:                                                   70 
BLOOM Why did you decide to come? 
PENELOPE Well I'd never been to Greece. Or Europe. Or outside New Jersey. 
BLOOM It just seems like a big leap. From where you were at yesterday to being a world traveler. 
THE CURATOR And a magician is just an actor playing the part of a magician.   My compliments. 
Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up and away. 
74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74 
They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship. 
PENELOPE Who is that man? You avoided him earlier on the deck. 
BLOOM I don't know, but he's carrying a knife up his sleeve and wearing a cape. Do me a favor and steer clear of him. 
A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen. 
BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd) I don't suppose in all your hobby acquiring you ever learned how to dance? 
PENELOPE I went through a phase when I was mildly obsessed with the Bolero. 
BLOOM Give me a minute. 
He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows deepen. She shivers. 
A match strikes.   She jumps. 
The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck. The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match. 
THE CURATOR Mademoiselle. 
PENELOPE Monsieur. 
THE CURATOR (in French, subtitled) I didn't mean to startle you. 
PENELOPE (in French, subtitled) Yes you did. 
74   CONTINUED:                                                 74 
THE CURATOR (in French, subtitled) Apologies, but the deck was dark, and I had to approach. (English) It's been such a time since I've encountered the Brothers Bloom. 
PENELOPE You're in antiques? 
THE CURATOR (Cheshire grin) Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if you know the true nature of the men you travel with? 
The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist, and a long thin blade falls into his hand. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) A little fear might suit you, I think. 
He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush, which he delicately employs. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) Bon soir, ma cherie. 
With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone. Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious. 
BLOOM It isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best. 
He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the air, the Bolero suits it. 
The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in the dark. 
75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75 
Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea. 
75   CONTINUED:                                                75 
His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth marks on the stem. 
Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band. 
76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76 
The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a beer can pinhole camera between them. 
Penelope gives a lesson on how it works. 
The Chink appreciates her. 
77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77 
Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast. 
PENELOPE How'd you find her? 
BLOOM The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She found us. 
78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78 
Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe. 
BLOOM (O.S.) A few years back, when we hit the top of our art dealing game, she just appeared. 
A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette. 
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd) She's stuck with us. We figure when she gets bored she'll vanish with the same lack of noise. 
Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She drinks it without looking at him. 
79   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK                                          79 
The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him with a look. 
STEPHEN Shut up.   I know what I'm doing. 
She hands him a thin piece of paper.       He looks it over. 
STEPHEN (cont'd) This came through just now? 
The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received from St. Petersburg. Stephen reads it. 
81   CONTINUED:                                                     81 
STEPHEN (cont'd) "My dear Stephen STOP Word on the wire is the Bros B are bound for Prague STOP Am heading there myself would love to see my boys STOP Affectionately DD." The Diamond Dog. 
He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom. 
STEPHEN (cont'd) Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog STOP Unless you've lately felt an excess of eyes left in your head kindly stay the fuck away from me and my brother STOP Regards," etcetera. 
82   EXT. THE MEDITERRANIAN SEA - MORNING                           82 
The good ship Fidele rounds the Rock of Gibraltar. 
83   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                            83 
Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins. 
She says this word like she's eating chocolate: 
PENELOPE Smugglers. It's like an adventure story. Whose idea was it to go straight? 
BLOOM Mine. Stephen always loved the life. Then he was almost killed on a run to Jakarta, two thugs with heads like canned hams worked him beyond all reason. 
84   EXT. JAKARTA PIER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          84 
Stephen is set upon by two thugs.    He rushes them. 
STEPHEN Have at thee, you ham headed bastards! 
85   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                      85 
BLOOM And I called it, that was it. 
PENELOPE Scary. 
BLOOM For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He loved the idea that we were internationally infamous art smugglers, but I think deep down, same as me, he felt like we were putting on a persona, faking it. 
PENELOPE Telling a story. 
BLOOM He'd love to die on a job. Cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell his story so well it fulfills itself. It somehow would make it finally real for him. 
PENELOPE That's kinda the thing we all want, right? 
He looks at her in the sun. 
BLOOM Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap. Trust me on that one. 
86   EXT. GRECIAN PORT - DAY                                  86 
Kalamata, if it matters. 
The Fidele docked in bright blue water. Our intrepid heroes stand aside a dusty road, surrounded by their luggage. 
The Curator approaches, tips his hat to them. 
THE CURATOR Best of luck with the antiquing, boys. Au revoir, Chinois. (MORE) (MORE) 
86   CONTINUED:                                                    86 THE CURATOR (cont'd) (to Penelope) Mademoiselle. Mes restes d'offre. 
With a wink, he is gone.     A beat.   Penelope stands apart. 
BLOOM My French is a little rusty, but I believe he just told you `my offer stands.' 
PENELOPE He came out of nowhere last night. 
87   EXT. DECK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                                   87 
Penelope taking air on the moonlit deck.     The Curator dissolves out of the darkness. 
PENELOPE (V.O.) Whatever's in his pipe, it made me thick. 
He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks unheard words low and fast. 
88   EXT. GRECIAN PORT - MORNING                                     88 
BLOOM Oh lord.   What has he got? 
PENELOPE An 8th century prayer book. 
89   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY                                       89 
We fly through the city streets... 
PENELOPE (V.O.) From his museum in Prague, stashed in the castle. 
Up to the base of the castle, through a grated hole in an ancient wall, into... 
90   INT. MUSEUM VAULT                                               90 
STEPHEN Nothing lasts. 
Exit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his face. 
96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96 
Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed ATTENDANT runs past. 
A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth. 
Off Bloom's quizzical look: 
PENELOPE Smuggling.     From the snack car. 
They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their sacks. 
Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze. 
97   INT. SNACK CAR                                               97 
Bloom pays the SNACK CAR ATTENDANT from a stack of Euros, while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers. 
97   CONTINUED:                                                   97 
BLOOM Fourteen gins? Are you kidding me? 
THE CHINK Jameson. 
BLOOM I'm not paying for that. 
She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two. 
ATTENDANT Ice? 
She says no with a look, they drink. 
BLOOM She made up the Smuggler Song. 
The Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson. 
BLOOM (cont'd) I thought it was a Disney thing. 
98   INT. PENELOPE'S SLEEPING CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT              98 
The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk. 
Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically by. 
PENELOPE Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you taken this train before? 
BLOOM Yeah. 
PENELOPE So this is all like fuckin `whatever' to you. 
BLOOM I usually drink with the Chink in the snack car, play cards. 
PENELOPE With the who? 
98   CONTINUED:                                                 98 
Oops. 
BLOOM Mrs. Yeungling. That's her smuggler nickname. 
PENELOPE That's offensive. 
BLOOM I think if it were offensive to her, she'd let us know. 
PENELOPE Do I get a smuggler nickname? 
Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber band into Penelope's luggage. 
BLOOM No. 
PENELOPE I think you're constipated.   In your fuckin soul. 
Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this before giving up. 
BLOOM What? 
PENELOPE You've got a big load of grumpy petrified poop up your ass, I'm just calling you out on it. Yeah I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so you know what? I'm a fuckin smuggler. If that's your thing, fuckin tell it like you own it. When you've got a spotlight in front of your feet, man, fuckin jump into it and dance the shit out of it. Stop fuckin thinking so much. Enjoy the fuckin ride. Fuck. 
A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens. 
PENELOPE (cont'd) Whoa. 
98    CONTINUED: (2)                                             98 
BLOOM Look, I'm not- 
PENELOPE Shh.    I love thunderstorms. 
Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares, confused. 
PENELOPE (cont'd) Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo ha ha ha ha. 
Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain falls harder. 
THE CURATOR (blank, then realizes) Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise Belguta Rioso. I get his file. 
108   INT. CURATORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - LATER                     108 
Penelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an array of beautiful paintings on the wall. 
PENELOPE Gin is slow death, man. 
Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.   The Curator strolls in. 
STEPHEN We'll see you back at the hotel. (glances at the Curator) Soon. 
They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed. 
108   CONTINUED:                                                    108 
THE CURATOR From a private collection on the island of Ikaria. That one. 
BLOOM Who painted it? 
THE CURATOR I don't know. 
PENELOPE Why is it the last thing you see every night, and the first thing you see every morning? 
THE CURATOR That's a story. You have a minute? 
He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the painting. Setting the stage. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) My daughter travelled with me when she was very young, and I'd show her the places and the art, all the most joyous and terrifying things in the world. 
Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the sun. 
THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) I wanted that the world was alive in the most fantastic way for her. To built her a pair of wings. Make these things real. But maybe more than any other objet d'art, she loved to hear she'd ask to hear the story of the stone golem. From a painting in a small private collection on the island of Ikaria. 
He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still images, which we move across like a picture book. 
THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) Well Rachel, like most monsters the Golem was once a human. A boy, about your age. (MORE) 
108   CONTINUED: (2)                                             108 THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) And one day the boy was walking home, and he quarrelled, he fought, with a good friend of his. They got very angry and his friend pushed him a certain way and the boy fell and struck his head and died. The boy's friend was very sad but also very frightened. So instead of telling the boy's parents, he did something awful. He pulled the body into a quarry, a pit of broken rocks, and hid the boy beneath a pile of large stones. Well. Years went by, and the boy's friend became a young man, and one day while drinking in town (which in his guilt he did quite a lot of) he heard that a well was being built near the forest... with the stones from the quarry. He ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty... no stones, no body. He ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work. `Did they find anything strange in the quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe hoping they'd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot. But no, they said, motioning to the well. Nothing strange. Just stones. They left him alone there at the well, and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep, still silence. 
The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing. 
Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence that follows. 
Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar pulls him back down into the depths of the well. 
Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the Curator, sitting very still. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) My daughter died nineteen years ago today. She was six. She went out to play one afternoon and vanished. (MORE) 
108   CONTINUED: (3)                                             108 THE CURATOR (cont'd) The next morning we found her, in a stone well on a neighboring property. I climbed down to her, but slipped and broke my leg, and while we waited for the rescue team to pull us out she died in my arms. If you've had a child... my whole everything just focused down to one thing, to hold her and make her feel safe. But no matter what I said to her, I couldn't stop her shaking, crying. Her last moments on this earth were filled with terror. Of a stone golem. 
He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) It was the first painting I `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping some night the golem will come for me. 
109   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER                   109 
Bloom trots out, ahead of Penelope. 
THE CURATOR Mademoiselle. 
Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on the staircase. The Curator comes out. 
THE CURATOR (cont'd) It is you I do business with, yes? 
PENELOPE Right.   Oh, right. 
She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's. 
He lets go, and smiles apologetically. 
THE CURATOR Au revoir. 
110   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY                                  110 
Penelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded, vibrant cobblestone streets. 
PENELOPE You aren't constipated. You're scared. What are you scared of? 
They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands. 
As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand holding off. Penelope notices why. 
111   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        111 
Stephen, up in the window watching them approach.   He recedes into the room. 
112   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                                112 
The sun sets against the castle, taking us into night. 
113   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                              113 
Bloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil. A smell breaks his concentration. 
BLOOM Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane. 
The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and through the window the horizon glows with the approach of dawn. 
Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open, the guttural snoring ringing in his ears. 
119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119 
Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all step judiciously back. No response. 
STEPHEN Max? 
BLOOM We're a little early... 
120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120 
Still and silent in the breaking light of morning. 
And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls. 
The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the well... broken on the floor. 
Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness. Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window. 
PENELOPE The Golem came for him. In my dream. Crawled out of the painting and killed him in a horrible way. 
120   CONTINUED:                                                120 
BLOOM Well at least he had the decency to just skip out on us, not do something tacky like fake his own death. 
Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas. 
THE CURATOR (sotto) You're a little early. 
Bloom quickly closes it. 
STEPHEN I don't get it. If he was hightailing it he could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book, and had some traveling money. Well. Back to antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing lost. (to Penelope) And you got to see Prague, which is nice. 
Penelope's eyes widen with realization. 
PENELOPE Oh. 
BLOOM You should stay in the city for awhile, they have these amazing puppet show opera things- 
But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up. 
STEPHEN Oh? 
121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121 
Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's hand. All heads are slumped. 
PENELOPE Oh. 
121   CONTINUED:                                                    121 
BLOOM It's my fault. I can't believe I left you alone with him. 
The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it. 
STEPHEN The check was cashed yesterday afternoon, he'd have deposited it in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen. 
PENELOPE What a waste. 
Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic. 
PENELOPE (cont'd) That poor man. What a waste. 
Bloom's expression turns quizzical. 
PENELOPE (cont'd) That poor Argentina man. He'll never see the book now, it'll just rot in the catacombs. What a waste. 
When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear. 
122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122 
Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars. The Chink and Stephen stand by. 
BLOOM No. No no. Can't you see what happened here, there is no book, we've been swindled - 
PENELOPE But maybe there is, maybe it's real, we don't know! 
BLOOM It's not real, it's a con. 
PENELOPE It's my money, I'm going to find out for sure. He gave us every piece of information we need. 
122   CONTINUED:                                                  122 
She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench. 
Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back. 
STEPHEN We'd need to clear the administrative offices.   Some sort of disruption. 
The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness. 
PENELOPE (to Bloom) C'mon. Help me break into this castle. It'll be fun. 
123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123 
STEPHEN Ready? 
130   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                130 
The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb. 
131   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                131 
Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket. 
132   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                         132 
A little alcove with a good view of the castle. 
132   CONTINUED:                                               132 
Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the Eastern tower. Bloom paces. 
133   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        133 
An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector. 
134   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                   134 
Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink. 
STEPHEN Ok. 
He looks through his binoculars again. 
BLOOM Alright? 
PENELOPE Ok. 
They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly. 
BLOOM For the record, I'm still against this. Why send her in alone? 
The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers. 
STEPHEN Because going in alone is a very important thing to do. She's walking into a zero security tourism office during a fire drill and taking a five hundred dollar manuscript replica from a utility crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a file clerk asks if she's lost. Which isn't even going to happen. (to the Chink) She's in position. 
He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door. 
Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin. She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key. 
134   CONTINUED:                                                       134 
She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the handbag dangling at her hip. 
STEPHEN (cont'd) Cause nobody's going to know we were ever here. 
Bloom spots the handbag.         Something's not right. 
BLOOM Uh- 
The Chink clicks the pen. 
135   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             135 
The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps. 
136   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        136 
A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully dramatic ball of fire and debris. 
Screams.   Shouts.      Panic. 
Our three look up at the tower, agape. 
THE CHINK Fuck me. 
Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope. 
137   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                      137 
Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust. Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground. 
The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour out. 
138   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                               138 
BLOOM Don't do it don't do it Penelope don't- 
138   CONTINUED:                                                  138 
STEPHEN They're locking down the castle, she won't get in. 
139   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 139 
She takes a step towards the door. 
140   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          140 
Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints. 
141   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 141 
And opens her mouth to speak. 
154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154 
The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink sit watching for some sign. 
Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of the bridge. 
BLOOM The Chief of Police. 
As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged mesh in the back seat. 
His face falls. 
Then Penelope spots him, points and says something. 
Very suddenly, the police car stops. 
The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three. 
And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and salute her. 
He kisses her hand. 
CHIEF OF POLICE (in Czech) It has been a privilege, madame, to behold even briefly such a strong, beautiful flower. 
PENELOPE (in Czech) Thank you sir, I will not soon forget your kindness. 
She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink. 
154   CONTINUED:                                                    154 
The police cars drive off. 
Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it on a bench. A moment of victorious silence. 
Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy. 
PENELOPE (cont'd) (sings) We're a band of smugglers hey, la la la la la, we smuggle by night, drink by day, smugglers ho, ho ho... Everybody! 
155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155 
Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses. 
The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture. 
STEPHEN Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave till eight. 
BLOOM That was real. 
STEPHEN Yeah, I know. 
BLOOM Fuckin scary. 
156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156 
Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens' "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio. 
His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit seller's cart. 
He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance. 
Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple. 
Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens. 
156   CONTINUED:                                                   156 
And turns. 
And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite judgement. 
Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER. 
The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints, apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips. 
157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157 
Stephen bails Bloom out. 
STEPHEN An apple? 
BLOOM Yeah, but it was part of an epiphany. 
158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158 
The train thunders South, towards Greece. 
159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159 
Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight. 
As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with two mini bottles of gin. 
He kisses her. 
160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160 
PENELOPE What's up? 
He pulls her out of the room. 
168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168 
Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops. 
168   CONTINUED:                                                168 
PENELOPE Bloom.   What? 
Deep breath. 
BLOOM My brother and I are con men. All things considered, we might be the most respected con man team working today. And everything since you hit me with your Lamborghini, all of this, it's all fake. It's all a con. 
169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169 
The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance, Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes inside and turns out the light. 
170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170 
BLOOM No, we were going to blow you off tomorrow using the cackle bladder, it's a, term, we have actors playing the Argentina guy's men, when we showed up the deal would go bad, they would open fire on us, Stephen and I would pretend to be shot using blood packets, squibs. That's - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders, so... So you'd escape with the Chink, she'd send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that. 
PENELOPE Wow. 
BLOOM But that's not how this one's going to end. I love you now, and I want to get you out of this. I'm going to do what I have to do to get you out of this, away from all this for good. Are you ready? 
171   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           171 
Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand. 
BLOOM Stephen's gone into town to prep the Argentina actors. Your money's at his place. 
PENELOPE Money? I don't want the money, let's just leave. 
For a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead. 
BLOOM C'mon. 
172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172 
Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark, switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on. 
STEPHEN (O.S.) You have to switch it on at the base. 
A beat.   Bloom does. 
Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not angry. Much more sad than angry. 
BLOOM So I've told her our whole play. And I'm here. To take her money back. How's that make you feel? 
STEPHEN Disappointed. 
BLOOM This isn't the ending you wanted? 
STEPHEN It doesn't matter now. This is the way it ends. So let's get it over with. 
BLOOM Where's the money? 
172   CONTINUED:                                                    172 
STEPHEN I ate it. 
BLOOM Give me the money, Stephen. 
STEPHEN No. 
PENELOPE I don't want the money. 
BLOOM He's not going to keep a single piece of you. 
Stephen stands. 
STEPHEN I'm sorry you fell in love with her. But she's a mark. And all of this, all of it is a con. Every moment you shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in love. That's what you're afraid of, right? That you don't know the difference? Or maybe that there is no difference. That that's what love is. 
PENELOPE We're leaving. 
STEPHEN (to Bloom) No. You're too scared to leave. You're scared to ride off into a sunset that isn't painted tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights. If you were ready for that, you wouldn't be here. The money is in my bedroom. Right behind me. But in my story you don't get the money or the sunset or the girl. 
A long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen. 
PENELOPE Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please. 
172   CONTINUED: (2)                                              172 
Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw. 
Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs Bloom's leg and brings him down. 
Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified. 
A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house apart, thirty years worth of a fight. 
Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet. 
Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground. 
BLOOM Hey. 
The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs- up of approval. 
177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177 
Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city. 
BLOOM How did you find me? 
PENELOPE The Chink. 
BLOOM How did you find the Chink? 
PENELOPE She gave me her cell when we got to Mexico. 
BLOOM I didn't even know she had one. 
PENELOPE I think she's kind of selective in who she gives the number to. 
178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178 
They sit with wine and bread. 
BLOOM Why are you here, Penelope? 
PENELOPE Why did you decide to stay with your brother instead of coming with me in Mexico? 
BLOOM Everything Stephen said that night was true. 
178   CONTINUED:                                                   178 
PENELOPE I've been doing a lot of thinking the past three months. I want you to consider something. 
She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and slides it across the table to him. 
On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST." 
Bloom sets the paper down with a snap. 
BLOOM Go away. Everything Stephen said was true. I was just playing you as a mark. Everything between us, none of it was real. 
She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg. 
PENELOPE I don't believe you. 
It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right. 
179   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                                  179 
Bloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings. 
BLOOM Pick up... c'mon... 
180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180 
Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair holds his tear stained face in his hands. 
This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell phone chirps away. 
Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod. 
Stephen hastily answers it. 
180   CONTINUED:                                                180 
STEPHEN Hello? 
181   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        181 
BLOOM How quickly can you get to Ferentino? 
STEPHEN (ON PHONE) Uh... Nine-ish? 
Bloom fishes out his pocket watch. 
BLOOM Alright. 
Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket. 
182   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           182 
Penelope plays cards with the Grandmother. 
183   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           183 
Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the apartment. 
STEPHEN So she comes back wanting to work with us. Honestly? I think we'd be lucky to have her. If you called me to hear my opinion on the matter. Which I'm getting the feeling you didn't. 
BLOOM I did what I did in Mexico to get her out of all this. I would rather die than bring her into the con. 
STEPHEN So maybe you want to tell me what I'm doing in Ferentino. 
183   CONTINUED:                                                  183 
BLOOM You knew she'd come back. What did you figure she was good for, another million? 
188   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNSET                                 188 
The blood red sun sets over the city. 
189   INT. ST. PETERSBURG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                       189 
Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack. 
The phone rings.    Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up. 
STEPHEN Our "Russians" have arrived. 
190   INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                        190 
Stephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a red suitcase. 
190   CONTINUED:                                                 190 
BLOOM Who'd you get, anyway? 
STEPHEN Hm? 
BLOOM To play the "Russians?" 
DING. 
The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog. 
DIAMOND DOG My boys. 
191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191 
Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS, waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter. Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area. 
192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192 
BLOOM I don't understand. Tell me so I understand. Three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard- 
STEPHEN We need someone who can pass for the Russian mob to buy our fake book. The Dog's got his big store right here in St. Petersburg. 
BLOOM Alright, fuckin stop. You want this to finish in St. Petersburg, you want this to end with the Dog for some what thematic something? Fine but don't tell it like a story, let's say it. Twenty three years ago and I can still smell, that blood red apartment of his, the smell of that place. I hate him Stephen but this isn't that, this is I don't trust him. 
192   CONTINUED:                                                   192 
STEPHEN What's he gonna do? Steal our fake money? (beat) I've thought this one out, believe me. And we can't end it without him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok. 
193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193 
The red leather suitcase on the bar. 
DIAMOND DOG Stephen, still the grand architect with your symbols. Red for temptation, white for salvation. 
The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a loupe. 
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd) Impressive, boys. 
BLOOM It's trash. There's visible cross hatching in Franklin's eye. 
Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben Franklin's eye on the bills. 
DIAMOND DOG Hm.  I'll be damned. (closes case) Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead handing over a rag bag like this, it should be a steel attache. 
STEPHEN This'll   do. We'll do the drop off at your   store. Make it scary, think a   movie version of the Russian   mafia, but don't hassle her. 
DIAMOND DOG Alright. 
The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest on his bandaged hand. 
He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew. 
193   CONTINUED:                                                   193 
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd) I look forward to meeting the lady. Take care, boys. 
Leaving his gold lighter on the bar. 
194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194 
The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot. 
STEPHEN So. Our fake Russian attack. One small charge will simulate a bullet hit, and blow out the back window. 
The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on the rear windshield. 
STEPHEN (cont'd) So that one bang, then we roll off the road. Once we get clear of the car the Chink sets off the final charge, incinerating the car and the money in the trunk. This'll all happen exactly twenty seconds after we cross the main bridge out of town. After the bridge. 
Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his jacket. 
BLOOM Ok. 
195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195 
Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is expressionless. 
BLOOM You've been awful quiet. 
She doesn't react. 
BLOOM What happened? 
PENELOPE Yeungling went to get another car. 
BLOOM Where's Stephen? 
PENELOPE We don't know. He was gone. 
Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his fingers over the dozens of bullet holes. 
Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila envelope. 
PENELOPE (cont'd) We're going to find him. If he escaped, he'll contact us. If they've got him, it's for ransom. 
205   CONTINUED:                                                 205 
BLOOM Who's got him? 
PENELOPE The Russians. 
The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching Bloom's face against the dark forest depths. 
206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206 
A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug, loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands outside. 
BLOOM Stephen, god please what's happening. I don't know what to do. I don't know Stephen please. Please. What's happening. Please. 
A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready. 
But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan. 
PENELOPE Where does she get all these cars? 
Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet the Chink in the middle of the parking lot. 
BLOOM If you know what's happening, now would be a really good time to speak up. 
She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in. 
BLOOM (cont'd) No, please. Not now. I need your help here now, I don't know what to do. 
The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the world. But she's leaving. 
She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching for an instant. 
206   CONTINUED:                                                     206 
She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up her case and walks off. 
A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets in. 
Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in Chinese. 
BLOOM (cont'd) Thanks. 
The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a dramatic fireball. 
The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave. 
Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just happened. 
207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207 
A busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago, Illinois." 
On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant. 
208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208 
A dive.   The chef on the phone. 
CHEF Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok. 
ALL THE COOKS Blooooom! 
He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper. 
209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209 
Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper. 
209   CONTINUED:                                                209 
BLOOM Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok. So I've got "We are all assholes in our own theatrical enterprises." You sure? 
This phrase, written on Bloom's paper. 
CHEF And then it end with "Goodbye shit head." 
BLOOM Shit head? 
CHEF But it is different meaning in Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit head" if you have affection for shit. 
210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210 
The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying. Bloom sits next to her.

"THE MUMMY" 
by 
Stephen Sommers 
The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not ancient. 
SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS. 
THEBES - 2,134 B.C 
Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent: 
NARRATOR Thebes. City of the Living. Crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First. 
The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME. 
INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK 
Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP. 
NARRATOR Home of Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris, Keeper of the Dead. 
A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN. 
NARRATOR Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's Mistress. No other man was allowed to touch her. 
She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains. 
Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust: 
NARRATOR But for our love, we were willing to risk life itself. 
And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- SUBTITLED. 
PHARAOH What are you doing here? 
The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws them back. 
Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger. 
PHARAOH WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?! 
From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked. 
PHARAOH Imhotep?... My priest. 
Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back. 
Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony. 
PRIESTS Pharaoh's bodyguards! 
Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony. 
ANCK-SU-NAMUN You must go. Save yourself. Only you can resurrect me. 
Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN. 
MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony just as the Mumia rip through the curtains. 
Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses -- 
ANCK-SU-NAMUN My body is no longer his temple! 
She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream... 
NARRATOR/IMHOTEP For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's body was to be cursed. And it was I, the High Priest, whose duty it was to curse it. 
EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT 
Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck- su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS. 
IMHOTEP Her body was mummified, her vital organs removed and placed in sacred canopic jars. 
Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING. 
IMHOTEP The Book of The Living contained sacred incantations that would send the evil dead on a journey into the dark underworld. 
Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising. 
Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the ground. 
Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus. 
The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears at the Nubians. Killing them. 
The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle BOX. 
IMHOTEP They would never allow me to be released. For I would arise a walking disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power over the sands, and the glory of invincibility. 
Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean. 
IMHOTEP And if I could raise my beloved Anck- su-namun from her place in hell, together, we would be an unstoppable infection upon this world. The Apocalypse. The End. 
Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM: 
THE MUMMY 
The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave. 
Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half- buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert. 
EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY 
Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG HORSEMAN. 
Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS: 
THE SAHARA - 1925 
A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL. 
He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at him. 
O'CONNELL I knew this was gonna be a lousy day. 
A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of the wall. This is BENI. 
BENI Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender? 
O'CONNELL Shut-up and gimme your bandolier. 
Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell. 
BENI Then let's run away. Right now. While we can still make it. 
O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier. 
O'CONNELL Now gimme your revolver, you'll never use it anyway. 
Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell. 
BENI Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody ever does that anymore. 
O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver 
O'CONNELL Now go find me a big stick. 
BENI In the desert? What for? 
O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him. 
O'CONNELL So I can tie it to your back, you appear to be without a spine. 
The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins. 
O'CONNELL How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways? 
BENI I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? 
O'CONNELL Altar boys? 
BENI Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody? 
Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground. 
O'Connell gives him a nasty look. 
O'CONNELL No, but I'm considering it. 
They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp 
BENI What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping! 
O'CONNELL None of the above, thank you. 
BENI Then what the hell are you doing here!? 
They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening. 
O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile. 
O'CONNELL I was just looking for a good time. 
WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN: 
CAIRO 
INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY 
Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare. 
This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with her. 
Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads the title. 
EVELYN Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up here? 
Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer. 
And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts stiltwalking down the aisle. 
EVELYN OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH! 
The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY. 
And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES into the next bookshelf. 
Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other eye and stares at the huge mess. 
EVELYN Oops. 
The Egyptian CURATOR storms in. 
CURATOR Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! Give me frogs, flies, locusts, anything but this! Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy! 
Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books. 
EVELYN I'm sorry, it was an accident. 
CURATOR When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you? 
Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself. 
EVELYN You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library. 
CURATOR Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess! 
The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming. 
And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT. 
EVELYN Hello? 
Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery. 
EVELYN Abdul? Mohammed? Bob? 
Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters -- 
INT. THE RAMESSEUM 
Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery. 
The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch. 
Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans forward with the torch, and peers inside. 
-- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her! 
Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half drunk. 
EVELYN You...! YOU...! 
JONATHAN Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original. 
Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth. 
EVELYN Have you no respect for the dead? 
JONATHAN Right now, I only wish to join them. 
He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest. 
EVELYN Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours. 
JONATHAN My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note. 
He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb. 
EVELYN High note? Ha! For five years you've been scrounging around Egypt, and what have you to show for it? Nothing. 
EVELYN I'm your sister. 
JONATHAN That just makes you more gullible. 
EVELYN You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?! 
JONATHAN Picked his pocket, actually. 
EXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY 
The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen. 
EVELYN And what is he in prison for? 
WARDEN I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself. 
EVELYN And what did he say? 
WARDEN He said... he was just looking for a good time. 
The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars. 
From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance. 
EVELYN But he's just a filthy criminal? 
JONATHAN (cringing) Way to go, Evy. 
O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan. 
O'CONNELL So who's the broad? 
EVELYN Broad?! 
JONATHAN She's my sister, actually. 
O'CONNELL Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss. 
Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door. 
WARDEN I'll be back in a moment. 
O'CONNELL (sarcastic) I tremble with anticipation. 
A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer. 
EVELYN We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it. 
O'CONNELL No. 
EVELYN No? 
O'CONNELL No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra. 
Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy. 
EVELYN How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra? 
O'CONNELL Because that's where I found it. I was there. 
Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious 
JONATHAN How do we know that's not a load of pig swallow? 
O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition. 
O'CONNELL Hey,... don't I know you? 
JONATHAN Um, well, you see... 
O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again. 
He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look. 
Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell. 
EVELYN You were actually at Hamunaptra? 
O'CONNELL I just decked your brother 
EVELYN Yes, well... (shrugs) I know my brother. 
O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl. 
O'CONNELL Yeah, I was there. 
EVELYN You swear? 
The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger. 
The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear. 
EVELYN He knows the location to Hamunaptra. 
The warden spins around and faces her. 
WARDEN You lie. 
EVELYN I would never! 
At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn. 
WARDEN Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly? 
EVELYN Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent. 
WARDEN Fifty percent. 
EVELYN Twenty. 
WARDEN Forty. 
Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl. 
O'CONNELL Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- 
EVELYN Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more. 
The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING. 
All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him. 
CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face. 
CURATOR She must die. 
Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA: blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs. 
HOOK She is like all the others. She will die in the desert. 
CURATOR No! She has seen too much. She knows too much. 
The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes. 
CURATOR Not only does she have a map, but she has the key. 
Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys. 
HOOK The key!? She has the lost key!? 
CURATOR Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all. 
HOOK Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her. 
CURATOR And burn the map and retrieve the key. 
HOOK It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well. 
CURATOR Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra? 
EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY 
SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI. 
BENI It is three days down the Nile, then two days by camel, sahibs. 
WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS. 
DANIELS For all the money we're paying you, something better god-damned well be under that sand. 
WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back. 
HENDERSON "Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya gotta keep sayin, to yourself, "Hamunaptra." 
Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures. 
EVELYN Do you really think he'll show up? 
JONATHAN Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word. 
EVELYN Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit. 
O'CONNELL (O.S.) Anyone I know? 
Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river. 
The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her. 
O'CONNELL Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. 
EVELYN The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners. 
O'CONNELL Still angry that I kissed ya, huh? 
EVELYN If you call that a kiss. 
O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite. 
EVELYN Did I miss something? Are we going into battle? 
O'CONNELL The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died. 
This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts dismantling and cleaning the guns. 
O'CONNELL There's something out there, you know, something under that sand. 
EVELYN Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there? 
O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes. 
O'CONNELL Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell." 
EVELYN Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually. 
She gives him a know-it-all grin. 
EVELYN I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit. 
O'CONNELL And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right? 
Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge. 
EVELYN You know your history. 
O'CONNELL I know my treasure. 
Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says: 
EVELYN By the way,... why did you kiss me? 
O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders. 
O'CONNELL I was about to be hanged, seemed like a good idea at the time. 
Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off. 
O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed. 
O'CONNELL What?... Wha'd I say? 
Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni. 
BENI My very good friend! What a surprise. 
O'CONNELL Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you. 
O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin. 
BENI You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell. 
O'CONNELL So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot? 
BENI Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way. 
O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck. 
BENI You never believed in Hamunaptra, O'Connell. Why are you going back? The devil himself lives out there. 
They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck. 
O'CONNELL The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble. 
BENI You always did have more balls than brains. 
O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni. 
O'CONNELL Let's make us even, shall we? 
BENI Even? 
O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge. 
He picks her up and throws her over the side. 
O'CONNELL The occasion calls for it. 
Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after her. 
EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT 
Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head. 
JONATHAN Americans. 
Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH. 
Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles. 
JONATHAN I say! Good show! 
Then he points his thumb at himself 
JONATHAN And did I panic? 
He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back. 
JONATHAN I think not. 
And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other. 
NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT 
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices. 
Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans. 
BENI Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses! 
O'CONNELL Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river! 
Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking... 
BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY 
O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them the reins of four ugly old camels. 
JONATHAN I can't believe the price of these fleabags. 
O'CONNELL We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister. 
JONATHAN Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it? 
O'CONNELL Awfully. 
And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress. 
O'CONNELL Then again... 
SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY 
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara. 
JONATHAN Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. They smell, they bite, they spit. Disgusting. 
The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him. 
O'CONNELL Yeah, disgusting. 
Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel. 
EVELYN Well I think they're cute. 
WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it. 
FRYING PAN - NIGHT 
The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking across the vast wasteland. 
Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he looks up at a distant ridge -- 
-- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing them. 
EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY 
The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune. 
JONATHAN And you snore! 
WARDEN I do not snore! 
BENI (struggling) Why do you like to fight so much? 
O'CONNELL 'Cause I look good doin, it. 
Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them. 
A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone. 
Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, she hears something coming up behind her and spins around. 
A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises his scimitar, about to strike. 
Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS him twenty feet back into some ruins. 
At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand dune. 
Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them. 
Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams. 
JONATHAN Let 'em have it, boys! 
Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins. 
JONATHAN I say, bloody good show. 
And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat. 
O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES! 
Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray points his scimitar at O'Connell's head. 
ARDETH RAY LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE OR DIE! 
Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her and holds her close. 
O'CONNELL You alright? 
Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too. 
EVELYN Yes,... fine,... thank you. 
Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and Burns help Daniels to his feet. 
DANIELS See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand! 
HENDERSON For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there. 
O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied. 
O'CONNELL These men are a desert people. They value water, not gold. 
Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried. 
EVELYN Where's Jonathan? 
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open. 
Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk. 
O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly -- 
EVELYN Unlike my brother, sir, I know when to say no. 
O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away. 
O'CONNELL Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew. 
EVELYN I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this? 
O'CONNELL Something like that. 
EVELYN Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself 
O'CONNELL Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here? 
Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet. 
EVELYN I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am. 
O'CONNELL And what is that? 
Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins and proudly lifts her head high. 
EVELYN ...I am a librarian! 
INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY 
WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited. 
EVELYN Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl. 
O'CONNELL You dream about dead guys? 
Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes. 
EVELYN Look, all the sacred spells have been chiseled off. The hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife, they've been removed. This man was cursed,... doomed. 
O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care. 
O'CONNELL Tough break. 
JONATHAN Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we? 
Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs 
the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly. 
And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP! 
O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN AHHHHH!!! 
They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin. 
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY 
Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background, Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets. 
BENI The curse,... beware the curse! 
Beni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits. 
DANIELS Stupid superstitious bastard. 
And that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud. 
INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY 
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out. 
O'CONNELL Is he supposed to look like that? 
EVELYN No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still... 
JONATHAN Juicy? 
EVELYN Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing. 
O'CONNELL And look at this. 
O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside. 
EVELYN Oh my god, he was buried alive. 
This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer. 
EVELYN And he left a message. 
WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD. 
EVELYN It says: 'Death is only the beginning.' 
Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around. 
O'CONNELL Where's my gun? 
JONATHAN What are you going to do? Shoot him? 
O'CONNELL If he decides to wake up, hell yes! 
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY 
The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to life. 
EGYPTOLOGIST I have heard told of this book, but I never truly believed it existed. This, good gentlemen, is a most priceless treasure. 
Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger. 
HENDERSON I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon! 
DANIELS Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold! 
Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels) 
The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her. 
EGYPTOLOGIST NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT! 
He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents. 
The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple. 
The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The Book Of The Dead, looking haunted. 
EGYPTOLOGIST What have we done? 
The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR 
INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair 
JONATHAN Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers! 
O'CONNELL That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague! 
EVELYN This is not a plague. It's generational. Every so many years the locusts of Egypt have a population explosion and they all take flight. 
Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS. 
O'CONNELL Okay,... and what about frogs? 
INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 
The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway. 
Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet, squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness, 
BURNS Daniels! Henderson! 
INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS. 
Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul ass. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 
Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything. 
Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps out. 
BURNS Daniels?... is that you? 
Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move. 
BURNS Henderson? 
Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth. 
LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS. 
O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES. 
Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then they look across the way. Evelyn is gone. 
JONATHAN EVY!? 
SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT 
Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards him. 
EVELYN Oh thank goodness, you're one of the Americans, aren't you? 
Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets. 
Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets. 
Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS. 
IMHOTEP Anck-su-namun? 
LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto 
O'CONNELL Damn-it! Must be a trap door around here or somethin'. 
And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs. 
Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice. 
O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself. 
O'CONNELL I told ya, I already got him! 
Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious. 
ARDETH RAY Know this, the creature will be coming for you. He must consummate the curse. And until he does, he will never eat, he will never sleep, and he will never stop. 
Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice, 
EXT. RUINS - NIGHT 
O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist, still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another. 
They all head off into the dark, windblown desert... 
And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC, PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE -- 
IMHOTEP ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!! 
EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY 
A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter. 
INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY 
A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open. 
O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk. 
O'CONNELL I thought you didn't believe in this stuff!? 
O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses 
EVELYN Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one. 
O'CONNELL Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone. 
EVELYN No, we are not. 
O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk. 
O'CONNELL Oh yes we are. 
O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues to UNPACK them: 
EVELYN No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him. 
O'CONNELL We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing. 
EVELYN Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him. 
O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands. 
O'CONNELL How!? You heard the man, no mortal weapons can kill this guy. 
Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer. 
EVELYN Then we'll have to find some immortal ones. 
O'CONNELL There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here! 
O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk. 
Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers. 
O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking his fingers as Evelyn follows him. 
EVELYN According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed. 
O'CONNELL Yeah? So? Is that my problem? 
EVELYN (incredulous) It's everybody's problem! 
O'CONNELL Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated. 
EVELYN That's what I am to you? A contract? 
O'CONNELL You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot. 
EVELYN I'm staying. 
O'CONNELL FINE. 
O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door. 
EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY 
LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound, knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken. 
O'CONNELL Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!! 
EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY 
Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard. 
O'CONNELL We got problems. 
And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom. 
O'CONNELL He's here! I saw him! That thing is here! 
EVELYN The creature!? Are you sure!? 
O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the HAIL and FIRE. 
O'CONNELL Pretty sure! 
The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet. 
O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them. 
O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs. 
INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY 
O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE. 
Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his gun. 
Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell. 
The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned. 
O'CONNELL We are in serious trouble. 
Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn. 
O'CONNELL Back off, creep. 
Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind. 
Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're all stunned at the sight of Imhotep. 
O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it. 
Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY. 
He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her. 
IMHOTEP You saved me from the undead. For this, I shall make you immortal. 
He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face. 
And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING. 
Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone. 
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed. 
Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified. 
HENDERSON The curse. The curse. 
INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY 
O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn across the Ramesseum. 
EVELYN There's only one person I know who can possibly give us some answers. 
They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops. 
EVERYBODY YOU! 
O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head. 
CURATOR Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen. 
EVELYN What is he doing here? 
CURATOR Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us? 
Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38. 
EVELYN Who put you in charge? You can't just leave me behind like some old suitcase. I'm the one responsible for this mess and I intend to be the one to clean it up. 
O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon. 
Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING. 
O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels. 
O'CONNELL Keep an eye on her. If you leave her door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon, Jonathan. 
Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself. 
JONATHAN Me? 
CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT 
The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed face. 
He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO -- 
THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT 
Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves. 
O'CONNELL (O.S.) Well, well, well. 
Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door. 
O'CONNELL Lemme guess, spring cleaning? 
Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor. 
O'CONNELL Where's your new friend? 
BENI What friend? You're my only friend. 
O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin. 
O'CONNELL Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you? 
BENI It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune. 
O'CONNELL Immune from what? 
BENI You shall see. 
O'CONNELL What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat. 
O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin. 
BENI The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds. 
O'CONNELL What does he want the book for? 
BENI (shrugs) Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... (looks at Jonathan) And your sister. 
O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses. 
Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes. 
JONATHAN That looked rather painful. 
O'CONNELL (wincing) Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap. 
JONATHAN Yes, I know, I do that to people. 
And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to the window and look out -- 
EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT 
Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST. 
A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters. 
The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running. 
EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT 
O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked. 
O'CONNELL Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go. 
JONATHAN And then he'll be coming after Evy. 
They turn and race out of the office. 
BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT 
O'CONNELL Got guts, lady. 
EVELYN Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them. 
Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET. 
JONATHAN Hey that's mine -- ! 
Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away. 
O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of Ardeth Ray's grip. 
O'CONNELL Evelyn! 
The huge, powerful man holds him tight. 
ARDETH RAY Be calm. There is still time. We can stop him yet. 
The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep stops and looks back at O'Connell. 
IMHOTEP Pared oos. 
Evelyn SCREAMS. 
EVELYN NOOO!! 
Beni smiles. 
BENI Kill them. 
Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's grip and stumbles forward. 
O'CONNELL EVELYN! 
But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill. 
O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole. 
CURATOR Go! Find a way! Kill the creature! 
The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator apart. 
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats. 
O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell. 
FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies. 
STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT 
The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE... 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY. 
O'CONNELL We gotta get her back. 
JONATHAN I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it. 
O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray. 
O'CONNELL You know where he's taking her? 
ARDETH RAY Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual. 
Jonathan looks worried. 
JONATHAN And what ritual would that be? 
ARDETH RAY The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life. 
JONATHAN And how does one do that? 
ARDETH RAY By reading the Book Of The Dead. 
JONATHAN Oh yes, of course. 
ARDETH RAY And then killing your sister. 
JONATHAN Excuse me? 
Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell. 
ARDETH RAY Imhotep is now able to cross the desert with great haste. 
The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston Havlock LAUGHING. 
WINSTON Here I come, laddies! 
O'Connell braces himself for impact, 
SAHARA - DAY 
Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep. 
EVELYN Stop it! You'll kill them! 
Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard. 
Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs. 
EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY 
The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside- down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down. 
JONATHAN Excuse me... A little help would be useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE!! 
O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead. 
A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away. 
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND... 
HAMUNAPTRA - DAY 
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra. 
O'CONNELL Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like? 
JONATHAN He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon. 
O'CONNELL Got it. 
HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY 
Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell. 
NECROPOLIS - DAY 
Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his rifle into her back and pushes her forward. 
BENI Keep moving. 
Evelyn gives him a look. 
EVELYN You know, nasty little fellows such as yourself, always get their comeuppance. 
Beni suddenly looks worried. 
BENI Yeah? 
EVELYN Oh yes, always. 
Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall. 
JONATHAN I say, look at that. 
He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE. 
JONATHAN Say, gents! You should come have a look at this. 
The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM. 
O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away. 
The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job. 
O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM! 
INT. CEMETERY - DAY 
The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life. 
Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE. 
Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed. 
TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests. 
ARDETH RAY My turn. 
Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now. 
O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway. 
Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels and rolls about. 
INT. CEMETERY - DAY 
Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS. 
INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY 
The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them. 
O'CONNELL This whole place is comin, alive! 
The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty. 
ARDETH RAY I'm out. 
He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into -- 
HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY 
-- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber. 
JONATHAN There he is! 
They run up to the base of the statue, 
JONATHAN Hello Horus old boy. 
O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder. 
ARDETH RAY Allow me. 
O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS. 
Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES. 
Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way out, -- another dark, creepy passageway. 
INT. CEMETERY 
Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths in the room. 
Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed cheek. 
INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY 
O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up. 
O'CONNELL These guys just don't quit. 
Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells and runs off towards the mummies. 
ARDETH RAY Keep digging! 
O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give. 
The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember? 
Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts... 
And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor. 
One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard. 
AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly. 
INT. CEMETERY 
Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead. 
A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. 
Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror. 
INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY 
Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag. 
He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces as they stare at it in wonder. 
The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel and wades into the remaining mummies swinging. 
The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares angrily down. Jonathan stares back. 
JONATHAN Oh boy. 
O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis. 
O'CONNELL This just keeps gettin, better and better. 
Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue. 
O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts. 
Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away. 
O'CONNELL Do something, Jonathan! Kill it! 
JONATHAN You have got to be joking? 
Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun. 
EVELYN Finish the inscription, idiot! 
JONATHAN Oh. 
Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure -- 
JONATHAN Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here? 
EVELYN What's it look like!? 
Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares at the inscription, slightly oblivious. 
JONATHAN It's an Anck symbol, with two little squiggly lines above it, and a bird, a stork! on either side. 
Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun. 
EVELYN Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus! 
JONATHAN Yes,... I see. 
The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him. 
JONATHAN Hootash im Ahmenophus! 
The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to powder and DRIVING her into the ground. 
Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly backpedals on his hands and heels. 
O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall. 
O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP! 
SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins. 
O'CONNELL Okay pal, let's see how tough you are without your right arm. 
Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes it off. 
O'CONNELL Alright,... so he's left handed. 
Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn. 
JONATHAN I got it! 
Evelyn runs for Jonathan. 
O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy. 
Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back. 
O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air, 
SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with him. 
He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet. 
Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand. 
Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them. 
Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm. 
No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and casually flings it away. 
The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages looking for something. 
O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About to die.

Hot Tub Time Machine Theme Lyrics by Josh Heald Music by Def Leppard, Styx, Journey, Poison, or Whitesnake 
Water cranked to a hundred and three Got my tunes, my snacks, my booze, my skis (Got the) freshest moves you ever seen When I'm soakin in my Hot Tub Time Machine When you're going back to the 80s... And you might be fuckin some ladies... You bring your button fly jeans and some sweet hair gel Want blow? All you gotta do is yell (Yeah you're) lookin real smooth, (and you're) lookin real mean When you're soakin in your Hot Tub Time Machine Yeah! Hot Tub - Time Machine! Hot Tub - Time Machine! C'mon! (Sweet guitar solo - 16 measures] Relaxed as hell when you're goin through time That's the 54 jets workin' on your spine (Yeah) you gotta be loose and you gotta be lean When you roll up in your Hot Tub Time Machine Yeah your shirt's a little psychedelic... And you're lookin kinda like Tom Selleck... Yeah the chicks are wetter than the Everglades But double bag your dude, don't wanna get AIDS Just listen right up, consider me your dean In the college of the Hot Tub Time Machine Yeah! Hot Tub - Time Machine! Hot Tub - Time Machine! Yeah! 
FADE IN: 
EXT. POOL DECK - DAY 
BLUE SKIES. A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY. CAMERA PANS DOWN to reveal A HOT TUB FULL OF HOT CHICKS IN BIKINIS. They splash about playfully. Then-- 
A FUCKING LION JUMPS IN THE HOT TUB! As the girls SCREAM and scramble for safety, the BEAST ROARS and it becomes the: 
MGM LOGO 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
ADAM COLEMAN (late 30s, good-looking, sweet-natured face) is in a great mood as he packs a SUITCASE. 
LILY (O.S.) Ready for the wildest bachelor party of all time? LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy sense) walks in the room, smiling. 
ADAM You know it. I'm gonna bang all sorts of chicks this weekend! 
LILY That's not the answer I was looking for. 
ADAM Sorry, honey. Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss. She shows him some PHOTOS. 
LILY Look what I found... 
ANGLE: PHOTO A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun ever. 
ADAM Check out that young stud. Can you believe he's about to get married? Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17) partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS: -- In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain... -- Eating PIZZA at "Papa Enzo's," stuffing their faces... -- Drinking BEERS at the "Brew Haus," an awesome pub... -- In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS... Adam snatches the last photo from her. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Ignore that one. Nothing happened. 
(BEAT) I love you. Lily laughs. 
LILY Adam, you didn't know me yet. As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES. 
LILY (CONT'D) Who's this? Lily shows Adam a PHOTO: -- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers). 
ADAM I'm not sure. 
LILY Really? Lily shows Adam another PHOTO: -- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks like she was ambushed for the photo. 
ADAM Oh! Jennie. 
LILY Who's Jennie? 
ADAM She's nobody. Ski instructor. (off her look) You didn't know me yet. Lily still looks at him a little hard. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and a face. Of course I'm gonna take her picture. Lily still looks a little bothered. 
LILY Do you still think of her? 
ADAM Of course not! I think of you. As Adam goes to EMBRACE her: 
LILY Hold on... Lily goes into the CLOSET. 
ADAM She's got a hell of an attorney. 
LOU Yes and thank you so very much for giving her the referral. 
ADAM She told me it was for a friend. 
NICK So... what? Your wife likes black dick now? 
LOU I'm gonna slaughter you in your sleep tonight. 
ADAM (turns to Lou, genuine) Thanks for coming, man. 
EXT. UPSCALE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Nick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking YOUNG GUY in his 20s (JACOB) comes out, carrying a MESSENGER BAG. 
INT. NICK'S CAR -- SAME TIME 
The guys watch Jacob carefully cross the street. 
LOU Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming? Boo! Drive away before he gets in the car! 
ADAM Be nice. I know Jacob's kind of a douche, but I'm trying to be closer to him since Mom died. Jacob gets in the back next to Lou. 
LOU 
(VERY INSINCERE) Hey buddy! How's it going? Good to see you! 
JACOB You look dirty and you smell bad. 
LOU You look gay and you smell like a basket of fancy soaps. Advantage me. 
JACOB How is that to your advantage? 
ADAM He's not gay. He's just... what are you again? 
JACOB Metrosexual. 
LOU You have sex with trains? 
JACOB For your information, I fuck chicks. Hot ones. 
LOU For your information, you fuck dudes. Gay ones. 
JACOB Yeah, well at least I'm young and my life's full of potential. I hear you're homeless now? 
LOU (to Nick and Adam) You told him?! 
(GRIMACES) I hate all you people. 
ADAM Will you two please shake hands and make up? We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone. 
JACOB Yeah, about that. Why aren't we going to Aspen? Vermont's lame. 
ADAM It's gonna be fun. 
JACOB Yeah, whatever. And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments, the lifeblood drained from the car. Finally... 
LOU I've gotta take a shit. 
INT. BURGER KING REST STOP - DAY 
Lou walks from the bathroom back to the TABLE where Adam, Nick, and Jacob sit and eat. 
LOU That was an ugly experience. 
LOU Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of my life - not fucking a whore at my bachelor party. 
NICK That's the biggest mistake of your life? 
LOU Fuck yeah. And he's not making that same mistake. 
ADAM Uh... I'm not having sex with anyone this weekend. Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out. 
LOU Ohhhh. I gotcha. 
(WINKING) You're not having sex this weekend. 
ADAM I'm not having sex this weekend. Without the winking. 
LOU 
(WINKING) Right. No winking. 
(WINKS AGAIN) I understand. 
ADAM I'm pretty sure you don't. 
INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING 
Nick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to the WOODS, as we track the drive. Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign. 
NICK Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst. 
ADAM Yes! 
EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON 
The car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare, with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos. 
INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - AFTERNOON - DRIVING 
The guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions. 
JACOB so this is the coolest town ever? 
ADAM Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF Chang's. Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah Montana 3-D Experience!" He looks utterly disgusted. 
LOU I don't even have the heart to tell you what I just fucking saw. But say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This town sucks. 
NICK What the fuck is going on? The car climbs a twisty part of the road. 
NICK (CONT'D) Please god let it still be there... 
JACOB What? 
ADAM Pink Paradise. Best strip club ever. The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The beginning reads "Pink." 
NICK Yes! It lives! The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into view: "Pinkberry." 
LOU I wanna die. 
JACOB 
(OBLIVIOUS) Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here. 
EXT. PINE VALLEY INN - AFTERNOON 
The car pulls into the parking lot of this RUNDOWN lodge. 
INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - AFTERNOON 
EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON 
On a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets, underwater lighting. It's amazing. Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized. 
LOU Thank. God. 
ADAM At least some things never change. 
JACOB What's the big deal about a hot tub? 
ADAM Shame on you. 
NICK There's plenty of time for tubbin'. Let's ski. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN - AFTERNOON 
At the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look ridiculous in TIGHT, RETRO-STYLE NEON SKI JUMPSUITS. Jacob, on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire. 
JACOB (re: their outfits) When's the last time you guys actually went skiing? 
ADAM It's been a few years. 
NICK I think we look good. 
JACOB Then you're an idiot. 
NICK All right, we race down the mountain. Loser buys first round. Premium shit only. 
JACOB You gonna be all right? 
NICK What does that mean? 
JACOB I dunno - do black dudes ski? 
NICK Of course black dudes ski. Aren't I wearing skis? 
JACOB I'm just not sure you're representative. 
NICK You're calling me an Uncle Tom? 
JACOB I don't even know what that means. 
NICK It means black dudes ski. (pulls down goggles) Catch ya at the bottom. Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a GRASSY PATCH and falls over. 
LOU Black dudes don't ski. 
ADAM 
(MOCK YELLING) How's the bottom? 
CUT TO: 
ADAM HITS A BAD PATCH AND FALLS DOWN. 
CUT TO: 
JACOB AND LOU COLLIDE, BOTH TRYING TO AVOID A BARE PATCH. 
CUT TO: 
NICK PICKS UP SPEED, BEFORE HITTING A BARE PATCH AND FALLING. 
A LITTLE OLD LADY SLOWLY SKIS PAST HIM, KICKING UP POWDER. 
EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - NIGHT 
LOU Quiet, men are talking. Aiden approaches. 
AIDEN Get you guys some to-go boxes? 
LOU I would like you to die. And then I would like you to leave. Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys. 
LOU (CONT'D) It's tub time. 
EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - NIGHT 
Lou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE. Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all. Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN. 
LOU Oh my god. The water is perfect. 
He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK. Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink. 
JACOB I really don't see the appeal. It's like a glorified bath. 
NICK Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the whole thing! You ski all day. Then you hit the town, get trashed, and lure some fine ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin'. Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back. 
NICK (CONT'D) So the town's dead? Fine, we skip that part and go right to the tub. Trust me. If there's fun to be had, the tub is a good start. Nick gets in. 
NICK (CONT'D) Yes! It's amazing. Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three guys are already starting to look more energized and happy, splashing around. After another beat of consideration... 
JACOB Fuck it. Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually starts to loosen up a bit and smiles. 
LOU Well? 
JACOB I'm not convinced this is anything more than a bath, but it's nice. 
NICK Hit him with some bubbles. 
ADAM Coming right up. Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's "I Like to Move It." 
-- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various combinations of VODKA, RED BULL, MOUNTAIN DEW, BACARDI, and anything else they can get their hands on. -- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know. -- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him. -- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures. More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water. -- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS. -- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way. -- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another empty Red Bull his the patio. -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it. -- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub. -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3 BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back. -- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD. -- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More Bacardi... The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in a BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT, we 
EXPLODE TO: 
THE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS. 
EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - DAWN 
As the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub, the water calm. A KITTEN licks Lou's face. It's adorable. Until... 
Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING! This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the carnage, mostly hangover-related. 
NICK Oh my god, I wanna die. 
JACOB I need a vitamin water. Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices. 
ADAM Red Bull or Fresca? Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS. 
LOU That fucking bear got me good. 
ADAM Yeah he did. 
LOU But we showed him, didn't we? 
ADAM If by showing him, you mean we laughed and he got bored and wandered off into the woods with your sneakers, then yeah, we got him good. 
LOU Fuck yeah. Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE. 
ADAM You just puked. 
LOU That's why I'm eating your sandwich. I'm fucking starving. 
ADAM Spazzes? 
DUDE IN SUNGLASSES 
(VERY ANGRY) Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You Miami Vice? Which one's Crockett? Which one's CROCKETT?! 
ADAM I'm Crockett, obviously! 
(TO NICK) That's the Don Johnson one, right? The dude flips out a SWITCHBLADE. 
DUDE IN SUNGLASSES You show me you're not spazzes. 
NICK We're not spazzes. The dude extends the coke once more. 
DUDE IN SUNGLASSES Show me. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - MOMENTS LATER 
At the top of the mountain, Nick looks WIDE AWAKE. Adam, on the other hand, looks COKED OUT OF HIS SKULL. He sniffs, fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally "up." 
NICK Adam, you gotta chill. You just did one line. 
ADAM I've never ridden the horse before. 
NICK You're not riding the horse. The horse is heroin. Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting. 
ADAM I don't know what kind of animal I'm riding, but it's the best animal of all time. I feel great! Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE. 
NICK Adam! Jesus. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN / SKI TRAIL - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Adam TUCKS down, still CLENCHING HIS TEETH. He PICKS UP SPEED as he flies down the mountain like a racer. 
FURTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety. 
ON ADAM He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before -- 
HE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK! The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent. Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs. 
ADAM What a rush! He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Oh wow, are you OK? 
SMOKING HOT CHICK No thanks to you, asshole! 
IN SLOW MOTION -- The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the sunlight. As she turns to face Adam, NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is: 
ADAM 
(MIND BLOWN) Jennie O'Keefe! Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him. 
JENNIE Do I know you? He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still looks loopy from the coke. Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM. 
BLAINE I'm gonna serve you a knuckle sandwich, airhead. 
(TO JENNIE) You all right, babe? 
JENNIE I think so. 
Blaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine ANGRILY RIPS Adam's lift ticket from his jacket. 
BLAINE Your lift ticket's been revoked. Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends. 
ADAM (a la Lethal Weapon 2) Diplomatic immunity. Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too. 
LOU (with genuine emotion) We're in 1971. 
ADAM 
(CORRECTING HIM) We're in 1987. Everyone looks stunned and dazed. 
JACOB What are we gonna do? I have plans next weekend. 
ADAM We all have plans. It's my fucking wedding! 
NICK Now hold on, we don't know for sure that we're in 1987. The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64 computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you..." 
When it's over... 
NICK (CONT'D) OK, we're in 1987. Adam stands up, completely losing it. 
ADAM What the FUCK is going on?! Nick stands up and calmly takes charge. 
NICK Everyone relax. I think I know what's happened. And when we're done discussing it, we're all gonna feel a lot better. Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer. 
NICK (CONT'D) Two words: black hole. He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly going to gel for everyone. But the guys look confused. 
NICK (CONT'D) I saw a special on the Science Channel. And guess what? Sometimes this happens. 
ADAM This happens? 
NICK Yes. And the best thing for us to do is to stay put. The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch. Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness. 
ADAM This is a big glitch. 
JACOB Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes are in space. Not at a ski resort. 
LOU 
(HOPEFUL) So does this mean we get to go to girls' locker rooms and see them naked and they can't see us? 
JACOB No, we traveled through time. We're not invisible. Lou looks upset. 
LOU (under his breath) I'm still gonna do it. 
ADAM Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment-- 
NICK Black hole. 
ADAM How are we supposed to get back? For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then: 
LOU We find a scientist. 
CUT TO: 
INT. IBM / RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON 
Our guys WAIT NERVOUSLY near a RECEPTION DESK, above which is the "IBM" logo. Lou reads a MAGAZINE. 
LOU This Dukakis guy seems like he might be the real deal. An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches. 
MAN IN SUIT Gentlemen, how may I help you? 
NICK We're waiting for a scientist. 
MAN IN SUIT I am a scientist. 
LOU Where's your white coat? 
SCIENTIST I'm not that kind of scientist. 
JACOB (CONT'D) This is gonna be a problem. He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH. 
JACOB (CONT'D) Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards aren't gonna work and our new money looks fake. The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something: 
A TABLE FULL OF JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN. 
NICK I've got an idea. As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks around the room and by the bar, he spots -- 
Jennie. He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice. 
ADAM I still can't believe it's really her! 
LOU She's aged remarkably well. 
(REMEMBERS) Oh, right. Why don't you just go talk to her? 
ADAM I should go talk to her. To apologize, of course. You know, nothing inappropriate. 
LOU Sure... Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room. Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him, as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy. 
JENNIE 
(TO ADAM) Listen putz, if you're gonna try to attack me again, my boyfriend will be here soon. He'll kick your ass. Adam tries to be casual. 
ADAM No, no. No ass kicking. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about earlier. I lost control of the old skis there. 
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Looks like I shoulda taken another one of your classes! 
JENNIE When did you take my class? 
ADAM Certainly not when I was a kid! I mean, that would make no sense! Adam tries to recover. 
ADAM (CONT'D) I was here for a convention. Power tools. And regular tools. All sorts of tools. I'm big into tools. It was a couple years ago. Jennie looks very suspect of Adam. 
JENNIE Yeah, OK. Have a good night. Jennie starts to walk away with her friends. 
ADAM 
(TOO FRIENDLY) Hey, where ya going? She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind. 
JENNIE'S FRIEND (quietly, to Adam) Are you with that guy over there? She discretely points out Jacob. 
ADAM Yeah, he's my brother. She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it. 
JENNIE'S FRIEND There's a party later tonight at this address. Make sure he comes with you. He's way boss! Adam walks back to his friends. 
JACOB How'd it go? He shows them his palm. 
ADAM We got invited to a party later. 
LOU sweet! What are we gonna do until then? 
ADAM How about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day? Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH. 
NICK Bam! 
LOU We're millionaires! 
NICK Close. It's a thousand bucks. 
ADAM Where did you get that money? Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen. 
NICK 
(PROUDLY) Sold them my iPod. Jacob looks incredulous. 
Adam and Nick watch the car pull out of the parking lot. 
ADAM 
(SOBERING SLIGHTLY) This will not end well. 
INT./EXT. DELOREAN - SAME TIME 
Jacob and Lou hit the road, picking up speed. They pass a COP, who pulls out, turning on his LIGHTS AND SIREN. 
LOU Oh shit, they found me! I don't know how but they found me! 
(LAUGHS) I always wanted to say that. Punch it! Jacob HITS THE GAS. 
LOU (CONT'D) Let's see the look on this pig's face when we hit 88 and disappear into thin air! Yeah! The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80, 85, and then 90. And then 95. The car SHAKES VIOLENTLY. 
LOU (CONT'D) 
(SURPRISED) This thing's a piece of shit. Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY. 
JACOB Hey Lou? 
LOU Yeah? 
JACOB 
(VERY CALM) We're doing a hundred. I can't control this car. 
LOU 
(NODS) I hear ya. 
EXT. ROAD - EARLY EVENING 
The Delorean BRAKES, but doesn't make the turn. It FLIPS OVER in a fantastic disaster and comes to a stop in a DITCH. The COP pulls over, gets out of his car, and DRAWS HIS GUN. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING 
Adam and Nick watch the accident from a distance. 
ADAM So do you think we should run away? 
INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Looking ragged as hell, the four guys walk into the room and silently collapse on various BEDS and COUCHES. 
LOU I wonder if we'll still be here for our court appearance. 
ADAM If we're still here in four months, I will happily go to jail, because I'll be fucked anyway. A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He looks startled. 
TOWEL GUY Who the hell are you dweebs?! Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD and PUMMELS HIM on the floor! The others pull him off. 
NICK Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?! 
LOU I have no tolerance for intruders. 
NICK This is probably his room! We're not registered here in 87. Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry. 
LOU I'm still pretty OK with it. 
ADAM You have a problem. 
LOU Just help me put him outside. 
INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
JENNIE I know. You don't look like you could handle power tools. 
ADAM The truth is, Jennie, I've always liked you. But I've never really known you. I really wasn't supposed to meet you again. 
JENNIE Who are you?! Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her. 
ADAM I came here from the future. She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners. 
JENNIE Let me guess. You want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two? Or maybe you're wondering if these are astronaut pants? 
ADAM Astronaut pants? 
JENNIE Because my ass is out of this world? Give me a break, spaz. I've heard them all. She turns away. Adam goes after her. 
ADAM No! No spaceship. No astronaut pants. Just regular time travel. With normal pants. 
JENNIE OK, what's the punch line? An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine. 
BLAINE I thought I told you to stay off my mountain, partner! 
JENNIE Blaine, stop! 
BLAINE You talking to my girl? Huh? I can't hear you. Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder. 
JENNIE Blaine, that's enough! Let him go! He can't breathe! Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole. 
BLAINE Can't breathe? Is that right? Can you breathe, partner? What's that? I can't hear you. Just tell me you can't breathe and I'll stop. Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs. 
BLAINE (CONT'D) He's not saying anything. I guess he can breathe. Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam. 
BLAINE (CONT'D) Babe, stop. Jennie, stop! Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her. 
BLAINE (CONT'D) Baby, I'm sorry. (turns to Adam) See what you made me do?! 
JENNIE Screw you, Blaine! Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along with her, as she storms away. 
JENNIE (CONT'D) 
(TO ADAM) Come on, let's go! Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie leave with Adam. 
LOU (V.0.) Sandy, I don't know what you did with this wine, but it is delightful. 
INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 
Jacob and Lou sit with Michelle and Sandy back at the girls' apartment. The whole place looks like a Madonna concert. 
Jacob looks uncomfortable, but Lou pours on the polite charm. 
SANDY It's from a box. There's lots! 
LOU Mmm. Fantastic. 
(QUICK TURN) Do you mind if I borrow my friend? We'll only be a moment. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Lou has Jacob PINNED AGAINST THE WALL with his arm. He speaks quietly, but with purpose. 
LOU You're gonna fuck her! 
JACOB I'm not gonna have sex with her. She killed a guy! 
LOU That guy was undesirable. You heard her. It was about the money. 
LOU 
(CALMLY) Adam. I know I don't look like I understand, but I do. You have a beautiful fiancee who means more to you than anything in the world. And if you could, you'd literally travel across time for her. 
ADAM Yes. 
LOU I get it, man. Life is about these moments. Moments where a regular Joe becomes a hero. Moments where you dig deep and find the motivation... the courage... the guts to do what's right and what's necessary. It's moments like these... Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub. 
LOU (CONT'D) Jesus, how come nobody told me there was coke out here? Lou SNORTS A BIG LINE. 
LOU (CONT'D) What was I saying? Adam and Nick get out and towel off. Lou follows. 
ADAM Maybe we have to learn something? 
NICK What do you mean? 
ADAM You know, like Groundhog Day. We have to learn the meaning of life or some shit. Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE on the base of the tub JUMPS in the hot tub and VANISHES IN A BRIGHT LIGHT! For a moment, everyone is quiet. 
LOU 
(FREAKED OUT) I've gotta stop doing cocaine and I need to go to the hospital. I just saw a fucking kitten explode. 
NICK I saw it too. The guys run over to the tub. The bubbles are on low, but there's NOTHING IN IT. 
ADAM It didn't explode. It vanished. It went back... to the present. 
LOU This is the present. 
ADAM Our old present. 
NICK So it is the tub! Lou POINTS at something. 
LOU Um... The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it's clearly running. 
ADAM OK. You guys know what to do. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MINUTES LATER 
The guys have a COUPLE BOXES OF KITTENS. One at a time, they get in the tub and take turns DIPPING THE KITTENS. When nothing happens, Lou DUMPS an entire box of kittens into the tub. The cats get ANGRY and CLAW AT HIS FACE and body. Eventually, the guys just shake their heads. 
ADAM This isn't working. 
LOU Maybe these aren't the right kittens? Adam points at him in a "now you're thinking" way. 
ADAM We'll split up. Get as many different cats as you can. Let's all meet back here in an hour. 
LOU You can count on me! 
INT. BREW HAUS - DAY 
Lou sits on a stool, munching on snacks. A TV shows the AFC conference championship game between the Denver Broncos and the Cleveland Browns. It's the 4th Quarter and the Browns score with 5:43 remaining on the clock to go up by 7. Two stools over, a SLICK-HAIRED ASSHOLE (RICK) sits with his bored-looking HIGH SOCIETY TROPHY WIFE (CANDACE). 
RICK Yes! 
LOU Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are gonna lose by 3 in overtime. 
RICK Eat shit and die, scumbag. I've got ten large on this game. 
LOU Not only that, but I bet you Elway's gonna throw a touchdown with 37 seconds left. 
RICK Fat chance, pal. Elway's done nothing all day. 
LOU Care to make it interesting? 
JACOB Thanks. I like you guys, too. A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad and Chaz. He drops off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY (pronounced JOFF-rey). 
GEOFFREY Gentlemen. 
TAD Geoffrey, please meet Jacob. Excuse his Jewish name. He really quite exceeds it. Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand. 
GEOFFREY Jacob, would you like some too? He offers a pill bottle. 
JACOB What is it? 
CHAZ Rohypnol. Geoffrey's father is a pharmacist, but we don't hold that against him. 
JACOB Rohypnol? 
TAD You slip it to a chick who won't go to third. Give it an hour and you'll be rounding home. 
JACOB 
(SURPRISED) This is a date rape drug. 
GEOFFREY 
(LAUGHS) What the fuck is date rape? 
JACOB These are roofies! 
CHAZ Roofies... I like that! 
TAD Yeah, it takes the clinical name right out of it. It sounds so fresh, chicks might even take it voluntarily! 
(TO JACOB) Hey, can we use that? Jacob looks beside himself. 
EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON 
A GUY and a GIRL are using the hot tub, which is still hot and bubbly, despite the fact that it isn't plugged in. Nick and Lou sit at the table, as Adam approaches with CATS. 
ADAM I got regular cats. I figured maybe the kitten was a fluke. Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down. 
NICK Come here. He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something. 
LOU There! 
ADAM What am I looking at? It's some kind of stain. 
LOU Smell it. 
ADAM I'm not smelling it. 
LOU 
(NODS ENCOURAGINGLY) Smell the stain. Adam puts his nose up against the stain and SNIFFS. He recognizes something, but can't put his finger on it. 
ADAM What is that? 
NICK Red Bull. 
GUY IN TUB Hey, you fellas mind? I'm trying to get a handjob here. 
INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON 
Our guys sit and absorb the impact of what they've learned. 
ADAM So you're telling me that Red Bull plus hot tub equals time travel? 
LOU 
JENNIE Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's your funeral. He's in the warehouse at the end of Lawrence. Good luck. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY 
Adam walks off the mountain with Nick and Lou. 
LOU Moment of truth. Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair. 
LOU (CONT'D) 
(LOOKS BACK) That fucker! Just then, Lou's NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result of being broken and never fixed. It stays this wa for the rest of the movie. Lou touches his nose. 
LOU (CONT'D) Oh, that's just great. Jacob runs up, in a friendlier disposition. 
JACOB Hey guys! 
ADAM I thought you were with douche patrol. 
JACOB Yeah I was. But it turned out those guys are date rapists. 
ADAM Ah. 
NICK Adam, where are we going? Adam gets a look of determination again. 
ADAM To get my bag. We get that, we have the Red Bull, and our ticket home. 
LOU Yes! The race is on! 
ADAM What race? 
LOU Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski resort? 
(SHAKES HEAD) Disputes like these are settled with a downhill ski race. Usually at dawn. It's the law. 
ADAM You're an idiot. 
INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Adam and the guys step into a warehouse. WET FLOOR, CHAINS hanging from the ceiling for no reason, STEAM rising from grates. As they enter, Chaz pulls down a large GARAGE DOOR. Up ahead, Blaine sits on some CRATES with Tad. 
BLAINE Welcome to my lair. 
ADAM You live here? 
NICK Yeah, this is kind of a shitty place to live. 
BLAINE I don't live here. Adam approaches Blaine, trying to speak maturely. 
ADAM Look. Blaine. I think we got off on the wrong foot. You have some issue with me. 
BLAINE You get blown by my girl? I'll say that's one hell of an issue. 
LOU Whoa! You got blown?! 
ADAM She didn't blow me. She lied to you to make you jealous. I'm not trying to steal Jennie. I just wanna get my bag. 
BLAINE Oh, your bag. I was wondering when you'd come around for that. Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates. 
ADAM Yeah, I'll just take it and get out of your way. 
BLAINE You will? Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND. 
ADAM Whattya say? Can we work this out like gentlemen? Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES. 
NICK What is this town's obsession with knives? 
ADAM Friends? Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet. 
JACOB Brothers. They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted. 
LOU Gay. Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his game face. 
ADAM I didn't think you guys would show. 
BLAINE This was my idea. 
ADAM It's gonna make my victory taste all the more sweeter. Like a Peach Snapple. 
BLAINE A what? 
ADAM You'll see. Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up. Adam is on a SNOWBOARD. 
BLAINE What's that? 
ADAM You're not afraid of getting beat by a guy on a skateboard, are you? 
BLAINE I've seen you in action. You're reckless and terrible. 
ADAM Reckless and terrible's my middle name. Because I feel the need... (pulls on goggles) for speed! Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Catch ya at the bottom. 
CHAZ 
3, 2, 1... GO! Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob, who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up speed, starting at about one mile per hour. Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna coast to victory. 
ADAM Here goes nothing. Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE, despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course. He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING! Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam. Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force. 
BLAINE You can't beat me! I was born on this mountain! 
ADAM I was born in a hospital like a normal baby! Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up. Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND. 
The SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN / BASE - DAY 
Phil stands against a SHED, as a GUY THROWS A HATCHET at him, just narrowly missing his arm. Phil FLEXES HIS MUSCLES, as a 
HOT CHICK KISSES HIM. Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL'S ARM, sending BLOOD SPLATTER EVERYWHERE! 
PHIL Ahhhh! My arm!!! 
EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY - SAME TIME 
Lou watches with BINOCULARS and PUMPS HIS FIST. 
LOU Yes! 
EXT. MOUNTAIN - RACE - DAY 
As Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he has the victory in the bag. But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain. With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch Adam. It's gonna be close. At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race. Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop. 
CUT TO: 
A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS! 
INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A large "BON VOYAGE" BANNER hangs in the room. 
Lily waits by the bathroom door with some PEPTO and a GLASS OF WATER. She looks very concerned. 
ADAM (V.0.) Lily had every opportunity to leave. She didn't know me at all and she certainly didn't owe me anything after the night I put her through. But she stayed. 
INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Adam lays on the couch, his head in Lily's lap. She feeds him a little GATORADE. He keeps it down... for a moment. Then he turns and VOMITS into a BUCKET on the floor. 
ADAM (V.0.) She saw me at my worst and she stayed. Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it. 
BACK TO: 
INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY 
Nick, Lou, and Jacob look sick. 
ADAM Don't you see? This is more than a sandwich. It represents all that shit. All that puke. 
LOU Keep the sandwich. 
JACOB This is disgusting. 
ADAM She gave me this as a reminder of her love. 
(THINKS) Or to give me horrible diarrhea so I didn't leave the room during the bachelor party. But mostly as a reminder of her love. Adam holds up the sandwich. 
ADAM (CONT'D) This is the reason I need to go home. Adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich. 
ADAM (CONT'D) I'm gonna go prep the tub. Lou holds up a BAG OF CHIPS. 
LOU Do you have any stories about these chips or can I eat them? 
EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - CONTINUOUS 
Adam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds Jennie waiting in the TUB. 
JENNIE There you are! 
ADAM Jennie! What are you doing here? 
JENNIE Making good on a rumor. Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS. Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked. 
ADAM Whoa. 
Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself. 
JENNIE When I saw you win that race against Blaine, everything changed for me. I realize now that I deserve more. I deserve a winner. 
(SEDUCTIVE) Come and get your prize. Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE. 
ADAM Yeah, I... can't. She covers up, embarrassed. 
JENNIE Oh my god. I missed my opportunity. 
ADAM No, I'm not sure there ever was an opportunity. Jennie, you're terrific. You've brought me so many moments of joy, you'll never know. But I shouldn't have given you the wrong idea. Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks. 
ADAM (CONT'D) The truth is there's a girl I need to go see. We have plans to spend the rest of our lives together. And I can't wait any longer. (listening to himself) And I'm totally cool with it. Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her. 
ADAM (CONT'D) One day, you're going to find the right guy who's willing to give up everything and travel across time and space for your love. She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her. 
JENNIE 
(EMOTIONAL) I would totally blow you right now. 
ADAM I know you would. 
LOU I don't hate you as much as I used to. 
JACOB (a little emotional) I hate you a little less also. Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY. 
ADAM OK, whenever you're ready, Lou. 
LOU One small step for man! One giant asshole puking in a hot tub! Here goes nothing! Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE... TWO... THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else. 
NICK OK, well maybe if we-- A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down, we see Adam, Nick, Jacob (and the floating puke) in the hot tub where we left them. Only Lou is missing. 
ADAM What happened? Did it work? 
NICK I didn't feel anything. 
JACOB 
(DISAPPOINTED) Guys, look. They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds ago. 
NICK Dammit. Even the deck furniture's the same. We fucking blew it. It didn't work. 
ADAM Where's Lou? 
LOU (O.S.) Right on schedule! Lou walks toward them, but there's a lot that's "off" about him, including HAIR PLUGS, JEWELRY, and a SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC SURGERY (including a fixed NOSE) that makes him look at once older and younger. 
NICK Ahhh! 
LOU Oh, the face, eh? I was curious how you'd react. 
(DISAPPOINTED) Didn't think you'd be scared. 
ADAM Lou? 
LOU You're damn right it's me. 
ADAM What happened? 
LOU You just traveled 23 years in three seconds. Took me 23 years. It's good to see you guys! 
JACOB We're back? It all looks the same. 
LOU It better! You know how much I pay the groundspeople around here? A lot. But that's all right, I'm fucking loaded. Look at all this. Everyone looks confused. 
ADAM Will you fill in some of the blanks for me, please? 
LOU I'll give you the short version, because time is of the essence. First of all, to settle an old bet, time most definitely has been moving forward. It is exactly three days since you've arrived here in beautiful Havenhurst. Jacob looks at Nick. 
JACOB Told you. 
LOU Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I own most of V ermont. (MORE) 
LOU (CONT'D) I've been reimagining the state as my own personal playground. You could say I'm a little bit like Michael Jackson, except I don't fuck kids. Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou. 
LOU (CONT'D) I do fuck them, though. Haven't gone above 24 years old in 10 years and even then, it was a mistake. 
(REMEMBERING) A horrible mistake. 
ADAM Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it? 
LOU Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2 hours to get to New Jersey in time for your rehearsal dinner. 
ADAM 
(DISAPPOINTED) Great, I blew it. 
LOU Not even a little bit. I have a helicopter waiting in the parking lot and a private jet on my airfield five minutes away. The guys look stunned. 
ADAM I don't wanna hear any more! They sit in horrified silence for a bit. 
LOU You'll have to introduce me when we get there. Your families won't know me. Although I'm sure they're huge fans. 
(ABRUPT) So hey, getting married, huh? Taking the plunge! Adam looks disturbed. Nick looks confused. 
NICK This makes no sense at all. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Lily looks beautiful, surrounded by FAMILY and FRIENDS. Still, she looks distant and lonely. Until -- A LILY (the flower) comes into frame. Lily smiles and stands up. She turns around. Adam's standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers. Lily gives him a BIG HUG AND KISS. When she's done: 
LILY Don't you ever let me take your phone again! 
ADAM 
(COY) I'm here on time. Just like I promised. Nick sits down next to COURTNEY and Jacob takes his seat. 
ADAM (CONT'D) (no nerves at all) I'm so happy to see you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. 
LILY 
(TEARFUL) Me too! 
ADAM You're the one. Lily notices Adam's on CRUTCHES. 
LILY Oh my god, what happened? 
LOU (O.S.) My fault entirely, madam! The room is ABUZZ with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL ENTRANCE, wearing a WHITE TUXEDO. 
GUY AT TABLE Hey, it's Lou Blustein! The whole room APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the guys can't believe it. 
LOU I was partaking in a little ski adventure and I mistakenly wandered into your fiance's path. His broken leg is my broken heart. My most humble apologies. Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She looks genuinely flattered. Lou gets up and whispers to Adam. 
LOU (CONT'D) See? I'm awesome here. You shoulda stayed out of that tub. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER 
Nick SLOW DANCES with Courtney. 
NICK I was thinking we'd invite Adam and Lily over for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon. That's... if it's OK with you? 
COURTNEY Why wouldn't it be OK with me? That sounds nice. 
(SMILES) 
(MORE) 
COURTNEY (CONT'D) You look so good in this shirt, by the way. Nice choice. She puts her head on Nick's shoulder as they dance. 
NICK So... how are your parents? 
COURTNEY Still working hard. I really wish they could retire already, but it's tough competing with the big chains. I mean, they just have the one store... 
FLASHBACK TO: 
EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - 1987 - DAY 
The Japanese Businessman is on a PAY PHONE, speaking RAPIDLY in Japanese. 
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN 
(IN JAPANESE) Hiro-san! Cancel the paperwork! We have to get back to Tokyo. I have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal. Nick stands next to him, nodding and SMILING WIDELY.

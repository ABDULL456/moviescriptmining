Men In Black 
by Ed Solomon 
EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT 
A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air. 
The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down the road. 
INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT 
The DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers, smearing the remains all over. 
DRIVER Goddamn bugs. 
He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road. 
He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) Deja me hablar. (Let me do the talking.) 
EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT 
The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue four doors with "INS" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window. 
The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs. 
AGENT JANUS Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where you comin' from? 
DRIVER I was fishing in Cuernavaca. 
AGENT JANUS Sure you were. What do you say we have a look at your catch? 
AT THE BACK OF THE VAN, 
the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head. 
AGENT JANUS Me, I woulda thrown 'em back. (to the passengers, in Spanish) Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina! (Let's go. Out. Form a line!) 
They pile out of the van. Some are parents with small children. 
AGENT JANUS (CONT'D) What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna need -- 
He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several Agents pull their weapons. 
The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD. 
TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents. 
KAY We'll take it from here. 
AGENT JANUS Who the hell are you? 
Kay and Dee flash some form of ID. 
KAY INS Division 6. 
AGENT JANUS Division 6? I never heard of Division 6. 
KAY Really? 
Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants. 
KAY (CONT'D) What're we thinking, Dee? 
DEE Tough call, Kay. 
He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in Spanish. 
KAY !Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey! (What's up, how are you?) No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los Estados Unidos. (Don't worry grandma. Welcome to the United States.) (next) A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo, no? Buena suerta. (Where are you going? San Antonio?  Looking for work, aren't you?  Good luck.) (next) Es un placer verle aqui. (It's a pleasure seeing you here.) 
One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but: 
KAY (CONT'D) Que dices si te rompo la cara? (What do you say if I break your face?) 
The Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the Guy's shoulder. 
KAY (CONT'D) No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol, verdad, amigo? (You don't speak a word of Spanish, right, friend?) 
Again, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee. 
KAY (CONT'D) We got a winner. (to the others) Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense! (The rest of you are free to go. Scram!) 
KAY Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on you. 
He takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does, Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the stars. 
The other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions. 
KAY Okay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down. If you'll just give me your attention for a moment I'll tell you what happened. 
From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch, figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the device up to "08." 
KAY (CONT'D) This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from some friends from out of town. The red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain. More specifically, the ones for memory. 
Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them. 
KAY (CONT'D) Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80. 
2ND INS AGENT What in the hell is going on?! 
KAY Exactly the right question. And the answer lies right -- here. Pay attention. 
JANUS Who are you, really? 
KAY Really? I'm just a figment of your imagination. 
He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses -- 
-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly. 
KAY (CONT'D) God, we're a gullible breed. 
Behind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the Men in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion. 
KAY (CONT'D) I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that. 
The Agents look around, confused. 
AGENT JANUS What -- blast? 
Kay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started. 
KAY Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms. 
He jabs a finger into Janus' chest. 
KAY (CONT'D) Especially you. 
Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him. 
DEE I'm sorry. About...back there. 
KAY Happens. 
DEE Didn't used to. 
He holds up his hands, which tremble with age. 
DEE (CONT'D) The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of me... 
He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead. 
DEE (CONT'D) They're beautiful, aren't they? 
KAY What? 
DEE The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore. (back to Kay) I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase. 
Kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it. 
KAY No. You won't. 
EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT 
A shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN DOWN TO... 
A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME. 
A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up. 
Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt. 
EDWARDS Stop! NYPD! 
He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS, overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air. 
EDWARDS What are you?! 
The Perp looks down. He decides. 
-- and he falls, SCREAMING, to his death. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT 
EDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit across from him. 
INSPECTOR Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes? 
EDWARDS No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then again with another completely different set. 
SERGEANT Sort of a low beam, high beam. 
INSPECTOR Was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces? 
EDWARDS After, sir. 
INSPECTOR And why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events? 
EDWARDS 'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection. And they couldn't keep up, sir. 
SERGEANT Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I am -- 
EDWARDS What do you mean? I am half the man you are. 
SERGEANT What the hell is your problem? 
EDWARDS My problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time. 
SERGEANT I think he threw him off the roof. Ten minutes -- your best shot. 
INSPECTOR (cutting off the Sergeant) Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside. Now. 
EDWARDS You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT 
A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him. 
LAUREL Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I believe you. I opened him up. Find me at the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I found. 
EDWARDS Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
LAUREL (turning at the door) You have really pretty eyes. 
She hurries to turn the corner, but is STOPPED by someone who remains just offscreen. 
VOICE (O.S.) Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office? Working on the John Doe? 
Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel, facing whoever it is in the hallway. 
LAUREL Yes. That's right. 
VOICE (O.S.) Would you look right here, please. 
The Someone says something else and Laurel steps forward, now also out of Edwards's line of vision. 
LAUREL (O.S.) Look where? 
Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding FLASH from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up -- 
-- when KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. Edwards rolls his eyes. 
KAY Some night, huh? 
EDWARDS Oh, yeah, some night. 
He crosses to the door. 
KAY They were gills. 
Edwards stops. 
KAY Not eyelids. 
EDWARDS Who are you? 
KAY Did he say anything to you? 
KAY (O.S.) Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs. 
At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face. 
JEEBS H-hiya Kay, how are you? 
KAY The imports, Jeebs. Now. 
JEEBS You know I got outta that business a long time ago, Kay. 
KAY Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you lie. 
He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead. 
JEEBS Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here... 
KAY I'm going to count to three. 
Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine. 
EDWARDS He'll do it, Jeebs. 
KAY One. 
EDWARDS I've seen him do it. 
KAY Two. 
EDWARDS Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's like this. 
JEEBS He's always crazy. (to Kay) Take a cruise. Get a massage -- 
KAY Three. 
KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor. Edwards is shocked. 
Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head. 
EDWARDS Put down the gun and put your hands on the counter! 
KAY I warned him. 
EDWARDS Drop the weapon! 
KAY You warned him. 
EDWARDS You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. 
KAY Will you relax? 
JEEBS (O.S.) (irritated) Don't do that. 
Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs' baby-soft new cheek. 
JEEBS (CONT'D) Do you know how much that hurts? 
KAY Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up another one. 
Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk -- 
-- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes. 
KAY Edwards? 
Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons. 
EDWARDS Uh, this. This is what I saw. 
Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off. 
KAY You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid. 
JEEBS He looked all right to me. 
KAY A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs. Who was the target? 
JEEBS I don't know. 
Kay raises the weapon again, threatening. 
KAY Jeebs! 
JEEBS I don't know! 
EDGAR (O.S.) You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck! 
-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts. 
EDGAR (O.S.) Stay here! 
The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground. 
EDGAR Figures. 
He walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole. 
IN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights. Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across. 
BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully. 
BEATRICE What is it, Edgar?! 
EDGAR (turns to her) Get your big butt back in that house! 
Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY VOICE comes from deep in the hole. 
VOICE (O.S.) Place projectile weapon on ground. 
Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole. 
EDGAR You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers! 
There is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's. 
VOICE (O.S.) Your proposal is acceptable. 
A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole. 
From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to the truck. 
It's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face, arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom. 
The shotgun flies out and lands beside him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind him. He carries the shotgun. 
She looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank. 
BEATRICE What on earth was it?! 
He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than before. More refined. 
EDGAR Sugar. 
Pause. She looks out the window, at the smoking truck. 
BEATRICE I've never seen sugar do that. 
EDGAR Give me sugar. 
Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar. She holds it out to him. 
EDGAR (CONT'D) In water. 
Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of the sugar into it. 
EDGAR (CONT'D) More. 
She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling. 
Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck. 
BEATRICE Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just hanging off your bones! 
Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He reaches up -- 
-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the skin of his neck back into his shirt collar.  He looks at her. 
EDGAR That better? 
Beatrice faints. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY 
SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room. The SEVEN RECRUITS stand in front of the table. 
There's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each other, at the blank walls... 
EDWARDS Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're doing here? 
MARINE (clipped, unquestioning) Looking for the best of the best of the best. 
EDWARDS (can't help but smile) Well, yeah, I know, but... 
And then .. suddenly -- 
The two far walls pull apart. The whole room pulsates and the air is suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both human and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously. 
The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX SHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is fired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last. 
There's an awkward silence. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards. 
ZED The hell happened? 
EDWARDS Hesitated, sir. 
Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl. 
ZED May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die? 
EDWARDS She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. At the time. 
ZED And how did you come to that conclusion? 
EDWARDS Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's not his head. His head is that butt-ugly bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow, the girl's books were way too advanced for an eight-year-old's. And besides, from where I'm looking, she was the only one who appeared to have a motive. And I don't appreciate your jumping down my throat about it. 
Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs. 
EDWARDS (CONT'D) Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology? 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 
ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision. 
ZED He's got a real problem with authority. 
KAY So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed. On foot. Tenacity. That I can use. 
ZED I hope you know what you're doing. 
Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group. 
Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off. 
ZED (CONT'D) Congratulations, you're everything we've come to expect from years of government training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we have one more test to administer, an eye exam. 
INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway. 
KAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last night. 
EDWARDS You! Hey, what's goin' on? 
The other recruits continue down the hall with Zed. Kay doesn't answer, just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does. 
KAY Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet. 
As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket. 
ZED Now, if you'll look directly at the end of this device. 
He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses. 
Edwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away, just as Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES WHITE. 
INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
As KAY leads EDWARDS down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs. 
He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights. DEE and ZED are there, much younger. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
The next morning. A door opens on a garage and an ORKIN MAN steps inside, carrying a tank of toxic gas. The morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place. 
The Orkin Man sighs and sets down his tank. 
ORKIN MAN Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we? Think we own the place? 
He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank. 
ORKIN MAN (CONT'D) Got a little eviction notice for you, boys. 
He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose. 
VOICE (O.S.) Just what exactly do you think you're doing? 
The Orkin Man turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage, staring at him disdainfully. 
ORKIN MAN (shrugs) Takin' care of your pest problem. 
EDGAR "Pest" problem? "Pest?" 
ORKIN MAN Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation. 
Edgar advances on him, slowly. 
EDGAR You know, I have noticed an infestation here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum. So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives. 
ORKIN MAN Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of 'em? 
EDGAR In the worst way. 
Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Orkin Man's face with one hand -- 
-- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other. 
THE ORKIN MAN'S CAR KEYS drop to the garage floor, and Edgar picks them up. 
EXT. GARAGE - DAY 
A six-by-ten sheet of plywood THUDS to the driveway outside the garage. EDGAR raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the Orkin man's van -- now it's a ramp. 
He walks off and we hear that familiar SCRAPING sound again. Edgar, GRUNTING with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into the back of the Orkin truck. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY 
EDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he first came into yesterday. The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him. 
EDWARDS One thing you gotta know right now. 
Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay. 
INT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY 
Inside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues. 
EDWARDS All right. I'm in because there's some next-level shit going on around here, and I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there are a couple of things we need to get straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize the skills. So as of now you can cease with all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or "sport." Cool? 
KAY Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours, 
The elevator doors -- 
INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
-- slide open on Men in Black headquarters. 
KAY As of this moment, they don't mean much. 
It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers. 
KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place. 
Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien tongues. 
Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor. 
PASSPORT OFFICER Purpose of trip? 
ARQUILLIAN Diplomatic mission. 
Kay hands them back. 
KAY (CONT'D) Your resident card has you restricted to the five boroughs only. Where do you think you're going? 
REDGICK It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look! 
Kay leans down and looks in the window. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast. 
KAY Oh God. How soon? 
Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS in pain. Real soon. For the first time since we've seen him, Kay is nervous. 
KAY (CONT'D) Okay. All right. No big deal. (to Jay) You handle it. 
JAY Me? 
KAY Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch. 
Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried. 
REDGICK Are you sure he knows what he's doing? 
KAY Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time. C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask you something. 
Kay gives Jay a supportive SLAP on the back and leads Redgick away, to the rear of the car. Jay stays in the background and opens the rear door, tentatively. He leans down, into the car. 
JAY Oh God! I see it I see it I see it! 
A few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him. 
KAY Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th. You were headed out of town. 
REDGICK Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone. 
Suddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold. 
JAY Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see that?! 
KAY (still to Redgick) So? Who you meeting? 
REDGICK Well, it's -- a ship. 
KAY Really? I didn't see a departure clearance for today. 
REDGICK You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency. 
Now a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight. He GASPS, choking. 
JAY Guys -- guys -- 
KAY Doin' fine, Ace. (back to Redgick) What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden? 
JAY (choking to death) Help?! HELP! Hello?! 
He starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to pull the baby out. 
REDGICK We just don't like the neighborhood anymore. Some of the -- new arrivals. 
Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes away. 
KAY What new arrivals? This have anything to do with the crasher from last night? 
JAY (Screaming) Can you guys do this later?! 
But in that moment, Jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires leverage, and RIPS the baby free. He falls, flat on his back in the dirt, the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest. 
JAY (CONT'D) Oh -- oh -- oh -- man. 
Kay turns and claps Redgick on the back. 
KAY Congratulations! It's a lizard. 
Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest. 
JAY (misty) Hey, you know, it is sorta -- 
It vomits on him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY 
Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY starts up the car. 
BEATRICE And they said to me, "If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?" And I must admit, I was a little stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him. It was more like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit. 
A little GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay, over by a bookcase, notices a framed PHOTO OF EDGAR, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to skin a deer. 
JAY Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an alien... 
BEATRICE Sorry? 
KAY Go on. 
BEATRICE Anyway, when I came to, he was gone. 
KAY Did he say anything? 
BEATRICE Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I remember. 
KAY Sugar water. 
JAY Did you taste her lemonade? 
Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Takes out another pair, hands them to Jay. 
Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized. Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him. 
KAY Ray Bans. (pulling off Jay's sunglasses) Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus -- 
JAY Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you give her a new one? 
KAY Standard issue neuralyzer. 
JAY And that's the best you can come up with? 
KAY On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. Decide you're better off. 
JAY (butting in) Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked him out, and now that he's gone, you ought to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a decorator or something... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 
KAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts colors.  Red. Then Yellow. 
JAY (from up outside the hole) Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those memory things? 
The spectral analyzer turns blue. 
KAY When you're ready. (re: analyzer) Please -- not green. 
Purple. And then green. 
Kay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt. Above him, JAY leans over, staring down. Kay looks up at him. 
KAY (CONT'D) Do you know what alien life form leaves a green spectral trail? 
JAY Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the question on Final Jeopardy last night. 
AT THE CAR, Kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone. 
KAY (softly, into mic) Zed, we have a bug. 
He turns off the radio and sighs. Jay stands next to him. 
JAY I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess that this is bad. Right? 
KAY Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species. 
JAY So basically you have a racial problem with all insect-based life forms? 
KAY Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than Albert Einstein, four times stronger than an ox, nine times meaner than hell, strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in his brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun? 
JAY What do we do? 
KAY With a bug in town? Watch the morgues. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY 
ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner. 
A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street. 
INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY 
Later, and the Russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with COPS and flashing lights. THREE BODIES, now on stretchers and covered with sheets, are being loaded into the back of ambulances. 
ROSENBERG'S CAT races out of a UNIFORMED COP's arms and leaps onto one of the stretchers, MEOWING mournfully. The Uniformed Cop turns to a POLICE INSPECTOR who is questioning the WOMAN from the diner. 
COP What am I supposed to do with the cat? 
INSPECTOR I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let family claim it. 
The Cop nods and follows the stretcher with Rosenberg's body into the back of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its dead owner for the time being. 
The doors of the wagon SLAM shut. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them. The words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors. 
INT. MORGUE - DAY 
The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body. 
COP Where do you want contestant number three? 
The coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand. 
LAUREL By the wall, I guess. (noticing) What's with the cat? 
COP Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat. Sign here. 
Laurel signs his clipboard. 
LAUREL What's the problem with the cat? 
COP Your problem. 
Laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes over to the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently. 
LAUREL Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up. (of Rosenberg) His is worse. 
She sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights. 
LAUREL (CONT'D) Okey-dokey. Shall we? 
INT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY 
Laurel is hunched over the corpse, the only light in the room coming from the overhead spot that illuminates her work. 
Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her face a mixture of alarm and excitement. 
LAUREL Oh, my God. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
Kay's LTD pulls up in front of the morgue. 
INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end. 
JAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission. 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms. ROSENBERG'S CAT sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws. Suddenly, the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently. 
Laurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her chair. JAY and KAY stand in the doorway, staring at her. Kay steps forward, holding out that black card again. It reforms into another kind of official ID, this time it says "DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH" 
LAUREL (into recorder) ...approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body temperature. Examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum. Which can only be described as...well...as really... 
KAY (O.S.) Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of Public Health. This is Dr. White. 
She looks up. Jay and Kay are standing there. 
LAUREL Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm going to need to see some ID. 
He hands her his CARTE NOIR, which changes to read "Dr. Menville, Department of Public Health." She hands it back. 
LAUREL (checking her watch) You boys must not have much of a home life. 
KAY We watch the morgues very carefully. You've got something unusual? 
As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building. 
INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING 
Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast. The large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION ORION. 
Jay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads for Zed. 
JAY Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around here? 
ZED The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time -- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months -- you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a psychotic episode. 
He points up at the screen with a laser pencil. 
ZED Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky... (pointing) and here's Orion's belt -- 
He indicates the three stars that make up the belt. 
JAY That's what the little guy was talking about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on Orion's belt..." 
ZED There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars. (switches off the laser pointer) You heard wrong. 
JAY You're attracted to me, aren't you? 
Jay starts to cross over to ANOTHER MONITOR, where Kay is sitting alone, tie loosened, slightly disheveled. On the screen, the word "SEARCHING" blinks, encouraging patience. The image changes to a satellite view of North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest. 
On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The printout changes to "SUBJECT ACQUIRED." 
The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we get a good look at a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. SUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind him. 
Jay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it. He looks at Kay's expression, then back at the monitor. 
JAY Pretty lady... 
Kay clicks off the picture of her. Jay drags a chair and sits down. 
JAY (CONT'D) You were the guy with the flowers in the photo, (the night the aliens arrived.) (What, you were on your way to a dance or something and you got lost? And she never got those flowers, did she?] 
Kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight. 
JAY (CONT'D) Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She ever get married? 
KAY No. 
It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen: SUBJECT LOST Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally: 
JAY Well, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have -- 
KAY Try it. 
ZED (O.S.) Kay. 
Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering LIGHT. 
Some lights are starting to go out. 
KAY (quietly, with dread) They're leaving. 
ZED We've had twelve jumps in the last hour. Redgick was just the beginning. 
JAY What do they know that we don't know? 
Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out. 
KAY Why do rats desert the ship? (to the twins) Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view of Manhattan. 
ON THE SCREEN New York City is just a bright spot of light on the Eastern coast of the United States. 
KAY (CONT'D) Four hundred. 
Now there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual. 
KAY (CONT'D) Four thousand. 
Now we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see something that doesn't belong in this picture: 
A BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth. The words "LEVEL FOUR" flash in red letters on one side of the map. 
KAY (CONT'D) That's an Arquillian battle cruiser. 
JAY And we've got a dead Arquillian prince. 
A COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender. 
JAY The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck from the picture! That's him! 
Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar. 
KAY (picking himself up) Damn it. 
Kay runs out after Jay. 
EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
Edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. He jumps behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. The engine ROARS. 
Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into some pedestrians, while his SHOT... 
Hits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it accelerates too quickly. 
Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire. 
JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through the air and CRASHING through the window of a car, his rear end right in the woman driver's face. 
When Jay looks up, Kay is standing before him. He yanks Jay out of the car. 
KAY We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public. 
JAY Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up the world if we don't... 
KAY There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don't know about it. 
Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the store. There's smoking rubble everywhere. 
KAY Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving town. We've got his ship. 
After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone. 
KAY (into phone) Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston. 
INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over, and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right. 
ZED is in his office. 
ZED Containment may be a moot point, my friend. The exodus continues. It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check. 
Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor. 
ZED You sorry little ingrates! 
KAY (O.S.) What about the Arquillians? 
ZED We've only translated a part of the message so far: "Deliver the Galaxy." 
KAY (O.S.) No, they don't want much, do they? 
ZED Oh, it gets better... They're holding us responsible. 
He looks up at the screen. It reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY. 
ZED Another contestant has entered the ring. 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE) 
As Kay puts away his phone, turns to Jay 
KAY All right, kid. The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We need help. A professional. Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics. I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY 
The tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away, fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar. 
EDGAR Where do you keep your dead? 
VENDOR (thinks) I don't have any dead. 
EDGAR Where?! 
VENDOR I don't know, the city morgue! 
Edgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a postcard display marked "LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA." Edgar stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out and picks up a color postcard. 
He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and hurries off. 
LAUREL Boy, when you want attention -- 
She pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light. Laurel turns the name tag to face her. 
CLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD "ORION." 
As it is written across the collar of the cat. 
LAUREL (O.S) "Orion." That's a pretty name. 
From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING. 
Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a CIRCULAR ICON of a strange and beautiful metal. The center is some sort of hardened, translucent material, light green in color. 
LAUREL (CONT'D) What's this? 
She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement. 
INT. ICON - DAY 
It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed of light. 
INT. MORGUE - DAY 
LAUREL Wow. 
Outside, the bell DINGS again. Orion looks up, as if knowing who's out there, and not liking it. She SNARLS at the door and leaps off the desk, scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment. 
INT./EXT. LTD - MANHATTAN - DAY 
Jay and Kay barrel through town. 
JAY So two galaxies have been fighting for years. And the only people who've been benefiting are a race of creatures called bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make peace...and the bugs send this guy down to make sure the fighting never stops. 
KAY By killing the emissaries, and stealing the galaxy they've been fighting about. 
JAY And if we don't get it back before he leaves the planet...we're history. 
KAY We're not even history. 'Cause history implies there's someone around to remember it. 
INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
On a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand BANGS on a bell on a countertop, over and over. The hand belongs to EDGAR, who is carrying his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. The morgue attendant, TONY, emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas Shrugged and a fly swatter. 
TONY Thank you for making sure the bell works. 
Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces. 
TONY (CONT'D) (to Edgar) What's up, Farmer John? 
EDGAR A man came in here earlier. A dead man. 
TONY And this means what to me? 
EDGAR He was a very dear friend of mine. And I believe he had an animal with him. A gift I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me. I would like it back. 
TONY I'll need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with -- 
WHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. Edgar grits his teeth. 
TONY (CONT'D) -- the deceased. 
EDGAR Don't -- do that. 
WHACK! Still another fly goes down. 
TONY Do what? 
Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve. 
TONY (CONT'D) Shit! 
He ducks under the counter -- 
-- and comes up with a can of Raid. Edgar's eyes bug out. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MORGUE - DAY 
Kay's LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out. 
JAY I'll handle this one, you wait outside. 
JAY Now slow down, you don't have to hit the gas like that. 
She leans in and lowers her voice. 
LAUREL You don't understand. You really need to see this. 
JAY And I will. But we gotta get something straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not some kind of macho trip, it's just the way I'm used to doing things, okay? 
INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp SIZZLE. 
Kay furrows his brow. Odd. 
INT. MORGUE - DAY 
Laurel is at the end of her rope. 
LAUREL Look, Stud, I don't know how many more times I'm going to get to tell you this. There's something -- 
She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her. 
LAUREL (CONT'D) -- that you have to help me with. 
Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out.  He starts to reach for his gun. 
INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
Kay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close, a BIG GLOB OF GOO drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the flame. 
Kay looks up, sharply. 
Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand. 
From inside the morgue, Laurel SCREAMS. 
INT. MORGUE - DAY 
Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it. 
Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own. 
KAY Freeze it, Bug! 
JAY Don't shoot! Don't shoot! 
LAUREL (to Jay) CHRIST, are you THICK! 
JAY How was I supposed to know!?! 
LAUREL What did I have to do, SING it for you!?! 
JAY Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken prom date! 
LAUREL Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just -- 
EDGAR Everybody shut UP! 
KAY Let her go, Shit Eater. 
EDGAR Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?! 
KAY You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches to your left and I'll solve all your problems. 
ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth. Edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. The cat squirms in his arm, the icon jangling. Edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat away, across the morgue. The icon comes free, remaining in his hand. 
He drops it into his mouth and swallows. He shoves the gun hard against Laurel's cheek. 
EDGAR That's better. Now put down your weapons. We're leaving. 
Kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. Standoff. 
EDGAR (CONT'D) Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly? 
Edgar cranks one of Laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she CRIES OUT in pain. 
EDGAR (CONT'D) Would you care to see the fly get even? 
KAY How far you think you'll get without your ship? If that's what you call that hunk of space crap we've got back at our office. 
EDGAR Put the weapons down! 
KAY Never gonna happen, Insect. 
JAY WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?! 
ZED Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to respond. 
JAY A galactic standard week? How the hell long is that? 
KAY One hour. 
JAY One hour? 
Viewing the screen, it now reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED... SORRY 
ZED To keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and whatever planet it's on. 
JAY You're talking about US! 
ZED Sucks, doesn't it? 
KAY Pull up the locations of all land-based interstellar vehicles. 
ZED They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the last ship on the planet. 
As Kay and Zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data, Jay walks back towards the center of the room, deep in thought. Over him we hear: 
KAY Atlantic City? 
ZED Gone. 
KAY That landfill on the Jersey Shore? 
ZED Gone. 
JAY Uh, gentlemen. 
KAY Epcot? 
ZED Gone. 
KAY Miami Beach? 
ZED Gone. 
JAY Fellas. 
KAY Hartford? 
ZED Gone, thank God. 
JAY Hey. Old guys. 
Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling. 
JAY (CONT'D) Do those still work? 
They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by -- 
-- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her. 
EDGAR You're coming with me. 
LAUREL What?! Why?! 
EDGAR It's a long trip. I'll need a snack. 
And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships. 
Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the front of the postcard he's been carrying around. "FLUSHING MEADOWS, SITE OF THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR," it says, with a distinctive photograph of the spaceships. 
So that's how he knew. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - NIGHT 
Nighttime now, and the city hums along, just another Thursday night.  The clock in Columbus Circle says it's 7:45. 
EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT 
From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel. We can hear KAY'S VOICE as he goes on. And on. 
KAY Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I should quit. I've tried. Never took, though. I'm beginning to think I lack self-control. 
And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel -- 
INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT 
-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat. 
KAY Well, back to work. 
He flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left. 
EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT 
Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window -- 
-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT 
EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships, pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top. 
LAUREL Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat me. I'm a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even. There are those who worship me, yes. I'm not trying to impress you with this, I'm just letting you know. It could start a war. 
EDGAR Good. War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed, your highness. 
LAUREL You're a wonderful dad. 
And with that she KICKS him squarely in the face. He reels, momentarily losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and FLINGS HERSELF out, into the air. 
Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the air -- 
-- and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground. 
Above, Edgar just keeps climbing. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds. 
AT THE TRUNK, JAY and KAY flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, UNSNAPS a row of latches, and opens it, revealing -- 
-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet. 
Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up the clip. 
JAY You know how to work that? 
Kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence. 
KAY No idea whatsoever. 
He SLAMS the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their columns in the distance. 
KAY (CONT'D) Let's bag us some bug. 
As if on cue, one of the saucers begins to HUM. Then it starts to spin, faster and faster. The ship begins to rise. 
JAY Oh, shit. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT 
Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement. 
EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT 
At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side, the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible. 
But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the ball is headed. 
All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen, his jaw drops -- 
-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall behind him. The crowd BOOS viciously. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
Kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay. 
KAY Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor -- 
Kay starts walking after the Bug. 
KAY Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on that ship. 
JAY Where are you going? 
KAY Getting my gun back. 
JAY What!? 
Kay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug. 
KAY (CONT'D) Hey, Bug! 
The Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder. 
KAY (CONT'D) I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper? 
The Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien hug. 
EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT 
She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the woods. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT 
Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's face. 
KAY You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me! 
The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS, lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth. 
The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS his way down into its abdomen. 
JAY looks on, in stunned horror... 
AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Laurel is still watching.

CLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach, we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY!

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass. 
The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay -- 
-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the grass. 
Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him.

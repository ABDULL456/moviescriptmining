December 21, 2009 INT. A BLACK SCREEN 
EDDIE (V.0.) They found me. 
INT. CLOSE 0N - A HIGH-TECH RESIDENTIAL STEEL DOOR 
being POUNDED in. WHAM! WHAM! Whoever's trying to get in is serious. The door shudders but doesn't give. It's state-of- the-art residential protection. 
EDDIE (V.0.) I might have five minutes. 
We hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door. These people are determined. Professional. And prepared. 
EDDIE (V.0.) ( (CONT'D) I'll never know how they got past security in a half-billion dollar building. 
EXT. THE CELESTIAL - LOOKING INTO THE LOBBY - NIGHT 
The sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk. All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut. 
EDDIE (V.O.) They've become sophisticated. Before they couldn't have done this. But now...? 
The CAMERA RISES, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors of this stunning new building, coming to rest on... 
EDDIE MORGAN, 
30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him, beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump. 
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I will never let them touch me. 
His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the next apartment. He looks over, at- 
THE ADJOINING TERRACE 
Through the gauzy curtains of the window, TWO MEN force A MIDDLE-AGED MAN towards the windows... there is arguing. 
EDDIE (V.0.) My neighbor must've heard the noise. Opened his door to complain. 
Two MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded again. It doesn't give. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) He bought me half a minute. I wish he hadn't. Last thoughts are self- pitying and mine are no exception: the waste. The waste of it all. I mean, how many of us ever know what it is to become... the perfect version of ourselves. I'd come that close. To having an impact on the world. 
The pounding intensifies. 
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And now, the only thing I'd have an impact on... 
He looks over the railing... 
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... was the sidewalk. 
His smile is bitter, as we CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY 
EDDIE (V.0.) Not so long ago, this was me. 
Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face rounder --he's out of shape. A belly bulges against his belt. He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy "writer's" sport coat --the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the Salvation Army. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I was a writer. Two years after my copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr came to a non-mutual end, I had, in an extraordinary burst of desperate energy, bullshitted my way into my first book contract. This was it: 
INT. EDDIE'S RATTY RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT ON AVENUE A- DAY 
Eddie, slumped in his desk chair, is playing COMPUTER SCRABBLE. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Now, at last, I was ready to write. 
QUICK CUTS: --Eddie sprawled on the couch, eating takeout and watching TV, the sink in the foreground full of dishes. -- Eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Gearing up, that's all. 
--Eddie sleeping in his bed, sacked out, the clock beside him clicking to 11:59 a.m. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Getting psyched. 
--Eddie sitting on the john, playing a game on his childhood Game Boy. 
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) A few days did pass this way... maybe a few months... 
--Eddie at his desk. He glances at his LAND LINE. The message light is unblinkingly green. No one's called. 
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Friends fled. 
LINDY Yeah, thanks. I do. 
She smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. No good to keep looking. It's over. Eddie makes an attempt to reach for the check, which Lindy grabs. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LINDY (CONT'D) Oh, please. 
He knows she knows he can't pay. 
EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - DAY 
Eddie is walking home, eying the homeless on the street, feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck. 
EDDIE (V.0.) She was right. I was almost 35. No one talks about "potential" at 35. I had missed the on-ramp. Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower bunk of my childhood bedroom... my father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory... 
He's interrupted by A VOICE - calm, amused: 
VOICE Eddie. Morgan. 
VERNON GANT looks him over with condescending bemusment. He's 30, wears an expensive suit, looks like he comes from money. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs, is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in- law? 
VERNON Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--? 
EDDIE But who's counting. 
VERNON (taking him in) Hey, you!!! 
He genially whacks the sides of Eddie's arms. Eddie halfheartedly whacks back. Vernon sizes Eddie up. 
VERNON (CONT'D) Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't you? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Eddie didn't need that. He's very self-conscious about his weight. 
EDDIE Sedentary job, you know... 
VERN So you're still trying to write? 
EDDIE As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract. 
Vern looks half suspicious, half impressed. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) How about you? (POINTEDLY) Still dealing, Vernon? 
VERNON (SMUGLY) Do I look like I'm still dealing? 
Eddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut. 
EDDIE No. 
VERNON Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna hear about this book. 
EDDIE Nah, I should go-- 
VERN You can't tell me you're a health nut, now. Not with that tire- 
EDDIE (ANNOYED) Enticing invitation. Thanks. 
Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket pocket. 
VERN C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't give `em back. 
He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
EDDIE It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern. 
VERN When's that ever stopped you? 
EDDIE (SIGHS) Fuck. 
INT. BAR - DAY 
A BARTENDER brings beers to Eddie and Vernon who sit at the bar. Eddie clearly wishes he were elsewhere. 
EDDIE So... how's Melissa? 
VERNON Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to the beer. 
EDDIE I'm making conversation, Vern. 
VERNON Well, I don't know how Melissa is. 
INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT (AN ALMOST SUBLIMINAL FLASH) 
Melissa, naked, silhouetted in the bathroom door. BACK TO: 
He turns off his phone, gets up. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
VERN (CONT'D) Fucking people. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave you here, Eddie. But let's hang out again, have another beer. 
He takes out his business card, and places it carefully next to the little white tablet on the bench. 
VERN (CONT'D) By the way, that's on the house. 
EDDIE I don't want it, Vern. 
Vern smiles at him. 
VERN Don't be ungrateful, now. You know how much these things cost? 
Eddie shakes his head. 
VERN (CONT'D) Eight hundred bucks a pop. 
He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes. Eddie is still looking at the pill. 
Which seems to be looking back at him. 
EXT. THE STREET - DUSK 
Eddie makes his way home, a little tipsy and filled with self- loathing. 
EDDIE (V.O.) All the way home she was back on my mind ... Melissa. 
FLASH! 
A memory -- Melissa's face as she's talking, laughing. 
EDDIE (V.O.) She'd been so smart. Smarter than anyone around her. And oh, how she loved to provoke people... 
INT. A DOWNTOWN PARTY - PARTY - NIGHT 
Melissa, sparkling, beautiful, surrounded by people, in intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types. 
MELISSA --Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--! 
The men gasp, shocked and titillated. The women are furious. Melissa smiles to herself --she's trying not to crack up. 
EDDIE (V.0.) I thought, by now, she'd be curing cancer, directing movies, running for the Senate... 
We HOLD ON MELISSA'S LOVELY, CONFIDENT FACE as her voice fades down and Eddie's fades in. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) What had happened? Her life made no sense. I mean, I could see a direct, plausible link between this Eddie, broke and buzzed at three o'clock in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie... 
INT. A DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN BEHIND A DESK - DAY 
--getting SPLATTERED by some ochre liquid from an offscreen source. 
EDDIE (V.0.) ...vomiting on his boss' desk during a presentation... 
INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A YOUNGER, THINNER EDDIE rifles through a bureau, an old lady in bed, sleeping, behind him --an oxygen mask on her. She's clearly terminal. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (V.0.) ... or stealing his dying Aunt's Percocet. 
EXT. THE STREET - DUSK 
Eddie walks, pensive. 
EDDIE (V.0.) But there was no link between my Melissa and this upstate Melissa dumped, cold-calling people from her living room. 
EXT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - DUSK 
An edgy neighborhood on the furthest edge of lower Manhattan. This block may never be gentrified. 
EDDIE (V.O.) 40 long blocks later I was "home." 
He digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with... 
THE LITTLE WHITE PILL 
INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK 
It's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up. Eddie trudges up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years of paint. 
Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad, and he knows he looks bad. 
He reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the palm of his hand, looking up at him. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Well. There was less than nothing to lose. 
Quickly, impulsively, he swallows it. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
A slightly younger Eddie is flipping through the Lange book. 
EDDIE (V.O.) ...sitting on the couch of a T.A. I was trying to make, waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom... hoping she'd have a condom... 
BACK TO: 
INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - LANDING - DAY 
EDDIE (V.0.) Somehow, my unconscious had served that up... a memory I'd never even recorded. Or was it there the whole time... and all I needed... was the access? 
ON EDDIE'S FACE - CLOSE 
As it sinks in: 
EDDIE (V.0.) Vern was right. This was no recreational drug. 
Eddie's eyes flick to the laptop in her bag, his manner suddenly intimate, confident. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use. 
VALERIE Well, who asked y- 
EDDIE Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor. 
During this speech, MUSIC COMES UP and the sound goes down... SEVERAL QUICK CUTS... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Eddie and Valerie's mouths are moving... she's asking questions... he's supplying answers, lots of them... 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary, was all bubbling up to my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information. 
Valerie's whole posture is relaxing, the look in her eyes becoming... friendly. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) She didn't have a chance. 
INT. THE DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT FROM EDDIE'S - NIGHT 
A mirror image of Eddie's, but considerably nicer. We HEAR the SOUNDS of two people -- Valerie and Eddie -- HAVING WILD, mutually satisfying SEX from the other room. 
EDDIE (V.0.) We'd really worked on her paper, too. In 45 minutes it was a polished gem. She was pleased. 
We see the laptop set up, books scattered -- then, obviously abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) One nice little side effect...? I stayed hard for hours. 
We HEAR female groans of pleasure. Laughter. 
INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A dishevelled Eddie opens the door to his apartment. He enters, looks around. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Happy and sore, I returned home. 
EDDIE'S POV - HIS LIVING ROOM 
It's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers home: what a mess. Books scattered across the floor, dirty dishes, broken Venetian blind sashes. The nest of a slob. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (V.0.) ... But it couldn't be my home, could it? Who would live like this? 
MONTAGE: Speeded-up shots of Eddie sifting through his books and tapes. Cleaning up the kitchen. The bathroom. Picks up books. He starts moving the sofa. 
QUICK CUTS: the living room, rapidly whipped into shape. If not stylish, habitable. Final shot: he's sitting on the (repositioned) couch. Thinking. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) What was this drug? I couldn't stay messy on it, I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours... 
He stares at the pack in his hands. It looks alien. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) ...hadn't eaten... So. Abstemious and tidy. What was this -- a drug for people who want to get anal? 
He gets up. Paces. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I wasn't high, wasn't wired --just clear. What I needed to do. And how to do it. 
His eye falls on his COMPUTER. 
The MONTAGE CONTINUES: Eddie flipping through research books, typing onto his keyboard, the printer printing, doing Internet searches... pages and pages spit out of the printer. 
INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Eddie, in his underwear, is sleeping soundly. He stirs, rolls over, cracks open an eye. 
He gets up, schlumps to the mirror, looks at his unshaven face. The penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes. 
EDDIE (V.0.) The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain. No surge of brilliance came up to greet me. I felt thick and stupid -- a shuffling zombie without my coffee and cigarette. In short... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
VERNON It works better if you're already smart. 
Eddie can't get over how bad Vernon looks. 
EDDIE VERN- 
VERN You don't want to know. 
And Eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what happened. 
EDDIE What's... um... what's it called? 
VERN It doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile. And that's the way we want it to stay. The boys in the kitchen are calling it MDT-48. 
EDDIE "The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved. 
VERN "FDA-approved," that's a laugh. Did you really believe that shit? 
Eddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Okay, so what did we have here? Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere, given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years. 
VERN So you want some more of it? 
EDDIE Yes. Definitely. 
Vern chuckles. He knew it. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
VERN We'll talk about it. But first maybe you can do me a little favor. 
EDDIE Uh... sure. 
Eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but Vern clearly has him by the balls. 
VERN You can see, I'm in no shape to go out right now. Will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit? And maybe pick me up a little breakfast...? 
Eddie sighs. Vern tosses him a set of KEYS. 
INT. A DRY CLEANER'S AUTOMATED CLOTHING RACK - DAY 
As the plastic-wrapped clothes spin towards us... 
EDDIE (V.0.) It was amazing how quickly it all slotted back into place... 
INT. A DINER GRIDDLE - DAY 
As two eggs are flipped, over easy. 
EDDIE (V.0.) ..the dealer-client dynamic...... 
INT. VERNON'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
And here comes Eddie, carrying Vernon's suit, and greasy bag of breakfast... 
EDDIE (V.0.) ...the easy sacrificing of dignity for the guaranteed return of a dime bag, or a gram, or in this case a little pill that was going to cost me a month's rent. 
He arrives at Vernon's door. He takes out the keys Vern gave him, but he doesn't need them. The DOOR is AJAR. 
INT. VERN'S APARTMENT - DAY - EDDIE'S POV 
As Eddie pushes the door open, he can see Vernon sitting, quite normally, on the couch. As he enters the room, though, he sees that the place has been RANSACKED. Destroyed. 
Eddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck. And then sees it. 
VERN'S FACE -CLOSE 
In the center of his forehead is a neat little BULLET HOLE. 
EDDIE 
is no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow. He starts shaking... then, seized with horror that they might still be in here, he edges to the bedroom. We hear THE POUNDING OF HIS HEART as he peeks in... 
INT. EDDIE'S POV - VERN'S BEDROOM 
It's been ransacked, too. Torn to shreds, bureau drawers opened and dumped, pillows ripped open with knives. But no one is there. 
INT. VERNON'S DESK - DAY 
Eddie's shaking hand can barely hold the phone. 
EDDIE Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't. 
He puts down the phone, puts his head in his hands. 
VARIOUS CUTS OF: Eddie sitting. Shifting his butt in various positions. Holding a BASEBALL BAT he's found --just in case "they" come back. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It took them forever. And the longer I sat there, the clearer I saw... Vern had known whoever had done this. He'd opened the door. 
CLOSE ON - EDDIE'S FACE 
EDDIE (V.0.) And it wasn't just women. I was, for the first time in my life, a presence... 
INT. ANOTHER BAR - ANOTHER NIGHT 
The CAMERA circles around a European-looking crowd... that's clustered around Eddie. He's finishing a long story -in French. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Of course, all this seemed to work better with people I didn't know... than with people who knew me... 
INT. A MODEST QUEENS LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Eddie's MOTHER and FATHER, working class schlubs, sit on the floral sofa, staring at their now-dapper son, who is waving some paperwork in their faces. 
EDDIE ...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock -- (realizing they're lost) Okay, remember when I explained default flops? Did any of that stick? (THEY'RE LOST) CDS's? CDO's CBO's? 
His parents stare at him. They don't know what to make of any of this. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I quickly returned to the unfamiliar audience. 
INT. ANOTHER UPSCALE BAR - NIGHT 
A sizable crowd is around Eddie, including finance types in suits. 
EDDIE --Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years? 
A well-dressed broker - KEVIN DOYLE - shakes his head. 
KEVIN DOYLE No, no, there are safeguards-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature. 
Eddie's tone isn't aggressive -- it's genial, amusing. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) We're wired to overreach -- you look at history, I mean, all the countries that ruled the world? Portugal? With its big, butch navy? All that's left is salt cod and cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they just sit on their dank little island, fussing over their suits. Nobody stops and thinks, hey, we're doing pretty well, we've got Poland and France, and a big Swiss bank account -- let's not invade Russia in the winter! Let's go home and pop a beer and live off the interest! 
The crowd laughs. Eddie takes a swallow of his drink. 
KEVIN DOYLE (smiles, gets it) Yeah. It'll all happen again. 
Eddie toasts him. 
EDDIE Hey, I want in on it! 
Kevin Doyle, wishing Eddie was right, clinks his glass. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) My brain was just pouring this stuff out. Everything I'd ever read, heard, seen, was now organized and available --here it is, here you go.. 
EXT. THE BAR - NIGHT 
Eddie leaves with several people. Kevin Doyle presses a card into Eddie's hand. 
KEVIN DOYLE You must have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Eddie politely takes his card. Smiles charmingly. 
EDDIE Thank you so much. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) "I must have a portfolio." Very well -- if I must, I must. 
INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Eddie pulls out the broiler and removes the ENVELOPE OF CASH he's taped in there. It's much thinner. 
EDDIE (V.O.) But Vern's cash was low. And it takes cash to make cash... 
INT. MARK SUTTON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Eddie stands opposite Mark's desk. 
EDDIE (V.O.) But it takes cash to make cash... 
Another ELEGANT MAN is there too, Mark's boss, DUNHAM. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I'd like to re-negotiate my advance. 
DUNHAM Well... sit down, we'll be discussing that. 
MARK SUTTON First, ah... I want to apologize, Eddie, if I in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities. 
Eddie smiles coolly. In control. It's Mark who's a little nervous. 
MARK SUTTON (CONT'D) Mr. Dunham has read your pages, and we're prepared to make you what I hope will be a very exciting offer. 
DUNHAM What would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Eddie holds there gaze, expressionless, but says nothing. After an uncomfortable moment, Dunham continues. 
EDDIE I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened. 
Gennady just looks at Eddie, thinking it over. 
INT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY 
Eddie sits on a bench, waiting. Gennady appears. Hands Eddie a large paper bag. Eddie reaches for it; Gennady holds it aloft for one last second. 
GENNADY Okay, you take this... you mine. You don't pay, you know what we do? We cut you around the waist, peel your skin, pull it up over your head and tie knot in it. And you don't die from that. You suffocate. 
He lets the full picture sink in for a moment. Then: 
INT. LAFAYETTE TRADING - DAY 
Cubicle after cubicle of GUYS - all guys - at computers, rolling the dice on the stockmarket. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (V.0.) My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage two and a half times your cash at a day- trading firm... 
Eddie alone in a stall. He takes TWO MDT TABLETS out of his wallet, downs them. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I'd been upping the dose for over a week. It seemed to cut my learning curve. 
OVERLAPPING DISSOLVES of Eddie working at a furious pace. Another trader stands behind Eddie, watching. Second shot: three traders are watching. Third shot: nine traders are watching him, awed. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It was instinct. But informed instinct -- instinct based on huge amounts of research, which, thanks to MDT, was conducted more rapidly and comprehensively than anyone at Lafayette Day Trading would ever know... 
TRADER BEHIND HIM Why are you buying that? The CEO just got indicted... 
EDDIE But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week. 
The trader shakes his head. How did Eddie know that? 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) At the end of the week my brokerage account contained... over a million dollars. 
INT. LAFAYTTE DAY TRADING - OVERHEAD SHOT OF ROOM -- "GOD SHOT"- 
As still more people drift over to where Eddie is sitting... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (V.O.) I'd heard the old metaphors about the stock market: it was a collective nervous system, a global brain, a numerical representation of the will of God... 
EDDIE - CLOSE 
Eyes taking in data, fingers reacting on the keyboard... 
EDDIE (V.O.) Whatever it was, I was jacked in, booted up - my mind was living tissue inside the greater, functioning whole. (BEAT) By the end of the second week I had 2.6 in the bank.... 
INT. LAFAYETTE DAY TRADING BUILDING - DAY 
Eddie at the computer, soaking up information, making trades. Kevin Doyle stands behind Eddie, flabbergasted as he watches. 
EDDIE (V.0.) The word quickly got out. 
INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK 
Quick cuts of Eddie playing back his messages: 
EDDIE'S MACHINE You have... 19 messages. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Four job offers... my bank, raising my line of credit... a reporter... 
FEMALE VOICE Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan, this article's about you's gonna get written with or without your cooperation... (BEEP!) 
EDDIE (V.0.) (SARDONIC) All my new friends. 
GENNADY'S VOICE ...you stupid shit, I be there Thursday for the money, ten o'clock! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Eddie makes a jerk-off motion, crosses to his window, looks down. 
EXT. EDDIE'S POV - HIS STREET - DUSK 
There is a MYSTERIOUS BLACK CAR just sitting at the curb, in front of his building. No one gets in or out. Eddie turns back to his machine. 
EDDIE (V.0.) And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to sound casual. 
KEVIN DOYLE'S VOICE Eddie, I was having drinks with a friend of mine, and... ah, you won't believe this... 
INT. A FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Lindy, Eddie's ex-girlfriend, is sitting across the table from Eddie. She peers at him, confused. Is this dapper stranger really her shlumpy ex? 
LINDY Carl Van Loon wants to meet you? 
EDDIE Apparently he does. 
She is pleased for him, but flabbergasted. 
Eddie takes a step. And suddenly... He's across the room. Boom. A skip in time. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Then... I found myself at the door. With no consciousness that I had moved. 
He puts his hand on a table, steadies himself. He catches a look, in the mirror, of this lean, handsome, dapper shark he has become. 
LINDY Are you all right? 
He doesn't look all right. 
LINDA When was the last time you ate something? 
Dully the realization penetrates Eddie's fog: 
EDDIE (V.O.) It had been three days. 
INT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT 
Eddie sits at a table, discreetly wolfing a few appetizers. Kevin Doyle arrives, looking a little nervous. 
KEVIN Hey. 
He sits, launches in. 
KEVIN (CONT'D) He'll be here in ten. Now look, since we have a minute, be warned: Van Loon's mercurial. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KEVIN (CONT'D) One minute your best friend, the next...you're a leper. And he needs direct answers... anything tentative and you've lost him forever. I think we should rehearse a few scenarios.. 
EDDIE I'm eating, Kevin. 
There is so much quiet authority in Eddie's tone that Kevin just shuts up. But a moment later, looking at the sweat on Eddie's brow, Kevin is pecking at him again. 
KEVIN You up for this? You sure? Because I've got a little bit on the line HERE- 
EDDIE Have a toast point. 
Brazening it out again. Because Eddie isn't sure he can pull this off either. 
ACROSS THE ROOM - LATER 
There is that little stir from the hostess and staff that can only mean the entrance of a very rich and powerful man. 
EDDIE'S TABLE -LATER 
The martini is put down on the table. We tilt up to CARL VAN LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects geniality. He sits; the middle-aged man with him, PIERCE, does the same. 
VAN LOON So. Eddie Morgan. 
He looks Eddie directly in the eyes. 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) What's your secret? 
A beat. Eddie looks at him back, directly in the eyes. 
EDDIE Medication. I'm on special medication. 
Another beat. And Van Loon laughs. Pierce doesn't. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER - THAT NIGHT 
Eddie is in mid-spiel, Van Loon listening intently. 
EDDIE --Yes, that's partially what I'm SAYING-- 
PIERCE (CONTEMPTUOUSLY) Pattern recognition? So that's your snake-oil? Look, if there's one thing we all understand, it's understanding itself --that's how the business works... (SCOFFING) Pattern recognition. Please. 
EDDIE (POINTEDLY) Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns. 
Kevin sucks in his breath. Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed. Eddie continues with his unstoppable, MDT-fueled insights: 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone. We entered the age of decentralized, online decision- making, with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world, people who don't even know each other -- making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze. 
PIERCE Until they weren't. 
EDDIE Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works. 
PIERCE (SCOFFING) And you have a formula. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KEVIN (MEDIATING) Well, from 12 thousand to two point eight million in ten days-- 
EDDIE Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce. 
PIERCE (SNORTING) Delusions of grandeur. 
EDDIE I don't have delusions of grandeur. 
A beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I have an actual recipe for grandeur. 
VAN LOON You're a gusty little prick, Eddie. 
EDDIE Ooh. Now you're curious. 
VAN LOON Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a couple pretty big buttons. Go on. Tell me what you think. 
EDDIE (DISMISSIVE) It's getting late. 
Van Loon laughs. 
VAN LOON All right. You get your shot. Come to my office, tomorrow at ten, and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re- structure this deal. 
Eddie nods. 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) And you better be prepared. 
EDDIE I'm at your disposal. 
Eddie opens the car door. Van Loon eyes his building, scoffs. 
VAN LOON You don't really live here...? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
Eddie smiles. 
EDDIE The Spartans weren't big on amenities. 
VAN LOON Yeah. And they eventually got their asses kicked. 
He gets out. Van Loon drives off. 
EXT. EDDIE'S BLOCK - NIGHT 
EDDIE (V.0.) I didn't go in. 
Eddie keeps walking by his building. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest... 
His stride picks up, buoyantly. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) There are moments in life, moments when you know you've crossed a bridge, your old life is over. Van Loon was my bridge. One week, two weeks from now, I would be hobnobbing with ambassadors, flying to Dubai for meetings, blowing off supermodels, vacationing in Medici villas... And that too, was only a bridge... 
He steps off the curb. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Suddenly... 
A SHARP, JARRING 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOUSTON STREET - NIGHT 
Eddie is stepping off another curb, God knows where. 
EDDIE (V.0.) There was another skip. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He stops, rocked. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) How had I gone that last 20 blocks? I got another ten... 
ON EDDIE WALKING... 
EDDIE (V.0.) ... then... 
...in mid-step... 
EXT. UPPER 5TH AVENUE - NIGHT 
Eddie is walking past the Metropolitan Museum. 
EDDIE (V.0.) I was back uptown. 
A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO: 
INT. A CLUB - NIGHT 
Eddie is suddenly sitting at a bar, picking up a drink, people around him... 
EDDIE (V.0.) What bar was this? Was it Harlem...? 
A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO: 
Eddie is dancing with a BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN... 
EDDIE (V.0.) Same bar? Different bar? How long had passed...? 
He breaks away from her, starts for the door... 
KEVIN Yeah, well, you can't have the fucking flu right now -- he'll never give you this chance again! 
EDDIE I need to, ah, analyze this data- 
We see the two men continue to talk, Kevin growing more agitated, Eddie growing more sheepish as we HEAR: 
EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Already I recognized it... the thick tongue, the leaden synapses. It was regular Eddie - the Eddie that, now, was unbearable to be. 
We FADE UP THE SOUND on the two men: 
KEVIN ... Don't you get it?! This is your test--! 
EDDIE Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now! 
KEVIN And how am I going to look if you don't? 
Eddie looks pretty bad. He massages his temples. 
EDDIE Okay, Kevin. Okay. 
He hands up on a still-yammering Doyle. He picks up the MDT pill, looks at it. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It was my first morning off MDT in a month. The beginnings of a headache was curling around my head like a big fat, greasy python. 
Again, he looks at the MDT tablet, weighing his options. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) But the time-skips had me scared. 
He puts the tablet back down on the table. 
INT. THE REGENCY HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY 
Eddie walks in, much more tentative in his stride, fear in his eyes. This is the real Eddie, the non-MDT Eddie and he feels suddenly out of place with the curly maple paneling antique Persian carpets. 
EDDIE (V.O.) My thought -- such as I had one -- was to tap dance with Van Loon until I could find out more about MDT. 
INT. BAR AREA - DAY 
Eddie sits on a couch, Pierce on another chair, Van Loon opposite, watching him. 
VAN LOON What do you know about Hank Atwood? 
EDDIE Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado... 
He's struggling. 
VAN LOON Uh-huh. So this is "prepared," Eddie? 
He shoots Eddie a look of withering contempt. Eddie holds the stare and shoots a look back. 
EDDIE What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood. 
VAN LOON Where was he two years ago? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
A flash of panic in Eddie's eyes. What's the right answer? 
EDDIE Nowhere. 
An agonizing pause. Then Van Loon nods. 
VAN LOON Two years ago Forbes didn't even have him on the radar. 
EDDIE Yeah, his Great Leap Forward. 
Eddie is faking it. Pierce is looking at him intently. But Eddie's staying afloat. 
VAN LOON The guy comes on, out of nowhere, so fucking strong he has me on the run. Beat me out of two properties, invests in bumfuck countries with no oil, places I wouldn't go near, sextuples his money. 
Eddie's glance flicks to the TV behind the bar. A WOMAN'S PICTURE flashes on the TV screen -- and he recognizes it. It's the ITALIAN WOMAN he met last night! 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) ...Always picks green technologies, invests in them, and a year later he owns them. 
Eddie strains to hear the ANCHORWOMAN'S VOICE... 
ANCHORWOMAN ... found dead in her hotel room last night, victim of foul play. 
Eddie tries to keep his face immobile. Van Loon's voice drones on, distorted now, as we HEAR Eddie's heart pounding. 
VAN LOON ...100 billion if he has a nickel... and I have to convince him, somehow, that I can raise his game. 
ANCHORWOMAN An unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D) Anyone with information should contact local law enforcement authorities. --Steve? 
Eddie bolts upright. 
VAN LOON You can't tell me he's in this to improve the fucking planet. He owns a ball team. 
MALE VOICE Well Bill... Jerry's in the hospital... (VOICE QUAKING) ...and he's really sick. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE Oh my God. What's wrong with him? 
MALE VOICE We don't know. He just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago...? Then, uh, last Wednesday he collapsed at work... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
Eddie turns to the last page of Vernon's book. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Of all the people I called, three were dead, and the rest were sick. 
Eddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white. 
The man takes out his cell phone and answers. 
MAN'S VOICE Hello...? Hello...? 
The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and follows. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY 
Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly can. 
He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He can't run fast. 
Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling. 
EDDIE (V.0.) In the end, my stupidity saved me. 
Eddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk. 
EDDIE'S POV - A HUGE TRUCK 
is barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him--! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it -- then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it. When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone pedestrians, his last glimpse is of- 
EDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK 
disappearing down into a Subway entrance. Swallowed by a crowd. 
TAN COAT 
hesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. Eddie's given him the slip. This time. 
INT. CHARLIE'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Eddie, limping, enters, looking around anxiously. 
EDDIE (V.0.) What was I dealing with? Who could tell me? I hoped against hope... that Melissa would show. 
EDDIE'S POV - SCANNING THE PLACE 
Not one person in it could possibly be Melissa. Eddie sighs. Turns to go. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Eddie...? 
Eddie turns back. There, sitting at a booth, is a thick- waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her... and not recognized her. She bears no relationship to the siren Melissa of his memories. Eddie tries to hide the shock on his face. 
EDDIE Melissa...? 
He goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few years. 
Eddie tries to conceal his shock. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (CONT'D) You... how are you doing? 
Melissa responds with a cynical shrug. Then, she eyes him. 
MELISSA Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way... (BEAT) You look good. 
EDDIE I guess I lost some weight... 
MELISSA Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you. 
They regard each other for minute, unsure of where to start. Old emotions. New emotions. Shock. Dismay. Affection. 
MELISSA (CONT'D) I know you've been doing it. I just read the Post. Eddie. Short-selling stocks? Second-guessing the markets? You? Come on. 
Eddie doesn't know what to say. 
EDDIE Since when do you read the Post? 
MELISSA These days, the Post's about all I can read. 
WHAM! He's pushed up against the wall of his building. Not by Tan Coat. 
By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN. 
GENNADY You fucking forget about me? Huh? 
Eddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the building pretty hard. He still clutches the MDT tablet tight in his fist. 
EDDIE I... I... ahh... 
GENNADY One o'clock? And you not here?! Eddie tries to catch his breath. 
EDDIE I'm here now! 
INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - ON THE DOOR 
They come into his apartment, Eddie using all his energy to stay upright. 
EDDIE I'll get you a check. 
Gennady turns to ice. 
GENNADY A check? A check?! You out of your fucking mind?! What you think we are, some financial institution? 
Eddie realizes his brain isn't working --of course Gennady can't take a check. 
EDDIE Gennady, look- 
GENNADY I cut your balls off! 
EDDIE I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF! 
Gennady has punched him in the stomach. Harder than he's ever been punched. Eddie gasps for breath... holds his fist to his body, protecting the pill. Gennady notices. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GENNADY What you got there? 
EDDIE NOTHING-- 
Gennady grabs Eddie's wrist and wrenches his hand open. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) It's aspirin. 
Gennady snatches the pill away from him. Examines it. 
GENNADY Don't look like no aspirin I ever see! 
His voice drips with crude contempt. 
GENNADY (CONT'D) What is it? Something good, eh? 
In one swift motion, Gennady pops it in his mouth and swallows it! 
Eddie is mute with shock. 
INT. A BANK - CLOSE ON 
Eddie's shaking hands are handing Gennady a thick envelope. 
EDDIE That's the whole thing, plus twenty. 
He looks desperately ill. He can barely stand. Gennady, meanwhile, is coming on to MDT. 
GENNADY I feel good. What in that shit? 
EDDIE Aspirin and vitamins. 
GENNADY You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I know you lie about the movie script too. 
He wants to hit Eddie again, but thinks the better of it with all the bank cameras. 
THE MONITOR - 
We see Gennady give the camera a gay little wave, then turn and walk out. 
EXT. THE STREET - DAY 
Eddie lurches along the street, staggering like a drunk, barely able to walk. People avoid him, veering away. 
EDDIE (V.O.) I had to get my stash. 
INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Lindy clearly has a mid-level executive job; her office is better than a cubicle and she has a bit of a view. There is a KNOCK. A FEMALE ASSISTANT appears in the door. 
FEMALE ASSISTANT Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him in, but I know you know him... 
EDDIE appears in the door, looking deathly ill. 
LINDY It's all right, Lisa. 
INT. LINDY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Lindy enters. Tense, panicked. She walks to a SQUARE END TABLE, takes the lamp off it. The table is actually a box -- she lifts the lid. She reaches in... and pulls out the PACKET OF MDT. 
LINDY You asshole... in my fucking HOUSE?! 
Furious, she stuffs it into her purse and goes for the door. 
EXT. LINDY'S BUILDING - DAY 
As she leaves, we see that we are in the POV of... 
A MAN 
across the street. He clicks open a CELL PHONE. 
INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY 
There is a KNOCK on the DOOR. Lying on the floor, trying to breathe, Eddie ignores it. His PHONE rings again. It takes a lot of effort just to answer it. 
EDDIE Hi -- Have you got it? 
And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN: 
INT. A MOVING CAB - DAY 
Lindy is on the phone. Her voice is tense, terrified. 
LINDY Yes. --Eddie, there's someone following me. 
EDDIE Are you sure? 
LINDY He got into the cab behind me, and they're making every turn I'm making! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE Don't get out. 
LINDY What the fuck did you put me in the middle of--?! 
EDDIE Call the cops. 
LINDY (PANICKING) There's traffic. We're slowing down... (to the driver) Go around him! Go around! (TO EDDIE) Shit! We're stopped dead. (A GASP) He's getting out, Eddie -- he's walking over here- 
Eddie, helpless on the floor, can do nothing. 
EDDIE LINDY--!!! 
EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY 
Lindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on the opposite door. She takes off into Central Park. And he's after her like a shot. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY 
Lindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig-zagging, trying to find a place not to be seen. 
TAN COAT 
Zig-zags too, not far behind her. 
LINDY 
Begins to scream, desperate: 
LINDY Help! Help!! 
Up ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against the side of the horse. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
She's so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak. 
LINDY (CONT'D) There's... a... man... chasing me. He has a long, tan -- 
The cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS and TWITCHES, his eyes flutter, glaze... and HE TOPPLES OFF HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody. LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY... comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS. Dives behind one of them. 
Ahead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples, families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low, although she's hyperventilating. 
LINDY (CONT'D) Are you still there? 
And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN: 
INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY 
EDDIE Yes. What's happening? 
LINDY I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll find me! 
EDDIE Just be still, stop talking. 
LINDY He killed a cop-- 
EDDIE I can take care of you now. 
LINDY That was never what I wanted. 
EDDIE A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you. 
Lindy's head comes up. She looks at him, steely. 
LINDY You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty. 
She gets up, turns away from him. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LINDY (CONT'D) I understand that stuff now, Eddie. And I don't blame you for taking it. No one could ever tell you, till you take it, what it can do. Invincibility in a bottle. And I know I'm going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life. 
There's eerie quiet to her tone that Eddie hasn't heard before. A matter-of-fact chill. 
LINDY (CONT'D) But once you can see everything that way, mapped out like that, on a grid... and always be right...? Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want to fuck up? Who'd want to be human? 
She heads for the door. 
LINDY (CONT'D) I just came up to say goodbye. I don't ever want to see you again. I'm not even going to stay in New York. Don't try to find me, and don't try to help me. 
She goes. He knows there's no point in stopping her. She's done with him. 
EXT. W HOTEL - LATER 
Eddie at the WINDOW, looking down... 
EXT. EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET 
He sees Lindy briskly walking away. RACK FOCUS as Lindy passes... GENNADY. Leaning against a sign post. Lighting a cigarette. And looking up at Eddie's hotel. Waiting. 
EXT. W HOTEL - DAY 
Gennady stands there, looking up at the hotel. So he's a little surprised to find EDDIE walking right up to him. 
EDDIE Looking for me? 
Gennady quickly gets aggressive: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GENNADY You think you can run out on me? You think I don't know where you are? 
EDDIE I was under the impression that our business was settled. 
Something is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink. 
GENNADY Walk. 
Gennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the (deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie remains cool. 
EDDIE So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman. 
GENNADY I want some more of that shit. 
EDDIE What shit. 
GENNADY The pills. 
He whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT, doesn't react. 
EDDIE Well, so do I. You took the last one. 
GENNADY So you get me more. 
EDDIE I can't get more -- the dealer's dead. 
Now Gennady smiles. 
GENNADY Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Eddie doesn't like that Gennady knows anything about his business life. But he stands his ground. 
EDDIE Nothing. I. Can. Do. 
GENNADY Make some calls. One hundred pills. 
EDDIE A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on-- 
The gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin. 
GENNADY You know I don't really do this. So clean, like this. What I do to you, I do in stages. 
EDDIE I might... be able to get ten. 
GENNADY Ten. Fuck your ten. 
The men nod. They understand. 
INT. EDDIE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY 
Eddie straightens his tie. Then opens his suit jacket, reaches in, and pulls along a seam. An invisible POCKET OPENS. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Safer though my stash now was, I was not sitting around until it ran out. 
INT. A LABORATORY - NIGHT 
The place is state of the art, but it's an after-hours, furtive meeting Eddie is having with a TECHNICIAN, who passes back a small PLASTIC ENVELOPE to Eddie. In it we see SEVERAL TABLETS of MDT. 
TECHNICIAN Well, it's nothing you can cook up on a stove top. Whoever made it, it's a real pro act. 
EDDIE Can you make more? 
TECHNICIAN Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantities? Yes. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: TECHNICIAN (CONT'D) But the exact method of delivery to the brain...? Darts at a dartboard. 
EDDIE Meaning...? 
TECHNICIAN Clinical trials. Guinea pig people. 
EDDIE That's too long. 
TECHNICIAN It's what it is. Or you'll kill people. You need twelve, eighteen MONTHS-- 
Eddie tosses the envelope back at him, gets up. 
EDDIE Two million dollars if you do it in six. 
He holds up the packet. The guy considers. Then slowly reaches for it, taking the MDT back. 
INT . RESTAURANT - DAY 
Eddie is having lunch with several POWER PLAYERS. They are listening, mesmerized, to what Eddie is saying... 
EDDIE (V.O.) It was all going to work out... 
His eyes flicker upwards. His two SECURITY MEN are seated at the bar. The CAMERA PANS to find... Also seated at the bar, is the DETECTIVE who questioned Eddie at the police station! 
Eddie gets up, "casually" wanders over to where the detective is sitting, pretends to order another drink. He does not make eye contact with the detective, or look like he's talking to him. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I thought we straightened this out, Detective. 
DETECTIVE This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morgan. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Fear begins to prick the back of Eddie's neck. But he strives for casual annoyance. 
EDDIE What is it about? 
The DETECTIVE hands Eddie a magazine. 
THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS - CLOSE 
It is turned to the middle, and there is a picture of Eddie, candid, on the trading floor. That fucking article! 
DETECTIVE A witness identified the Donatella Alvarez suspect as this person. You want to tell me about your whereabouts on the night of June 
Eddie keeps his cool, does not look scared. Wanders back to the table, says a few cool words, and strolls back to the detective. The detective gets up. Shall we go? 
EDDIE (V.0.) Luckily, I could now afford Morris Brandt, the best lawyer in New York. 
EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY 
Eddie walks down the steps, with a beautifully dressed shark lawyer, MORRIS BRANDT, 50's. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Time was bought, and I was released -- for now. 
Eddie's two SECURITY GUYS, waiting, fall into step ten paces behind him. 
MORRIS BRANDT You're lucky somebody wiped the room. Weak circumstantial at best. Just between us -- were you there? 
EDDIE I don't remember. 
MORRIS BRANDT (SHRUGS) Busy life. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He's heard it all, and doesn't really care. 
INT. CARL VAN LOON'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
EDDIE (V.0.) Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood remained unaware that soon, I would be in a witness lineup as a possible murderer. 
Eddie is making a presentation to the Van Loon Associates -- and a skeptical-looking OLDER GUY -- HANK ATWOOD. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) ...well, a unified front between Van Loon and Atwood would be lethally effective, and not a moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out... 
EDDIE (V.O.) It was, as it turned out, a good moment to move. 
Eddie comes in. The room has been completely ripped to pieces -- just like Eddie's apartment. Eddie just smiles. Because there was nothing for anyone to find. 
EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY 
EDDIE (V.O.) No one knew, or would ever know, that I now carried the pills with me at all times. 
Eddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps behind. GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it. 
Gennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Right away, it was obvious he was on MDT. 
Gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a cigarette. His movements are elegant, refined. 
GENNADY Next week...? I require twenty pills. 
EDDIE Next week? You can fuck yourself. (BEAT) Not that you'll feel anything. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Gennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady laughs, an unpleasant sound. 
GENNADY I don't think your Forbes 400 new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police? 
Gennady turns with a flourish and walks off. Over his shoulder, with smug confidence: 
GENNADY (CONT'D) Thursday. You have them here. 
Gennady turns, walks to the curb, where a NEW BLACK TOWN CAR is waiting for him and his boys. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Obviously, this could not go on. But there is very little on this earth that 45 million dollars can't solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers. 
INT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Eddie, Van Loon and associates are all waiting in the conference room. The clock on the wall reads 9:40. Van Loon looks glum. A long silence. 
PIERCE Well, you want to call it? 
ASSOCIATE #1 Cold feet. 
VAN LOON There was all last night to tell us that. 
Van Loon pushes the intercom. 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) No call? 
SECRETARY'S VOICE Not yet. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't. (BEAT) It's still on. 
PIERCE (SARCASTIC) Oh, based on your graphs and projections? 
EDDIE (CALMLY REPEATING) I saw his eyes: it's on. 
PIERCE You know, remind me: who the fuck, exactly, are YOU?! --I'm sorry, Carl, I'm about at the end with this unqualified, posturing little- 
VAN LOON Pull it back, Pierce. 
PIERCE Since when is this little pisher the fucking Delphi Oracle?! 
VAN LOON PIERCE- 
SECRETARY'S VOICE (INTERRUPTING) Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is here. 
Eddie and Van Loon look at each other. What? Van Loon nods at Eddie; the two men get up. Pierce starts to get up too. 
VAN LOON Pierce, you can stay. 
Pierce looks bitter -- chastened -- as Van Loon and Eddie go. 
INT. CARL VAN LOON'S INNER OFFICE - DAY 
Van Loon and Eddie enter, to find MRS. HANK ATWOOD, a well- dressed, well-preserved and beautiful 50, standing at Van Loon's desk. 
MRS. ATWOOD I wanted this to be as confidential as possible. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Van Loon and Eddie can't imagine what's coming next. 
MRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D) My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning. He's at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests. 
She speaks with great dignity, distraught, but tightly controlled. 
MRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D) Obviously, it wouldn't be in our best interests for this to be reported by the press, as it might put some of his interests at risk. I just want you to know that we have every intention of signing the contract, and, as soon as he is able, we will proceed. 
EXT. VAN LOON'S BUILDING - DAY 
GENNADY (CONT'D) See, I dissolve pill in solution. You shoot it - goes straight into blood and to brain. Works much better. 
He pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in the arm and injects the cloudy liquid. 
GENNADY (CONT'D) Now. Where do you keep yours? 
Eddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go. 
EDDIE I'm plum out. 
Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone. 
GENNADY They will find it. Or I will make you tell me. Which is quicker? We see, huh? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
He clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE. It is filled with sinister-looking silver instruments, and knives. 
INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - NIGHT 
Thug #2 has found, behind a bureau, a SAFE. He calls excitedly, in Russian, to the other room. 
INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Gennady calls back in Russian. Then picks up a particularly delicate, yet sharp-looking KNIFE. 
GENNADY This is a waste of my time, you know that? I am getting out of this part of the business... starting import-export company. Very exciting stuff. A lot on my plate. I need to learn to delegate... 
Eddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with stuff he's scattered, which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A KNIFE in it... Gennady starts arranging his instruments. 
GENNADY (CONT'D) First, I will cut skin from you, flay you... you stay alive nice long time... then maybe we cut meat from you, steaks... or maybe softer parts... I get inspiration... 
He looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on Eddie. 
ON EDDIE 
Staring back at Gennady, hard, a fuck-you stare. We can't see behind Eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and the knife is gone. 
GENNADY 
senses something is not right. Looks at Eddie quizzically. 
GENNADY (CONT'D) WHAT-- 
Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into Gennady's stomach. Gennady gasps in surprise, chokes, writhes. Eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing Gennady's other hand, which lashes at Eddie with the fillet knife... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
The men fall to the floor in a death-struggle. Eddie exhausted, off MDT, but determined not to let go. Gennady writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking on blood. Eyes shocked, surprised. Eddie turns the fillet knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing. His gurgling gets quieter. He's quite dead. 
Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him, suddenly weak and exhausted. 
From the other room comes the BRRRRRRR! sound of the drill -- the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. Eddie tries to get up, then falls back. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Not much of a triumph, was it? 
He's got the shakes... no, more of a convulsion... he sinks back to the floor... 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Because I would die here, too. 
There is a break in the convulsion. Then another one starts. 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Only MDT could help me, and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream... 
Gennady's BLOOD wells around Gennady's body in a crimson puddle. A puddle that's creeping closer and closer to Eddie's face, which is lying, convulsing, on the floor... 
ON EDDIE'S EYES 
between convulsions, suddenly looking. Looking at the blood. It creeps closer to Eddie's face. Eddie is trying to move, trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there... 
And now he turns his face down into the blood. 
And begins to lap it up. 
INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - DAY 
The Thug finally gets the safe open. Inside is only one item - -the TATTOOED SECURITY MAN's SEVERED HAND. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
And its middle finger has been arranged in a vehement fuck- you. The thugs are not amused. 
INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The thugs are coming down the hall, muttering angrily... 
INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Mouth smeared with blood, Eddie is dragging himself by the elbows, across the room. Footsteps coming. Fast.

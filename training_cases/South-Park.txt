KYLE We HAVE to see this movie, dude! 
CARTMAN Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway. 
KYLE Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip! 
CARTMAN Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes. 
IKE Poo baba! 
STAN Wait! I've got an idea! 
EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER 
The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the Ticket Guy with the boys. 
HOMELESS GUY Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire. 
TICKET GUY You realize this movie is rated R? It may not be appropriate for your little ones. 
HOMELESS GUY Oh. (Turning to boys) Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate for you. 
STAN (Whispering) Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of Vodka and not forget about how miserable your life is and not stop the voices in your head then go right ahead. 
HOMELESS GUY Five tickets please. 
The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over. 
INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY 
The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink. 
IKE Purpre mama! 
KYLE Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting! 
ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN 
A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire' 
BOYS HOORAY!!! 
On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome Canadian star with a great body. 
PHILLIP Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest say to the Uranian gynecologist? 
PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally handsome in a more rugged way. 
TERRANCE I don't know, Phillip, what? 
Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. 
ANGLE - BOYS 
Laughing their asses off. 
KYLE That was sweet! 
STAN Where do they come up with this stuff?! 
CARTMAN How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking? 
KYLE Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike! 
CARTMAN Oh. 
IKE Poo bada! 
ANGLE - SCREEN 
TERRANCE You're such a pigfucker, Phillip! 
PHILLIP What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?! 
TERRANCE Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs. 
PHILLIP Oh yeah! 
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. 
ANGLE - BOYS 
KYLE Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they said? 
ANGLE - SCREEN 
Terrance pulls out a white envelope. 
TERRANCE Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter! 
PHILLIP A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master? 
TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from the film enters their innocent ears. 
TERRANCE It's from your mother. 
PHILLIP My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say? 
TERRANCE It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.' 
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. 
PHILLIP Oh, you fucking ball whore! 
The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy taking it all in. 
CARTMAN Wow... Ball whore... 
TERRANCE Listen, you donkey raping shit eater- 
KYLE (To himself) Donkey raping shit eater. 
Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He speaks with a rich English accent. 
GREGORY Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly brush. 
Stan looks at Gregory. 
STAN Who are you, kid? 
GREGORY My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time. 
WENDY Want to skate with us? 
GREGORY We've been skating all morning. And laughing and talking of memories past. 
Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to get Wendy's attention. 
STAN We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie! 
WENDY That's nice, Stan. 
Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected. 
KYLE Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy? 
STAN She's not my girlfriend, dude! 
Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around Cartman. 
CARTMAN Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said, "Who wants to touch me?!" 
A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's arm. 
SMALL BOY Oooooh... 
EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING 
Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background. 
It's a brand new day. 
EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY 
The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two mountain peaks. 
INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY 
The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing. 
KIDS Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're a shitsucking, cocksucking Unclefucka!! 
The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down. 
CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to be speaking. 
MR. HAT Okay, children, let's take our seats. 
As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality. 
MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT) We have a lot to learn and precious little time. 
Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt, except, of course, for Wendy. 
MR. GARRISON Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of Sigfried and Roy? 
KYLE It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison, it's Terrance and Phillip. 
KIDS TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!! 
Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan sulks. 
MR. GARRISON Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment. 
MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT) That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe. 
CARTMAN I hate the environment. 
KYLE Dude, how can you hate the environment? 
CARTMAN 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it. 
The kids all GASP! 
MR. GARRISON Eric! Did you just say the "F" word? 
CARTMAN Fragile? 
KYLE No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison. 
MR. GARRISON Kyle! 
CARTMAN Why the fuck not? 
MR. GARRISON Eric! 
STAN Dude, you just said fuck again. 
MR. GARRISON Stanly! 
KENNY Mph. 
MR. GARRISON Kenny! 
CARTMAN That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip can say something, I should be able to say it too! 
BEBE Wow, Cartman's cool! 
CLYDE He's like Terrance and Phillip! 
Cartman gloats proudly. 
CARTMAN Fuckin' a right. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code. 
A look of shock comes over the principal's face. 
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA Article 42!  You don't mean-?! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you. 
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA But I- 
KYLE'S MOTHER You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school! 
Kyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Get out of that chair! The PTA is in charge now! 
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 
The other school kids are in line for lunch. 
Just then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through the P.A. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Attention students. We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY. 
The kids look down. They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip shirts. 
KIDS HOOORAY!!! 
The kids all cheer and run out the door. Leaving the cafeteria absolutely empty... Except for Wendy. 
WENDY Hello? 
Wendy's hello echoes throughout the entire building. 
INT. TELEVISION SET 
A dapper NEWS ANCHOR sits behind a news desk. 
NEWS ANCHOR All over America, kids are flocking to the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'. Here with a special report, is a quadriplegic midget in a bikini. 
INT. SPELLING BEE - DAY 
A QUADRIPLEGIC MIDGET IN A BIKINI stands in front of the camera with a microphone. 
Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching indeed. All over America, children seem to be influenced.

We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka." 
The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and Puffy in that video they did in Vegas.  They wear shiny bright jumpsuits and lunge at the fish-eye lens of the camera. 
TERRANCE & PHILLIP (Singing) Shut your fucking face! Unclefucka!! 
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY 
The news anchor shakes his head in disgust. 
NEWS ANCHOR Thanks, midget. Shocking report.  The controversy surrounding the Terrance and Phillip movie began in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado where the local PTA banned the movie.  With us tonight is the head of the South Park PTA, Sheila Brofloski- 
A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed. The TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'. 
NEWS ANCHOR Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or is it Canada? 
KYLE'S MOTHER Canada! 
NEWS ANCHOR Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the Canadian Minister of Movies. 
A split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a goofy looking Canadian slides into the other. 
NEWS ANCHOR Thank you, Minister, for joining us. 
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES Thanks for having me, buddy. 
NEWS ANCHOR Minister, parents all over America are concerned about your country's entertainment. Your thoughts? 
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES Well, the film is R rated, and it's not intended for children- 
KYLE'S MOTHER Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!! 
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage- 
DOCTORS and NURSES are pushing Kenny into the operating room ER style. 
Everything is quick and chaotic. Shouts fill the hallway. 
NURSE CBC chem kit STAT!! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE LOAD THAT I.V. WITH 70CCS OF SODIUM PENTOTHAL!! 
INT. OPERATING ROOM 
It's mid-operation. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum! 
Another nurse hands him a sucker tube.  He immediately shoves into Kenny's skull.  It starts to slurp and burble. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Try to untangle his trachea and esophagus! 
NURSE Right! 
While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso, the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside out in the process. 
Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!! 
NURSE Watch his liver!!! 
Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the floor. 
ASSISTANT I'll get it!!! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE We have precious little time left people! We're going to lose him soon!! 
Suddenly, there is a long, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP. 
NURSE Doctor, his heart's stopped! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Crack him.  Let's get it out of there!!! 
Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE We need to zap this, quick! 
And runs it to the microwave.  He opens the door. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Who's making a potato? 
DOCTOR 2 My bad, sir.  I missed lunch. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this kid!!!!!! 
INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER 
Fade up from black.  We're close on Kenny's face.  His little eyes start to open. 
Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.  Stan and Kyle are there. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Kenny.  Kenny, can you hear me? 
Kenny stirs. 
KENNY (Weakly) Mph rmph rm... 
DOCTOR GAUCHE How are you feeling, son? 
KENNY mph.... rmph.... 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Great... Son, I have some bad news.  We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato.  You have about seven seconds to live. 
KENNY Mrm?! 
Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle. 
STAN Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny! 
KYLE You bastards!! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Damn it!  It never gets any easier! Anybody get the score of that Broncos game? 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM 
Kyle's mother is waiting with the rest of the parents. 
The nurse walks up to Kenny's parents with a sad expression. 
NURSE I'm sorry... 
Kenny's mother breaks down. 
KENNY'S MOTHER Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
KENNY'S DAD You bastards! 
KYLE'S MOTHER I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?! 
STAN'S MOTHER He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny. 
CARTMAN'S MOTHER You bastards. 
KYLE'S MOTHER This is it! The time for action is NOW!! (Singing) Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done! 
Everyone gathers around Kyle's mother. 
STAN'S MOTHER I agree! (Singing) Something must be done! We must take action fast! My child used to say 'please and thank you' Now he says suck my ass! 
CARTMAN'S MOTHER And my boy was the sweetest boy the world had ever known! until those damn Canadians brought that filth into our home! I agree that there is now a battle to be won! We can't just stand here singing! Something must be done! 
KENNY'S MOTHER But what are we going to do against the media machine? It's so big and powerful! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Right! And we can use that same media machine to exploit OUR cause!  We've got to let the whole world know what the Canadians did to your son! 
ANGLE - TELEVISION - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW 
Conan comes back from a commercial break. Sitting next to him, is Ms. Brooke Shields. 
CONAN O'BRIAN Our next guests have the number one movie in the world right now, please welcome Terrance and Phillip! 
A few cheers as Terrance and Phillip walk out on stage. A few boos as well, and we see that the South Park mothers are in the audience holding 'Anti-Terrance and Phillip' signs. 
Terrance and Phillip walk out and sit next to Brooke Shields. 
PHILLIP Hello, Conan! 
TERRANCE Hello, Brooke Shields! 
CONAN It's nice to have you here in America. 
PHILLIP Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all, we thought what the hell! 
CONAN O'BRIAN So guys... I understand you have a comedy routine worked out for us. 
PHILLIP We sure do, Conan. And here it is. Excuse me, Terrance. 
TERRANCE Yes, Phillip? 
Phillip rips a fart that launches Terrance backwards and into the band.  They both laugh wildly. 
PHILLIP Gotcha! 
Terrance and Phillip laugh. Nobody in the audience laughs. 
ANGLE - BOYS 
They laugh merrily. 
RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW 
TERRANCE Good one, Phillip!  Cheers. 
PHILLIP Cheers, Terrance! 
Terrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing nervous. He looks out into the audience... 
Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother nods back. 
CONAN O'BRIAN (Nervous) So, guys, I need to ask you a serious question... 
PHILLIP I just farted Terrance back into the stone age! 
They both laugh hard. 
Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh. 
BROOKE SHIELDS I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon! 
TERRANCE Nobody cares, Brooke Shields! 
CONAN O'BRIAN Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was it, to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie? Who is responsible for that? 
Terrance and Phillip exhange glances. 
TERRANCE Phillip, I think our friend Conan has been working too hard. 
CONAN O'BRIAN Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie! 
PHILLIP/TERRANCE (Together) It was our idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie. 
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE 
Kyle's mother is among them, listening to all this. 
KYLE'S MOTHER (Into her lapel) That's it!  Move, move, move!

PHILLIP This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us! (Pointing to Conan) You are a bad man! 
TERRANCE And you call yourself a Canadian! (To Phillip) I told you we should of done Leno! 
Conan O'Brian turns away, ashamed. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian. They're master manipulators. You did a good job. 
TERRANCE You loved our movie, Conan!  We watched it together.  You... You laughed! 
Conan grabs his head. 
CONAN O'BRIAN What have I done?!!! 
Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke Shields with blood. 
BROOKE SHIELDS AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight AAAGHGH!!!! 
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. Kyle's mother cradles Conan's lifeless body. 
KYLE'S MOTHER You see what your filth has caused? 
TERRANCE US?! This is your mess, outraged mother!! 
INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
KYLE'S MOTHER The Terrance and Phillip movie has obviously done irreparable damage to their brains.  We have to put them in rehab right away. 
KYLE What's that? 
KYLE'S MOTHER You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language. 
STAN'S MOTHER There are? 
Kyle's mother thinks for a second. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Well no, I guess not...  But we will establish the first of its kind right here in South Park.  All the children in town will have to attend and receive treatment from the school counselor Mr. Mackey!  Ooh I just love when I get these sorts of ideas! 
CARTMAN Why?  So you can fuck up our life some more? 
CARTMAN'S MOTHER Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way! 
CARTMAN But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem! 
INT. HELL - DAY 
Kenny walks through the black void of hell. A trippy, single shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes. 
KENNY Mphrmo? 
No answer... No nothing... 
Kenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground scaring the shit out of him. 
KENNY MPHR!! MMLY MMT! 
Suddenly, Kenny hears a CLAWING NOISE. It gets louder and louder. Kenny starts to run faster and faster. Now the clawing is RIGHT BEHIND HIM! Kenny spins around. He is face to face with SATAN! 
Satan looks down at Kenny and shoots flames out his nose. 
Kenny's eyes bulge open. 
KENNY MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!! 
SATAN Fallen one... We have such sights to show you! 
Kenny shakes. Satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across the room like a serpent, in a millisecond he is right up in Kenny's face. 
SATAN I am Satan. I am your God, now. 
KENNY MPH RM!!! 
Kenny tries to run away, but Satan again changes form, flies across the room and cuts Kenny off. 
SATAN Come with me. I will show you what delightful pain awaits. 
Two black DEMONS grab Kenny by the arms and start to lead him away. 
KENNY MMMMMPHPHP!!!! 
Just then, SADDAM HUSSEIN show up next to Satan. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!! 
SATAN You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?! 
Kenny's eyes grow wide. 
KENNY MMMPPH!!! 
EXT. REHAB CENTER - DAY 
Establishing shot of the small Betty Fordesque building. 
INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER 
The kids are sitting in chairs in a circle.  There are anti- drug signs on the walls: "Crack is Whack"; "Get High on Pottery"; and, "I Go From Zero to Bitch in .9 Seconds."  MR. MACKEY, the wiry school counselor, leads the group.  There's a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them. 
MR. MACKEY Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay. Now the sooner you recognize your problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you back to your third grade homeroom where you belong. 
KYLE But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our parents are over-reacting. 
BEBE Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even like Terrance and Phillip! 
Wendy looks bored. Stan tries to smile at her, but she doesn't even acknowledge him. 
Meanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat. 
CARTMAN Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal... 
MR. MACKEY Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you. 
He points at Gregory. The little British bastard from the lake. 
GREGORY My name is Gregory... And I have a potty mouth. 
Wendy looks at Gregory. Stan notices this. 
CARTMAN You've got a stupid accent too. 
MR. MACKEY Eric, that is not appropriate. 
CARTMAN What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear. 
MR. MACKEY Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think. 
GREGORY How are you gonna do that? 
Mr. Mackey crosses to a piano. He plays chords while speaking the following lines. 
MR. MACKEY There are times when you get suckered in, by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en. But it's when you do these things too much (Singing) That you've got to clear your head and get back in touch... 
Mr. Mackey plays the piano and sings: 
MR. MACKEY You can do it, it's all up to you, mkay? With a method, there's nothing you can't do, mkay? You don't have to spend your life addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand- jobs for cash as long as you follow this simple plan I'm fully convinced that it's, easy, mkay... 
The kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a chalkboard. 
The children all listen, wide-eyed. 
INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY 
TERRANCE The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it. 
PHILLIP Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up. 
KYLE'S MOTHER THAT IS ENOUGH!! 
TERRANCE WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors YOU from the world. 
KYLE'S MOTHER NO THEY DON'T! 
PHILLIP YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT- 
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP. 
Suddenly, the screen goes blank. A sign that says 'PLEASE STAND BY' comes on. 
INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER 
The kids all watch, wide-eyed. 
KYLE What happened? 
WENDY The station CONVENIENTLY went blank. 
INT. CANADIAN PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY 
The Canadian Prime Minister stands directly in front of camera, looking right at us. 
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER ATTENTION AMERICA!! You have taken our national treasure Terrance and Phillip. We, in turn, have taken yours... The Smothers Brothers! 
The Canadian Prime Minister steps out of the way, revealing the Smothers Brothers tied up in chairs behind him. 
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER I'll let you catch your breath... Now, release Terrance and Phillip, or else we will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers Brothers!! 
TOMMY SMOTHERS Please listen to them!! 
DICK SMOTHERS They're not fucking around!! 
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER We're not fucking around. This is not aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is aboot freedom... This is aboot respect. RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!! 
Another Canadian leans in and whispers in the Prime Minister's ear. 
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER Oh yeah... AND FUCK YOU, AMERICA! 
He raises his middle finger, but it's all blurred and digitized. 
INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER 
MR. MACKEY Okay kids, for today's rehabilitation activity, we're going to watch the Terrance and Phillip movie. 
STAN What?! 
KYLE Sweet! 
MR. MACKEY Now, this is an EDITED version of the movie, which was put out by the MPAA. That's the Motion Picture Association of America. 
WENDY Isn't that censorship? 
MR. MACKEY No the MPAA is NOT a censorship group. 
WENDY Why not? 
MR. MACKEY Uh... Because they say so... Mkay. Now I want you to watch this movie, with all the immature profanity taken out, and notice how much better a movie it becomes... 
Mackey puts the tape in and hits play. 
The TITLES come up 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire' Except that 'Asses' has been blurred out, and replaced with 'bunz'. 
KIDS HOORAY!!! 
The movie begins. Phillip walks in. But it isn't Phillip's voice, somebody has dubbed him over. 
DUBBED PHILLIP Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to pass gas near your head. 
DUBBED TERRANCE I would rather you didn't, Phillip. 
DUBBED PHILLIP Oh? Is that so? 
Phillip farts on Terrance. 
TERRANCE Oh, you are such a maroon! 
PHILLIP You would know, dummy. 
The boys look confused. 
TERRANCE You are pigeon-like in your intelligence. 
The pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh. Terrance throws a match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death. 
A TITLE comes up - THE END. 
And the credits roll. 
CARTMAN WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! 
KYLE Dude, they cut out 92 minutes! 
The lights in the theater come up. 
MR. MACKEY So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think? 
CARTMAN Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie. 
MR. MACKEY Eric, you're not watching your mouth! 
CARTMAN You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth! 
STAN That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me! 
KYLE I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude. 
STAN She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me! 
INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER 
The kids are all sitting in rows, wearing very crude 'Free Terrance and Phillip' buttons. 
MR. MACKEY Mkay, children, you've all made terrific progress, and are hereby done with the eight step program. 
The kids all AD LIB relief. 
CARTMAN Thank God, that sucked ass. 
MR. MACKEY Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word. 
CARTMAN The N word? 
MR. MACKEY (Reading) Norwegian Ass Raper. 
CARTMAN Oh yeah. 
MR. MACKEY The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today. 
The kids cheer. 
CARTMAN I don't graduate?! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?! THIS IS BULLSHIT?! 
Just then, Mackey notices the little buttons on everybody's shirts. 
MR. MACKEY Free Terrance and Phillip? Oh no... Mkay. 
KYLE (Proudly) We're protesting! 
STAN Yeah! 
MR. MACKEY Well, boys, it might interest you to know that your FRIENDS the Canadians have just bombed the U.S. 
STAN They did?! 
MR. MACKEY Yes, at six this morning they bombed the heck out of Cleveland. 
KYLE Oh. That doesn't count. 
WENDY They only bombed Cleveland because we're going to Execute two of their citizens!! 
MR. MACKEY Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay? 
CARTMAN HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?! 
MR. MACKEY No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you... 
Dramatic MUSIC sting. 
INT. HELL - DAY 
Kenny is chained up in a torture chamber in Hell.  Demons and ghouls surround him.

Kenny starts to cry. 
Saddam Hussein comes out from behind Satan holding a martini. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again. 
KENNY Mrph mprph!! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children. 
KENNY Mrph mprhm mm rmph! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun. 
SATAN (To Saddam) Saddam, would you let me do my job please! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants. 
KENNY Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Oh, you want out of hell, huh? 
SATAN Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT. 
KENNY Mrph? 
SADDAM HUSSEIN I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie! 
Saddam walks over to Kenny and releases his chains. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN (To Kenny) Well what are you waiting for pal?!  Get to it! 
Kenny runs out and away. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!! 
Saddam walks over and joins Satan on the couch. 
SATAN I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see? 
SATAN Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Hey, come here, guy. 
Saddam pulls Satan around and plants a big wet kiss on him. 
CARTMAN Very funny dickhead- 
BZZAAT!  The v-chip shocks Cartman. 
CARTMAN OW!  FUCK- 
BZZZAAAT!! 
CARTMAN AY! 
Cartman is thrown to the floor in a shivering heap. 
KYLE Whoa!  What the hell was that?! 
STAN Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses! 
Stan and Kyle look at each other.  Kyle smiles. 
KYLE Hey Cartman. 
CARTMAN What? 
KYLE You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are. 
CARTMAN Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit- 
BZAAAT! 
CARTMAN SHIT- 
BZZZAAAT!! 
CARTMAN FUCK- 
BZZAAAT!!  The cycle continues as Stan and Kyle laugh merrily watching Cartman flopping around on the floor. 
KYLE This is sweet!! 
STAN Totally! 
Garrison stands before his class. 
MR. GARRISON Okay, children, let's try a few new math problems. What is five times two? 
The kids all just sit there. 
MR. GARRISON Come on, children, do be shy, just give it your best shot. 
Clyde raises his hand. 
MR. GARRISON Yes, Clyde? 
CLYDE Twelve? 
MR. GARRISON Okay, now let's try to get an answer from somebody who's not a complete retard. Anyone? Come on don't be shy... 
Just then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi looking American soldiers. 
They walk over to the children and start pulling off their 'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins. 
STAN Hey, what are you doing? 
SOLDIER You can't wear these in school. It's against school policy, thank you. 
Another solider rips off Kyle's pin and replaces it with a yellow star. 
KYLE What's that for? 
SOLDIER 2 You get a star for doing well in school. 
Just as quickly, the soldiers make their way out the door. 
WENDY NAZIS!! 
STAN What's the matter, Wendy? 
WENDY Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand. 
STAN (To Kyle) God damn it, why does she keep saying that? 
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 
The boys are in line. Nazi-ish soldiers usher them through. 
STAN I'm so sick of these soldiers. 
KYLE Yeah, they suck. 
CARTMAN I know.  Always saying, do this, do that. They think they're so cooool. (To the soldier) Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler! (BZZZT) OW!!! 
The soldier glares at him. The boys walk into the kitchen, where they are greeted by their big, happy, black school CHEF! 
CHEF Hello there, children!! 
STAN Hey, Chef. 
CHEF How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles? 
KYLE We can't, we're on a hunger strike. 
CHEF A hunger strike? For what? 
STAN To free Terrance and Phillip. 
CARTMAN But you guys... It's Salisbury steak. 
STAN Chef, do you know anything about women? 
CHEF Ha! Is the Pope Catholic? 
KYLE I don't know. 
The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the rest of the crowd. 
Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed. 
CHEF Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle. 
CARTMAN Amen to that. 
INT. HELL - DAY 
Kenny is sadly walking around hell. He walks up to another one of hell's prisoners. 
KENNY Mph rmph rm rmph rm? 
GEORGE BURNS Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores? Beat it, kid. 
Kenny moves along. He hears some voices coming from a door. Kenny opens the door and peeps inside- 
INT. SATAN'S BEDROOM - KENNY'S POV 
Saddam and Satan are lying in bed. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself. 
SATAN I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself- 
Just then, Satan hears a reporter on CNN. 
TV In war news, countries from Europe and Asia are joining sides in the Canadian- American War- 
SADDAM HUSSEIN -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and forget about the whole thing- 
SATAN SHHH!!!! 
TV ...The death count is already on its way to 10 million with no signs of slowing down.  What started as a spat between the United States and Canada is quickly turning into World War III- 
Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks off the television and sits up in bed. 
SATAN It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank! 
SATAN No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign. 
Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient tome.  Satan turns the pages as he talks. 
SATAN Behold, the signs of my reign on earth are all falling into place!  The fall of an empire- 
He points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of Ceasar. 
SATAN -The coming of a comet- 
He points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth. 
SATAN Jerry Springer's movie doing more than ten million box office- 
A picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money. 
SATAN ....And now.... 
Satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall. It looks like Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head. 
SATAN The seventh sign!  When the blood of these Canadians touches American soil... It will be my time to rise!!!!! 
DRAMATIC music. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!! 
SATAN Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing. 
SATAN Is sex the only thing that matters to you? 
Saddam thinks for a second. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN I love you. 
Satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN You know I do. 
SATAN I know. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh? 
Satan reaches over and turns off the light.  Everything goes pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well. 
A beat. 
Then, a small moan from Satan. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch? 
EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY 
Stan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue. Stan is reading out of a huge book. 
KYLE Does it say what the clitoris is? 
STAN All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva? 
KYLE Isn't that in Arizona or something? 
Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away. 
The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it starts to burn. 
Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing. 
STAN What is this? 
KYLE Hey... It IS Cartman's mom!! 
Cartman looks at the screen. 
CARTMAN Oh, son of a bitch! (ZZAP!!) AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit! 
STAN Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman! 
Ike bounces in, happily. 
IKE Ber dada! 
KYLE Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff! 
IKE Papa mama simi. 
Ike bounces out. 
CARTMAN Come on, just get to the message board! 
KYLE I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame... 
Kyle furiously hits a bunch of keys. 
KYLE Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll try to reroute the encryptions... 
Kyle furiously hits a bunch more keys. 
STAN Dude, do you know what you're doing? 
KYLE No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works. 
Just then the screen pops up. Access Granted. 
KYLE Bingo. Okay, here we go... (Typing) Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night... 
CARTMAN Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch. 
KYLE We're not gonna have pie and punch! 
CARTMAN More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch! 
KYLE (Typing) pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is... 
The boys all think... 
STAN (Dramatically) La Resistance. 
Triumphant MUSIC cue. 
INT. KYLE'S ATTIC 
The door to the attic pops open.  Kyle shoves Ike up into the attic. 
KYLE You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay? 
IKE Uhh... 
KYLE Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed. 
The door closes and it is dark. 
Ike blinks. He looks out a small window, onto the street below. 
A few armed soldiers walk by. 
Ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to play. 
INT. PENTAGON - NIGHT 
Tons of MILITARY PERSONNEL are running to and fro. Giant computer screens show Canada's latest attacks. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des Moines!! 
PRESIDENT How can you tell? 
Everyone laughs merrily. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Good one, sir! 
Suddenly, a PENTAGON GUY runs up to the President, holding some papers. 
PENTAGON GUY Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing into Canadian computers! It looks like we may have a resistance movement starting... 
The President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms behind her back and her chest out. She has a few military badges on her. 
PRESIDENT (Showing her the papers) Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost! 
PRESIDENT Yes ma'am! 
The President starts to run off. 
KYLE'S MOTHER And Bill? 
PRESIDENT Yes? 
KYLE'S MOTHER I'm needing lunch. 
PRESIDENT Right away, ma'am! 
The president runs off. 
EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Establishing. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as more and more troops are needed to fight the Canadian forces... 
INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
SATAN (Gently) Sometimes I think When I look up real high That there's a whole world up there And just maybe it could be mine But then, I sink because it's here I'm supposed to stay but I don't even know how or why its supposed to be that way- 
Satan walks to his veranda. 
SATAN Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and live without a care... Up there 
Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly. 
SATAN They say I don't belong That my place is down below Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme? Without evil there could be no good So it must be good to be evil sometimes Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom. Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and life without a care... Up there 
PULL BACK, big crane shot rising above Satan. 
EXT. SMALL ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT 
A dim light is all that is visible from inside the small building. 
INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT 
Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La Resistance'. 
Cartman comes running in, he looks scared. 
KYLE You're late, Cartman! 
CARTMAN I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me. 
KYLE Your behind? 
CARTMAN I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass- (BBZZAATT) OW!!! 
KYLE Did you bring the pie and punch? 
CARTMAN No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy? (Looking over each shoulder) I don't think Kenny is dead. 
STAN What? 
CARTMAN I saw him last night! 
KYLE I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day. 
CARTMAN YOU DO?! 
KYLE Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby... 
Kyle and Stan laugh again. 
CARTMAN Hey!  I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I think he's haunting me. 
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! 
The boys all look scared. 
KYLE Somebody's here... 
The boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in front of their eyes. 
KYLE Who is it? 
VOICE Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance. 
KYLE What's the password? 
VOICE Uhh... I don't know. 
KYLE Guess. 
VOICE Uhh... Bacon. 
KYLE Okay. 
Kyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab stands there looking handsome and angelic. 
GREGORY Viva la Resistance. 
STAN Oh no, it's that kid. 
GREGORY This is the place-- 
Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes grow wide. 
STAN Wendy? 
WENDY Stan?! YOU started La Resistance? 
GREGORY Well, apparently you have a bigger heart than we thought. Let us get this meeting underway, there are others coming. 
Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes. 
INT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER 
Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of twelve. 
The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall. 
Stan and Kyle look nervous. 
STAN Everyone be seated, please. 
The kids all sit down. 
KYLE Wow, a lot of people showed up. 
STAN Yeah, so what do we say? 
KYLE I thought you had something planned. 
STAN Me?! 
Stan looks out over the faces. Gregory checks his watch. 
STAN (Nervous) Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, and we think that sucks ass!! 
Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle. 
GENERAL PLYMKIN Now what's wrong with this thing? 
General Plymkin messes with the controls. 
GENERAL PLYMKIN Fucking windows 98! 
General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with the cord in his hands. 
GENERAL PLYMKIN GET GATES IN HERE!!! 
BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS. 
GENERAL PLYMKIN YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET!!! 
BILL GATES It is faster, over five million-- 
Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. Gates falls to the floor, dead. 
GENERAL PLYMKIN Alright men, get lots of rest, and prepare thyselves for battle! 
INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT 
In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing the plan. 
GREGORY ...after you clear this zone here, rendezvous behind this ridge where Terrance and Phillip should be held. 
KYLE Gotcha. 
GREGORY You are indeed brave, but you will need someone who's done this sort of thing before.  MOLE! 
Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out) 
The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops THE MOLE.  He is a very bitter little nine year old French kid with a THICK French accent. 
VOICE Oui? 
GREGORY Thank you for coming, Mole. 
THE MOLE So... We must free more Canadian prizoners? 
KYLE Yeah, I guess. 
THE MOLE America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children. 
Stan and Kyle look at each other confused. 
GREGORY This is the Mole.  He will accompany you to the prison where Terrance and Phillip are.  He is an expert in covert operations and a lifelong fighter for freedom. 
THE MOLE Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine. 
Everyone stares at The Mole. 
GREGORY Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy is... kept safe? 
Stan gets pissed. 
KYLE Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me death!!! 
OTHERS YEA!!! 
Now, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder. 
GREGORY God has smiled upon you this day The fate of a nation in your hands... 
Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled. 
GREGORY As brothers and sisters we unite And behind you we shall fight! Until only the most righteous belief stands! 
The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox. 
GREGORY Do you see the distant flames? they bellow in the night Fight in all our names For what we know is right And if you all get shot and cannot carry on Though you die, La Resistance lives on! 
KYLE What? Shot? 
Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join in the song. 
KIDS You might get stabbed in the head by a dagger or a sword You might be burned to death or skinned alive or worse! 
GREGORY But when they torture you You will not feel a need to run For though you die, La Resistance Lives on! 
KIDS Do you hear the beating drum? It is our hearts all joined to one It is the music of our souls knowing we have much to overcome! 
As THE SONG CONTINUES we- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT 
The MAC Mothers are on a stage, preparing two electric chairs. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Something must be done! Tomorrow it will be! We're going to execute this threat to our democracy! 
All the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with American flags. Kenny's mother is counting money she has made from selling t-shirts. 
M.A.C. MOTHERS And after that our kids will be safe from all the Canadian scum! The time is now the time is here Tomorrow something will be done! 
The song still CONTINUES as we 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HELL - CONTINUOUS 
Satan stands on his veranda. 
SATAN I want to be part of that world! But if only I had the strength to go without HIM... If only I had the strength to leave him behind... Get on with my life in that world... Start over as part of that world... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MILITARY BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS 
KYLE'S MOTHER Let's hear it again for the one and only Winona Ryder!!! 
The same guy claps again. 
ONE CLAPPING GUY We love you, Winona! 
Everybody else in the audience just stares at him. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Next up we have a special treat... Please welcome, direct from Vegas- BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY EXPERIENCE!!! 
The place goes wild as Big Gay Al walks out on stage.  Winona fumes in the wings. 
RANDOM SOLDIER This guy is the coolest! 
RANDOM SOLDIER 2 Totally man! 
The back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set complete with a waterfall, hippos, monkeys and hundreds of colorfully dressed dancers. 
BIG GAY AL How we all feeling tonight?! 
Between the cheering, we hear a throng of "Happy!". Now the place is rocking!! Everybody loves Big Gay Al! 
Winona can't believe it. 
BIG GAY AL I can't hear you... 
CROWD Happy!!! 
BIG GAY AL Friends, you know why I'm here... I'm here to teach TOLERANCE!! 
The crowd cheers. 
BIG GAY AL I'm here to say that we're all PEOPLE under God, and we should embrace, and accept our differences!! 
The crowd cheers louder. 
BIG GAY AL And that means we should LOVE CANADIANS TOO!! 
The entire place goes incredibly quiet. 
You can hear a pin drop. 
Silence... 
Deafening silence... 
BIG GAY AL JUST KIDDING!! FUCK 'EM!!! 
Slow music swells in. Big Gay Al saunters around the stage and starts to sing. 
BIG GAY AL (Singing) Bombs are flying People are dying Children are crying Politicians are lying too Cancer is killing Texaco is spilling The whole world's gone to hell But how are you? 
Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all his dancers dash to his side. 
BIG GAY AL I'm super!  Thanks for asking! All things considered I'm doing super I must say! Very peachee Nothing bugs me 'Cause everything is super when you're -don't you think I look cute in this hat? 
The crowd is absolutely confused. 
BIG GAY AL I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple But I just can't feel bad for you right now Because I'm feeling so insanely super That even seeing you in that chair can't bring me down! 
EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ANOTHER AREA 
Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to building. He is scared out of his mind. 
CARTMAN (Imitating the Mole) Shut of ze Power, Cartman. Zis is very important, Cartman... Stupid British piece of shi- (BAZZT!) OW! 
He approaches the electrical box.  Just as he's about to open it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.  Cartman gets scared and hides in the shadows.  The soldiers continue walking... 
AMERICAN SOLDIER Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big Gay AL! 
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2 Me too!! 
...And pass a terrified Cartman. 
EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA 
The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return. 
KYLE I don't think he's coming back, dude. 
Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater. 
TICKET GUY Oh thank you! Thank you for getting me out of there!! They locked me up for selling movie tickets to minors! 
THE MOLE Is this one of zem? 
KYLE No! That's not Terrance or Phillip! 
THE MOLE Oh... Alright, back you go. 
The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole. 
TICKET GUY No! Please! I don't want to go back!! 
The boys sit back down and wait again. 
EXT. USO SHOW/STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Meanwhile, Big Gay Al's song continues- 
BIG GAY AL I'm super! Thanks for asking! All things considered I'm doing better than okay! Feeling peaches nothing bugs me Everything is super when you're -don't you think I look cute in this hat and my little shoes and this matching tie that I got at Merv's?

CHORUS He's super! Thanks for asking! All things considered he is better than okay! And it's peachee, nothing bugs him Everything is super when you're- Let's fight fight fight against Canada today!!!!!! 
The song ends and everyone erupts into applause. 
INT. HELL - DAY 
Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball. Saddam isn't around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out. 
THE MOLE Now the light, she fades And darkness closes in But I will find strength I will find pride within Because although I die Our freedom will be won Though I die Ze Resistance Lives on... 
The Music fades away, as the Mole coughs up some blood. 
THE MOLE It's so very cold... 
KYLE We can't leave without you! 
THE MOLE It's okay, I am done for. 
KYLE No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!! 
The Mole coughs up more blood. 
THE MOLE Where is your God when you need him? Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot now? 
The Mole dies. 
KYLE SHIT! 
VOICE FREEZE!! 
The boys look up to see three large MARINES pointing guns at them. 
Stan makes a run for it. He dashes off at full speed. 
KYLE Run, Stan!! 
One of the soldiers fires at him. PWANG! PWANG! But Stan disappears into the night. 
PENTAGON GUY Forget him! The night will swallow him up. 
MARINE You are under arrest!  Cuff 'em! 
KYLE What? 
PENTAGON So THIS must be the resistance the pentagon has been tracking! 
CARTMAN Oh, son of a bitch... 
EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT 
Kyle's mother, and the other mothers of MAC, take the stage again. 
KYLE'S MOTHER And now, for our big finale, the MOMENT YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!! 
Terrance and Phillip are wheeled out onto the stage. 
TERRANCE Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good. 
PHILLIP I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time. 
From the other side, Kyle's mom appears with a couple of official looking military people.  The crowd cheers. 
KYLE'S MOM It is my pleasure to present to you, THE EXECUTION OF TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!! 
The crowd cheers. 
KYLE'S MOM Strap them in! 
Terrance and Phillip are then greeted by the EXECUTIONER, donned in a black hood. 
The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and puts them into electric chairs. 
KYLE'S MOM Today is a great day for democracy! 
The crowd cheers. 
The Executioner steps up to the throw switch. 
TERRANCE Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco. 
PHILLIP I know, Terrance. I know. 
EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT 
LONG SHOT of a desolate, dark area. 
It has started to rain. Stan trudges through the wilderness looking tired and scared. 
STAN Hello? Where the hell am I? Is anybody here? 
A few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on. 
STAN MARCO!!! 
No answer. 
STAN MARCO!!! 
No answer. Stan stumbles a bit. 
STAN Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy... 
Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and his head smacks against a rock. 
Stan is out cold. 
Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his flashlight around. 
STAN What is that? 
The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on something that is huge and throbbing. 
STAN OH MY GOD!!! 
EXT. STAGE - NIGHT 
Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip. 
KYLE'S MOM Gentlemen, do you have any last words? 
PHILLIP Terrance! NO! 
KYLE'S MOTHER DIE!!!!!! 
SLOW MOTION SHOT - 
Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach. 
Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down, down... 
Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!! 
CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes. 
CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground... 
BACK TO REAL TIME 
Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames and ash take over the sky. 
Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle. 
SATAN RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!! 
Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on both sides can't believe what they're seeing. 
Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off and looks around. 
EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT 
As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike huddle close to each other in a trench. 
CARTMAN Kyle... All those times I said you were a big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew. 
Kyle thinks. 
KYLE Yes I am! 
IKE Baba mama! 
Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the boys' heads. 
CARTMAN AGH! (Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand) What the hell am I still holding this for?! 
Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice. 
MR. GARRISON Mr. Hat! Noooooo! 
Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench. 
KYLE Stan! 
STAN Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now! 
KYLE Sweet. 
CARTMAN (Sarcastic) Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's well that ends well, huh? We can go home now. There's just one little thing left to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!! 
More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys. 
Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys. 
CARTMAN/KYLE AGAGAH!!! 
CARTMAN It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to take us to the netherworld!

KENNY Mph rmph rm rmph rm! 
CARTMAN Okay!  We can get you some proofs of purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny!  Just mellow the heck out! 
EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT 
More battle. People are dying left and right. 
The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows the Canadian's head clean off. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Hey, pal, don't lose your head. 
Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead, and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled shotgun. 
CANADIAN SOLDIER I'm glad you got that off your chest. 
Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian through the head with his bayonet. 
TOM I guess he got the point. 
A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes. 
CANADIAN SOLDIER 2 Plastics are a cheap and efficient insulator for electrical applications. 
Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush in. 
SATAN Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another! 
The soldiers all look scared and puzzled. 
SATAN You're all part of Satan's army now! 
KYLE'S MOTHER What the hell is going on?! 
Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face. 
SATAN I am the dark master! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz! 
SATAN SILENCE!  I AM SATAN! 
Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared.  He appeals to Cartman. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Hey buddy!  No need to stress! Let me make you a deal!  How about a lifetime supply of Snacky Smores and we just forget about this whole thing?! 
KYLE Don't listen to him, Cartman! 
KENNY Mrphmmmph!!! 
CARTMAN (giving in)  Okay.  (then)  Not. 
Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the worst words in the world. 
Then, it comes out.  Like a volcano. 
CARTMAN SUCK THE HOT SHIT FROM MY GURGLING ASS YOU BLOOD DRENCHED FROZEN TAMPON ON A STIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZATTTTTTTTT!!!!! 
A huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam.  Saddam is thrown back against the wall. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN (To Satan) What are you waiting for, bitch?! Destroy him!! 
Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks... 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket! Save me!! 
Satan stands there. 
SATAN Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much! 
SATAN If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching! 
SATAN I don't care!  I want to talk about it now! 
Saddam grabs Satan by the arm. 
SATAN Ow, you're hurting me! 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed. 
Satan starts getting really mad.  Steam starts coming from his nostrils. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Your little problems can wait til later, see? 
Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut! 
SATAN THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!! 
Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming cliff, back into the depths of hell. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!! Heeeeyyyy guyyyyy, relaaaaaxx..... 
CHEF Saddam Hussein is dead! 
STAN AND KYLE Hooray!!! 
Everyone cheers. 
PHILLIP You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy! 
TERRANCE Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words! 
CARTMAN Well, I learned it all from you guys. 
PHILLIP Of course you did, cock fuck! 
They all laugh merrily. 
Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam fell. 
SATAN He spent so much time convincing me I was weak and stupid that I believed it myself. 
The boys look at each other, confused. 
SATAN Saddam didn't respect me.  All he wanted was sex.  But it took me so long to figure that out. 
He starts to cry.  Chef hands him a hanky. 
CHEF Here you go Satan- 
SATAN Thank you. Give me the proofs of purchases. 
Kenny hands them to Satan. 
SATAN Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any wish you want is yours. 
TRACK IN slowly on Kenny. MUSIC BUILDS. Finally, Kenny speaks. 
KENNY Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm. 
Everyone GASPS!! 
KYLE WHAT? 
STAN Are you sure, Kenny? 
SATAN What did he say? 
STAN He said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back. 
CHEF Kenny, you realize this wish is the only chance for YOU not to be dead... 
KENNY M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm. Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm. 
Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand, important speech.

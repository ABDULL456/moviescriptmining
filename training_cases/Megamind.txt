HEADLINES flash before us, displaying their accompanying photographs. 
"UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND! 
PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of METRO CITY. 
"UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!" 
PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings. 
"MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!" 
PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a METALLIC GAUNTLET. 
The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored glove. 
We ZOOM IN to the last headline. 
"MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!" 
PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his hips, obviously trying to accentuate the "U" insignia on his chest. 
END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE 
EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the exact same position. 
WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city below. A perfect view for our guardian hero. 
He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day. 
Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's expression. 
UBERMAN You look so peaceful from up here. 
His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND coming from his wrist. 
He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm. It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter "U". 
UBERMAN (CONT'D) Looks like Roxanne's in trouble again. 
Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off into the distance like a speeding bullet. 
EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT 
Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and wonder - now home to a great evil. 
INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY 
The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have an obvious function FLASH and HUM. 
A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM- SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP. 
He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE WITH A GIANT GREEN "M" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES. 
Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS. 
A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI. The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board, is dressed as the philosopher PLATO. 
EINSTEIN I hate the outfits. I mean, I get it: we're all supposed to be "masterminds" - very clever. (MORE) EINSTEIN(cont'd) I just feel stupid. I mean, what the hell did Einstein really do anyway? 
PLATO Theory of relativity. 
Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side. 
EINSTEIN Well, you'd think he'd invent a wool sweater that didn't itch so much. 
Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein. 
Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right shoulder and turns around. 
He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with his metal gauntlet. 
MASTER MIND The real Einstein once said, "God does not play dice with the world." He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood? 
DA VINCI & PLATO Sir! Yes, sir! 
EINSTEIN (gasping for air) Yes, sir. 
MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR) Actually, I wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend. 
A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping Metro City's protector. 
Totally unfazed, our hero stares on. 
UBERMAN You can't possibly believe this will work. 
Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED BUTTON on it. 
MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR) Oh, can't I? I have attained control of the Earth's most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED POWER OF THE SUN!!! 
He presses the button. 
EXT. OUTER SPACE 
A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS. 
The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the burning star's power. 
The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power. 
INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory. 
PLATO We're now at minimum safe distance, master. 
Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box. 
MASTER MIND Excellent. Stop here, I like this view. 
PLATO Twenty seconds until impact. 
Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored. 
Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage. 
MASTER MIND Any last words? 
Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile. 
UBERMAN (ON MONITOR) Yes: there's no caging the power of justice. 
PLATO Ten seconds to impact. 
On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in his hands. He yanks...NOTHING. 
PLATO (CONT'D) Nine... 
Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused. 
PLATO (CONT'D) Eight... 
Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as leverage. 
MASTER MIND (genuinely concerned) What's going on? 
UBERMAN (straining) Hold...on...a second. 
Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness. 
PLATO Seven... 
Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS. 
UBERMAN SON OF A BITCH!! 
Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison. 
Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears. 
DA VINCI What did he just say? 
PLATO Six......Five... 
Master Mind begins to laugh. 
MASTER MIND What kind of trick is this? 
Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression. 
UBERMAN Like you don't know. These bars are made of copper, aren't they? 
PLATO Four... 
MASTER MIND Yeah, so? 
Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand. 
SPINNING HEADLINE: "UBERMAN'S DEATH IGNITES CITY WIDE CRIME WAVE!" 
ARMORED TRUCK 
It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS. 
We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER. 
Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally. 
SPINNING HEADLINE: "CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF HOOLIGANS." 
METRO CITY BANK 
Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding BAGS OF MONEY. 
Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley. 
After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after them. 
The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the driver's wheel. 
They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done. 
SPINNING HEADLINE: "MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!" 
A VICIOUS TORNADO 
It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the lackeys coolly look on. 
Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of CASH. 
The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks. 
Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado. 
MASTER MIND (absentmindedly) Oh, right. 
Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death. 
He presses the button marked "Tornado Off." 
The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city. 
As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it melancholy? 
END OF MONTAGE 
EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY 
It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL. 
INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY 
HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING BALL. 
HAL It's a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove. 
He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball, following it with his eyes. 
It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL. 
An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth looks over at him. 
HAL Okay, do something like that - but center it more. 
She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim. 
ATTRACTIVE BLOND Tell me how my form looks, honey. 
Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson administration era derriere. 
HAL Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin' REAL good. 
It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig. 
VINNIE (O.S.) Hal, I want to see you in my office! 
Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling him. 
VINNIE Now! 
INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk. 
VINNIE You're fired. Leave your shirt and locker key. 
This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train. 
Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the arm. 
FRANK Come on into my office, sweetie. 
INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns toward his door. 
FRANK Can we get this woman some water for God's sake? (to Rebecca) I gave you two months off. What're you doing back? People are gonna think I'm a slave driver. 
ROXANNE Aren't you? 
FRANK Yeah, but I don't want people to think it. 
ROXANNE Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work. 
FRANK ...You're hysterical, aren't you? 
Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM EMBRACE. 
ROXANNE What're you doing? 
FRANK Keeping you warm before you go into shock. (toward the open door) DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND HERE? 
A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it on the table in front of them and leaves. 
Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to face him. 
ROXANNE It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work. 
There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank. 
FRANK Well, that's going to be... 
ROXANNE I thought you'd be happy to have me back. 
FRANK Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, but... 
ROXANNE Yes? 
FRANK Things have sorta...changed. 
ROXANNE In three weeks? 
FRANK Listen, I'm not one who likes to open up wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab, but you were sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on Uberman. And now that he's gone...I moved Brad into your anchor spot. 
ROXANNE (disgusted) Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot. 
FRANK It's the suits. They think it's time to switch things up. 
ROXANNE Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story. 
FRANK C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the nature of what we do. They used you, you used Uberman. Everybody's happy. 
ROXANNE (defensive) I didn't use him. 
FRANK Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you two were in love or something. My bad. 
ROXANNE We were. 
FRANK And that's great. 
ROXANNE Very in love. 
There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if she's failed to convince even herself of this. 
ROXANNE Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot? 
FRANK ...Human interest. 
ROXANNE Bake sales and pet stories. 
FRANK I told them I wouldn't be surprised if you just upped and quit. You busted your ass for that desk. 
Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her pride 
ROXANNE I'll take it. 
Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing. 
FRANK What? 
EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT 
Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century Gothic architecture. 
LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY. 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT 
INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY 
Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console as he speaks to Plato. 
MASTER MIND (into phone) A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it. 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
PLATO Then you are absolutely going to love this - 
We follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN. 
PLATO - He volunteers at a school for the blind. 
INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY 
Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair. 
MASTER MIND He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul. 
EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY 
From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child who's sitting on a rock. But up close... 
HAL You greedy little bastard. I already gave you a twenty. 
BLIND KID Hey, you want me to play along? Then pay up, bitch! 
HAL Fine, but you better be convincing. 
He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them. 
HAL Here she comes, go to work. 
Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his hands and begins to cry. 
BLIND KID (weeping) Why can't I see! Why God? 
Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder. 
HAL Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me look at you. 
The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance. 
The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark sunglasses - he should get an Oscar. 
HAL You know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there. 
BLIND KID You really think so, Hal? 
HAL Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying? Now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended. 
The boy stands up and is about to take off. 
HAL Petey, wait a minute. 
Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boy's face before sending him on his way. 
The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to absolutely melt. 
HAL Don't run into anything! 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should be next in line for popehood. 
PLATO I think I've seen enough, sir. This is your guy. 
MASTER MIND (O.S.) (over radio) Then return to base. We have much work to do. 
Plato starts up the van and pulls away. 
INT. BAR - DAY 
It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting pool as the bartender slings drinks. 
Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him. 
As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site. 
He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back to the TV. A plan of attack is forming. 
HAL (obviously playing it up for the woman's benefit) Oh, there it is again. This is really getting embarrassing now. 
The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take. 
ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man who saved that woman   and her baby the other day! It is   you, isn't it? 
TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them, OVERHEARS. 
MASTER MIND Follow him. 
INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a minefield. 
Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights wobble and streak like a hallucination. 
He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks worse. 
Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a chair. The room begins to swim. 
His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him. 
From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it. 
CAT You don't look so good, man. 
HAL I don't feel good. I was struck by freaking lightening. 
Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him. 
HAL (CONT'D) AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk? 
CAT No, you're just hallucinating. By the way, we're out of orange juice. 
HAL AAAAAAHHHHH! 
Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table. 
INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Hal lies in the same position we left him last night. 
He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst hangover in the world. 
Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not really sure what he's looking for. 
HAL Man... 
Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator. 
He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth. It's empty. 
As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself. 
He shakes the thought from his mind. 
BATHROOM 
Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants. 
HAL'S FACE 
He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content look washes over his face. 
There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and SPLINTERING. 
The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM SMASHING THE TOILET. 
HAL (CONT'D) Oh, God! 
He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL. 
HAL (CONT'D) Oh, God! 
He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window. 
HAL (CONT'D) Oh, God! 
He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way. 
Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole. 
He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the stop. 
HAL Wait! 
He starts running after it. 
ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING. 
HAL (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls back to the ground. 
Hal backs away and trips over a box. 
"PAT MORITA" Calm. All things must be filtered through calmness. 
HAL Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to freak out. 
"PAT MORITA" I think we must work on your attitude first. 
HAL Look I'm gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you don't get out of here. 
Pat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm. 
"PAT MORITA" Are you calm now? 
HAL Yeah, I'm okay. 
Pat slaps him across the face hard. 
"PAT MORITA" Good, because we've got a lot of work to do. 
Hal grabs his jaw. 
HAL What the hell was that for? 
"PAT MORITA" Rule number one: expect the unexpected. 
HAL Can you just tell me what this is all about? 
"PAT MORITA" The heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone. You are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity. 
HAL That's me alright. 
"PAT MORITA" I am to train you so you may fulfill your destiny to defeat the great menace to Metro City: Master Mind. 
Pat gets up and walks toward the door. 
"PAT MORITA" (CONT'D) Come. 
HAL We're are we going? 
"PAT MORITA" To train. 
EXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY 
Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up and down. 
"PAT MORITA" Strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle. Remember, both need to be exercised. 
We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head. He's hardly straining. 
HAL I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!! 
Pat leans on the HORN. 
"PAT MORITA" Hey, Corky? You listening? 
Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a "hello." 
HAL Yeah, work both muscles. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest. 
"PAT MORITA" Trust me. 
HAL What are you doing!? 
"PAT MORITA" An invulnerability test. Something wrong? 
HAL Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to get shot. Do not fire that thing! 
Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun. 
"PAT MORITA" You're bulletproof. 
HAL Okay, do you know that for sure? 
Pat quickly aims and fires. 
Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets off his chest. 
"PAT MORITA" I do now. 
Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch. 
HAL You suck. 
EXT. SKY - DAY 
She tosses it in a nearby garbage can. 
ROXANNE (CONT'D) Of course I already ate half of it. I wonder what that says about my character? 
"JOHN CUSACK" It means you don't give up on a sandwich. You see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to be all it can be. 
Roxanne smiles at his analogy. 
ROXANNE Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It might have been okay at first, but I just made it bitter. 
John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade. 
"JOHN CUSACK" Is that what happened with your last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend? 
ROXANNE When I look back, I probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one of those go out and save the world types. 
"JOHN CUSACK" I've run into a few. 
ROXANNE I was selfish, I guess. I didn't want to share him with anybody else. 
"JOHN CUSACK" It sounds like he was a special man. 
ROXANNE They broke the mold. 
John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner. 
"JOHN CUSACK" Perhaps not. 
INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY 
Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not unlike Uberman's except for a giant "T" on his chest. (From here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN) 
TITAN What's the "T" stand for? 
"PAT MORITA" Titan. 
TITAN What's that supposed to mean? 
"PAT MORITA" It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's father...oh, just go with it. You look perfect. 
TITAN I don't think this mask is big enough. Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me? 
"PAT MORITA" It's fine, just don't slouch. It's all in the posture. 
He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa. 
"PAT MORITA" (CONT'D) It is time. 
INT. BANK - DAY 
There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window. 
Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank. 
John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an immediate panic. 
JOHN Alright folks, this is a robbery. Nobody moves - yadda, yadda, yadda... 
Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills into a bag. 
As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head. 
GEORGE The safe. Let's go. 
BANK MANAGER Okay, just don't hurt anyone. 
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
George leads him out by the collar. 
CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold superhero stance with hands on hips. 
TITAN Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster. 
Paul cocks his gun. 
PAUL What are you suppose to be? 
We move in for a nice dramatic close up. 
TITAN Justice. 
GEORGE Well, justice, suck on this... 
George, John and Paul open fire on Titan. 
He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him. 
With their guns empty the three just stare at him in amazement. 
Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads "Metro's New Hero: Tighten." 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) No matter, I suppose. 
Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace around the room with his arms folded behind his back. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) We've now fully established Titan as Metro City's hero. They will love him just as they loved Uberman. Everything is going according to plan. 
Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear. 
EINSTEIN (whispering) Yeah, if the plan is getting us in jail. 
Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over, standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen. 
MASTER MIND You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself. 
EINSTEIN I just fail to see the point in all of this. I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? I mean, Uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to...to... 
MASTER MIND To what? 
EINSTEIN I don't know. To take over the weather, space, the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do. 
MASTER MIND The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over. 
Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off his wig and throws it to the floor. 
EINSTEIN That's it! This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's with me? 
MASTER MIND You dare? 
EINSTEIN Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing stupid costumes, and I'm sick of working for a super villain who's turning into a softie. 
Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to Master Mind for his rebuttal. 
MASTER MIND What - did - you - call me? 
EINSTEIN You heard me. You used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you. You're creating super heroes, you don't go with us on robberies anymore, it's been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing. 
MASTER MIND THAT is none of your business, knave! 
EINSTEIN Hey, you guys haven't sealed the deal yet, have you? 
MASTER MIND Silence! 
EINSTEIN (In a woman's voice) Oh, Master, your head is so big. 
MASTER MIND I'm warning you, Einstein. 
EINSTEIN (In a woman's voice) Take me! 
MASTER MIND I said silence! 
With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the throat and lifts him into the air. 
Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of Master Mind's grip. 
Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the floor. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) Get out of my sight. 
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a fancy restaurant. 
ROXANNE Don't get me wrong, I love being a reporter. I don't think I could do anything else. It's the consequences of what we do that I'm having a problem with. 
He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine. 
"JOHN CUSACK" That's where journalistic responsibility comes in, no? 
ROXANNE It's supposed to. 
"JOHN CUSACK" Sounds to me like you're running from something. 
ROXANNE I got someone I cared about killed. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved. 
John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing what she's talking about. 
He reaches across the table and takes her hand. 
"JOHN CUSACK" You can't blame yourself. My father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive. 
ROXANNE Was he an actor? 
"JOHN CUSACK" ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a horrible one. I mean he would fail time and time again at his...landscaping. And sometimes he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail - 
ROXANNE Jail? 
"JOHN CUSACK" My point is he took the good with the bad. He grew a little each time. Improved, learned. 
INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty. 
ROXANNE Damn. 
She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe. 
EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING 
Roxanne steps outside. 
ROXANNE Please be open. 
Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on. 
ROXANNE (CONT'D) Thank God. 
She walks across the street, passing in front of Master Mind's car. 
Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat. 
Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence. 
Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into the store. 
INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the counter. 
ROXANNE A pack of Lady Strikes, please. 
EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT 
Master Mind is talking on his cell phone. 
MASTER MIND Hello, Triple A? 
He suddenly spots something across the street. 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out a gun from under his coat. 
EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT 
Master Mind stares in shock. 
MASTER MIND I'll call you back. 
He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the store. 
INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full of cash from the register. 
SHOPKEEPER Hey! 
SHOTGUN HOODLUM Shut up, Gramps. 
He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her neck. 
SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D) Gimme that necklace! 
ROXANNE I don't think so. 
The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun. 
SHOTGUN HOODLUM I said give it to me! 
MASTER MIND (O.S.) The lady said no. 
The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs and blinking lights. 
The hoodlum starts to laugh. 
SHOTGUN HOODLUM What the hell's that? A super soaker? 
MASTER MIND No, it's a goo gun. 
The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind. 
SHOTGUN HOODLUM Yeah, what's it do? 
MASTER MIND It goos. 
Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store in a cloud of SMOKE. 
The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL, covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK. 
MOMENTS LATER 
Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN. Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run around in chaos. 
TITAN Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait a sec - 
He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization. 
TITAN (CONT'D) THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!! 
EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home. Reporters stand just beyond the police line. 
TITAN Crap. 
From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita. 
TITAN (CONT'D) PAT! 
Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms. 
TITAN (CONT'D) You okay? 
"PAT MORITA" I'm dying, kid. There is just one last lesson I have for you. It is the most important of all. 
TITAN What's that? 
"PAT MORITA" Master Mind did this, you must avenge me. 
TITAN Master Mind? Why? 
"PAT MORITA" Because he's evil. You must stop the evil Hal - stop the... 
Pat's body goes limp. 
The cameras begin to pop and flash around them. 
Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully over him. The reporters rush over. 
REPORTER 1 Tighten, Is this the work of Master Mind? 
REPORTER 2 How will the death of your mentor affect your resolve? 
REPORTER 3 Was that Pat Morita? 
Titan walks up to one of the cameras. 
TITAN This injustice will not go unpunished. Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you. 
In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher. 
PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing dead. 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT 
Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy. 
MASTER MIND Alright, people, we don't have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out. 
There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall being tinkered with by Da Vinci. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) How's the death ray coming? 
DA VINCI Nearly up to full power, sir. 
MASTER MIND Hum. Let's turn it down a few notches. It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we? 
Plato enters the room. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) Anything on the radar yet? 
PLATO Not yet, sir. 
MASTER MIND I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed? 
PLATO All twelve. 
Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on his throne. 
MASTER MIND Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me. 
They move to either side of the chair. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) No slouching. 
Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut. 
They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no Titan. 
MASTER MIND What do I think? 
Master Mind shakes his head tiredly. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) I think you're probably the biggest idiot I've ever met. I mean, I can't believe you. All your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. You know what? Your kind of people make me sick. 
Titan puts down his drawing. 
TITAN I worked hard on this. 
MASTER MIND Oh - gee - I am so sorry! 
Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) (under his breath) Of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser. 
This strikes a cord with Titan. 
TITAN Now, hold on. You're going a little too far. 
MASTER MIND I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache. 
TITAN Hey, I mean it. 
Master Mind gets right in his face. 
MASTER MIND Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? 
EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
We see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land in a DUMPSTER across the street. 
A car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out and runs to help his master. 
DA VINCI Master! 
MASTER MIND (O.S.) It hurts. 
Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body cushioned by a stack of trash bags. 
DA VINCI What hurts? 
MASTER MIND It! 
The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall. 
TITAN I don't need you, I don't need anybody. I have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, I'm gonna take back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, it's time for Titan to collect. 
Titan shoots up into the air. 
TITAN (CONT'D) Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY THE WAY I WANT TO FLY! 
He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were piloting an invisible jet. 
Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan disappear into the distance. 
DA VINCI How'd the plan go, boss? 
MASTER MIND I just made myself redundant, old friend. 
Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff. 
DA VINCI It's not that bad. 
INT. BANK - DAY 
Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks nostalgic. 
A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his TV idol. 
SECURITY GUARD Morning, Tighten. 
TITAN Morning. 
SECURITY GUARD Is there something we can do for you? 
TITAN Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just here to make a withdrawal. 
Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration from all. 
A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good- natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault. 
The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK OF CASH. 
Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out the door. 
The bank manager comes over to the guard. 
BANK MANAGER Say, did he just rob us? 
MASTER MIND There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me. 
TITAN Really? 
Titan melodramatically throws up his arms. 
TITAN (CONT'D) I guess I should leave town then, huh? 
MASTER MIND I have a better idea - NOW! 
Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan. 
Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars, tries to pull them apart but can't. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) That's copper my good man. Your one weakness. (MORE) MASTER MIND(cont'd) For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect. 
Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW. 
As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from under the street in front of him. 
Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded. 
Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops. 
TITAN You know what? You're nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort. 
He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the street. 
Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They watch Titan shrink into the distance. 
MASTER MIND He's not as dumb as I thought. 
PLATO I guess not...Funny, though. 
MASTER MIND What's funny? 
PLATO Funny Uberman didn't think of the same thing. 
EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY 
As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city below. 
Suddenly, something catches his attention. 
HAL That's it! 
He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below. 
The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane. 
HAL Hello, Legacy. 
EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY 
Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a COMMOTION. 
They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL from the top of the establishment. 
VINNIE Hey, that's my ball! 
INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in. 
ELDERLY WOMAN That was a close one. Sixth floor, please. 
Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button. 
The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the floor unconscious. 
INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her living room. 
We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to adjust her vision. 
Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear. 
It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks to be some kind of JOURNAL. 
MASTER MIND Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college. 
ROXANNE That's my diary. 
MASTER MIND So it is. 
ROXANNE It's personal. 
MASTER MIND Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find. 
WAYNE SCOTT I always planned to retire - eventually. I mean, come on, you can't do this sort of thing in your fifties. You'd just look ridiculous. 
The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in Master Mind's head. 
MASTER MIND I see it all so clearly now. 
INT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK 
Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the observatory explodes. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.) You must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded. 
INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK 
Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the cage. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.) You bore out from under the cage. Then, using your Uber-Speed, - 
EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK 
Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in front of some bushes. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.) - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere. 
EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY 
Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D) Then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then... 
Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the SKELETON like a javelin. 
It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil. 
END OF FLASHBACK 
Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed. 
WAYNE Man, you ARE smart. 
MASTER MIND But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit. 
WAYNE SCOTT But the responsibility would still be there. (MORE) WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd) A cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets - but people expect more from superheroes. I tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt in Zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it. I figured, out of sight, out of mind. 
MASTER MIND And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to disappear? 
WAYNE SCOTT Both of my lives have so much baggage. It's time for new baggage, you know? 
Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted. 
MASTER MIND I just can't believe it. This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart? 
Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to say no more. 
WAYNE SCOTT I don't want to hear about it. That's why I don't have a television in here to remind me of all the things I SHOULD be doing. Hell, I could get a wife to do that. 
MASTER MIND There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city. 
Wayne shrugs indifferently. 
MASTER MIND You're really going to do nothing? 
WAYNE SCOTT Good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out. If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him. It's just the order of things. You found me, didn't you? 
Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder. 
WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D) I know it's hard, but you'll find someone else someday. 
He then starts walking to the door. 
MASTER MIND You're the only one who can stop him. 
Wayne turns around. 
WAYNE SCOTT Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a plane to catch. 
MASTER MIND A plane? 
WAYNE SCOTT Going to Barbados for a little change in climate. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got to go pack. 
He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face. 
WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D) You were a good foe. I'm sorry if I've let you down. If it makes a difference, you were the best foe a hero could ask for. 
MASTER MIND Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap. 
WAYNE SCOTT Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper. Now that made me sweat a little. Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage. 
MASTER MIND I got lucky. 
Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine- gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a nearby car. 
He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose- mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him. 
Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The bottom of it was blown apart in the blast. 
TITAN (CONT'D) Didn't mean to get you involved in all of this. 
He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun gets a bead on him. 
TITAN (CONT'D) Hey, man! You killed my suds! 
Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his hand. 
It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like a car dropped off a building. 
TITAN (CONT'D) That's one was for you, beer. 
Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and Frank still hiding behind the building. 
TITAN Guys, please tell me you got that last bit. 
BRAD HELMS Huh? 
TITAN You're kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing? 
BRAD HELMS We were afraid something might hit us. 
TITAN Looks like I've given the story of the century to the wrong man. 
He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him. 
TITAN Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs. 
BRAD HELMS Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a much better reporter than I am. You want her. 
TITAN Where can I find her. 
FRANK We're actually not supposed to give out that sort of information. 
BRAD HELMS 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe she lives in a penthouse. 
TITAN You've been very helpful. 
He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream cone. 
In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of the Metro City river. 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY 
Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb. 
MASTER MIND Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible. 
DA VINCI Master, why must we flee? 
MASTER MIND I told you, Titan is too powerful. If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it. 
DA VINCI Where are we going? 
MASTER MIND To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best. 
PLATO With our tails between our legs? 
The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man. 
MASTER MIND Plato, do you have a better plan?! 
Master Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his men and answers it. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) Hello...Roxanne? 
INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT 
Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone. 
ROXANNE What are you going to do about Tighten? 
INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone. 
MASTER MIND Right now I'm packing, later I'll have a snack on the train. 
ROXANNE You're running away? 
MASTER MIND In a word - yes. 
ROXANNE You created this monster... 
MASTER MIND I didn't create this - the god's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve. 
TELEVISION 
A news report shows an aerial shot of Titan setting the giant ball down in the middle of a vacant city street. 
REPORTER We interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown Metro. The former hero knows as Titan is placing what appears to be a giant ball... 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY     - CONTINUOUS 
Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news report in progress. 
REPORTER Hold on...It appears our own Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the scene. We now go to her with a live report. 
DA VINCI Sir, I think you should see this! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her hand. 
ROXANNE I'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall "Asskickiness." He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins. 
Titan suddenly steps into the shot. 
TITAN And I'm going for the biggest strike ever. 
He leans into the camera. 
TITAN And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as I cement my name in the anal of history. 
ROXANNE Annals. 
TITAN What? 
ROXANNE Nevermind. 
EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot. 
TITAN (in quiet professional bowler announcer voice) Like Tiger before him, a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart, a young man with a dream, realizing that dream here today, folks. (MORE) TITAN(cont'd) One might click there heels and say "There's no place like home" upon finding themselves in such a fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much at home right were he is - with a ball in hand and glory in his sights. 
INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR glows and HUMS MENACINGLY. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away. 
ROXANNE Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do this. 
TITAN You're right. I don't HAVE to do anything. Isn't that cool? 
Titan lines up his shot. 
TITAN Here's one for the record books! 
Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street. 
ROXANNE 
Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of Metro City. 
As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake; cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete sphere brushes along side buildings. 
TITAN 
He smiles in anticipation and uses "body English" to direct the ball. 
GIANT BOWLING BALL POV 
It's nearly halfway to its target. 
ROXANNE 
She closes her eyes. 
Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something we don't. 
About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a defensive barrier. An enormous letter "M" is etched in the web's center. 
TITAN (CONT'D) What the...? 
The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly reduced. 
FRANK Look, what's that flying in the air? 
We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A JET PACK. 
BYSTANDER 2 Uberman's alive! 
BYSTANDER 3 We're saved! 
As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro City's newly resurrected champion. 
MASTER MIND I thought. 
UBERMAN So did I. 
He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder. 
UBERMAN Thank you, old enemy. 
MASTER MIND For what? 
UBERMAN Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me I'm meant to be this city's savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny. 
With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON. 
Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING EYES. 
TITAN Oh...Did I interrupt something? 
Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him. 
TITAN Where you going, buddy? 
Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across the street into a parked car. 
TITAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Paintown. Population: you. 
Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a daze, unable to move. 
Titan flies up in the air. 
TITAN (CONT'D) Time to finish this. 
With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing blow. 
Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands. 
MASTER MIND WAIT!!! 
Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old Warner Bros cartoon. 
TITAN What? 
MASTER MIND Quick joke - What's the capital of Thailand? 
TITAN Huh - I don't know. 
MASTER MIND It's bang cock! 
In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN THE GROIN. 
The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching, with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the pain suddenly surging through his member. 
TITAN (CONT'D) Ow. 
Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER. 
MASTER MIND So, I guess pennies are good for something. 
He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold. 
Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE. 
Roxanne comes up to him. 
The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's not sure what to make of it. 
ROXANNE Pretty strange, huh? 
MASTER MIND They're cheering for me. 
ROXANNE You saved them. You saved everybody. How's it feel? 
Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to well up a little. 
MASTER MIND It's a...it's nice, you know? I usually don't get a lot of feedback. (whispering) But I also kind of caused all this. What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this? 
Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master Mind. 
ROXANNE What they don't know won't hurt them. 
MASTER MIND I guess that is all in the past. 
ROXANNE You're the hero.

1 AERIAL PANORAMA - DAY TO NIGHT 1 
A slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath. Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing lights. The camera slows, and hovers. 
2 EXT. SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 2 
Out of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight. Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall. 
SUPER: 'SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA, 1940'. 
3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3 
A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian territories, still ear something of their national costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or 'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that has put them here. Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk. These men look healthier, and are further distinguished by their tattoos. 
(CONTINUED) 
3 CONTINUED: 3 These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters of the block. Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent, BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made cards. [All DIALOGUE IN THE CAMP IS IN RUSSIAN, SUB-TITLED, 
EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED THAT INMATES SPEAK ENGLISH]. 
BOHDAN 
(IN RUSSIAN) What've you got? VALKA removes his coat, passes it to BOHDAN who examines it briefly. 
BOHDAN (CONT'D) Think I want your stinking lice farm? 
VALKA Polish tailor. He shows the label. 
VALKA (CONT'D) See? From Krakov. Good as new. BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the coat. 
VALKA (CONT'D) And the sausage. BOHDAN stares at him, shakes his head, 'no'. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Bohdan, you're a dog's prick, I swear. I hope you die with an axe in your skull, and your balls ripped out. The swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no reaction. 
VALKA (CONT'D) OK. For the bread. 
(CNNTTNTTFD ) 
3 CONTINUED: ( 2) 3 BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid plays, VALKA is left coat-less. Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players, the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder, SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN. 
BOHDAN For the bread. 
VALKA For the bread, and the sausage, bastard! BOHDAN enjoying himself. 
BOHDAN Throw in that crappy shirt you're wearing and I might be tempted. Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage. Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again VALKA loses. VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then offers to BOHDAN. 
BOHDAN (CONT'D) I don't play for regulation issue crap. VALKA lights a cigarette. 
BOHDAN (CONT'D) All done, Valka? VALKA tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil of cool. 
VALKA I go on credit. 
BOHDAN 'Credit'? 
(CONTINUED) 
3 CONTINUED: ( 3) VALKA nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by a cord from his neck. Etched on the cross a naked woman. 
As they approach one of the prisoners looks up to an arch stretching across the gates - a hand-painted sign in Russian subtitled: 'LABOR IS HONOR, GLORY, NOBILITY, AND 
HEROISM'. The prisoner is JANUSZ, early twenties and he exchanges a look with the man beside him, TOMASZ, about the same age. ANOTHER ANGLE shows a line of prisoners, five abreast, marching toward them on their way to work. They have their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns pass each other the contrast between the half-starved, ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse some of those already established - they include BOHDAN, and VALKA, and further back - SMITH and KHABAROV. As they pass they look across to JANUSZ and TOMASZ, both Polish, and behind them to VOSS, a tall young Latvian with a mop of white-blonde hair. Behind VOSS - ZORAN, a blanket over his three-piece suit. Beside him, another Pole - KAZIK, at seventeen, the youngest in the group. 
9 EXT. 'THE ZONE', CAMP 105 - DAY 9 
The newly arrived prisoners assemble between the various buildings - an area known as the 'ZONE'.

9 CONTINUED: 9 The camp is being expanded, and everywhere are piles of cut timber, coils of wire, and work going on replacing old canvas-sided barracks with new timber ones. The Spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into slush, and duck-boards are hastily laid to allow the Commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners. He walks with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new camp construction. LAZAR carries a sheaf of plans, and the COMMANDANT stops, studies a drawing, then impatiently issues an order dismissing him. The COMMANDANT mounts a box, accepting a folder of documents from his subordinate, who has in turn received them from the escorting guard. The COMMANDANT surveys the prisoners before him. He's a man in his fifties with a bland but not unintelligent cast to his features. He looks up from the collection of documents in his hand. 
COMMANDANT Enemies of the People! Look about you...and understand... it is not our guns, or our dogs, or our wire, that forms your prison. Siberia is your prison. All four million square miles of it. Here in Camp 105, you will work hard. Work and you eat. Eat and you live. Close on JANUSZ and his friends.

A14 EXT. THE ZONE, CAMP 105 - DAY A14 
Later, the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash-house, heads and beards shaved. In the background a glimpse of others waiting their turn. To one side of the wash- house, a pile of their luggage. A couple of guards sort through their belongings, pocketing the odd item. JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut. JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed- wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a section of the old wall falls to the ground. 
14 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, THE ZONE - NIGHT 14 
The prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no bowl, so he uses his hat. JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window. Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a hand on the shoulder of the man in front. 
VOSS (TO JANUSZ) 
(IN ENGLISH) Night blindness. Saw it in the transit camp.. .vitamin deficiency. SMITH, a couple of places ahead in the line, turns on hearing English spoken. As JANUSZ moves forward he watches several wild-eyed men scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into the mud by the kitchen door. They find here the odd scrap of food, or simply soak their fingers in the slime, then lick them clean. 
Revised 2/25/09 (Pink) 10. 
14 CONTINUED: 14 SMITH, having been served, moves away, retrieving a hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket. He dips it into the soup, raises it to his mouth when a corner of the bread drops to the ground. One of the garbage- eaters, dives for it, but SMITH is too quick for him, placing a boot over the scrap of bread. JANUSZ watches as SMITH picks up the bread, cleans off the dirt and eats it, his every move watched by the starving man at his feet. JANUSZ offers the remainder of his soup to the man who greedily drinks it. SMITH and JANUSZ stare at each other. 
SMITH 
(IN ENGLISH) Planning to survive on half rations, son? JANUSZ surprised by the American accented English. 
JANUSZ 
(IN ENGLISH) He's an old man. 
SMITH I'm an old man. But I'll be alive in the morning. He won't. He goes to move away, hesitates, turns back to JANUSZ. 
SMITH (CONT'D) 'Kindness'. That can kill you here. You'll learn that. He places the last morsel of bread in his mouth, and chewing slowly, turns and walks away. 
KHABAROV (V.0.) 
(IN ENGLISH) American. JANUSZ turns to find KHABAROV beside him looking at SMITH's retreating back. 
JANUSZ American? He looks back to SMITH walking away toward the barracks. 
KHABAROV Stalin doesn't like foreigners. That includes Poles. You are Polish aren't you? JANUSZ still staring after SMITH.

JANUSZ nods. 
JANUSZ Yes, I am. 
KHABAROV I love you Poles, your burning sense of injustice, your yearning for freedom. (He offers his hand). 
KHABAROV (CONT'D) Khabarov. Andrei Timofeyevich. JANUSZ looks at him - he wears a distinctive coat, trimmed with fur - something refined about him, 'aristocratic' even. He offers his hand, and they shake. 
15 CONTINUED: 15 
KHABAROV They are considered the by-product of bourgeoisie society and therefore 'Friends of the People'. We political prisoners are 'Enemies of the People'. Russia has become one vast prison - slave labor. You see even this camp is expanding to take in another thousand prisoners. JANUSZ looks over to a group of Asiatic prisoners. 
KHABAROV (CONT'D) From the far reaches of the Soviet Empire - all scooped up in the net like so many minnows, poor creatures. 
JANUSZ And do any ever wriggle out of the net? KHABAROV considers a moment, then leads him away from the surrounding prisoners. He lowers his voice to a whisper. 
KHABAROV You should be more careful. Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere, even in here. He leans closer to JANUSZ. 
KHABAROV (CONT'D) In a camp like this you'll be dead in a year. If not literally then in spirit. 
JANUSZ And how long have you been here?

KHABAROV (CONT'D) Good night, friend. 
16-17 OMITTED 16-17 
A18 EXT. THE ZONE, CAMP 105 - DAWN A18 
In bone-chilling cold the prisoners form up in their brigades as a guard begins counting them. JANUSZ looks toward a barrack building where the bodies of several men who died overnight are being carried out and laid on the ground - among them the 'garbage-eater' from the night before. JANUSZ glances over toward SMITH who stares impassively ahead. GUARD NO. 1 is visible, checking paper work at the camp gates. 
AB18 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST, ABOVE MINE - DAY AB18 
Follow a bird as it hops from branch to branch, pausing every now and then to listen to the sounds of axes and saws drifting from the forest floor. JANUSZ and his friends - VOSS, TOMASZ, KAZIK and ZORAN - work at trimming felled trees of branches, and then sawing them into lengths. SMITH and his gang work nearby. He watches JANUSZ peeling strips of bark from a pine-tree and stuffing them in his pocket. KHABAROV, too, works here with a third gang, cutting and trimming the trees. 
AC18 MINE SITE - DAY AC 18 On the valley floor, below towering cliffs, some 150 men haul rocks in wooden wheelbarrows from the mine entrance across a maze of tracks to waiting trucks. A fire blazes in a 44 gallon drum set up in an open-sided wooden shelter. Here BOHDAN and his criminal associates supervise the work. VALKA has fallen on a slippery slope within the Urka hierarchy following his losses and growing debt. 
( CC)NTTNTTFD ) 
AC18 CONTINUED: AC18 BOHDAN amuses himself by throwing stones at VALKA, warning him away from the fire like a stray dog. Guards placed at vantage points, stamp their feet to keep warm, occasionally shouting at the exhausted prisoners to work harder or move faster. Death is casual here. A man falls. If found to be dead he is left where he fell, bodies to be collected and counted at the end of the day. 
AD18 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY AD18 
JANUSZ and his group dump a load of trimmed logs in a bay by the mine entrance. He hesitates as the others move away, staring into the black hole leading into the mountain. Eerie sounds drift up from deep below. A look of utter dread on his face. 
18 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST, ABOVE MINE - DUSK 18 
The prisoners work hard to fill their quotas - VOSS swings his axe like a demon, but even with his contribution the cut pile of logs is a long way from the mark showing at the top of the storage bay. BOHDAN, the overseer, moves amongst the various working gangs, measuring their completed piles of logs. JANUSZ's group are still only half way to a full quota. KHABAROV leaves his gang and approaches JANUSZ. 
KHABAROV 
(IN ENGLISH) Quickly now, half-quota means half- rations. Quota is Law here. 
JANUSZ No-one could meet that quota even if they were fed and rested. KHABAROV calls for them to follow him. He leads them at a jog deeper into the trees - pointing out various shapes buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut timber. 
KHABAROV Cut last year and never collected! Quickly hide them inside your fresh cut timber! BOHDAN moving closer. It becomes a race to transport all the old logs to their pile and to conceal them inside the fresh cut logs. 
(CONTINUED) 
18 CONTINUED: 
They just make it, but BOHDAN notices the end of an old grey log poking out from the center of the stack. He stops his measuring of their quota. A tense moment, then he nods and leaves. KHABAROV crosses from his gang to join them. 
JANUSZ He knows. KHABAROV shrugs. 
KHABAROV He knows, but he doesn't care, as long as his arse is protected. This is 'Tufta'. Bull-shit. JANUSZ nods his thanks. 
19-22 OMITTED 19-22 
A23 EXT. A DIRT ROAD THROUGH A FOREST - DUSK A23 
KHABAROV (CONT'D) Few ever escape the camps. I've waited for someone like you, someone with the strength and will to see it through. 
JANUSZ 
(EXCITED) Can't go West - apart from the Soviets, there's the Germans. East? All Soviet right to the Pacific.. .it would have to be South? KHABAROV nods, beams at him like a teacher with a very bright pupil. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) They marched as due North from the railway, I glimpsed a lake, but I have no idea where we are. KHABAROV squats down, JANUSZ joins him, and smoothing out a drift of snow KHABAROV sketches a map of a lake and indicates the location of the camp. 
KHABAROV We believe about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal. 
JANUSZ We could follow the edge of the Lake, it runs due South. 
KHABAROV 
(NODDING) Then on to the Trans-Siberian Railway. Cross that and you're close to the Mongolian border. And freedom.

Revised 3/4/09 (Yellow) 21. 
26 CONTINUED: ( 2) 26 JANUSZ's eyes burn with excitement. KHABAROV takes his arm, as if drawing energy from the younger man. 
KHABAROV (CONT'D) Spring is already upon us. It would have to be next autumn. 
JANUSZ Why wait? 
KHABAROV It's 1000 kilometers to the border, maybe more. We need careful planning, stock-pile food. I've already begun - trading, dealing. You could do the same. In the Autumn the weather is predictable. We need the early snows to cover our tracks. JANUSZ nods. 
JANUSZ What about my friends? 
KHABAROV If you trust them. But they won't all survive. 
JANUSZ But they'd die free men. KHABAROV offers his hand, and they shake. 
A27 INT. BARRACK - NIGHT A27 
KHABAROV and JANUSZ enter, having buried the shirt in the snow. KHABAROV indicates LAZAR, sitting on a bunk , and whispers. 
KHABAROV That's Lazar. He was architect. In Kiev.Now he is grave robber - me too. (Whispers) We sneak out at night.Through the wire. He moves away. 
27 EXT. CAMP - DAWN 27 
To the echoing clang of the hammer and iron, JANUSZ and KHABAROV hurry to where they buried their clothing.

Revised 3/4/09 (Yellow) 21A. 
27 CONTINUED: 27 CLOSE on the tips of the cloth showing above the snow - a teeming mound of lice on each. WIDER, as they shake their clothing free of the lice, and hurry over to join the assembly of prisoners at the kitchen servery window for their meagre breakfast ration. At the same time the morning ritual of carrying out the bodies of those who have died overnight is underway. The corpses are stacked like cords of wood for burial. JANUSZ pauses, a muttered prayer on his lips. Then he's passing the hospital barracks - the usual crowd of desperately ill prisoners hoping to be admitted, to be excused another day of the killing work, the majority turned away. He joins the line at the kitchen. The days' bread ration is being weighed and issued. If not exactly 500 grams a little is added or subtracted, the cook keeping trimmed slices, placing them in a tin. 
28 EXT. THE ZONE/CAMP EXTERIOR - DAWN 28 
Having been counted once, inside the camp, the brigade of prisoners is marched outside the gates where the armed guards who will escort them to work are waiting. GUARD NO. 1 begins counting them again. It's much colder than usual, prisoners beating their arms to keep warm, a high wind blowing. Khabarov stands with JANUSZ. 
KHABAROV Temperature is dropping. Below 60 they're not supposed to send us out. Know how to tell the temperature? You see frosty fog - it's 40 below. If you exhale easily but in a rasping fashion? 50 below. When your spit freezes? More than 60 below. He hoiks and spits. Close on the ball of spit mid-air. Freeze-frame. It's a solid glittering crystal of ice. 
29 OMITTED 29 
A30 EXT. ROAD THROUGH FOREST - DAY A30 
The freezing wind has picked up considerably, driving sleet against the column of prisoners, forcing them to a halt in an open snow-covered area. The column halts, the guards anxiously confer - 'to go back or continue on'? The prisoners shiver in the biting cold, some collapse, their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them. JANUSZ and his friends find themselves near SMITH and watch as he hails a GUARD. 
SMITH (Shouts in Russian) We need to make shelter. 
GUARD NO. 1 Who asked you? 
SMITH We'll freeze to death in less than an hour. 
GUARD NO. 1 I couldn't give a fuck if you drop dead right now. 
VALKA There are no secrets here. 
JANUSZ What do you want? 
VALKA The game goes against me. Small debt - lose fingers. Big debt, they take head. Me, big debt. But one thing I never gamble is my Wolf. He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade. 
VALKA (CONT'D) In forest you need knife to survive. Without? A miracle. He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear. 
VALKA (CONT'D) You need a knife, and I need miracle to get me out of here. With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'? 
39 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAWN 39 
Heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards. They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs into the gap, then following them toward the distant forest. 
40 EXT. FOREST, SIBERIA - DAWN 40 
Then seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them, as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt, occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his feet fast enough to keep up with the others. JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before plunging on Southward. 
41 FURTHER ALONG 41 They top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their breath. The snow continues to fall but JANUSZ will allow no rest and moves off without a backward glance. 
42 FURTHER STILL 42 JANUSZ is out in front when SMITH stops, resting his hands on his knees, gulping for air. The others stop too, VALKA dropping to his knees. JANUSZ runs back to VALKA, drags him to his feet. 
JANUSZ Get up. Or we die right now. You know how fast dogs travel. He turns to the others. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) Run, damn you! Run! He moves to SMITH. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) Is it time for me to carry you?

43 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - DAY 43 
A feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins. The snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep depression, and facing a steep climb find they can go no further. KAZIK turns his face to the light. His sight is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to VOSS. In the deep stillness the sound of distant voices. They look about them. Hard to tell the direction of the sound. JANUSZ is on his feet - there's plenty of fallen timber but no obvious place to hide. He draws a circle in the snow, mimes digging to the others, then turns to VALKA, whispers. 
JANUSZ Knife . VALKA has never taken an order from a 'Political' in his short life. 
VALKA What? 
JANUSZ Your knife. With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ. While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to cover their hide.

It's like an Indian sweat-lodge as the fugitives sit shoulder to shoulder in a tight circle, ears straining, sweat running down their faces. The voices closer still. A tense moment, and then they are passing, the voices fading into silence. 
47 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, SIBERIA - NIGHT 47 
The strong wind drives snow and sleet horizontally, and as they push forward they cover their faces to keep the snow from throat and lungs. VALKA, his arm wrapped defensively across his eyes, staggers and falls to his knees. JANUSZ turns back, drags him to his feet. KAZIK hangs onto the back of VOSS' coat, VOSS at times literally dragging him along.

With VALKA's knife JANUSZ cuts a square of bark, pulls it from the tree, cuts two triangular holes some centimeters apart, then rams the base of the bark piece into VALKA'S collar. It's a crude mask. 
49 EXT. THE PROCESSION, FOREST - NIGHT 49 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) Valka? VALKA reluctantly reaches into his coat - something familiar about it with its distinctive fur-lined collar. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) That's Khabarov's coat.

AC51 CONTINUED: ( 3) AC51 He smiles at JANUSZ as he produces a bulging sack from inside his coat. 
VALKA (CONT'D.) Yes...and... From the sack he produces KHABAROV's hoarded supply of food and other items. Off JANUSZ's reaction - 
VALKA (CONT'D) He was going to inform. Don't worry. I talk to him. Everything o.k. He puts the goods back in the sack and goes to place it inside his coat. 
JANUSZ We share. JANUSZ reaches out for the sack of food. VALKA glances at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a tea party, raising a smile from his exhausted companions.

The wind is rising, whipping flurries of snow through the trees. SMITH and JANUSZ are in the lead. SMITH refers back to VALKA. 
SMITH You've made a bargain with the Devil.

The group in the shelter of the trees. The sky is overcast but at least it's not too cold. Everywhere about is deep snow from the recent storm. TOMASZ prepares a meal from their dry rations, small portions for men who have expended so much energy. KAZIK examines his swollen blistered feet. VALKA has his boots off, shaking them. 
VALKA (TO KAZIK) Clean inside boots, foot-cloths. KAZIK copies him. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Man on run - one tiny piece of sand can make cripple, I swear to God. The others are listening, and some do likewise. 
52 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 52 
With lengths of wood as 'ski-poles', the group begin to make up lost time. VOSS has lashed his rope-belt to KAZIK who walks behind him. SMITH wonders about this, but says nothing. They pause at the top of a rise amongst the trees, on hearing the sound of dogs howling from behind.

The upturned faces of the fugitives. Sun worshipers all. JANUSZ a short distance away. He plants his 'ski-pole' in the snow, marking the tip of its shadow with a pine- cone. They watch as he draws a line in the snow from the second marker - about a foot in length. Then he stands, and with the toe of his left foot at the first pine-cone and the toe of his right foot at the end of the line in the snow, he points, calling to them. 
JANUSZ South! To Lake Baikal! Cheers from the watching group.

SMITH Then you'll die. KAZIK has a far-away look in his sight-less eyes. He speaks in Polish to JANUSZ. 
VOSS What does he say? 
TOMASZ He asked Janusz if he believes in God's forgiveness. This has come from seemingly nowhere. 
SMITH Save your philosophy. Concentrate on keeping up with us instead. He gets up and goes in search of more wood, the others surprised at his cold tone. The rest of the group also begin to prepare their camp. Most gather wood while TOMASZ, the 'quartermaster', makes their meal, and JANUSZ the fire. VOSS keeps an eye on KAZIK who, demonstrating his independence while it's still light, and his desire to contribute, returns with a load of wood, turning back into the forest for more. Others gather wood, and as the light fades, begin to take up positions by the growing fire, roll cigarettes, etc. VOSS looks anxiously for KAZIK. He has not returned.

The group range out from the fire calling KAZIK's name. VOSS turns to JANUSZ. 
VOSS He has night-blindness.

KAZIK stumbling through the whiteout. He stops. Did he hear his name? He moves on, pleased to find by his side the Professor from the mine.

KAZIK I thought I was alone! 
PROF. I've been walking with you for some time. 
KAZIK I'll just sit for a minute. The PROF. sits beside him. 
PROF. Not far to go. He points, and KAZIK sees - the Pyramids of Giza, deep inside the fog. 
KAZIK We made it. We really made it. Isn't that something. 
67 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN 67 
They find KAZIK not a hundred yards from where they camped. The weather has broken, the fog gone. He sits looking toward them, his bare feet stretched out before him, his eyes wide open. On his lips a frozen smile. 
68 EXT. A CAIRN OF STONES - DAY 68 
They stand by his grave. 
JANUSZ A free man died here today. Amens are muttered. The group remain by the grave reluctant to leave. All but VALKA who looks about restlessly. 
VALKA Young always die first. The others look at him. 
VALKA (CONT'D) In the camps. He looks at their somber faces.

SMITH and VOSS are last in line as they move cautiously along a dirt track. SMITH keeps looking back over his shoulder. 
VOSS What is it?

Revised 2/25/09 (Pink) 54. 
88 CONTINUED: SMITH signals JANUSZ to stop, while holding a finger to his lips for silence. JANUSZ joins him, followed by the others. 
SMITH We're being followed. 
JANUSZ Followed? Where? 
SMITH Fifty yards back. A man on his own. May have seen us - crossed into the trees beside the track. A silence as they consider their options. VALKA draws his knife. 
VOSS No killing. 
VALKA 
(TO VOSS) No? I think you've killed before. You say too many prayers for an innocent man. VOSS looks uneasy. 
SMITH He gives us away, the soldiers will be on us in no time. 
JANUSZ Valka, go back on the other side of the track, then come up behind, in case he makes a run for it. VALKA moves off, gliding through the trees on the left of the track. The others wait a beat, then move into the trees on the right side of the track picking up fallen timber as weapons. JANUSZ is in the lead when in a clearing not fifty paces ahead, a figure steps out from behind a tree. JANUSZ stops, holding up a hand for the others to stay where they are. He stares at the small figure - a young woman. There's a glimpse of a dirty skirt under her coat, a scarf tied loosely about her neck. Wisps of chestnut hair stray out from under a moth-eaten fur hood. She looks frightened and desperate. 
(CONTTNTTFD ) 
88 CONTINUED: (2) 88 From her waif like appearance, it's hard to tell her age - an old thirteen or a young sixteen? The men discreetly drop their irovised weapons. She looks ready to make a run for it on seeing VALKA with his drawn knife. JANUSZ gestures for the others to fall back, as he cautiously approaches, uttering reassuring words. 
89 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - LATER - DAY 89 
The others sit smoking by the pathway, watching as JANUSZ crosses back from the GIRL to join them. He says something to TOMASZ in Polish. A rapid exchange between them. 
SMITH What? What is it? 
JANUSZ She's Polish. Been following us for several days. 
VALKA What does she want? 
JANUSZ Food? Protection? She's been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we weren't Russians. 
SMITH She wants to travel with us? 
JANUSZ She's on the run, like us. Escaped from a Russian collective farm. 
VALKA I swear to God I know this type - street gypsies, there are thousands like that, less use than a dog! JANUSZ looks back to the GIRL who watches them from the clearing. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Pakhan. Don't do this. 
JANUSZ She's starving.

SMITH We can't feed ourselves.

100 CONTINUED: 100 TOMASZ; In between sketching scenes of his friends at work he skims fat from the pot filled with boiling bones, and lays out strips of meat given to him by VALKA to dry in the sun, part of the jerked meat they will carry as a long term food supply. VALKA; With the 'Wolf' he separates sinews and tendons from the beast, to form much needed bindings for their journey. He also cuts meat for their jerked supply, or to be smoked. 
SMITH; Makes firstly a large bone needle, then later 
makes repairs in his clothes. ZORAN; After cleaning his teeth with a twig, hangs his suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a branch from a pine tree. TOMASZ teases him and suggests he do something useful. Later this leads to him sorting the boiled bones into various sizes, a sort of accountant of the 'bone-bank'. 'Customers' come to him looking for bones or teeth for various uses. JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH's help he stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat and fat. IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes her clothes and hair. The men try not to stare, and whether their thoughts are carnal or not, whether she reminds them of family or girlfriend, they are all affected by her transformation from boy/urchin, into a young woman when she returns washed, and wearing the dress she has carried rolled-up on her back. 
Revised 2/25/09 (Pink) 59. 
101 EXT. CAMPFIRE, LAKESIDE - NIGHT 101 
SMITH and JANUSZ some distance from the campsite collecting wood. By the fire ZORAN leads the 'Survivors Band'. He has them drumming on logs, tapping sticks, harmonizing, amid much laughter. JANUSZ watches IRENA. Then he turns to SMITH. 
JANUSZ She's educated. Speaks good English. And French. 
SMITH That right. 
JANUSZ You don't like her, do you? 
SMITH Speak to Valka about her. He doesn't even think she's Polish. 
JANUSZ I did speak to him. And the others. They agree she comes with us. 
SMITH It's decided then? 
JANUSZ You disagree. 
SMITH Apart from food she'll slow us down. There's no room for sentimentality. You know that.

101 CONTINUED: 
And he turns, moving back to the fire with his load of wood. 
102 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - DAY 102 
Refreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from the deer, they make their way along a narrow dirt track by the lake. IRENA is aware that the main opposition to her joining with them comes from VALKA and SMITH. SMITH she knows is the more important, and she tries to keep up with him. Occasionally catching his eye, she tries to charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years. 
103 EXT. RIVER/LAKE - DAY 
A river flowing into the lake presents an obstacle. They walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow, but here it's still frozen, and a quick test with JANUSZ's staff shows it to be too thin to take their weight. They look upstream - a distant figure of a man, a hunter possibly, a shotgun over his shoulder, on their side of the bank. There's clearly no choice but to swim for it. They make hasty preparations, removing outer clothing, except shirts and trousers, tying their boots about their necks. IRENA watches. 
SMITH Can you swim? 
IRENA Yes, Mister. 
SMITH You wouldn't lie to me? 
IRENA I'm not lying, Comrade. That was a slip of the tongue, and SMITH is made uneasy by it. 
SMITH And don't call me, 'comrade'. With a shout the group plunge into the icy water, swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level in the other. It's only when they reach the other side they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment then runs upstream to where the river is frozen. 
(CNNTTNTTFTD ) 
103 CONTINUED: 103 They watch in astonishment as in a series of leaps and bounds she's out on the ice heading for the opposite bank. Ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times it seems she'll fall in, but with a last great leap over a section of free-flowing water she makes it to the other side, hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on her face. She looks defiantly at SMITH. JANUSZ is worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to follow him into the tree-line. 
104-105 OMITTED 104-105 
A106 EXT. FOREST, A SHORT TIME LATER - DAY A106 
They scramble up a steep, forested slope, with occasional backward glances to see if the hunter is following. There's no sign of him. 
106 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 106 
Some time later the group, still a little damp, walk by the lake. IRENA walks beside SMITH whose long strides force her to jog occasionally to keep up. They swat at mosquitoes as they walk. 
The group make their way uphill and around the town. 
A110 EXT.TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT A110 
Their P.O.V. down to the few lights of the town and the lake glimmering in the moonlight. From the direction of the town - the sound of a dog barking in an agitated fashion.

SMITH joins JANUSZ. Off his expression: 
SMITH 
(TO JANUSZ) What is it? What's wrong? 
JANUSZ Where's Valka? 
SMITH He was behind Zoran. 
JANUSZ 
(TO ZORAN) Didn't you watch Valka? 
ZORAN I'm not his keeper. 
JANUSZ Damn him! He looks back down to the town. 
110 EXT. THE GROUNDS OF A HOUSE, VILLAGE - NIGHT 110 
A dim light through a side window - the glimpse of a woman crossing through frame, followed shortly after by the weathered face of a fisherman. He's heard something. He crosses to the window, peers out into the darkness. The moment he turns away the camera moves on around the side to the rear of the building, past a rabbit in a cage. VALKA's shoulder comes into frame as he edges his way toward the back door, passing the sightless skull of a dried fish swinging from a cord under the eaves. He reaches for the door-handle, opens it, and slips silently inside. A111 EXT. TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT Alll A view along a road to the town. (P.O.V. now on the opposite side of town to that seen earlier.)

SMITH He'd bribe his way out of it. 
JANUSZ 
(TO IRENA) Would he do that? 
IRENA He might. 
ZORAN It's an opportunity. We're rid of him.

VALKA So. SMITH moves swiftly, grabs him by his collar and spins him into the tree. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Hey, easy cowboy! 
SMITH Could have got us all killed.

VALKA (CONT'D) Why should you care what I'm making? The evening is hot and VALKA has his shirt open, the tattooed portraits of Lenin and Stalin on his chest appear and disappear in the folds of his shirt. This amuses ZORAN. 
ZORAN Valka? 
VALKA What? 
ZORAN Why do you have arseholes tattooed on your chest? VALKA stops. Stares back. 
ZORAN (CONT'D) Shouldn't they be on your arse so you sit on them every time you take a shit? 
VALKA You think it's funny? They are great men. ZORAN laughs. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Watch your eyes, crowbait! He makes a 'V' with his fingers followed by a short stabbing motion. ZORAN reels back. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Don't you know what 'Stalin' means funny man? Man-of-Steel. He takes from rich and gives to poor. 
ZORAN Sure he does. Then he puts both of them in a camp for twenty-five years. VALKA goes back to his carving. 
A127 EXT. RAILWAY TRACKS - NIGHT A127 
JANUSZ stands on the tracks lookingdownthelinetoa cutting where the track disappearsaroundabend.The sound of an approaching train, a dim light already reflected on the side of the cutting. He turns and looks toward the trees where the others are approaching down a wooded hillside. He hurries toward them, urging them to take cover in the bracken beside the track. SMITH points out a glowing red light further down the track from the approaching train. 
AB127 EXT. RAILWAY TRACK - NIGHT AB127 
The train thunders into the cutting with a squeal of breaks as the driver sights the red light on the track ahead, and the train slows to a stop. 
127 EXT. BESIDE THE TRACK - NIGHT 127 
Close on the faces of the escapees as they look up to the carriages stopped in front of them. They are cattle- cars, but its soon apparent their cargo is human. From the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars. From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices, female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy. Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop to the tracks from the barred windows. After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the woods on the other side, all but VOSS. He is picking up as many of the notes and letters as he can. 
JANUSZ (V.O.) Andrejs, for God's sake! VOSS slowly crosses the tracks, and disappears into the brush. 
128 EXT. BRUSH, TRACKSIDE - NIGHT 128 
VOSS, overwhelmed with emotion sits down, examining the letters and notes in his hand. JANUSZ hurries back for him.

JANUSZ 
(WHISPERS) Come on! But VOSS doesn't move. JANUSZ sits beside him, and VOSS passes him a sample of the prisoners' pathetic messages - some scrawled on the back of photographs. They are mostly names and addresses, pleas for someone to mail or inform relatives of what happened to them - some have even clipped a few bank-notes to pay for postage.

130 EXT. RUSSO-MONGOLIAN BORDER, COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN 130 
Tall striped posts at intervals, strung with rusted wire - beyond, a dirt road and distant fields. From a concealed position in the nearby trees they carefully watch for signs of a patrol. JANUSZ goes first, passing easily through the sagging fence. ZORAN calls to him. 
ZORAN 
(SHOUTS) What's it like in Mongolia? JANUSZ holds up a hand - 'Keep your voice down'. ZORAN crawls through the wire followed by the others. 
ZORAN (CONT'D) I love Mongolia. 
SMITH Love it later. We need to get as far from this border as possible. ZORAN faces Russia and as if bowing at the end of a performance. 
ZORAN Thank you Mother Russia for your hospitality! I definitely will not be coming back! It's only then that we notice that VALKA has not crossed through. He stands staring at them from the Soviet side. It's clear he's going no further. JANUSZ crosses back to him, and they talk through the wire. 
ZORAN Go over the Himalayas? How? On a magic carpet? A silence as they contemplate the massive distances stretching ahead of them. 
AB136 EXT. ABANDONED STONE BUILDING, MONGOLIA - DAWN AB136 
In the middle of an empty plain a small circular stone ruin. 
136 INT. RUIN - DAWN 136 
Sleeping figures. A gentle tip-tapping sound. VOSS opens his eyes. Staring back at him from the doorway, half a dozen sheep. He nudges TOMASZ who wakes sleepily, takes his eye-line. Carefully, slowly, they rise, VOSS drawing his deer-bone knife. Then they move. The sheep retreat, bumping into each other, and outside the chase is on. TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a knife, but JANUSZ is behind him, grabs his arm. 
JANUSZ No! Andrejs, no! VOSS tries to free his arm. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) Don't kill it! 
TOMASZ Why not? We're hungry! 
JANUSZ You want the locals after us too? They break into Polish, a blazing argument, months of pent up frustration. VOSS picks up the sheep and carries it inside the ruin. 
137 INT. RUIN, LATER - DAY 137 
Milk squirting into their aluminium bowl as VOSS expertly milks the ewe, IRENA and ZORAN holding it steady. 
138 EXT. STEPPE - DAY 138 
The sun is blazing as they cross through a sea of grass, hills rising in the distance like islands. TOMASZ and ZORAN play a long distance walker's game - each in turn kicking a rock out ahead, continually passing it from one to the other. JANUSZ and SMITH look to the hills surrounding them as they walk. 
JANUSZ You feel it? 
SMITH Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
138 CONTINUED: 138 
IRENA Feel what? 
JANUSZ We're being watched. IRENA uneasy, squints in the direction of the hills. And you can feel it. Like a John Ford western there's a sense of being in Indian territory, of their every move watched by unseen eyes. 
A139 EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY A139 
A distant view of a temple complex at the base of low hills. 
AB139 EXT. STEPPE - DAY AB139 
The above has been pointed out by VOSS to the group, and they decide to make their way to the temple, in the hope of getting food. 
139 EXT. ABANDONED TEMPLE COMPLEX, STEPPES - DAY 139 
Within a walled compound they wander between a series of recently abandoned Buddhist temples and out-buildings. By the size of the compound, several hundred monks may have lived here. Everywhere are signs of violence - doors hang from hinges, and a large statue of Buddha lies smashed in a courtyard. JANUSZ points to a line of bullet impacts, stitched across a wall. 
140 INT. TEMPLE - DAY 140 
There are bloodstains on the floor, and the wind howling about the building makes a haunting accompaniment. IRENA and VOSS are alone inside. 
IRENA What happened here? 
VOSS The same as happened in Russia. Churches closed, priests shot or taken to camps, religion banned. They came to my church, in Latvia. Destroyed everything, declared it a 'museum'. Later that night, there was a lone guard. A boy.

140 CONTINUED: 140 
VOSS (CONT-D) I strangled him until his eyes popped right out of his head. Valka knew somehow. Knew I'd killed in cold blood. He bows his head. IRENA looks up at him, and they stand together in silence, but for the moaning wind. 
141 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - DAY 141 
As they head South, each is lost in their own thoughts when seemingly out of nowhere a half-dozen Mongolian horsemen are galloping toward them. The horsemen circle them, far from friendly looks on their faces. They wear the traditional costume of Steppe nomads and range in age from a man in his seventies down to a six-year-old boy. The OLD MAN pulls up his horse in front of SMITH, figuring as he's the oldest he'll also be the leader. The groups stare at each other. The OLD MAN speaks in Russian, a rough guttural accent. 
146 CONTINUED: 146 They look back to the disappearing horseman before scrambling down the rocky slope. 
A147 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY A147 
The group crossing into the heart of the Gobi.

VOSS is the first to see it - a vast glittering lake. They hurry toward it. 
148 LATER, 148 The lake leads them on, but appears no closer. 
149 LATER STILL, 149 JANUSZ has taken a reading of the sun, using his stick method. He points out their direction - it is away from the beckoning lake. 
VOSS Janusz! JANUSZ hesitates, looks at VOSS who holds up their water- bag. 
VOSS (CONT'D.) (CONT'D) We should go to the lake. Water is getting low. 
JANUSZ What lake? It's a mirage. He plods on, away from the shimmering vision. There's little the others can do but trust JANUSZ, and slowly they follow.

152 EXT. THE GOBI - ANOTHER DAY 152 
The figures, tiny in the surrounding desert, walk on, JANUSZ in the lead needing to constantly slow down to allow the others to catch up. 
A153 EXT. THE GOBI - SAME DAY A153 
The group hesitate on hearing a distant roaring sound up ahead. Nothing on the horizon. Then they are hit by a fierce wind, as toward them rolls a vast cloud of sand. They drop to the ground instinctively, and huddled together throw blankets around their shoulders and over their heads, as they are engulfed in the choking sand. LATER, they emerge from their own 'dune', and shaking themselves down they resume their journey southward. 
153 EXT. THE GOBI - NIGHT 153 
The temperature has dropped to freezing and they huddle by a fire, picking sand out of their small ration of food. 
ZORAN I'm too tired to sleep. 
TOMASZ Why not keep walking? 
ZORAN I'm for that, if we can wake Andrejs. They look to where VOSS sleeps. 
ZORAN (CONT'D) He can sleep anywhere, any time. How does he do it?

153 CONTINUED: 153 
SMITH I don't see any. I'm trying to remember my school geography but I seem to recall the Gobi Desert somewhere in Southern Mongolia. JANUSZ begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground. It's funnel-shaped, narrow at the base. The others watch as he lines the sides with dried deerskin, placing their cooking pot in the base. 
CLOSER AGAIN. A BIRD RISES INTO THE SKY FROM THE NOW 
MORE SOLID TREES. Back on ZORAN. 
ZORAN Mirages don't have birds! Wider, and they're running, running with the last of their precious energy. 
161 EXT. WELL - DAY 161 
A clump of straggly tortured trees surround a desert well - a low square of ancient stones. They sprawl by the well, SMITH reaching down inside with their bowl to bring up a scoop of crystal clear water. It's passed around rapidly. 
SMITH Just a little. Don't fill yourselves. More scoops follow in quick succession, enough to splash hands and faces. VOSS calls from a few yards away. 
VOSS Fire. Coals are still warm. SMITH and JANUSZ join him, examining the ground about the fire. 
SMITH Lots of tracks. Nomads? 
VOSS Maybe others will come? 
TOMASZ Over here! The remains of a meal! There's still meat on the bones! He points to the cooked remains of some animal. Using VOSS's deer-bone knife he scrapes meat from the bones, others just attacking any bone they find. 
(CONTINUED) 
161 CONTINUED: 161 
JANUSZ Don't eat it all! He manages to save at least half of the meat, wrapping it in a cloth, and putting it in VOSS's backpack. 
162 EXT. WELL, LATER - DAY 162 
They lie stretched out under the shade of the trees dozing, and every now and then going back to the well to drink or just to lay their hands in the cool water. 
163 EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 163 
IRENA sleeps while the men discuss their situation in hushed tones. 
TOMASZ At least we have water here. 
JANUSZ But no food. 
VOSS Other nomads will come. Water their flocks. 
JANUSZ When? Next week? Next month? 
ZORAN We could wait a few days, at least. 
JANUSZ Without food, we'll only get weaker. Maybe too weak to travel. 
TOMASZ These last days - I don't know that I could go through that again. 
VOSS (looks at the water) It was a miracle finding this. Can we count on another? 
TOMASZ I say we stay. 
(CONTINUED) 
163 CONTINUED: 163 They look to SMITH. He looks up to find them watching him. 
SMITH What are you looking at me for? Ask Janusz. He's already made up his mind for us, haven't you, Janusz? JANUSZ says nothing. 
164 EXT.WELL - DAWN 164 
They all take a last drink from the well, then pour water over their faces and clothes. VOSS fills the skin water- bag, then ZORAN fills their cooking bowl to the brim. Steamis rising from their damp clothing when they set off. ZORAN walking on tip-toe, anxiousnot to spill a dropfrom the bowl in his outstretchedhand. 
165 EXT.GOBI DESERT - DAY 165 
Close on TOMASZ as he looks back over his shoulder to 
SEE: 
THE WELL, STILL NOT MORE THAN 500 YARDS BEHIND. 
174 EXT. GOBI - DAWN 174 
They walk on, ZORAN carefully carrying the partly filled bowl of water. IRENA seems refreshed, but JANUSZ and SMITH walk beside her, watching her every step. 
IRENA I can walk alright if I can lean a little on you. They each lightly lay a hand on her elbow. 
175 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 175 
IRENA starts to fall forward, they steady her, and she walks on for a bit before slumping forward, and falling to her knees. SMITH too falls with exhaustion. VOSS hurries back to them. 
JANUSZ Can you go on? 
IRENA I think so. But what about Mr. Smith? SMITH struggling for breath is back on his feet, waving them on. VOSS and JANUSZ each put an arm about her and half-carrying, half-dragging her, they set off again but it's no use, she's lost all her strength. 
VOSS I'm going to carry her. 
(CONTINUED) 
178 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY 178 
A lizard, in close up, listens to an approaching sound. As the volume builds he runs for his life. A beetle too, has heard it and burrows into the sand as a foot in a battered moccasin looms large in frame. We follow the foot a few staggering steps, then a blur, as a body falls through frame, ending in a close-up of TOMASZ, his breath coming in short gasps. 
179 EXT. WIDER, GOBI DESERT - DAY 179 
The five figures, small in frame, TOMASZ the last in line, down on his knees. He raises a hand, hasn't the strength to call out. Then one of the figures sees him, calls to the others. CLOSE on TOMASZ. He pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty - the tell-tale swelling of the ankles, just as with IRENA. As JANUSZ approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers to his feet. JANUSZ steadies him, and taking his arm they continue. 
180 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 180 
As they walk the landscape changes from the endless scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes. The nature of the terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on the edge of exhaustion. In a curious freak of Nature the wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie singing sound. Ahead, and across their path a massive dune - no way forward but over it. TOMASZ looks up, staring in horror - 
TOMASZ'S HALLUCINATION: The dune is moving, rising up, higher and higher, like a massive sand wave. Back on TOMASZ. He collapses, unconscious. 
181 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - TWILIGHT 181 
An eerie, ghostly twilight, the group all sitting together in a rough circle around TOMASZ. He seems to revive as he passes around sketches he's made during their imprisonment and escape. 
(CONTINUED) 
181 CONTINUED: 181 It's an almost cheerful scene, like a traveller showing happy snaps taken on holiday. 
VOSS I like this one. When did you do that? He holds up a sketch of KAZIK, showing him examining one of his battered shoes. 
TOMASZ On the train. Poor Kazik, always the trouble with his feet. ZORAN holds up a drawing of himself. 
ZORAN Who's this? 
TOMASZ You. ZORAN looks at it again genuinely shocked. 
ZORAN My father maybe, but is that how I look now? A chuckle from the others. SMITH stares at a sketch of IRENA. 
SMITH You caught her smile. SMITH passes the sketch to JANUSZ as TOMASZ lays back down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn has given strength to his friends, and between them all is a feeling of love and a kind of peace. 
182 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - DAWN 182 
They've tied his pencil to a length of hide, and hung it from the top of the cross over his grave. A faint breath of morning breeze sets it swinging like a pendulum, the others long gone. 
183 EXT. DUNES - DAY 183 
As they stagger on JANUSZ has moved well out in front, when he stumbles and falls. Then he sees it, just out ahead, and he begins crawling toward it. 
(CONTINUED) 
183 CONTINUED: 183 
JANUSZ'S MIRAGE - DAY: It's the hedge and gate from his vision. Behind the hedge the hint of a roof. Through the gate can be seen the path to the front door. 
184 EXT. DUNES - DAY 184 
JANUSZ crawling faster now, when ZORAN appears beside him. 
Revised 2/25/09 (Pink) 103. 
197 CONTINUED: 197 JANUSZ helps SMITH sit up, feeding him a small piece of meat. SMITH waves him away, sinking back to the ground too tired to eat. 
VOSS Kind of like chicken. 
ZORAN Yeah, a long black poisonous chicken with no legs. 
JANUSZ You know Valka talked of eating each other? In Siberia? 
ZORAN He did? Would you have eaten me? 
JANUSZ Probably. 
ZORAN I would never have eaten you - too stringy and bitter, I'd rather eat snake. VOSS nearly chokes on something, reaches into his mouth, pulls out a tooth. 
JANUSZ Scurvy. 
198 OMITTED 198 
199 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 199 
The fire burns low, VOSS and ZORAN sleep. SMITH wakes from time to time and JANUSZ forces him to eat and drink. SMITH is deathly pale, his life ebbing away. He speaks in short, croaky stabs, every breath an effort. 
SMITH It can kill you, remember? JANUSZ puzzled. 
SMITH (CONT'D) 'Kindness'. JANUSZ tries to force more water on him but SMITH waives him away. 
199 CONTINUED: 199 
SMITH (CONT'D) How long can you survive on snakes and mud? You should leave me, but you can't can you? You're a fool. I'd leave you. He lays back down. JANUSZ studies his face, pain and suffering etched in sharp lines. 
JANUSZ Mister? 
SMITH What? 
JANUSZ I mightn't know youur first name, but I know your son's name. SMITH stares at him. 
SMITH Irena told you. JANUSZ nods. 
JANUSZ Can I say his name? Nothing from SMITH. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) 'David'. 
SMITH Saying his name on't bring him back. He struggles onto his elbow, staring intently at JANUSZ, an ironic smile on his lips. 
SMITH (CONT'D) You trying to give me the will to live? That it? Stop me giving up? 
JANUSZ Are you giving up? 
SMITH In the camps, some saw death as 'freedom'. 
(CONTINUED) 
Revised 3/16/09 ( Salmon) 105. 
199 CONTINUED: ( 2) 199 
JANUSZ So why didn't you kill yourself? 
SMITH Survival was a kind of protest. JANUSZ makes him take a little water. 
SMITH (CONT'D) Now being alive is my punishment. 
JANUSZ Punishment for what? 
SMITH I brought David to Russia didn't 
I? 
SHEPHERD 
(POINTING DOWN) Lhasa LHA-SA! Then, indicating 'over' the mountains - 
SHEPHERD (CONT'D) 
IN-DI-A! In dumb-show, he mines that the mountains would be very cold. 
212 EXT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 212 
Three horses arrive at the door of the lonely hut and its associated outbuildings. THE SHEPHERD dismounts and with much bowing opens the door for two other Tibetans who follow. One is a LPMA, the other a local OFFICIAL. They stoop as they enter - a glimpse inside to where the four survivors sit at a table, surrounded by bowls and plates of food. 
213 INT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 213 
The LAMA and the OFFICIAL sit opposite the group. Tea is served. The official speaks English with difficulty, and as in Mongolia, he addresses the elder of the group - MR. 
SMITH. 
OFFICIAL India? Yes. There is the track to Sikkim, over the mountains. Many people go there. 
SMITH And food? 
OFFICIAL Small villages there. They give food. Wood for fire. Yes, but you don't go now. CLOSE on JANUSZ, intensely following the conversation. 
(CONTINUED) 
213 CONTINUED: 213 
JANUSZ Why can't we go now? 
OFFICIAL If big snow come - very difficult. You wait here until Spring. This family keep you. He confers with the LAMA. 
JANUSZ 
(TO SMITH) That's three months. 
OFFICIAL (indicates the LAMA) He go to Lhasa. Get permission for to stay. Only to Spring. Not possible foreigners stay Tibet. SMITH bows his head, mutters thanks, all of the group doing likewise. 
214 INT. STABLES, SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 214 
THE SHEPHERD has seen JANUSZ, ZORAN and VOSS to their quarters. He passes VOSS a battered oil-lamp and retires with much bowing. They settle on the straw covered floor, laying out their heavy wool fleeces and blankets given to them by the shepherd's wife. 
ZORAN Well, we can't cross in Winter. 
JANUSZ He said it was 'difficult'. SMITH comes in, and they make room for him in the cramped space. 
ZORAN I'm going to sleep 'till Spring. Like a bear in a cave. What about you, Mister? SMITH settles with his back to the wall, draws up his sheepskin. 
SMITH I'm going to Lhasa. The others are stunned by this. 
(CONTINUED) 
214 CONTINUED: 214 
SMITH (CONT'D) The Lama has a contact - maybe get me out through China. There's a U.S. military mission there. They don't like it. A feeling he's deserting them, breaking up the team. 
ZORAN 'Looking after number one.' Isn't that what Americans say? 
SMITH Zoran? ZORAN eventually looks at him. 
SMITH (CONT'D) We escaped. We made it. VOSS blows out the lamp. Silvery moonlight from a small window. 
ZORAN He's right. I just realized it. 
VOSS Realized what? 
ZORAN Apart from a few mountains, we're there. We made it. 
VOSS Not all of us.

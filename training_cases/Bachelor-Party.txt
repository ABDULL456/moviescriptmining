SHOOTING DRAFT (1984) 
FADE IN: 
EXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY 
CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both firmly by the shoulders. 
SISTER MARY FRANCIS Make one more move and you'll both be staying late for the rest of the week. 
THE BOYS (softly; in unison) Sorry, Sister Mary Francis. 
SISTER MARY FRANCIS I didn't hear you. 
THE BOYS (louder) Sorry, Sister Mary Francis. 
Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate. 
Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking place around the corner. 
SISTER MARY FRANCIS (used to this) Step away from the curb, children. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on. 
While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life... This incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps up to him. 
SISTER MARY FRANCIS You're late again, Rick. 
RICK I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse. 
SISTER MARY FRANCIS There can be no excuse for tardiness. 
RICK You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak. 
He starts sobbing softly into his hands. 
SISTER MARY FRANCIS All right, stop that... Children, on the bus. 
The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is drying his tears with his handkerchief. 
RICK Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book. 
SISTER MARY FRANCIS (smiling despite herself) Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is. 
RICK Right... Think it over. 
He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus out of the parking lot. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top of their lungs. 
ANGLE - RICK 
He removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order. 
RICK (over mike) If you don't all calm down I'm gonna drive this thing over a cliff. 
The kids pay no attention to him. 
RICK (continuing; philosophically) Ah... youth. 
EXT. THE BUS 
Rick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his engine. Rick counters by gunning his. 
INT. THE BUS 
All the kids start screaming "Race... race." "Wipe 'em out." "Go for it." Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out money and start betting one another on the race's outcome. 
ANGLE - RICK 
as he readies for action. 
EXT. THE BUSES 
She coyly leans INTO FRAME. 
O'NEILL (O.S.) (continuing) A-huh. A little more... good! 
She is totally blocking her baby out of the picture. 
O'NEILL 
He gets out from behind the camera. 
O'NEILL I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons? 
WOMAN (seductively) Of course. 
She starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his camera. 
O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENS 
We SEE the Woman finish her last button. 
O'NEILL (O.S.) Now lean in a little more... more... more... 
As she complies, her breasts all but spill out of her dress. 
O'NEILL (O.S.) (continuing) Hold that pose. 
O'NEILL 
He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman. 
THROUGH CAMERA LENS 
We SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes. Each pose finds him near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to breast. Etc. 
RICK 
enters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps into the shots. 
THROUGH CAMERA LENS 
Rick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman gets bored and EXITS the FRAME. 
THE WOMAN 
As Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few beats pass and the guys notice they're alone. 
O'NEILL Where'd she go? 
RICK She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce. 
O'Neill crosses to his camera and takes out the film. 
O'NEILL Okay... be right with ya. 
RICK 
He picks up some photographs of today's work. 
INSERT - PHOTOS 
Each one has a different mother in several seductive poses. Their babies are barely visible, if at all. 
RICK (O.S.) Pictures a family will cherish forever. 
EXT. CHULO'S AUTO SHOP - DAY 
Rick's school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop. Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill hop out. 
RICK Hey, Chulo, where are you, man? 
ANGLE - LATE-MODEL CAR 
We SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic of Mexican ancestry. 
CHULO Hey, you guys, what's going on? 
RICK We're going for a little liquid refreshment. 
CHULO Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you? 
A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot. 
CHULO (continuing) Roberto, you finished fixing that lighter yet? 
Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right into traffic. 
CHULO (continuing; to Rick) I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion? 
RYKO Whoa... You got to go to school for that or what? 
CUSTOMER (he's had enough) Look, forget the specials. We'll take three hamburgers. 
RYKO Okay, great... Any of you guys got a pencil by any chance? 
One of the customers shrugs and hands him a pen. 
RYKO (impressed) All right, a Bic... How 'bout a piece of paper? 
Ryko's customers look totally disgusted as Ryko's short attention span is interrupted by something he sees O.S. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Rick and the guys appear in the bar. 
RICK Ryko. Come on! 
They all disappear into the bar area. 
RYKO Be right there. (to customers) Nice rappin' with you guys. Unfortunately I'm outta here. Someone else will have to help you. (calling off) Skip! 
The customers are pleased to get rid of Ryko. SKIP enters. He's a clone of Ryko. 
SKIP Like um... What's the deal, you guys gonna order? 
The customers give each other a "Here we go again" look 
ANGLE - THE GUYS 
They're laughing uproariously and carrying on as Ryko comes over and sits down. 
RYKO Hi pals. 
The guys acknowledge him. 
GARY Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement? 
ANGLE - RICK 
RICK All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is. 
CHULO Man, you're losing your audience. 
RICK Okay... This is it... I'm getting married. 
O'NEILL What? 
CHULO You're kidding. 
GARY I don't believe it. 
RYKO Fuck me! 
RICK Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro. 
CHULO Hey, man, congratulations! 
Chulo gets up and gives Rick a big bear hug... The other guys shake his hand. 
GARY Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married? 
RICK Because I love her. What can I tell you? 
RYKO You sure? This means no more partying. 
RICK No more raping and pillaging, either. You'll have to carry on without me. 
GARY Next Saturday... That's just two more weeks to live. 
O'NEILL Hold it... As long as you're gonna go through with this, the least we can do is make sure you go out in style. 
CHULO (warming to this) Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads. 
O'NEILL Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living. 
RICK Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will. 
GARY Let's have a toast. 
The guys all raise their glasses. 
O'NEILL To Rick. 
GARY To us. 
CHULO To girls with big pairs. 
RICK It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished. 
DEBBIE (looking at the stove) I think your dinner's burning. 
Rick crosses to the stove. A small fire is coming out of one of the frying pans. He douses it with water. 
RICK Don't worry... it's supposed to do this. 
DEBBIE (setting the table) Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun. 
RICK Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me. 
DEBBIE You're going to have a bachelor party? 
RICK Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. (he brings all the food to the table) Well, what do you think? 
DEBBIE It looks awful. 
RICK Yes, but looks are deceiving... (takes a bite) Not in this case, however. 
DEBBIE Are you going to have women at your party? 
RICK No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home. 
DEBBIE I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers. 
RICK Oh, those. Why do you ask? 
DEBBIE Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy. 
Rick grabs her; starts kissing her passionately on the neck. 
RICK Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo man. No painted lady ever gonna come between us. 
DEB I need you to promise. 
RICK Okay, you got it. I got a way we can seal the deal -- what'd you say? 
He grabs her. They kiss and slide down onto the table, knocking the dishes to the floor. 
EXT. BEL AIR-TYPE ESTATE - DAY 
Through the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit. She pulls up behind a new Porsche 911 and a Jeep, all decked out with rifles, nets and other hunting equipment. As she walks down the path toward the house, she sees something off in the distance that startles her. 
DEBBIE'S POV 
A large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side door of the house. 
ANGLE - DEBBIE 
DEBBIE (calling O.S.) Cole?... Cole! 
DEBBIE'S POV 
The "Bear" turns around. We SEE that the bear is, in fact, dead. It is being carried by a tall, handsome HUNTER. He waves to Debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside. 
INT. COLE'S SMOKEHOUSE - DAY 
Debbie opens a rustic-looking door and peers in. 
DEBBIE Cole? 
COLE (O.S.) Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse. 
CAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room. She passes several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from the wall. She makes her way past some sections of an undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended from the ceiling. Finally we see COLE WHITTIER, a Steve Garvey look-alike... rugged all-American, and heir to the Whittier Plastic Wrap fortune. Despite his jockish good looks and outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is definitely unsavory. 
As Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of him. (NOTE: For the squeamish, all of this is done OUT OF FRAME. The only thing we should HEAR are the delightful SOUNDS of TAXIDERMY.) 
COLE Hi, Deb. Just got back from the mountains. (as he cuts in with a surgeon's skill) Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna look great in the den. 
Debbie tries her best not to look down at what he's doing. 
DEBBIE Cole, we've got to talk. 
COLE Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? 
DEBBIE No, Cole, I... 
COLE (lifting an organ of some sort O.S.) It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas. 
DEBBIE Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you... 
COLE You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... 
DEBBIE Cole, I'm marrying Rick. 
COLE (confused) You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me? 
Rick starts humming the "ABC Wide World of Sports" theme loudly. Mr. T. gives him a disgusted look and serves the ball. Rick smashes the ball and sends it over the fence, out of the court. 
EXT. THE THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' BACKYARD - DAY 
A middle-aged COUPLE are sitting on some lawn furniture trying to read the newspaper. A tennis ball comes down from the sky and hits the guy squarely on the top of the head. PULL OUT to REVEAL that they're surrounded by dozens of tennis balls. 
MAN One of these days I'm gonna burn Thomerson's court to the ground. 
EXT. THE THOMERSON'S - MEDIUM SHOT - DAY 
Rick and Mr. Thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over some lemonade in front of the tennis court. 
RICK Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience. 
MR. THOMERSON Rick, I want to cut through the b.s. 
RICK I'd love that. 
MR. THOMERSON (sitting on his anger) Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes. 
RICK Mr. Thomerson, I... 
MR. THOMERSON Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions... 
RICK Feel free. 
MR. THOMERSON First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life... 
As Mr. Thomerson drones on, Rick shifts uncomfortably in his chair, focusing his attention on Debbie, her mother and her older, cynical cousin, ILENE, who are sitting nearby on the rear patio. 
ANGLE - DEBBIE, MRS. THOMERSON AND ILENE 
MRS. THOMERSON I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year. 
DEBBIE Great, Mom. 
ILENE If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party. 
DEBBIE Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick. 
ILENE Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble? 
DEBBIE Ilene, Rick promised... 
ILENE Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs. 
MRS. THOMERSON (trying to change the subject) Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. (calling to Mr. T) Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade? 
ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON AND RICK 
MR. THOMERSON In a second... (to Rick) And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words. 
RICK Well, sir, that's quite a list. But you're absolutely right. And if I work hard at it, I think I can be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch... 
Mr. Thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his breath. He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. They get up at the same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over Mr. T., and the lemons bounding over the fence. 
EXT. THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' HOUSE 
The Neighbor we saw before is reading his paper when an avalanche of lemons comes flying at him, joining the tennis balls on the lawn. 
NEIGHBOR I hate those people... I really do. 
INT. THOMERSON HOUSE - DAY 
The Thomersons, Rick, Debbie and Ilene are just finishing lunch. The DOORBELL RINGS. Mr. Thomerson gets up to answer it. Standing there is Cole, wearing his tennis shorts. 
COLE Hi, everybody. Am I late? 
MR. THOMERSON Not at all. We're just finishing lunch. 
Cole crosses to the table and kisses Mrs. T's hand gallantly. 
COLE Good to see you, Mrs. Thomerson. Hello, Debbie. 
He turns to Rick. 
COLE (continuing) And... 
RICK Bond... James Bond. 
Cole gives him a quick look of contempt and exits with Mr. T. 
MR. THOMERSON (O.S.) So, Cole, you been practicing your game? 
COLE (O.S.) Sure have... 
DEBBIE Why is Cole here? 
COLE Seventy-five hundred. 
RICK Not interested. 
COLE Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart... 
RICK I'm marrying Debbie. 
COLE Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools... 
RICK (to O'Neill) What is this person's story here? 
O'NEILL The way I see it, the big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances lying around. 
Debbie and Mr. T. have joined Rick. 
DEBBIE Cole, what are you doing here? 
MR. THOMERSON He's just trying to save you from making a mistake. (to Rick) A big mistake. 
RICK Thanks, Dad. (to Cole) Cole, go away. 
COLE He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would. 
RICK Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now. 
Cole turns red with anger. 
COLE (pissed) Rick, me and you aren't through yet. 
He runs off. 
RICK (a la talk show host) Ladies and gentlemen, Cole Whittier. Let's hear it for him -- a funny, funny guy. We love ya, babe. 
The wind suddenly picks up. A storm is coming in off the sea. Father Falwell's cassock blows up again. It starts to rain and hail. Everyone runs for cover but Rick and O'Neill. 
RICK (to O'Neill) You think the gods are telling me something? 
INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Rick is snuggled cozily on his side of the bed, fast asleep. Debbie is staring anxiously at the ceiling. After a couple of beats, she tugs at Rick's shoulder. 
RICK (drowsy) Huh? Wha... 
DEBBIE I can't sleep. 
RICK Oh... I got something for that. 
He groggily reaches into the nightstand, pulls out a hammer. He raises it as if to hit Debbie over the head. 
DEBBIE Stop fooling around... I need to talk. 
RICK What's the matter? 
DEBBIE I don't know... I just feel scared. 
RICK (he sits up) About what? 
DEBBIE The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party... 
RICK I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right. 
DEBBIE Before or After I have my nervous breakfown? 
RICK C'mere. 
He starts to gently rub her shoulders. She breathes deeply, trying to let go. 
DEBBIE That feels so great. 
RICK Good... 
DEBBIE Um... that's very relaxing. 
RICK Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland. 
He slowly lowers her to her pillow and tucks the covers in around her. 
RICK (continuing) Close your eyes... that's it... There's nothing to worry about... I love you... I'm a great guy... (yawning) In two days you're gonna be Mrs. Great Guy. 
He yawns again and turns off the light on the night table. There is a beat of silence in the dark. We PUSH IN ON their faces, which are faintly illuminated by a street light outside the open window. Both of them have their eyes wide open as they stare at the ceiling in fearful anticipation of the next day. 
INT. AIRPORT - DAY 
The guys (except Gary) are walking through the busy airport. 
RYKO You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together? 
INT. THE THOMERSON'S - NIGHT 
Several of Debbie's friends have arrived and are chatting amiably in the living room. Phoebe is dipping potato chips into a bowl that says "Muffy" on it. 
PHOEBE Do you have any more of this dip, Mrs. Thomerson? It's really excellent. 
MRS. THOMERSON You just ate Purina Cat Chow. 
PHOEBE Gross me out... 
Debbie comes into the living room and sits next to Bobbie. 
DEBBIE (concerned) What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party? 
BOBBIE They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies. 
DEBBIE What do you mean? 
BOBBIE I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car. 
DEBBIE You're kidding. 
BOBBIE Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. (starts to giggle) 
EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Rick, Ryko, O'Neill, Chulo, Larry and Stan are walking down the hallway, looking for their room. 
O'NEILL (spots the room) Aha! 1002. 
The guys give out a hearty cheer as they huddle around the door. O'Neill grabs the doorknob. He takes his time, playing up the moment. 
O'NEILL (continuing) And now... 
The guys lean forward, anticipating the opening of the gates of heaven. 
O'NEILL (continuing) ...to our honored guest Rick, and his life-long friends, I say... (turns the doorknob) ...gentlemen, start your boners. 
He flings open the door and everyone but he and Rick burst into the room. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
The guys all but dive into the room. It is a two-room suite with living room/kitcheonette and separate bedroom. The room has been decorated with balloons. A sign reads: "Happy Bachelor Party!" It looks far from professionally decorated. Chulo frantically checks out the rooms. 
RYKO Bitchin' place. 
He hangs a chin-up bar in a doorway and starts to chin himself. 
O'NEILL I did the balloons myself. 
He takes a prophylactic out of a Trojan carton. He blows it up. On closer examination, we SEE all the balloons are inflated prophylactics. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Chulo returns from his search of the rooms. 
CHULO (crazed) Where's the women, man? We gotta have women. 
O'NEILL Chulo, one thing at a time. 
CHULO Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it. 
STAN What's first? 
O'NEILL A bit of a warm-up. 
He threads a film projector. 
O'NEILL (continuing) We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"... 
RICK Olivier's in that, right? 
O'NEILL Then it's on to the real thing. 
GUYS (cheering) All right! 
Ryko flips off the lights as O'Neill puts the projector into forward and the title flashes on a movie screen. All the guys yell in anticipation. 
HOME MOVIE SCREEN 
We SEE a man stepping out of a shower. He puts on his robe and exits the bathroom. To his surprise and to the delight of our guys, two young, beautiful Nordic looking women, dressed in micro-minis and see-through blouses stand waiting for him. 
CHULO (O.S.) They're Danish, I know it. I'm crazy for Danes. 
RYKO AND CHULO 
sit watching the screen. 
MARGOT We're here. 
MRS. THOMERSON How nice. 
TINA I'm Tina Stahl. 
MRS. THOMERSON Of course. Stan's wife... Everyone come in. 
REVERSE ANGLE - THE STREET 
Cole sits in his car and watches happily as the hookers go inside. 
INT. THOMERSON'S LIVING ROOM 
Debbie spots Tina. She is oblivious to the two hookers. 
DEBBIE Tina! 
They give each other a big hug. The hookers watch closely. Debbie leads Tina to the other women. 
DEBBIE (continuing) You know everyone here, don't you? 
TINA Yes. 
The girls hug and give big hellos. Meanwhile, Margot and Darlene have come to the conclusion they've been hired for a kinky scene. 
MARGOT One of these, huh? 
DARLENE Looks that way. 
MARGOT Buck's a buck. 
They start to unbutton their coats. 
Tina hands Debbie her present. 
DEBBIE It's so heavy. 
She sits and the girls gather around as she starts to open the gift. 
Phoebe happens to look off and is stunned by what she sees. The others are curious at what she is looking at and they too stare O.S., stunned to silence. 
MARGOT AND DARLENE 
dressed in leather and mesh stockings. Margot carries a whip. Darlene is holding a phallic electrical device. 
DARLENE (business-like) Is there an empty outlet in here? 
Debbie unconsciously points to a nearby wall. Margot and Darlene stand amidst the girls. Darlene plugs in her device. She and Margot start to embrace and fondle one another. The girls watch in stony silence. Dumbfounded at what they see. Margot and Darlene start to sink to the floor, OUT OF OUR SIGHT. Before they disappear, we see Margot take out her gum and park it on an end table. Now OUT OF SIGHT, the girls watch for a beat. Then we hear the WHIRRING of Darlene's implement. Our girls screech in horror and hold onto one another in a protective clump. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
The guys are sitting around drinking, eating and looking generally bored. Chulo sits in front of the TV, glumly watching an old "I Love Lucy" re-run. 
CHULO If I was Ricky Ricardo I would beat the shit out of that chick. 
LARRY (totally ripped, staring at the black and white image) Wow! The colors are sooo beautiful. 
Chulo gives him a strange look. 
RYKO (opening a beer, reading the label) Isn't there any beer that's not imported? All this stuff's from St. Louis. 
RICK (calling to imaginary person O.S.) Bartender, round of brains for my friend here. 
Gary enters the room. He's all smiles. Confident he's done a great job arranging for the entertainment. 
GARY How's it going, guys? 
Everyone crowds around him like children greeting Daddy. Looking for candy hidden in his coat. 
EVERYONE Where's the girls? Where's the girls? 
Rick pushes them away from Gary like a referee separating two fighters. 
RICK Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner. 
GARY What's going on? 
CHULO Nothing. We got no women. 
GARY Screw you. 
RICK It's true. 
GARY This place should have been wall to wall tits by now. 
RICK (to O'Neill) Guy paints a beautiful picture. 
COLE I got the car only two months ago -- it's got -- 
As he looks out the window we see with him that his car is gone. 
COLE (continuing) Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone! 
RICK Maybe it had something to do. 
COLE Shit! 
He charges out of the room. 
O'NEILL Odd. He's only been gone a few seconds and I already miss him. 
EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT 
Gary spots Jumbo on the same grimy street corner. He's pimping for one of his ladies and makes a sale to an anxious young Marine as Gary approaches him. 
GARY Jumbo, where the hell are the women? 
JUMBO What are you talking about, asshole? 
GARY Your whores never showed up. 
JUMBO They left an hour ago, pink nuts. 
GARY Screw you! 
Jumbo has had enough. He backs Gary against a wall and pulls a knife on him. 
JUMBO (irritated; a lot) That's it, prick lips. 
GARY What are you... 
JUMBO I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got? 
GARY Why? 
JUMBO Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash. 
Gary hurriedly digs into his pockets and gives Jumbo his money. 
GARY This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere. 
JUMBO (mock sincerity) Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls. 
He snaps his fingers and TWO of his LADIES come forward. 
JUMBO (continuing; to girls) Give him the works. 
GARY That's more like it. 
The girls walk over to Gary and proceed to beat the crap out of him. 
EXT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT 
It is a garish nightclub. A large lighted billboard proclaims "ALL MALE... ALL NUDE." Two cars pull into the parking lot. Debbie and all of her shower guests get out. 
DEBBIE Are you sure this is a good idea? 
ILENE Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party. 
DEBBIE That doesn't mean it was Rick's party. 
ILENE Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men. 
BOBBIE (agreeing) Yeah. 
MRS. THOMERSON (reluctantly) I don't know about this. 
DEBBIE C'mon, Mother, it'll be fun. 
The girls giggle as they enter the place, with Mrs. Thomerson following reluctantly behind. 
INT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT 
PHOEBE Look at that guy. What a hunk. 
BOBBIE Check out the other guy's buns. 
TINA Let's sit over here. 
They head for some empty tables. Debbie notices her mother is still standing transfixed by the MAN on display on stage. Debbie grabs her by the shoulder. 
DEBBIE C'mon, Mom. 
On the way to the table they pass MICHAEL, the bartender, who looks at them and immediately recognizes Debbie. Finding this interesting, he picks up a phone and dials. 
MR. THOMERSON A real turd. 
EXECUTIVE (at a loss for words) Well... hope she'll be very happy. 
They exit into ballroom. 
INT. CHIPPENDALE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Amidst the kitchen activities we SEE Rick, O'Neill, Ryko, Stan, and Michael. 
RICK So will your friend Nick do it? 
MICHAEL He'll do anything for money. 
RICK I love his attitude. (calling off) They still out there? 
STAN 
He's peeking through the kitchen door. We SEE Debbie and the shower girls whooping it up at a ringside table. Stan turns back to Rick. 
STAN Breathing heavy at ringside. 
He joins the other guys. 
RICK (a la Long John Silver) So, they want action, eh? Are you with me, me hardies? 
The guys shout approval as NICK, one of the male dancers, enters carrying a tray of food. Nick is a muscled hunk. 
MICHAEL Guys, this is Chippendale's star attraction, Nicholas Carter... better known as Nick the Dick. 
RYKO Nick the what? 
Nick drops his pants. Since he's being SHOT only from the WAIST UP, we can't see what the guys see. 
NICK (proudly) The Dick. 
ALL OUR GUYS (astonished at this O.S. sight) Jesus Christ! 
RICK Let's get this thing going. Tray, please. 
Nick holds the tray waist high. Rick arranges the food. 
RICK (continuing) Looks good. Can I have the bun, Michael? 
Michael hands Rick a hot dog bun. Rick places it on the tray. He turns to Nick. 
RICK (continuing) And now, Nick... or is it Mr. Dick? 
NICK Nick. 
RICK Nick, if you would be so kind... 
NICK 
He holds the tray with one hand. With the other he reaches OUT OF FRAME. In a nutshell, what he does is place his honker in the hot dog bun. As he slaps his business into the bun, we HEAR a solid THUMP. 
RICK Nick, the rest is all yours. 
NICK (excusing himself) Gentlemen. 
He exits. As he does, our guys crowd around and peek through the kitchen door. 
NICK 
We FOLLOW him as he approaches the girls' table. 
NICK If you ladies would like to serve yourselves... 
The girls grab their orders. Mrs. T. is last. Hers is the hot dog. She points to it. 
MRS. THOMERSON Is this the foot long? 
NICK And then some. 
Mrs. T. grabs the hot dog. It won't come off the tray. She yanks harder. Nick drops the tray and Mrs. T. finally comes to realize what she is pulling on. She screams in terror. Because of sheer fright, she can't seem to drop Nick's schlong from her grip. The rest of our ladies look to see Mrs. T. 's hot dog. They scream in shock. Debbie spits out her marguerita, hitting Phoebe in the face. 
OUR GUYS 
They are busting a gut watching the girls' reactions. 
ILENE She looks up just in time to see the guys close the kitchen door. 
MRS. T 
still frozen in a state of shock. The girls try to pry her hands off. 
EXT. STREET CORNER 
RICK Really? 
LARRY Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party. 
Larry gets up and exits the room. PUSH IN ON Rick. He looks after Larry, concerned. 
RICK (to himself) He ain't all right. 
ANGLE - THE LOBBY 
Cole sits in a phone booth holding the receiver impatiently. 
ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL THE ADJOINING PHONE BOOTH 
The receiver is off the hook. After a beat, Mr. T. crosses to the phone. Cole does not see him, and vice versa. 
MR. T Hello? 
COLE Mr. Thomerson. 
MR. T Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is? 
COLE Yes I did. 
MR. T Fine. How's everything going? 
COLE Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere... 
MR. THOMERSON So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. (yelling) Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me? 
COLE What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you. 
Looking over into the next booth, he sees Thomerson's back. 
COLE (continuing) Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise. 
MR. THOMERSON Well, tell the asshole to shut up. 
COLE Right. (calling off) Hey, shut up. Okay, sir. 
MR. THOMERSON Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling... (yelling O.S.) Shut up, I'm talking here. (into phone) Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage. 
He slams the phone down and EXITS SCREEN RIGHT. Cole starts to exit left when he spots Chulo getting into the elevator. 
CHULO Hey, man, your car's looking good. 
COLE (crazed) Where is it? 
CHULO Out front. 
The elevator doors slam shut. Cole races out into the street. 
EXT. HOTEL 
Cole comes bursting out into the street. We can tell by his shocked expression he doesn't like what he sees. 
COLE Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. 
CAMERA PANS as he charges to his Porsche. His pride and joy has now, thanks to Chulo, been customized into a Chicano special. It's chopped and channeled; dingleberries rim the back window, flames have been painted on the rear fender; a chain steering wheel, fuzzy dashboard, dice hanging from the mirror. A real East L.A. beauty. 
ANGLE - COLE 
He's snapped -- totally flipped. He turns and yells up to the hotel: 
COLE (screaming) Rick... Rick... Goddamn it. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - ANGLE - RICK 
He's standing near the window. 
RICK Gee. I think that's for me. 
He looks out the window and sees Cole standing next to his transformed Porsche. 
COLE Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be. 
RICK (yelling back) Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy? 
COLE (furious) You've had it. I'm gonna get you. 
ANGLE - THE STREET 
Cole hops in his car and drives off, blowing his HORN at oncoming traffic. The HORN PLAYS "LA CUCURACHA." Cole slams his fist on the steering wheel in disgust. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
RICK (to guys) Don't you love it when old friends stop by? 
UNDER THE TABLE 
The Hooker grabs the money. 
BACK TO SCENE 
RICK I think you'll enjoy this table. 
O'NEILL So long, Father. 
He and Rick, suppressing a laugh, exit. Father Falwell picks up the menu. We HEAR the ZIP SOUND. Father perks up. He doesn't know what the hell is happening. 
O'Neill turns to Rick as they're leaving the coffee shop. 
O'NEILL I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now? 
RICK I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
Rick and O'Neill enter the suite. No one is there. 
RICK Where the hell is everybody? 
Everyone jumps out from their hiding places. With our guys is Gary and his team of FIVE PROSTITUTES. 
GARY Surprise! (gesturing to the girls) The team bus just pulled in. 
STAN Hookers. It's a party! 
RICK All right! 
One of our hookers, KELLEY, gets everyone's attention. 
KELLEY Who's first, guys? 
Everyone acts as if they're in grade school. They raise their hands; they come on like kids trying to get the teacher's attention. 
GUYS Oh, me... me... me! 
O'NEILL Wait. The guest of honor should be first. 
RICK Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break. 
STAN Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first. 
O'NEILL A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead off. I'll screw clean up. 
Everyone cheers Stan's good fortune. Kelley takes Stan by the hand and leads him into the bedroom. Gary turns on a record and everyone starts dancing. Larry is laying out drugs on a table. They consist of lines of coke and various happy time pills of all colors and shapes. Rick takes a look at the layout. 
RICK How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Chulo enters. He sees the party has taken off. 
CHULO I have returned! 
He spots a sweet-faced young hooker, LAVERNE. She is prancing around in her bra and underwear. Chulo wants her. 
CHULO (continuing; points to her) You! Mine! 
Laverne is frightened of Chulo. Mainly because he's coming at her like a sex-starved buffalo. Chulo goes after her. Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door. Chulo gives chase. 
RICK (to O'Neill) Chulo's got such a nice, light touch with women. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR 
Laverne runs down the hall, closely pursued by Chulo. An all- female NEW WAVE BAND comes to the door. O'Neill greets them. 
O'NEILL Terrific. You made it... You can set up over there... 
As they enter we go to -- 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Chulo is on the heels of Laverne. She bursts through a door to excape him. 
INT. STAGE 
Laverne finds herself on the stage of a beauty pageant, still in her bra and panties. FIVE other LADIES are dressed in their bathing suits. Chulo stops short of running on stage. Laverne, seeking the safety of the moment, stands in line with the contestants. 
ANGLE ON MR. THOMERSON AND OTHER JUDGES 
They like what they see. 
MR. THOMERSON (to another) Great bathing suit. 
There is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist. 
He heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor INTO FRAME. He turns it on and runs it over his wrist. Of course, nothing happens. Just then Rick enters. 
RICK What the hell are you doing? 
LARRY I'm trying to slash my wrists. 
RICK You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor? 
LARRY I couldn't find any razor blades. 
RICK Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up. 
LARRY (suddenly laughs like a crazy man) Ha, ha, ha. 
RICK No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party. 
As he shoves Larry out, Gary enters the bathroom. His expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life. 
RICK Gary, how we doing, big stallion? 
GARY Rick, I really think I'm in love. 
RICK This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on. 
Rick exits as Gary dreamily crosses to the mirror. 
GARY (into mirror) This time it's real. She's wonderful. 
Gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet. Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away, then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open. Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his dress and turns to Gary. 
SHE The name's Tim. I'm always available. 
He blows a kiss and starts to leave, but turns back. 
SHE/TIM By the way... I also do engine work on BMW's. 'Bye. 
Tim exits. Gary feels filthy. He rips open the cabinet, takes out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his teeth. He rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat. 
EXT. STABLES - NIGHT 
Ryko and Stan drive up to a country stable. They get out of the car and open a barn door. Both are pleased at what they see. 
RYKO All right. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Standing there is a donkey, eating straw. 
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Cole drives up in his Chulo-customized Porsche. He gets out, then reaches back into the car and takes out a crossbow (the heavy duty metal kind hunters use). He looks up menacingly at the hotel and spots the room where the party is going on. He sees another hotel across the way. He gets an idea and enters the other hotel. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
The party is going full blast. Some other girls and a couple of guys (hotel guests) enter the room and are quickly swept up in the spirit of the party. O'Neill approaches Rick. 
O'NEILL Rick, I'm concerned. 
RICK About what? 
O'NEILL This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet. 
RICK (trying to joke his way out of it) Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens. 
O'NEILL I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please. 
RICK Oooooo. 
O'NEILL (indicating the bedroom) Right in there, pal. 
RICK If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics. 
O'NEILL That's the old Rick! 
Rick enters the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM 
It's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on. In one corner of the room we SEE the figure of a woman. 
RICK Hellooo! 
Tracey walks toward Rick. The light illuminates her. What we see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth. She is totally nude. A vision that would make any man screw and ask questions later. 
RICK (to himself; overwhelmed by her) Eat my chair! 
He has Rick right where he wants him. 
CROSSBOW TRIGGER 
Cole's finger squeezes off a shot. 
RICK 
Luckily he starts to dance with a female guest. This takes him out of line of the arrow. 
HOTEL SUITE WINDOW 
The arrow zooms through the open window. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
Rajah is standing by the door. The arrow zips through the room, misses everyone and lodges in the wall inches from Rajah's head. He looks at the arrow and realizes he almost was killed. 
RAJAH (frightened) Holy Dung is this thing! I sic Milt on you. He get back bitches. Me? I haul ass. 
He runs out of the room. Rick and O'Neill watch Rajah exit, confused. 
RICK Who was that? 
O'NEILL I don't know. 
RICK (looking at arrow) What's this? 
O'NEILL Got me. 
Just then another arrow comes zipping through the room, lodging in a chair inches from Rick. 
RICK (to new arrow) How 'bout this? 
O'NEILL Still drawing a blank. 
They turn in the direction the arrow came from and look out the window. They spot Cole loading his bow in the room across the way. 
RICK He look familiar? 
O'NEILL Very. 
RICK C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business. 
They start for the door as we go to -- 
INT. BACKSTAGE OF BEAUTY PAGEANT 
Chulo is waiting outside a door that says "Dressing Room." Several of the beauty contestants race out wearing formal gowns. Laverne follows them, wearing a very tight black dress. Chulo approaches her. 
LAVERNE Stay away from me. 
CHULO I'm not gonna hassle you... Don't worry. You look beautiful. 
LAVERNE (nervous) Think so? I borrowed it from one of the girls. I don't look too fat? 
CHULO You're an angel... A madonna. 
Laverne is moved by this. Before she can respond a Stage Manager takes her by the arm and pushes her on stage. 
STAGE MANAGER You're on. 
Chulo watches Laverne enter the stage to hearty applause. 
ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE 
Mr. Thomerson and the other Judges sit in the front row making notes. 
MEDIUM SHOT - THE STAGE 
The girls are lined up on pedestals as the MC approaches Laverne 
MC All right, here is your question, Miss... Er... 
He looks through his cards hurriedly and is unable to find Laverne's. 
LAVERNE Rivas. 
MC Miss Rivas... Yes... How would you solve our country's present economic problems? 
LAVERNE Who, me? 
MC Yes. 
LAVERNE That's a good question. From the way I understand it, according to supply side economics, when supply exceeds demand, recession is the result. That's why I think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate. That way, the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery. 
ANGLE - THE CROWD 
He hears a KNOCK on the DOOR. Cole quickly hides his crossbow under the bed and answers the door. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Tracey stands in the open door. Cole's jaw drops open. He has never seen anything as lovely. 
COLE Yeah? 
TRACEY Make love to me... please. 
She walks into the room. Cole closes the door. 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COLE'S DOOR 
Rick and O'Neill run up to the door. They listen closely. We HEAR the SOUND of Cole's SHIRT being RIPPED off, the buttons flying around the room, then the SOUND of his pant ZIPPER being undone. 
RICK T minus... 3... 2... 1. We have ignition. 
e and O'Neill burst into the room and close the door. 
COLE (O.S.) Hey! 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
O'Neill is tying the end of a sheet around the bed post. We SEE the bed is minus its sheets and blankets. 
O'NEILL All set here. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made a rope. The other end is tied around Cole's chest. And that's all Cole is wearing; he's nude. 
COLE You guys are never going to get away with this. 
Rick stuffs Cole's underwear in his mouth to gag him. 
RICK We're just going to keep you in a safe place until after the party. 
He and O'Neill lift Cole up and put him out the window. They hang onto the sheet/blanket rope and lower him slowly outside. 
EXT. HOTEL 
We SEE Cole being lowered from the window. 
CLOSER ON COLE 
He's struggling, but can do nothing about his predicament. He looks down. 
COLE'S POV 
The hotel parking lot is ten stories below. 
COLE 
He looks up to the guys. 
RICK AND O'NEILL 
They look down at him from the window above. 
RICK Now, don't get into any trouble. 
O'NEILL Take care. 
RICK & O'NEILL Byeeeee! 
They duck inside the window. 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
Rick, O'Neill and Tracey exit the room. 
RICK (to Tracey) Don't you wish you were a guy so you could have fun like this? 
COLE 
He's scared to death. 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
We SEE that Cole's weight is pulling the bed to the window. 
COLE 
He's slowly lowering down the side of the building. 
INT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM 
INT. CAR 
Stan and O'Neill sit in the car looking at the hotel. 
STAN How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside? 
RYKO I don't know. 
STAN What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out. 
RYKO Maybe I did... I don't remember. 
STAN (through clenched teeth) I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once. 
ANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE 
Just then the "Moose" from the beauty pageant steps outside the hotel for a smoke. 
The guy in front removes the head, takes a drag of his cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear. After a beat, smoke steams out the rear end of the costume. 
ANGLE - THE GUYS IN THE CAR 
They both have the same idea. They stroll out of the car and approach the two men in the moose suit. We can't hear what they're saying, but we can SEE the bills Stan is taking out of his pocket. Ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the trailer with it. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
The door opens and Stan and Ryko enter pulling the "Moose" by a rope. 
RYKO Can you believe how perfect it fits? 
STAN Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular. 
Just then Rick and O'Neill saunter into the lobby. 
O'NEILL Hey, you guys... 
RICK Who's your friend? 
STAN (keeping it a surprise) Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party. 
RICK Great. (to moose) I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing? 
At that moment he HEARS a SPLAT hit the ground. The guys look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown excrement nestled in the shag carpet. 
RICK (continuing) Say no more. 
The Manager crosses to them. 
MANAGER I don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess. 
O'NEILL (resigned) Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something? 
All the guests turn away in disgust. Stan takes out a handkerchief and hands it to Rick, who closes his eyes and picks up the warm little bundle. The Manager turns and walks off in a huff. On the way back to the elevator, Rick checks to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's contents on the front desk, just OUT OF FRAME. Smiling contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the elevator. The doors slam shut. 
ANGLE AT THE DESK 
The Manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out of town. 
MANAGER I'll have the boy take your bags up. 
He goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes down on something soft and mushy. The look on his face tells us what it is. It's the "gift" Rick left behind. 
MANAGER (to couple) Excuse me. I seem to have a hand full of potty. 
Revolted, he races into a room marked "MEN." 
ANGLE - BALLROOM DOORS 
The doors open and several people from the Moosehead beauty pageant come out. Mr. Thomerson is one of them. 
EXECUTIVE Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it. 
MR. THOMERSON Any time, Al. 
Mr. T. crosses to the door just as Cole comes running in, slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet that held him suspended out the window. They both are shocked to see one another. 
MR. THOMERSON Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened? 
COLE (nearly hysterical) The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... 
MR. THOMERSON Take hold of yourself. What room are they in? 
COLE 
MR. THOMERSON All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. (disgusted) You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes. 
COLE Yes, sir. 
COLE She's mine! 
He drives off. 
RICK He's kidnapped her! Everyone into the bus! 
They all board the bus. 
EXT. CITY STREET 
As Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship. 
INT. PORSCHE 
COLE Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. 
He looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them. Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs OUT OF FRAME. 
EXT. CITY STREET 
A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely placing orange cones in the center line of the road. 
Cole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed. 
INT. RICK'S BUS 
Rick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over. 
MAINTENANCE TRUCK 
Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
Rick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught up with Cole. 
EXT. STREET 
The vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles back into the parking lot. 
EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT 
Cole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into the theater entrance. 
Rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out of the bus. 
COLE He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters. 
RICK Fan out and look for them. 
They all go running into various theaters. 
ANGLE - RYKO 
He approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie playing inside. 
RYKO Aw, I've seen this one already. 
Rick chooses a theater and goes inside. 
INT. MOVIE THEATER 
The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. He gives chase and catches up with Cole. 
He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman. 
A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth. 
MAN (to LADY next to him) Gee, what a realistic effect. 
WOMAN Yeah, like you're in the movie with them. 
Rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle. 
PATRON (to his date) Best 3D I've ever seen. 
As the movie ends, Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging him out of the theater. 
INT. MALL OUTSIDE THEATER 
Rick exits the theater with Cole. He tosses Cole to Chulo. Debbie comes running behind Rick. 
RICK (to Debbie) Are you okay? 
DEBBIE Yeah. 
RICK This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?

Revised Draft 
September 8, 1987 
FACE IN ON 
THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN 
sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER 
Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life... 
A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison. Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before. 
WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER 
Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES... 
JONES Burritos...Enchiladas... 
DEJESUS (hispanic voice) Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?... 
BOWMAN (female) I can't wait for fresh vegetables... 
Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?" "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the others. 
BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, cut the chatter.  You're not out of here, yet.  Who's the hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on container 22? 
A pause, then more voices. 
SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO (redneck drawl) The man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit. 
JONES' VOICE/ RADIO Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello, Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook, over. 
A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE SHACK.  Then a woman's voice. 
WILLIE'S VOICE (woman's voice) Six to Shack.  I'm the hook. 
INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM 
littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good- looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened. From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way. 
BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, Six, let's wrap this container and call it a day. 
Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is moving. 
UNDERWATER 
WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure. 
She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio. 
SIXPACK'S VOICE Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something?  We're all waiting on you, honey. 
WILLIE (under control) Keep your pants on Sixpack. I promise you'll be inside before "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on. 
OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta girl," etc... 
Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in by a winch. 
WILLIE'S VOICE Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready to winch. 
COBB Where's Doc?! 
BECK(RADIO) He's not at his station. 
DEJESUS (panicked) Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive me of my-- 
BECK'S VOICE (making a decision) Get him into the Shack. 
DeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion.  "15, 14, 13..."  DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the last few yards to the SHACK. 
INSIDE/SHACK - SAME 
ON BECK  sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life.  We see the same countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8... 
OUTSIDE 
ON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams. 
ON BECK 
DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room. Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving! Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock. 
INSIDE/LIFT LOCK 
WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water. 
CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then suddenly they flutter.  He's alive! 
THE MESS - LATER 
The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess features neatly stenciled letters that say:  "DAYS TILL PICKUP".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a "3"... 
A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES, Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE, twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist. DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still shaken from his experience. 
The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight. 
BOWMAN I'm telling you, it's the suits! 
JONES Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened! 
SIXPACK And just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh? 
Sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a huge belch. 
SIXPACK(cont'd) That would have been you, DeJesus... 
DeJesus keeps his head down. 
SIXPACK(cont'd) Yeah...I was standing next to a guy who blew a suit once in the Indian Ocean...little tiny hole in the fucking toe of his suit ...ocean came in and the pressure crammed his whole fucking body up into his helmet. They just buried his helmet. 
DEJESUS (coldly) I know all about implosion, man. 
SIXPACK Yeah, I bet you do. (laughs) I bet you were imploding in your pants. (laughs then imitates a hysterical DeJesus) Jonesy!  Doc!...Help me!  Help me! 
DeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat AS WE CUT TO 
BECK - SAME 
Beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks. 
BECK Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart... 
Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters. 
Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away. 
BECK Shit... 
He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking father.  Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining. 
He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC GROANING NOISE stops him cold.  The entire Shack seems shifting, like a giant waking from a nap. 
MESS 
JONES Uh, oh...I see where this is going... 
BECK (ignoring Jones) ...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to--- 
COBB (erupting) No way, Mister Beck!  No fucking way!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation! 
JONES Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward! 
SIXPACK Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck? Company got to abide by the rules. 
FIVE FACES STARE AT BECK.  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WEAKNESS. THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY. 
BECK I know all about the contract. The point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow...or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you. 
This leaves the group momentarily speechless.  Even DeJesus comes out of his stupor. 
DEJESUS You giving us a day off? 
Beck nods.  Cobb eyes him suspiciously. 
COBB What about our quota? 
BECK You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day. (he looks at the group) It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help. 
The others look around for agreement but Jones doesn't need anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind. 
JONES Count me in. 
Bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree. Buoyed, Beck moves ahead, businesslike... 
BECK Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system... (to Bowman and Sixpack) Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters... 
SIXPACK (disgustedly) Shit... 
BECK Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics. (to group) Any other suit problems she should know about? 
Sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses. 
SIXPACK (to Willie) My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey? 
WILLIE (annoyed) Your pocket? 
SIXPACK The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge. 
WILLIE (disgusted) Right. 
LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME 
ON BECK  He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds himself walking with Willie.  Beck is obviously uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together. She smiles, friendly, at ease. 
WILLIE You did good... 
BECK (a little surprised) What? 
WILLIE Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside... 
BECK There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit... 
WILLIE Still...you did the right thing. 
She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny, but honest compliment.  He savors it. 
THE SWAMP - LATER 
The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters. 
Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked, laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the control switch and hits the START button. 
NNNNNNNNNN.  A motor moves one of the suits along the track toward Willie.  As it turns the corner toward us we see it says:  DEJESUS. 
DOC'S OFFICE - SAME 
Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed. 
MARTIN(cont'd) The one thing I've learned in this company is you can't have enough friends.  It's the only way to survive. 
CLOSE ON A BOOM BOX/ LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME 
The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's Rocky Mountain High. 
DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he works on the intercom system.  He finishes, closing a metal box which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS. 
SWAMP - SAME 
ON WILLIE  She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic computer and is going through the computerized checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of possible problems. 
WILLIE (to herself) Probably a short. 
Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical Short. 
WILLIE(cont'd) Good guess, Williams. 
She types in a "help" command and the computer screen displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most Electrical Engineers baffled.  Willie hardly bats an eye. 
WILLIE(cont'd) Piece of cake. 
She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt.  With two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK. 
THE BILGE - SAME 
The walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes. The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones. 
COBB Okay, watch this.. 
THE SWAMP - SAME 
The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops directly in front of Willie.  She reaches up to open the pocket latch when she stops...listening.  THE NOISE IN THE AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED. 
THE BILGE - SAME 
Jones looks incredulously at Cobb.  He can't believe that's all it took.  Cobb starts gathering up the tools. 
JONES So that's all you do?... 
COBB Shhhh...don't tell no one. (winks) Job security. 
THE SWAMP - SAME 
In the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket in the waist of Sixpack's suit.  Some water drips out.  She pushes the spring a second time.  The pocket opens. Nothing. 
WILLIE (miffed) Nothing wrong with this... 
SUDDENLY THE HIDEOUS SEA SPIDER SPRINGS OUT onto the workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie.  She backs away and it drops into the water at her feet. 
THE DORMITORY 
Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead. 
WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.) (over intercom) Fuck you, Sixpack!  You think you're funny?  You're not funny! 
ON BECK 
He hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom. 
BECK This is Beck.  Is there a problem, Williams? 
SWAMP 
Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her as Beck's words come over the P.A.  Ignoring Beck she watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the skewered sea spider out of the water. 
WILLIE (to Beck) A little problem, sir...but I've got a handle on it now. 
TIME CUT TO: 
THE MESS - LATER 
BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches stock prices scroll across the screen.  Every so often she freezes a stock and types the command:  INFO.  The screen immediately changes to a financial report of the company in question as if prepared by a broker.  In a matter of seconds Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company. 
JONES Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get shit-faced! 
DEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp. 
JONES(cont'd) How about you, brother Cobb? Little Wild Turkey? 
Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head. 
DEJESUS No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker, from way back.  Ain't that right Cobbie? 
Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes. Cobb turns and watches them.  This is obviously a nightly ritual. 
COBB You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for? 
DEJESUS (acting drunk) What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana... 
COBB You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin. 
DEJESUS (laughing) I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes. 
INT. SIXPACK'S BUNK - SAME 
CLOSE ON  The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position representing mad desire. 
Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the photo. 
SIXPACK Oh, Darlin'...come sit on my face... 
He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS!  The SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead. 
Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming. He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams in more pain. 
The whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily "sober up" to stare. 
SIXPACK That bitch! 
MESS 
Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider.  He points angrily at his bleeding foot.  Jones and DeJesus move up to watch. 
SIXPACK (moving into room) Bitch!  Look what you did! 
WILLIE (imitating Sixpack) Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?... 
Everyone laughs, but Sixpack.  He has revenge in his eyes. He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward Willie. 
SIXPACK You think you're so funny? Wait till you taste this! 
As he pushes the dead creature into her face BECK'S VOICE behind him makes him freeze. 
BECK'S VOICE(O.S.) That's enough! 
Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway. 
SIXPACK Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk! 
BECK (cold as ice) How do you know it was Williams? 
SIXPACK (trapped) Huh?  I...uh...uh... 
BECK All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow-- 
SIXPACK AND WILLIE (protesting) Bullshit!  What?!  She...He... 
BECK (cutting them off) At ease!  You both have a half day...Anymore shit and its a full one. 
CLOSE ON BLACKBOARD/ MESS - MORNING 
SCREECH!  Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes "2" in place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words "Days Till Pickup." 
Jones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of cereal and holds his head in mock misery. 
JONES Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music. 
WILLIE (to Sixpack) You screw around like that again and-- 
SIXPACK What's wrong, did you miss me? 
WILLIE Hardly. 
SIXPACK Don't worry, darlin, I'm... 
Suddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides. 
Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio goes dead. 
INSIDE ON BECK 
BECK What's wrong?!  What happened? 
UNDERWATER 
ON WILLIE  She has stopped in her tracks.  All around her is blackness.  Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness. 
WILLIE Sixpack?!  Sixpack... 
Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet. The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers. 
BECK'S VOICE brings Willie back. 
BECK'S VOICE(RADIO) Willie?  What's going on? 
WILLIE He's gone.  I think he's fallen.  I'm going down after him. 
MESS 
Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike. 
DEJESUS That's it Jonesy...Sweat it out, man...Got to get the poison out of our blood. 
Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight, suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in. 
BOWMAN Sixpack is lost. 
CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Bowman, Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room where they are joined by Cobb. 
COBB Weren't they tied?  They're supposed to be tied. 
They all enter the 
CONTROL ROOM 
Beck is at the console with Doc in his chair. 
JONES How far away is she? 
DOC Two hundred meters. 
WILLIE'S VOICE silences them. 
WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO) Four to Shack...nearing the bottom.  Look at this... 
They all stare at the monitor.  The screen is filled with huge waving tubers. 
DOC My God, look at the size of those tubers.... 
DEJESUS Nine, ten feet high... 
BOWMAN If he had his blinkers on-- 
JONES It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him! 
UNDERWATER 
ON WILLIE  She moves through the dense waving forest of giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves slowly. 
BECK'S VOICE(RADIO) One minute. 
Willie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on her left, SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--IT'S SIXPACK.  His mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the ship's huge safe. 
SIXPACK (laughing) I'm rich, honey.  Rich! 
THE SWAMP - LATER 
The door to the Russian ship's safe stands open.  BANG! BANG!  Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a chisel.  While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case with Beck. 
SIXPACK It's all mine if I'm on report. Otherwise you gotta take me off report before you look at any more... Ain't that right, Cobbie? 
COBB You're on your own, Sixpack, you fucked up everybody's day off... 
DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets, wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...Bowman who stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory. 
BOWMAN Personal effects... 
WILLIE (considering a watch) Timex... 
She picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and tosses it to Cobb. 
WILLIE(cont'd) Here's something for you, Cobbie. 
JONES (checking a wallet) Russian money...Don't look like much. 
Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the table...Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman in a bathing suit.  Bowman looks at it. 
BOWMAN (grinning to Sixpack) Yeah, I'd say you can retire with all this loot. 
SIXPACK Shut up. 
Everyone chuckles.  More papers and a small, book-shaped object wrapped in plastic.  Jones unwraps it.  It's a video tape.  He looks at the label. 
WILLIE What is it? 
JONES (reading) "Debbie Does Dallas"... (looks up and grins) Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it... 
DOC May I see it? 
Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it. 
DOC (cont'd) It's a log of some sort. 
Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it out--Papers, more cheap watches. 
ON SIXPACK  He notices something silver, the size of a paperback book, under a stack of papers.  Discreetly he covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off the table out of sight. 
Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught by DeJesus.  He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor bottle. 
WILLIE Vodka. 
COBB What assholes, they lock booze in the safe. 
DEJESUS Probably confiscated.  No booze on board, same as us. 
Doc turns the bottle around in DeJesus' hand so he can read the label. 
DOC (eyeing the bottle) Stolichnaya. 
Everyone looks at Doc. 
COBB You read Russian? 
DOC Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background... 
Cobb stares at him a second then: 
COBB Bullshit. 
DOC (grins) ...and a Russian grandmother... 
Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman. 
INT. INFIRMARY/ SHACK - SAME 
Doc is at the console of his computer.  As words appear on the screen, obviously in response to his query... 
"...would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin..." 
Doc shakes his head disgustedly. 
DOC (to himself) No kidding?  "A virus of unknown origin."  Come on and tell me something I don't know... like what's going on... 
ON SCREEN 
More words come up.  "...no idea..." 
DOC(cont'd) (typing, angrily) Then take a guess, goddamnit! 
He finishes typing and waits for an answer.  The cursor flashes the word "PROCESSING".  Then an answer comes up. "Genetic Alteration?"  The words send a chill down Doc's spine. 
SWAMP ROOM - LATER 
The mood is happy.  Like a high school football locker room after a winning game.  DeJesus climbs out of his suit and slaps Beck on the shoulder. 
DEJESUS Good work out there, Mr. Becky. 
Beck, obviously pleased, looks at the others.  Jones sums up the feelings of the entire group. 
JONES Thank you, sir. 
Beck's grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing red light over the intercom. 
INFIRMARY - LATER 
Beck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad. 
BECK Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder. 
DOC He did. 
BECK Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?! 
Doc looks at Beck wearily and hands him a mask. 
DOC Here.  Put this on.  You examine him. 
BECK I'm not a doctor. 
DOC For this...you don't need to be. 
Beck hesitates, then puts on the mask. 
SICK ROOM 
As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the sheets.  Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the sight.  The black splotches have nearly all grown together. His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed.  Most dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become flared and elongated.  Though not bleeding, the open veins are visible. 
INFIRMARY 
Doc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip.  Beck enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet. 
BECK The mask is because you think it might be...catching? 
DOC I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses... 
BECK (impatiently) And? 
DOC And they didn't believe the symptoms I described... 
BECK (beat) Why Sixpack? 
DOC It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... (he looks up and locks eyes with Beck) But he went on that ship and so did Williams... (beat) I want to examine the crew. 
BECK (still in shock) Yeah...right... 
He starts to the door and Doc watches him. 
DEJESUS' VOICE(O.S.) What do you mean, "a skin problem"... your skin changes? 
DeJesus, naked, with his back to us.  Doc examines him. 
DOC It blackens...becomes scaly. 
DEJESUS (joking) You mean like a fish? 
DeJesus chuckles, but something about the thought stops Doc. 
DOC (almost to himself) Yes...like a fish... 
DEJESUS (smiles) I was just joking, Doc. 
CONTROL ROOM - SAME 
Beck sits in his chair reading the TRANSOCEAN OFFICERS INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL. 
INSERT:  The chapter he's on says:  BODY DISPOSAL AT SEA. 
The face of Martin stares back at us. 
MARTIN Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that. 
BECK What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy. 
MARTIN But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you? 
BECK I'm not anxious to find out, either. 
MARTIN Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours. 
BECK Do it. 
MARTIN (beat) Unfortunately.  We can't. 
He picks up a sheet of computer paper. 
MARTIN(cont'd) There is a typhoon about 600 miles off the coast of Baja. It's not coming your way but the Company doesn't want to lose you folks or an emergency ship should it veer your way. 
BECK What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow? 
MARTIN It shouldn't be a long delay. 
BECK But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?! 
MARTIN Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry. 
WASHROOM - SAME 
Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a toothbrush from the pocket of her robe. 
WILLIE Bo?  Doc says you're next. 
Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls. 
WILLIE(cont'd) Bo?...You okay? 
INFIRMARY - SAME 
Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick Room. 
SICK ROOK - SAME 
Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the body totally.  Jones smiles. 
JONES (whispers) Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man... How you feeling? 
There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body. 
JONES Hey, man, we made quota to- day.  No thanks to you, you dog, but we made it...Beck helped us...We just dropped Bowman off.  I hope what you've got ain't catching... 
He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops. 
DOC Bowman? 
There is no answer and he moves toward the shower. 
DOC Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here to help you. 
The water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc opens the shower door. 
WHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and blood swirls down the drain. 
Doc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm, turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE SEE the black scales. 
INFIRMARY 
Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers Bowman with a sheet as 
WE CUT TO 
THE MESS - LATER 
The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess. Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze. 
BECK I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms. 
DEJESUS And it killed Bo? 
BECK No...she killed herself. 
ON WILLIE  the news hits her hard. 
JONES We're getting out of here just in time. 
BECK There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours... 
DEJESUS Typhoon?! 
JONES Twelve hours! 
COBB At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract. 
JONES Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here! 
Their argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the corridor.  A THUMP!  The crew stops their grumbling and listens.  A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks at Jones. 
BECK (motions for Jones to come with him) Jones... (to the others) Stay here. 
RING CORRIDOR 
Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once more.  THUMP! 
Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes suddenly widen. 
WHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous conglomeration on the the table. 
SLAM CUT TO 
CLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER 
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside. 
INT. CORRIDOR "B" - LATER 
Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to transport. 
DEJESUS C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking... 
COBB (angrily) I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!.. 
Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off. 
BECK Shut up, all of you. 
COBB Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of--- 
SHOWERS - LATER 
Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her head against the wall of the shower stall. 
DORMITORY - SAME 
Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk. After some digging which produces five month's supply of pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck picks it up. 
BECK I think we just found our problem. 
MESS - LATER 
Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones, and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for a run.  There is a feeling of anger among them. 
DEJESUS Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish. 
JONES 'Fucker could have gotten us all killed. 
COBB He knew better than that. 
Willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all coldly. 
WILLIE You guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka...It could have been you. 
She gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor. 
THE RUSSIAN SHIP 
WE ARE MOVING along the ship's corridor that Willie walked looking for Sixpack. 
WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE CONTROL ROOM 
Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack on the Russian ship.  On the monitor screen we see Willie's POV of the infirmary.  The light dances off the broken glass as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the light moves out into the corridor. 
DOC Hold it!  Rewind it. 
Beck rewinds it. 
ON SCREEN  we see the scene again.  Light dancing off the cabinets.  As the light starts to turn-- 
DOC Stop it. 
Beck pauses the tape.  We see nothing. Doc is confused. 
DOC Back it up slowly. 
Beck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at the screen.  Suddenly he sees it. 
DOC There. 
ON SCREEN  We see it.  Caught in the turn of the camera, now frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains of a man.  Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man. Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than normal.  But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that especially catches our attention. 
MESS - SAME 
ON A BEAUTIFUL BAVARIAN SETTING 
as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles.  He takes a piece of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and places it perfectly into position on the puzzle.  Jones watches him amazed. 
DEJESUS You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man?  Think about that. Sixty-four square miles. 
He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits it into place as Jones watches.  It's blowing Jones' mind. 
JONES How'd you do that? 
DEJESUS What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry. 
He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in amazement. 
JONES Hungry?  After what we just went through I may never eat again. 
ON WILLIE 
She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp.  The Shack CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing below her feet.  It is dark down there.  Her feet pound off the metal grating. 
He notices that the floor's wet near the sink.  He frowns and hears a SMALL NOISE, like something shifting slightly. He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles, pails, rags...All he can see are shadows.  He looks more closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when 
SUDDENLY SOMETHING TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND!  DEJESUS JUMPS, BUMPING HIS HEAD ON THE SINK AS HE WHIRLS TO SEE. 
JONES, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him. 
JONES Man, everybody is jumpy... What are you doing? 
Not fully recovered from the start, DeJesus rubs his bruised head. 
DEJESUS Getting some food. 
JONES Under there? 
DeJesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the sink. 
DEJESUS Look.  Water. 
JONES Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what? 
DeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at Jones. 
DEJESUS No, I'll be right there. 
He looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the galley.  Something is missing. 
DEJESUS (to himself) Mustard.  Need mustard... 
He opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty. 
DEJESUS (muttering to himself) Sixpack... 
He throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside. 
SUDDENLY, LIKE A SNAKE, A TWO FOOT CHUNK OF MUSCLE ATTACHES TO DEJESUS'S WRIST!  WITH HIS FREE HAND DEJESUS TRIES TO RIP THE TWISTING, WRITHING THING OFF.  PULLING AT IT HE REVEALS PART OF SIXPACK'S FACE--ONE EYE AND PART OF HIS MOUTH--UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE. 
DeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and causing an avalanche of pots and pans. 
DEJESUS (in pain) Ahhh! 
INSIDE THE MESS 
Jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when he hears THE CLATTER OF POTS AND PANS. 
JONES Hey, Hazy...what're you doing now...cooking? 
There is no answer and Jones looks up. 
JONES(cont'd) (concerned) Hazy?... 
He goes to the door and looks in.  His eyes widen at the sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing hunk of muscle. 
JONES(cont'd) Holy shit! 
DEJESUS Help me, Jonesy.  Oh, God, help me!  It's getting inside me, I can feel it! 
He keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his friend. 
JONES Hazy, please...I'm going to get you some help, man...just don't touch me... 
Jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to the Galley.  He closes it, rushing through into the Mess to the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb. 
COBB What's going on? 
JONES It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc. 
Jones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door.  Cobb watches him go.  As the noise in the Mess intensifies, we hear banging on the door, then DeJesus' anguished cries. 
DEJESUS Help me!  Help me! 
Cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm. 
UPPER RING CORRIDOR - SAME 
BECK I thought they were your friends? 
JONES Were, Doss were. 
Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from him. 
BECK You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place down. 
Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp. Jones grins. 
INFIRMARY - SAME 
Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the infirmary.  What he sees upsets him. 
INT. SWAMP - SAME 
Jones working the intercom. 
JONES (to intercom) Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb? 
He looks back to Beck, concerned. 
JONES(cont'd) (to Beck) Think it got 'em? 
BECK No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that? 
JONES (beat, realizing) He did. 
INFIRMARY - SAME 
Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to the storage counter across the room--where the blood is stored.  WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been drained. 
LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME 
Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security. There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before. 
CLOSE ON THE CABINET 
The door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire system has been disabled. 
Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns directly into 
THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light, poised to strike. 
Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes in the corridor. 
COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he has seen the devil itself. 
COBB What happened? 
DOC (absently) It...almost got you. 
COBB What was it? 
Doc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock. 
THE MESS 
The remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He listens. 
COBS (excitedly) I saw it!  It's big! 
BECK Big? 
JONES Bigger than DeJesus?  How? 
DOC It's had a meal. 
He holds out the empty blood bags.  A change has come over Doc since Bowman's death.  The experience has slightly deadened him. 
WILLIE It needs blood? 
JONES Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us? 
INSERT COBB'S WOUND  Pink and healing. 
DOC Looks good to me.  I'll re-bandage it, though. 
He looks at Willie. 
DOC(cont'd) Willie, would you clean it for me.  I'm going to the infirmary for supplies. 
He turns and Willie stops him with a firm grip. 
WILLIE You can't go out there alone. 
DOC I'm the Doctor.  I have to do what's best for this crew. (he pulls away) I need my bag. 
THE LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME 
The door opens and carefully Doc steps out into the corridor.  He looks toward the Infirmary then starts up the ladder to the Upper Level instead. 
CLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL 
a grisly sight. 
WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag of Beck's blood.  Beck stops the drip and moves on into the darkness of the corridor. 
CONTROL ROOM 
Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of the Control room.  His face lit by the computer monitor.  He types furiously. 
COMPUTER SCREEN 
"Emergency Escape Bubbles...ready for activation..." 
DOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to the SEND command and presses it. 
THE MESS - LATER 
Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut.  He smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor.  The tired look now gone from his eyes.  He seems revitalized. 
DOC There, good as new.  Just keep your paws off of it. (to Willie) Do you have the new bandage ready? 
She nods.  Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.  Willie backs off. 
WILLIE Doc?...Doc! 
She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist.  It's razor sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with vacuum-like suction. 
DOC No! 
But it is too late.  Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's gash RRRRRRRIPS OPEN!  THE FLESH OPENING GROTESQUELY FROM THE INSIDE AND INVERTS SCALY--SPREADING OVER COBB'S BODY LIKE A BUSHFIRE! 
CORRIDOR "B" 
CLOSE ON THE POOL OF BLOOD 
A huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck.  A scaly tentacle suddenly whips across the floor.  The DEJESUS CREATURE!  WE SEE THE FLASH OF ITS APPENDAGES.  IT'S HEAD. AN EYE OPENS AND LOOKS UP. 
WHAT IT SEES  The outline of Beck lying "hurt" fifty feet away. 
It starts down the corridor toward it's prey--Beck. 
ON BECK 
A little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones waits in the shadows.  Suddenly Beck hears something. 
BECK (whispers) I hear something. Don't fire until we're both in the Swamp. 
Jones moves a little farther back. 
BECK(cont'd) Don't let him see you. 
JONES Don't worry... 
As the Creature approaches WE SEE Beck stand up like a wounded animal.  He begins dragging his "injured" leg behind him as he retreats toward the Swamp.  THE FOOTSTEPS MOVE FASTER.  IT'S CLOSING! 
JONES (gravely) Look at this. 
Beck looks at Doc's computer screen. 
ON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  "...hope that our sacrifice will mean that the human race will never know this awful mutation..." 
WILLIE What is it? 
JONES The good doctor signed our death warrant. 
SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all nervously exchange looks. 
WILLIE Well, at least we're safe inside here. 
JONES For how long? 
Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  "SHACK SIX REPORTING. PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---" 
SUDDENLY MARTIN'S FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN. 
MARTIN Thank goodness, you're still alive! 
JONES (yells nervously at the screen) Hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us.  You hear me, motherfucker?  Right now! 
Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them. 
MARTIN Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every- thing is under control.  Naturally, when we received Dr. Warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you. 
Jones lets out a breath.  Willie stares straight at the screen. 
WILLIE When are you coming for us? 
MARTIN (smiles nervously) Well, that's the bad news. The typhoon did turn your way. (he looks at weather printout) Right now it is on a course-- 
JONES Just answer the question, man! When are you coming?! 
MARTIN (beat) Hopefully in the next 48 hours. 
BECK Forty-eight hours! 
MARTIN I realize you must have gone through hell-- 
JONES Gone?  Man, we're still here! 
MARTIN (firmly) I can't change the weather. Try to get some rest.  I'll keep you posted. 
He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck, Jones and Willie goes blank. 
BECK He's right.  Why don't you get some rest.  I'll stand the first watch. 
TIME CUT TO 
CONTROL ROOM - LATER 
Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She watches Beck across the room, standing at the window. 
He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the blank computer screen. 
CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN 
"Request weather summaries January 14-21."  The cursor blinks back ominously then races across the screen.  "FILE CLOSED." 
BECK (to himself) Martin, you asshole... 
Suddenly he hears a voice behind him. 
WILLIE They know, don't they? 
BECK (quietly) Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us. 
WILLIE Maybe they already have. 
She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring earlier. 
Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "A." 
INT. CORRIDOR "A" 
The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the flooring.  The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down into the darkness.  Willie stands guard with the flame- thrower. 
ON JONES  He peers into the darkness below.  He wasn't a big fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared shitless. 
BECK I'll go first. 
Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs down into the dark bilge.  Jones waits till he's at the bottom, then starts down behind him.  Willie looks back. 
WILLIE Don't spend all day down there. 
JONES Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't. 
BILGE 
From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM. As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light into the eerie underground area. 
Pipes run overhead and on the walls.  A broken electrical conduit sparks over their heads.  The floor is ankle deep in greasy water.  They start toward the noise. 
ON WILLIE 
Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall).  Her eyes move from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering long enough to distract her.  Sweat runs down her face and we hear another tremor in the Shack. 
WILLIE (to herself, calming herself) Okay, Williams...let's hear a tune. (beat, quietly at first) "Off we go...into the wild blue yonder..." 
ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause.  She catches her breath and starts again. 
WILLIE(cont'd) "...flying high into the sky..." 
She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the wire mesh of the other wall).  Was it something moving? 
BILGE 
ON BECK  He moves around a corner we recognize from before with Jones' and Cobb's repair.  Beck floods the area with light and the break in the line is visible.  The pipe has been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable.  What's worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the water. 
JONES Jesus Christ... 
BECK Can you fix it? 
JONES No way... 
BECK Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think! 
JONES I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I-- 
Suddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS and disappears. 
As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes out sending the bilge into greater darkness. 
JONES I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?! 
BECK (standing) No. 
Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a thought. 
JONES The Swamp.  There's an over- ride switch in the Swamp. 
They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones' arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's thigh. 
JONES (screams) Ahhh! 
Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the ladder. 
BECK Hurry...Get out! 
Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE SEE it wickedly bare its teeth. 
Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge when a voice from above distracts it. 
WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.) Hey, you? 
THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Five minutes to implosion."  And we feel it happening: 
THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE VIBRATIONS 
THE WALLS SHAKE 
THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE. ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER 
JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half way!  It is jammed by the pressure. 
JONES It won't go! 
Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS! 
STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE! 
THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION! 
THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Four minutes..." 
BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK 
He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her suit hangs. 
BECK The suits!  Get in them! 
Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't. 
JONES The suits!  Are you crazy! How're we going to get to the surface? 
Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS. 
BECK Like this. 
He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they begin pulling the equipment out. 
BECK(cont'd) Get them in the Lock! 
Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like Container transporters to the lock. 
ON WILLIE  She climbs into her suit and activates her generator.  Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around the perimeter of her helmet. 
THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS..."Three minutes...to...implosion..." 
Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and sticks it in the vest of his wet suit. 
Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track to the Lock. 
JONES Your suit, Becky! 
BECK Just get in yours! 
Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his suit. 
Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK. 
Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR. 
BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck. 
WILLIE (screams) Look out! 
But it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to see Jones seal himself into his suit. 
JONES/RADIO I'm in. 
BECK (to the others) Go! 
WILLIE/RADIO No! 
THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK 
Beck looks at the others one last time.

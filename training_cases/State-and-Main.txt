FADE IN: 
EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY 
Ann is walking down the street.  The firedog runs out of the firehouse, she gives the dog a biscuit, and pats him on the head. 
The fireman is out front with a cup of coffee.  Ann hands him a poster. 
EXT. STATE AND MAIN - INTERSECTION - DAY 
Morris and Spud, two codgers, are about to cross the street when they hear a beeping and stop. 
As they cross, we see the tail end of a van, and the group nods in that direction. 
MORRIS You hear that? 
SPUD Yes, I hear it. 
MORRIS Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an-hour, get across the street yesterday. 
SPUD I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..." 
As Morris and Spud speak a car is coming down the street, and bounces in the pothole. 
MORRIS Y'wanna fix something, you should fix the pothole.  Yessir, they should be trussed up, thrown off some high building. 
DOUG MACKENZIE, a young Republican type, walks up to join them. 
DOUG Who's that? 
MORRIS Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand dollars, a new traffic light, you could grow old, paint your house before it lets you cross the street, and then, not fix the pothole. 
SPUD What was wrong with the old traffic light? 
INT. COFFEE CORNER - DAY 
They enter the Coffee Corner.  Carla is serving the folk, and Jack the owner is behind the counter. 
DOUG I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now: You want to bring business into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, no... 
ANN Morning, darling. 
DOUG Morning. 
CARLA Hi, Annie. 
Ann hands Carla a poster. 
ANN Morning, Carla. 
Doug and the two codgers move to a table by the window where Carla, the nubile waitress, brings them coffee.  Ann talks to a woman at the counter. 
MORRIS ...the damn thing... 
SPUD No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset... 
DOUG They are, yes.  I'm sure they are... 
WOMAN AT COUNTER Annie, I'm going to be a lil' late for the rehearsal, tonight. 
ANN S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...? 
DOUG ...I'm sure that people are upset... 
MAUDE I know 'em, I don't know what order they come in... 
ANN We'll work it out. 
JACK What're they talking about? 
ANN Traffic light. 
JACK Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's thing.  That's his thing, fine. 
DOUG Thank you, Jack, and... 
JACK But we got to talk about the pothole. 
DOUG Jack... 
JACK A public office is a public trust... This is why this is America.  Question is: who owns the street. 
Outside the front booth, on the street, the airport van cruises by. 
EXT. STATE AND MAIN - DAY 
As they walk out we hear a high pitched beeping sound at the traffic light.  We see DOC WILSON crossing the street, holding his doctor's bag.  An ELDERLY MAN approaches Doc at the crossing.  As Walt and Bill walk, the airport van follows them. 
TOWNSMAN Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back? I'm not sure that they work. 
DOC WILSON Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't hear me complain... come by th'office, end of th'afternoon. 
TOWNSMAN Thanks, Doc...

Joe is reading an old "Welcome to Waterford" tourist folder. The door to the room opens, and Joe stands, looks inside, squints.  Takes off his reading glasses and puts on another pair. 
JOE (to the open door) I, I'm sor... (as the door closes, to a passing aide) ...I lost my typewriter... 
Carla brushes past them. 
CARLA Hi, Mr. Bailey...

INT. PROD. OFFICE - WALT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Inside the room, production boards being carried in, blackboards, schedules taped to the wall, sketches of Main Street, a large "days till shoot...4" sign.  The Old Mill plate is on the desk. 
The PRODUCTION DESIGNER is bent over a worktable, he holds a compass and refers to blueprints and a scale model of the Firehouse and the Old Mill, which are on the table. 
Walt is holding glossy photographs, and leafs through them as the Production Designer talks.  They leaf through storyboards. 
We see that Walt is leafing through glossy photos of horses. Walt has shuffleboard stick over his shoulder.

ANN Not worth stealing.  Only thing in town worth something.  Stained glass window. 
She gestures at the Firehouse.

She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist.  I'll do four shows a week." (pause) The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?

CARLA I don't eat vegetables. 
BOB Well, I can offer you something to drink? 
CARLA Sure, what have you got? 
BOB What do you drink? 
CARLA Bourbon and milk.

Joe is standing by the side of the bed, holding Claire's clothes, trying to induce her to put them on.  She is sitting on the side of the bed, naked.

ANN The other side. 
JOE Oh. 
He turns the card over. 
ANN Don't you think you should put them in water. 
JOE Why? 
ANN ...because if you don't, they die. 
She goes into the bathroom, fills up the vase.  Comes out. 
ANN (CONT'D) Shouldn't we start? 
He and his assistant go into the house with wallpaper. 
SHERRY I've got two days to get this house...

CAL ...I have to give you this ticket for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse... 
MARTY (beat) You have to what? 
Cal reaches in back of him, on his belt, and takes out not the cuffs, but the summons book, he starts to write a summons. 
CAL It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and... (apologetically he hands the ticket to Bob) They'll, uh, these things happen, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...

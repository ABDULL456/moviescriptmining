Armageddon 
FADE IN 
Blackness. Then a hint of green becomes EARTH. It lies across an expanse of  space. Richly colored. Fertile. 
A GIGANTIC ASTEROID cuts into frame, Burning into EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE and  striking down in the currant area of Guzumel, Mexico. 
Voice An impact equivalent to ten thousand nuclear weapons detonating  simultaneously. 
A HUGE DINOSAUR FOOT steps down hard and is VAPORIZED with a deafening ROAR. 
Voice One hundred trillion tons of dirt and rock hurled into the atmosphere. 
EARTH, seen from space, is rocked with an IMMENSE SHOCKWAVE. A SHEET OF DEBRIS  washes across the North and South Hemispheres. 
Voice A blanket of dust the sun is powerless to penetrate. For five thousand  years our world is robbed of light as a nuclear winter falls. In that darkness,  a civilisation is removed from existence. 
EARTH is now completely entombed in a dark, cold hell. Letters push towards us-- 
"A R M A G E D D O N" 
65 MILLION YEARS LATER 
EARTH, reflected off the face of ASTRONAUT PETE SHELBY'S HELMET. It appears  close enough to touch. Shelby, attached to SHUTTLE ATLANTIS BY LIFELINE,  struggles to replace a piece of the shuttle's operational arm. 
Shelby (with radio squawking) Houston, I can't get this thing to work... 
EXT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Golden The size of Texas. In a hub of computers and tracking equipment, we find DAN GOLDEN, former  Astronaut from Apollo 8 (first crew to orbit the Moon) and now N.A.S.A's  second-in-command. Golden is watching Shelby on a SERIES OF VIDEO SCREENS.  FLIGHT DIRECTOR WALTER CLARK sits with rows of N.A.S.A Techs. Golden stands over  him, arms on the back o his chair. 
Clark Atlantis, what's the problem? 
Shelby (V.0) It just isn't working. Any suggestions? 
Clarke Hang on Pete. We'll figure something out for you. 
Golden taps Clark and sits down. 
Golden (to Shelby) We got the top scientific minds in the world working on  this. (a slight smile) Try "whacking" the thing. 
Shelby Okay, Houston, commence whacking. 
Selby begins Whacking the satellite with his glove. The SATELLITE comes n-line,  lights up like a Christmas tree. 
A HORRIFYING RUMBLING SOUND. SHOTGUN LIKE PELLETS assault the satellite.  SHRAPNEL rips into it's delicate gold skin. The satellite EXPLODES. Shelby's  lifeline breaks; he spins off, suit leaking from twenty punctures. 
INT. SHUTTLE ATLANTIS 
COMMANDER JAMES TURNER turns to his left 
General "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?" 
EXT. SHUTTLE ATLANTIS 
STOTGUN LIKE PELLETS shred through Atlantis' N.A.S.A. logo, peeling the shuttle  down to her ribs. FIERY EXPLOSION. 
EXT. SPACE 
CLOSE ON SHELBY as he twirls away from Atlantis. His helmet is fogging. He gasps  for air, wretching, his eyelids leaking blood. He tries to form words 
Shelby Ple...he...me.... 
Shelby's SHOULDER-CAM angle spins end-over-end.... 
INT. N.A.S.A - MISSION CONTROL MONITORS go dead. 
N.A.S.A. Technician #1 All systems crashing! 
N.A.S.A. Technician #2 Massive failure. We lost them. 
Utter silence. Utter desolation. DOLLY IN ON GOLDEN'S FACE. Utter disbelief. 
INT. WKU MOUNTIAN OBSERVATORY - NIGHT 
THEO and PEARL (at telescope) , and JIMBO (at the console) , 20's, are  star-gazing. Astronomy books, Starbucks cups, etc., spread all over. Nine Inch  Nails plays on the radio. These three could land a date if only they would lose  the road flares (plaid shirts, glasses) that signal the painful fact that they  are die-hard science nerds THEO'S POV - THROUGH WKU TELESCOPE - Far off in space  is a dusty, murky swarm of matter - something resembling a FLOATING EXPLOSION. 
Jimbo When are we going to let N.A.S.A in on what we've found? 
Theo We don't even know what we have yet. Comet, asteroid - it could be  anything up there. And don't be so eager to red flag N.A.S.A. They don't call us  when they discover anything. 
Jimbo Yeah, but this is their sandbox were playing in. 
Theo This is our discovery. We're going to hold a press conference. We're  going to be famous. SPACEWATCH'll name this thing after us. Job offers are going  to fly in from all the big companies. J.P.L., that think tank up at M.I.T., hell  even N.A.S.A. 'll be chasing us. 
Pearl I'm going on Oprah, Larry King, Letterman... 
Jimbo Hell with them, I'm going on Howard Stern.... 
Pearl (concentrating) This things really acting up tonight. We should find out  if anyone else knows about this. 
Theo How? 
Jimbo (master of factly) Call N.A.S.A 
Theo And say what? "Hi, we're a couple astronomer geeks who found something  really bitchin; floatin' in space." You can't just call N.A.S.A. It's like  calling the White House. Besides, you'll never get the number. 
More projectiles explode in the intersection. Cars get thrown everywhere. Stu's  cab slams upside down into JOHNNY'S BAR. 
ONE BLOCK DOWN. THE ENTIRE TOP FIVE STORIES -- A sheared section topples and  hits the street below. Bricks, mortar and gargoyles everywhere. 
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - PENTAGON - DAY 
Establishing, over which we hear RINGING PHONES. 
EXT. PENTAGON - GENERAL TEMPLE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Chaos in the corridors. GENERAL TEMPLE, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a  man of stature, bursts out of his office, met by his SECRETARY. 
Secretary We're getting reports as far away as Greenland and parts of Mexico! 
Temple Get me Dan Goldman on the secure phone. 
Temple enters his office and picks up a secure phone. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL - INSIDE THE GLASS-ENCASED ROOM 
Golden enters the room and sits down. Technician Flip hands him a secure phone.  Golden sinks into his chair. In the b.g., VIDEO MONITORS show twenty live feeds  from T.V. stations across the country. 
Temple (V.O.) Can you go secure? 
Golden (presses a button on the phone) I am secure. Go ahead, General. 
He listens...WE HEAR the distinct gargled voice of a secure line. 
Golden When? 
Temple (V.O.) Twelve minutes ago. Now you know what happened to your shuttle. 
INTERCUT - GOLDEN / TEMPLE 
INT. PENTAGON - GENERAL TEMPLE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Temple paces in his office. 
Temple I'm going to brief the President. What's going on here, Dan? Why didn't  we have warning? 
Golden Tell the president it's called "budget cuts." We don't have enough  telescopes to track the skies. 
Temple Is it over? 
Golden I don't know. We'll figure it out. (hangs up) 
INT. MISSION CONTROL - INSIDE THE GLASS-ENCASED ROOM 
Flip enters the room. Skip writes notes.... 
Golden (to Skip and Flip) Fly a team up to New York. Contact every Space Watch  facility in the world. We gotta find what part of the sky this is coming from. 
Skip I'll call J.P.L. and get the Hubble telescope on it. 
Golden Did we find who made the phone call last night? 
Flip The F.B.I.'s on it. 
INT. KENTUCKY - DORMITORY ROOM 
Theo is sleeping. The door is RAMMED in. Two F.B.I. AGENTS ROAR into the room,  overwhelming him. 
EXT. KENTUCKY - COLLEGE CAMPUS 
Pearl and Jimbo are walking across campus. TWO BLACK SEDANS pull up. The kids  increase their pace.The sedans SKID to a stop. F.B.I. AGENTS spring from the  cars, cuff them and CUT TO 
MANHATTEN - JOHNNY'S - DAY 
Stu's upside down cab, in front of Johnny's. A tow truck removes dented cars  from the trashed intersection. Career drunks, FRANK, FRED and WILLIE, stand in  the threshold looking out at the devastated intersection. Stu sits on top of his  cab, Listening to the guys 
Frank This city sucks... 
Fred What the hell was it? 
Willie They're sayin' it's space rocks. 
Stu Rocks from space, my ass. That, my friends, was the work of the big  Saddam. That was big-ass Iraqi missiles 
INT. MANHATTAN - SUBWAY - DAY 
F.B.I. AGENTS and N.A.S.A. SCIENTISTS examine a CHUNK OF ASTEROID, still  smouldering, which has ripped through the roof and floor of a subway car. The  plastic seats and aluminium panelling of the car has melted. 
EXT. KENTUCKY - INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Jimbo, Theo and Pearl sit in front of three F.B.I. AGENTS. Two N.A.S.A.  ASTRONOMERS look over the kids' TELESCOPE PHOTOS with concern. 
Jimbo So, that N.A.S.A. guy wasn't kiddin; about bein' arrested and.... 
Federal Agent Please shut up. 
Jimbo Yes, absolutely, yes sir. 
N.A.S.A. Astronomer I'm a N.A.S.A. astronomer. When were these photos taken? 
Federal Agent And which of you called N.A.S.A. Mission Control last night? 
Jimbo (points at Theo) Him. 
Harry Bennie! Third gear! 
The Greenpeace Leader miraculously produces a key and frantically begins  unlocking the handcuffs. 
Grace turns to the oil executives. 
Grace He's good at public relations. 
A.J. approaches Grace; they watch Harry. 
Grace So? (A.J. stares at her) What? (no response) What? (no response) A.J.? 
Suddenly, across "A" Derrick, a KLAXON SOUNDS. 
Chick She's kickin'! 
The civilians get the hell away. 
Harry and A.J. run toward the rig. 
Chick Pressure's north of seven thousand! 
A.J. We gotta clear the Derrick! 
Harry (looks at wellhead) Chick, rig up another pipe. (Chick and Bennie look  at Harry with uncertainty) NOW, NOT TOMORROW. 
CHick and Bennie begin clamping, and tong a PIPE STRAND onto the DRILL STRING  like an INDY PIT STOP CREW. 
A.J. Harry, we've hit pressure. We gotta bleed it off. e go any deeper, we'll  blow the rig. 
Harry Thanks for that opinion. Chick, full speed! 
A.J. The bit's five thousand feet down! Full speed'll rip the pipe apart! 
Harry You learn all this in college? I been doing this thirty years, kid. Get  on the controls. 
A.J. moves reluctantly to the DRILLING CONTROLS. Chick nods to A.J., who engages  the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL SPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten  feet into the hole, then.... 
The torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string. The drill  spins freely. 
A.J. hits the "stop! lever and stares at Harry. 
The roughnecks converge around the wellhead. 
A.J. I'm goin' down. Reattach it. Gimme a wrench and a band coupling. 
Chick hand the items to A.J. 
A.J. descends into the drilling hole. 
INT. DOWN THE DRILLING HOLE - DAY 
A.J., holding his breath under water, shimmies down the drilling pipe  feet-first, inside the water-filled concrete tube running from the rig to the  ocean floor. 
A.J. begins wrestling the disconnected sections together. EXT. RIG - "A" DERRICK 
The wellhead KICKS. The rig platform shakes and shudders. SEAWATER erupts from  the wellhead. 
Chick The drill hole's flooding! 
Grace A.J.!! 
Harry strips off his jacket and climbs into the wellhead. He takes a huge breath  and disappears into the brine-filled drilling hole. 
INT. DRILLING HOLE 
A.J. is pinned against the hole wall by one of the disconnected pipes. Harry  comes down the hole. He plants his back against the hole wall and kicks the  pipe, freeing A.J. A slow, deep, RUMBLE emanates from below. The Briny water  inside the hole suddenly turns BLACK and VISCOUS. 
A.J. and Harry exchange an alarmed look. Harry, then A.J., pull for the surface,  up the drilling hole as -- 
EXT. DRILLING PLATFORM - "A" DERRICK - DAY 
-- the wellhead KICKS again. The rig platform SHUDDERS violently. The derrick  sways. SEAWATER SPEWS up from the wellhead. 
Chick Get back, she's gonna blow! 
Grace, Chick, Bennie and the other Roughnecks huddle around the flooded drilling  hole, waiting. Tense, agonising seconds pass. 
Harry scrambles out, covered in....CRUDE OIL. 
He grabs Grace and pulls her away. 
Grace Where's A.J.!!!? 
Harry RIGHT BEHIND ME! RUN! 
The platform SHAKES. Harry, Grace, and the others sprint away as 
A GEYSER OF CRUDE OIL erupts from the drilling hole, blowing A.J. out of the  hole fifteen feet above the wellhead. A.J. crashes to the platform floor. 
CRUDE OIL rains down on Grace and the Roughnecks...they run to A.J. 
Grace Never do that again! 
CLOSE ON A.J. - he's looking back at the DRILL HOLE, panting, traumatised,  greasy oil raining on his head. 
A.J. You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't do the  first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...! (pulls out case; opens it) I  got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk to him, but try it on. 
Quincy eagerly outstretches his hand. They shake. Quincy doesn't let go. 
Quincy I'm a big fan, Mr. Stamper. 
Harry I kinda caught that. (to Golden) What's the problem, gentlemen? 
Golden I wonder if we might speak alone? 
Harry These two are my right and left arms. Grace Stamper and Albert Jack  Frost. Stupid name, so we call him A.J.. (handshakes) They run my company. You  talk to me, you  talk to them. 
Golden Okay. 
Golden direct everyone into -- 
INT. N.A.S.A. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 
Golden, Temple, Clark, Harry, Grace, and A.J. sit in a dark room viewing a  VIDEOTAPE. Quincy stands beside the projector, supplying narration. On the tape  we see Harry on a rig platform shaking hands with an ARAB BUSINESSMAN -- 
Harry Great, home movies. 
Grace and A.J. smile. 
Quincy Nineteen eighty five. The first well drilled over 50 thousand feet.  They said it couldn't be done. You did it. Incredible. 
ON THE SCREEN - Harry's on another rig, shaking hands with an INDONESIAN  BUSINESSMAN. Harry leans over and kisses the bit. The Businessmen shake their  heads, awed. 
Quincy (cont'd) Nineteen Ninety-One. Directional drilling through two miles of anthracite. They also said that couldn't be done. You did it. Incredible. 
Harry looks at Quincy strangely; this sure is a bizarre form of celebrity. 
Quincy (cont'd) Ninteen Ninety-Three. The first hole over seventy thousand. Once again they said -- 
Golden Move it along, Quincy. 
Quincy Right, sorry. Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost expert in  deep drilling. You hold specialized patents in high speed bits, drilling fluids,  downhole motors Can I call you Harry? 
Harry Stick with Stamper. 
Golden Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole. It's in a difficult  place. 
Harry I've drilled in them all. 
Golden Not...this place. This is really out there. (beat) Space, Mister  Stamper. 
Harry As in...outer? 
SATELLITE PHOTOS OF THE ASTEROID come up on the screen -- 
Temple You've watched the news the last 24 hours? You heard about the meteor  shower? (Harry nods) What you don't know is that an asteroid is on a collision course with  Earth. If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be over. 
Golden We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a nuclear device in  it's core. To do that we need to drill an eight hundred foot hole. 
Harry looks at A.J. and Grace. 
Harry A.J., is this guy shitting me? 
A.J. I don't think they shit people at N.A.S.A., Harry -- 
Harry An eight hundred foot hole. On a moving asteroid. In space. 
Golden All we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm, any help you  can provide. We'll pay your usual consultancy, of course. 
Harry Show me your rig. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY 
Quincy leads Golden, Harry, A.J., Grace, and Clark through N.A.S.A.'s Research  and Development area. This place looks like "Q's" weapons shop from the James  Bond movies as funded by every company on the fortune 500 -- 
Huge, clinically clean, dominated by MASSIVE ROCKET ENGINES. TECHNICIANS in  white coats and hairnets work on a variety of equipment. 
TECHNICIANS hunch over a ROVER VEHICE, not the golf cart used on the moon. This  is low, squat, sturdy, with an enclosed airlocked passenger compartment. 
Quincy The "Armadillo" - our fourth generation rover. It carries a six-cell  solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint venture with the Germans. (winks) It's designed by Porsche. 
Quincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM on a gurney,  powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is connected to an OIL DRILLING  BIT. 
Harry Where's the Kelly? 
Quincy This baby works without one. 
Harry How does it work? 
Harry starts to inspect the bit. 
Quincy It works through a series of complexly designed differential gears. 
Harry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further -- 
Harry This is my Patent. 
Quincy "Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics," by Harry S.  Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent Office last year. 
Harry You stole it. 
Quincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper. 
Quincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button. The drill bit  presses down into a block of concrete and begins to rapidly CHEW through it, as  Harry marvels at the realisation of his design. 
Chick We're living LARGE! 
Bennie (talking on a cellular phone) Give me nickels on Miami, Washington, San  Diego, and Green Bay. (listens) Quit whining. Last thing I need is to be friends  with my bookie. (listens, then angry) 
(MORE) 
Bennie (cont'd) Look, when the entire Mexican Army had Butch and the Sundance Kid trapped in that Hacienda, did they wait to die? Hell no. They went out guns  blazing. I live  by the code of that movie, man. 
Bennie hangs up the phone, he looks across from him at -- Tito Guevara, late  30's, stocky, tattooed, Latino, (reformed 118th Street L.A. o.g. gangbanger who  was rescued from the streets ten years back and put to work on a rig by Harry) is reading a book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus." 
Chick drops down into his seat, continues his heated discussion with Max. 
Chick Charlie Bronson could kick Steve McQueen's ass and have enough left over  to duke it out with Burt Reynolds in his "Smokey and the Bandit" period. 
Max I'm glad you qualified that shit 'cause you know the Burt Reynolds of  "Deliverence" would have kicked Charlie's ass. 
Chick Burt was trouble in that flick. 
Max What would you say the all-time, slam-bam, take-no-prisoners, kick-ass  Charlie Bronson movie is? 
Chick All time? Well, let me think. "Dirty Dozen," the first "Death Wish." No,  no! That movie where he hunted the buffalo. I don't remember the name but he  hunted a buffalo and he said like three words during the whole picture. That's my  selection. 
Max Fine. The buffalo movie. That's your pick. You relly think that buffalo  Charlie could have thrown-down with the Steve McQueen form "Bullitt?" 
Chick He'da whooped his ass and then his father's. We'll settle this right  now. Rockhound? You heard the debate. You're the Supreme Court. What's the final  verdict? 
Rockhound Tough call. But for me though, one name -- Poncherello. Eric  Estrada. You know, "Chips." 
Chick and Max just look at him. A beat. Then -- 
Max What did you ask him for? Guy makes his living looking at rocks. 
The limo pulls over and stops. The DRIVER gets out and walks to the rear door.  Opens it. 
EXT. N.A.S.A. - FRONT OF FACILITY - DAY 
The Roughnecks get out in front of the JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. They stare up at  the familiar N.A.S.A. LOGO imprinted on the building. Chick and Bennie exchange  looks -- 
BEHIND THEM 
A battered Ford pick-up pulls up, driven by 71 year-old "MAMA" MABEL BROWN.  Mabel's six foot-five, 375 pound son, BEAR, gets out of the car. 
Bear 'Bye, Mama. 
Mabel Reginald, get over here and kiss your Mama goodbye. 
Bear In front of the guys? 
Mabel Never too old to kiss your Mama. 
JIMBO, six-foot five, 375 pounds, bald, pulls up on a HARLEY DAVIDSON  motorcycle. He climbs off the bike. 
Chick There ain't no oil in this place. What the hell are we doing here? 
INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MEDICAL WING - DAY 
Harry has just briefed his crew on the mission. 
Bear ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? 
Chick Harry, this is some "Star Wars" shit. This ain't for us. 
Harry It's a job, like any other. Just a different location. 
Max We work rigs. We understand rigs. We don't know dick about being  astronauts. 
Rockhound (pointing) I might add that to get us up there they're going to have  to strap our asses on one of those rockets. That means fire, involuntary shit  release, and a slew of other stuff I can't hang with. 
JIMBO We don't have "The Right Stuff," know what I'm saying? (looking around) We're Roughnecks. 
Harry I'd rather die up there fighting this thing than sit  here waiting for it. 
Harry's line hangs in the air. Everyone exchanges looks. 
Bear I don't like the idea of waiting around to croak. It's wimpy. 
Chick If Harry-the-iron-ass is going, I'm going with him. 
Bear Hell, I'm going just so I can say I went. (shrugs) Once we get up there,  it's making hole. 
Tito I'm in. 
INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 
Max, Chick, and Tito sit in HOSPITAL SMOCKS on two examination tables. They have  tattoos, long hair. A cigarette dangles from Tito's lips. AIR FORCE NURSES are  everywhere. A NURSE clips a SWATCH OF HAIR from each of the men. She comes to  Tito. He grabs her arm. Takes the scissors from her. 
Tito Nobody touches my hair but me. 
He cuts a SWATCH of hair, gives it to her. A SECOND NURSE is in front of Max and  Tito. 
Max You're not taking any more blood. You vampires already have enough to feed  your coven for a year. 
Nurse (nasally-voiced) We need to know what substances you've recently  ingested. 
Tito What, uhh, "substances" you talkin' about? 
Nurse (matter of fact) Drugs. 
Chick and Max hurry off. A.J. smiles at Harry. 
INT. JOHNSON CTR - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - WORKROOM - DAY 
Harry, A.J., Bennie, Chick, Max, and Tito sit before Quincy, who demonstrates a  series of components on the N.A.S.A. SPACE SUIT. 
Quincy The new generation EMU - Extravehicular Mobility Unit - provides oxygen  for seven hours, a pressurised enclosure, and temperate control. The gloves and  helmet slide  on and lock with a twist, like this. The cap is worn underneath. It  contains a mike and headphones for two-way communication. We'll be able to see  you from a small  video cam mounted inside the helmet. The Undergarment has 300 feet  of plastic tubing circulating cooling water. Owen... 
OWEN THE TAILOR, five foot nothing & bald, stands in front of the men. 
Owen These are made for men 5'8" to 6'2", between 140 and 200 pounds. All of  you fit within those parameters - thank God we won't have to do any  re-tailoring.... 
Owen stops because -- 
Bear and Jimbo stand in the doorway -- 
JIMBO Yo. This where we get our suits? 
Bear Sorry, we're late. Doc said we had... What do we got? 
JIMBO Cholesterol difficulties. Said we gotta enter "The Zone." 
Bear Shit, the only zone I know is the one around my mama's grill. 
JIMBO (holding up form) But we're approved. 
Owen looks at the human mountains standing before hi, and then at the tiny EMU  suit. Alterations will be necessary. 
INT. JOHNSON CENTER - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - MORNING 
Clark briefs Harry and the mildly attentive Roughnecks. Sharp, Truman, CO-PILOTS  MEGAN WATTS (30's, tough as nails) and STAN WESTON stand in the back along with  N.A.S.A. Engineers JACK CROSS and RAYMOND SEARS. 
Clark United States astronauts train for eighteen months. You have nine days.  Officers Sharp, Truman, Watts and Weston are your military instructors and the  only pilots to have flown the spacecraft. (beat) Each is a combat decorated officer  and among the finest men and women we have in the service. Pay attention to  them. 
Sharp We spend six months on emergency training - we're throwing that out. If  we fail, everyone dies. Game over. That's a heavy load but it's ours to carry.  The purpose of this is to train you in the physical and mental rigors of working  in a weightless enviroment so that you will not panic. So you can do your jobs. (beat) You will vomit.  Your eyes will be sucked into the back of your heads. You'll be so  tired you can't eat but that won't matter 'cause you'll be so sore you can't  take a dump. By the way...good morning. 
INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - DAY 
Splash, Splash. Harry and the Roughnecks descend underwater. They look like  Michelin Men in their thick space suits. Navy divers are around them as they are  lined up. 
Through the underwater speaker, WE HEAR a trainer giving them instructions for  their weightless aerobic training. WE HEAR a loud, embarrassing gastric sound  from Bear's suit. 
Bear Houton, we have a problem. That is some vicious methane. 
Harry gives a "shut the fuck up" look. Time passes as the guys are dying,  HUFFING and PUFFING. One by one, they reach exhaustion. A cabled harness hoists  each out. 
INT. JOHNSON CENTER - CARDIO LAB - DAY 
Harry and his team, in T-shirts and running shorts, jog on a series of  threadmills, wired to EKG machines, nostrils taped shut, breathing tubes locked  in their mouths. EXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY 
A gleaming spit-shine hanger full of fifteen N.A.S.A. T-38 fighter jets. Our  drill team walks up looking worn out. They are met at the open hanger door by  pilots CHUCK JR., Vietnam vet, leatherneck-take-no-pussy-bullshit-type-of-guy  and HAMMER. 
Chuck Jr. On this mission, they tell me you will experience the worst G-Forces  in the history of flight. It's like an elephant sitting on your chest. So, I  intend to flip you, spin you, splat your bodies till your bones hurt. Now load up and  enjoy the flight. 
The Roughnecks, wearing flight suits and helmets, board the planes. Harry does  not like the look of these things. Bear is trying to figure out how to fit  inside. 
Bear Thing's made for a child - like my kid's car seat. 
Chuck Jr. and Hammer walk up to a nervous Harry. 
Chuck Jr. What's the problem, Texas tough guy? 
Harry I've got a thing about flying. 
Chuck Jr. Not good for an astronaut. (looks to Hammer) Hammer, go easy, don't  rip his guts out. 
Hammer Sure thing, Chuck. 
INT. JET FIGHTER. 
Harry plastered to the seat, MOANING so scared he can't puke. The plane  barrel-rolls and dives straight to the ground. Harry is GRUNTING and sweating  trying to stay conscious. 
EXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY 
The T-38's are pulling up and letting the drill crew out. They walk back with  white sweat, soaked faces and wobbly legs. Harry exits the plane. 
Harry I hate to fly. I hate to fly. I hate it so much. 
Harry leans over to puke. 
INT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY 
The Roughnecks walking to the T-38 Hanger. Sharp stands on the stairway to the  707 and calls everyone to attention. 
Sharp Trainees, AT EASE (in command) We are not done here. We're taking you  for a little ride. This bird will climb to 40 thousand feet and drop to 10  thousand feet to give  you the feeling of weightlessness for 30 seconds. Welcome to  N.A.S.A.'s Vomit Comet. INT. VOMIT COMET 
The plane drops. The Roughnecks lift off inside. Everyone's flying around the  cabin. It's a disaster. Guys bump heads. Bear floats like a beached whale. Jimbo  rams the roof. Hary hold a barf bag as he floats. An alarm SOUNDS, then the  plane levels off, the guys go slamming into the floor. 
INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER BATHROOM 
Tracking past a row of stalls, WE SEE the soles of a pair of shoes peeking out.  Then another pair, another, and another over the multiple sounds of guts being  tossed into the toilet. 
Golden, Clark, and Sharp stand outside the stalls. 
Golden This is like putting the Hell's Angels in space. 
INT. N.A.S.A. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 
Clark We've got to warn. 
Golden Warn who? The whole South Pacific? 
Golden, with lack of sleep and stress, falls back into a chair. He closes his  eyes, opens them -- finding Harry in the upper Mission Control Deck. They lock  eyes for a long moment. 
INT. SHANGHAI - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
The city ablaze in neon. The harbour, floating junksmanned by Chinese merchants.  A loud sonic boom CRACKS in the sky. There's a BRIGHT FLASH in the sky. Night  becomes day for two seconds. 
The world slows down, motion creeps. The bright FLASH catches the face of a  little BOY reaching out for his father's hand. The asteroid SHRIEKS down,  hitting the harbour's surface in a red hot FLASH-BOILED at 100 thousand degrees. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT 
The room is silent. Reports are starting to come in about the devastation.  Golden walks up to Harry who is standing with Grace and A.J. He pulls Harry  aside. 
Golden Stamper, answer me one question - have you ever let anyone down? 
We go close on Harry's face. Searing flashbulbs popping, WIDEN TO 
INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROO - NIGHT 
WE SEE him from behind as he addresses the massive crowd. The U.S. PRESIDENT  stands before a throng of reporters. 
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 
Papers headlines, CNN reporters flash on screens. Images of people watching the  news in bars, at home. A NEW YORK POST slams down on the pavement, the headline -  SHANGHAI DISASTER, MASSIVE DEATH TOLL RISING. 
INT. SOMEPLACE IN KENTUCKY - HOLDING CELL - DAWN 
Jimbo is talking to an F.B.I. AGENT who is on the other side of the bars holding  a newspaper. 
Jimbo If it's over then why aren't you lettin' us out of this goddamn cell? 
F.B.I. Agent Be real soon, son. 
The agent flips the newspaper into the holding cell and walks away. 
Jimbo Don't walk away, I want to talk to my lawyer. You hear me? 
Pearl (refering to the newspaper) This says that the asteroid came from the  Southern Hemisphere. 
Theo Southern Hemisphere? 
Pearl No kidding. It's a big sky - they want people to look the other way.

INT. N.A.S.A. - TRAINING ROOM - MORNING 
Morning after the devastating disaster in Shanghai. Harry walks into the quiet  room. Harry's all business. 
Harry Forty thousand people died last night. But I guess that didn't concern  any of you. I hope you all had a good time last night. 
The Roughnecks look around. They know there were wrong. 
Chick I gotta tell you...I'm scared. 
Harry Well, you should be scared. We all should be. 'Cause if we fail, they  say the Earth will die. 
Harry sits down, looks out the window at N.A.S.A. Techs working in the room down  below. 
Harry You think these N.A.S.A. guys are a bunch of clean-cut pussies, that's  it. They can out think you, they can outrun you. This job, gentlemen, is as real  as it gets. I need every one of you. (he looks them in the eye) If you're not up to it,  then walkout of that door. 
Finally. Theo and Pearl, frustrated, go to the TWO-WAY MIRROR, blocking Jimbo  from view. 
Theo I'm hungry! When're we gonna eat? 
Pearl I have p.m.s.!! I need some ibuprofen! 
Jimbo grabs Randy's legal pad and writes: 
HELP!! BIG ASTEROID GOING TO HIT EARTH. COORDINATES 712 BY 345. 
Randy stares at the message. 
Randy Okay, I'm done here! 
The door opens. Two F.B.I. AGENTS lead Randy out. Jimbo looks at Theo and Pearl. 
Jimbo He flunked the bar three times. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

-- Harry, A.J. and Quincy work with the TURBO PROP ENGINE, transforming it into  a JET FUEL GENERATOR. 
Quincy We'll run your liquid oxygen from the shuttle through a tube into the  intake manifold. No problem. 
A.J. I figured out how to bring up the slag. Direct the jet turbine's exhaust  down the drill pipe. It'll blow the stuff right up the hole. 
Harry Good, A.J. Good. 
A.J. presses a button and the cabin, simulating "depressurisation" in space,  begins to fill with water. 
INT. NEUTRL BUOYANCY TANK - SIDE OF TANK - DAY 
Everyone around him just watches, as A.J. climbs out of the tank. After a  minute, A.J. looks up, sees all the eyes in the room on him. 
EXT. CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT 
Harry is outside, smoking a Coheba. Harry runs his hand over a SMALL METAL MEDAL  that hangs from his neck. Golden approaches. 
Golden A.J.'s off the team. We need a list of names from you to fill the slot. 
Harry A.J. would be the first name on my list. 
Golden We don't want independent thinkers. And we don't need heroes. We need a  team. 
Harry You have to have confidence in the men you send up. I understand that.  But I'm the one that has to land on that rock. Not you. (firm) I pick my own  team. 
Golden One shot. Pull him in line or send him home. 
INT . HUB OF ROCKET SIMULATOR - NIGHT 
A.J. and Grace are there talking. Grace is on A.J.'s lap. 
A.J. I pushed it, I screwed up. 
Grace These astronauts train for years for what you're training for in a few  days. 
A.J. I don't know why I didn't just listen to them. 
Grace So, tomorrow you listen. 
A.J. and Grace share a look. 
A.J. I love you, Grace. 
A N.A.S.A. Tech approaches. 
N.A.S.A. Technician Harry wants to see you. 
INT. DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE ROOM - NIGHT 
Harry and A.J. stand in the centre of a high-tech supply room. SPARE PARTS from  shuttles, PROTOTYPES and WORK TOOLS are everywhere. 
Harry You tell me what the hell you think you're doing? 
A.J. I'm trying to work with the team. 
Harry Bullshit. You're trying to lead this team. You're trying to be me.  You're not me. 
A.J. What do you want? You want me to quit? 
Harry If you can't bury this cowboy shit, yeah, I want you to quit. 
A.J. I don't have to prove anything to anybody, Harry. 
Harry I listen to N.A.S.A., you listen to me. That's the chain. Either you  follow it, or you're done. 
A.J. I'll follow it. 
Harry I stood up for you, because I've made a life of proving people wrong. 
Harry's hand slides down to the medal hanging from his neck. 
Harry (cont'd) When I was about your age, I was in Galveston, Texas. I scraped together some money, bought some old equipment, a little land. I set up a rig  and drilled my first hole. Then I sat there and watched her soak up the sun for six  months - waiting for this baby to pop. Everybody told me to quit. I wouldn't  listen. My wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace. Everybody in town thought I  was a fool. But I stayed with it. And in the last hour of the last day, she  popped. She spit out that black gold and I danced in it like a wild Indian. (reflective ) I  captured the magic (holding medal) This is the last piece of pipe that struck  gold that day. 
Harry takes off the medal. Sets it on the table. He grabs a cutting vice and  cuts the medal in two perfect halves. He hands one half to A.J. 
Harry (cont'd) Here, take it up there. 
QUICK MONTAGE 
Inside the neutral buoyancy tank -- Harry's crew goes through all DRILLS one  final time (final mission checks) in quick succession. Everything runs  perfectly. The Armadillo is rebuilt and shown functioning without error. A.J.  works as part of the team. 
INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY 
The hour of the mission. The two teams sit in the orange N.A.S.A. flight  pressure suits. Golden enters and stands before the room. 
Golden In the book of Revalations, the Bible speaks of a final day on Earth,  when all mankind shall perish, shall cease to exist. This day is known as  Armageddon. (firm) Right  now, that day conflicts with six billion schedules. (beat) For the  first time in the history of this planet, s species possesses the technology to  prevent it's own  extinction. (beat) I've been with N.A.S.A. my entire adult life.  Eleven years as an astronaut, another fifteen on the ground at Mission Control. Twenty-six years I've had  to answer one question -- why? Why more money? Why the race for  space? Why do we need to know what is up there? (beat) When we come through  this, I'll take  comfort in the fact that I won't ever have to answer those  questions again. You are our warriors up there. You are our last hope. God be  with you. 
The crew stands...... 
EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - RUNWAY - DAY 
Two sleek BLACK LEAR JETS are parked on the runway. Harry studies them. Grace  approaches. 
Harry You know I was thinking, Gracie. Over the years, I should have patted  you on the back more.... 
Grace Dad, you don't need -- 
Harry No father has ever been prouder of his child, Gracie. I want you to know  that. 
Grace's reaction makes it clear that Harry has never said anything like this  before. 
Grace I love you, Dad. 
Harry I love you too, Gracie.

Clark Freedom, Independence. You're looking good. Prepare to start docking  procedures at the MIR. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 
Sharp addresses the crews of both shuttles over the radio -- 
Sharp Listen up -- the MIR will be spinning to give us gravity so we can work  faster. You might feel queasy or dizzy. We'll dock, transfer the fuel, then  detach from the MIR.  Fast and safe. This stuff is very volatile. 
INT. RUSSIAN MIR SPACE STATION - DOCKING PORT 
Lev is working feverishly, running highly insulated liquid oxygen and hydrogen  PROPELLANT TRANSFER HOSES from the MIR's several LABORATORY and LIVING MODULES  to the MIR's twin docking ports. 
A BLUE INDICATOR LIGHT FLASHES. Lev looks out of the MIR's portside window. His  eyes light up. He smiles. 
EXT. SPACE - LOW EARTH ORBIT - MIR DOCKING PORTS 
Freedom and Independence approach the MIR station. The MIR is T- shaped, with  TWIN DOCKING PORTS at each end of the T's crossbar. Freedom begins docking at  one end., Independence at the other.

INT. CENTRAL ROOM - CENTER HUB OF MIR 
Harry, Bennie, and Lev are talking in the combination kitchen/ rec room of the  MIR -- a little bigger than a walk-in closet. Lev grabs a VIDEO CAMERA and  starts video-taping Harry and Bennie. 
Lev I hear rumour on radio. My country broke. No steaks in freezer. They plan  to sell me and the MIR (moving in closer, conspiratorial) Can you confirm this? 
Bennie We wouldn't know. What's the camera? 
Lev Oh, I also di-rec-tor. Russian cinema. MIR movies. Each has title. 
Lev grabs remote control. On a large TELEVISION screen VARIOUS IMAGES OF LEV  appear. 
Lev "Lev loves cargo." "Lev sleeps." "Lev prepares for Americans." "Lev gets  bored so he gets drunk." Funny but...too long. 
Bennie Looks like you have a lot of free time on your hands. 
Lev Yeah. I alone by myself. 
Watts comes into the room. The first woman Lev has seen in a very, very long  time. Lev moves the camera all over her.

Suspended in zero-g, on its side and in mid-air, the Armadillo is pushed by  thrusters, tires-first, against the SHEER, 90 DEGREE CLIFF FACE next to the  slope. All four Armadillo tires slam against the cliff. The Armadillo bounces  off. 
Lev, grabbing the Armadillo's TOWING CABLE, flies off the rear. The cable spools  out and LEV, hanging on for all he's worth, SLAMS against the cliff face and  descends.... 
INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 
A.J., lying sideways, keeps toggling the thruster START SWITCH. The indicator  light finally FLASHES "IN" and A.J. rams it into drive -- 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - CLIFF FACE / ARMADILLO 
-- the Armadillo, all four thrusters now working, drives sideways across the  cliff face dragging Lev, who bounces against the cliff face and gradually falls,  until he's bouncing on the asteroid surface. 
The Armadillo finally falls down the cliff face and skids to a stop. 
INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 
A.J., shaken, takes a deep breath and gets out. 
EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - REAR 
A.J. walks to the rear. Lev splayed out 50 feet from the back of the Armadillo,  covered in asteroid surface dirt and grime, looks up at him. 
Lev Very bad idea, A.J. 
EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 
Harry orders his crew to start the drill up. The men drill a shitload of feet in  record time. They finally burst through the rock and hit easy sediment. 
The asteroid is spinning toward sunlight. Here, too, there is a sunrise. Bear's  face sweats inside the helmet. Chick's vision begins to blur. Tito takes a seat  on a nearby rock, exhausted. 
Chick Mutha...it's getting warm. 
Bear (worried) We got that sunrise, Harry. These bits are gonna fry up...... 
Suddenly the TRANSMISSION LINKAGE in the Armadillo BLOWS. 
Harry Goddamn it! (thinks) We'' take the tranny from the other rig! And if you  wanna complain about the heat, go to some other fucking asteroid....Toughen up. 
Sharp (to Roughnecks) Let's move it.....let's go, guys. 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
Chick and Bear yank the detached good TRANSMISSION HOUSING from inside Armadillo  2 and carry it across to Armadillo 1. 
INT. ARMADILLO 1 - CABIN 
Max finishes unbolting the BROKEN TRANSMISSION HOUSING. He passes it to Chick  who dumps it on the surface. Sharp and Truman work with Bear and Chick who feed  in the good transmission housing. 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
WIth an awesome force, the DRILLING HOLE BLOWS. The DRILLING PIPE EXPLODES  upward, lifting the DRILLING ARM and the ENTIRE ARMADILLO VEHICLE with it. THE  ENTIRE RIG blows upward into space. 
INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 
Max punches the DOOR LOCK without depressurising the cabin and is sucked  violently out of the rear compartment into open space. 
EXT. SPACE OVER ASTEROID SURFACE 
FIFTY FEET OF DRILL PIPE, THE DRILLING ARM, and the entire ARMADILLO RIG with  MAX trailing, BLOWS into space. MAX'S FACE is a screaming mask of terror and  confusion, reaching out, but there's no one to catch him....Harry and the guys  watch in helpless silence as the drill rig and Max ascend into space. 
Chick Max.....No. No. No. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Skip motions to Golden. He comes over. 
Skip They just lost the rig. The hole blew out. 
Golden takes the news stoically. He thinks, looking across the room at Temple.  He looks at the clock. ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES TO GO. 
Golden Say nothing. 
EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 
Silence. A stark tableau. Harry and the men standing there, just watching.  Devastated, confused, in shock. This is a total catastrophe. The mission is  over. 
Sharp nods to Pitts. Pitts picks up the REMOTE NUCLEAR DETONATOR. 
Sharp Stamper, you ready to blow this? Let's get outta here...! 
Harry ignores him. He won't accept defeat. 
Harry Chick, get your butt over here. 
Chick drags his ass over to Harry. 
Chick Yeah. 
Harry We're gonna fix this - make it work. If we weld those two together and  go in one speed.... 
Chick Harry.... 
Harry Get your ass up here! 
Chick doesn't move. The two men stare at each other. 
Chick I've been with you fourteen years. I've never said this to you, never  thought I would. It's over. 
Chick walks off toward the shuttle. Bear joins him. 
Harry, atop of the Armadillo, looks around. His head drops...he's burning up.  His fist clenches the HALF MEDALLION in his hand (where is it - clipped to suit  - in pouch of suit?) His eyes shut tightly. He is going to will victory from  defeat. He will not give up. 
CAMERA'S at low angle, giving Harry a larger-than-life look. 
Harry hears something. A LOW RUMBLE. It is confusing. It sounds like......an  ARMADILLO ENGINE. 
Harry opens his eyes. He slowly turns and looks -- 
ACROSS THE VALLEY - ON THE DISTANT RIDGE - The front bumper of A.J.'s Armadillo  inches over the ridge crest. 
HARRY, for the first time on the asteroid, smiles. Miracles do happen. 
HARRY CHICK...BEAR!!! 
Chick and Bear about ready to enter the Freedom's airlock, stop and turn. They  see A.J.'S ARMADILLO ROARING down the hillside onto the drilling site. 
EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 
A.J. and Lev roar up to the drilling site in the Independence's Armadillo. They  come down a hill spectacularly without brakes and it piles into shit, knocking  things down. 
Lev and A.J. bounce up to Chick and Bear.....hugs and high-fives go around. 
Bear A.J. Frost. Back from the dead. 
Chick Now you can die with us. 
Harry All the bits are gone, A.J. I've been inventing drill bits for  twenty-five years and I don't know what to use. 
A.J. You wouldn't happen to need a diamond tipper, would you? 
A.J. pulls out the POUCH OF DIAMONDS, found on the ridge. 
Harry Boys, we're back in business! 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Golden stares at the wall. Grace is curled up on a chair in the corner. 
Harry (V.O.) We have good news folks. A.J. and the Russian just showed up. No other survivors. 
Grace shuts her eyes, smiling. Sobbing. 
EXT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AFTERNOON 
Chick shuts off an ARC WELDER and moves aside, letting Harry view a DRILL BIT  with A.J.'S DIAMONDS mounted on the top like diamonds in a ring setting. Harry  and the guys smile. 
THE DRILL PIPE begins to reverse out of the hole. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 
Skip She's gettin' hotter! Gotta mean gas - methane, helium, probably water  vapor. 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
The DRILL PIPE turns sloely, retracting from the hole. Bear, atop the drilling  platform, is working on something with a wrench. 
Bear accidently drops his wrench. It falls on the turbine's RIPPED MESH  PROTECTIVE SCREEN and hangs there. Bear looks at it nervously and reaches...THE  WRENCH falls into the turbine spinning at six-thousand r.p.m. With a GRINDING  SQUEAL, the wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and -- 
THE DRILLING ARM reverses speeds and VIOLENTLY THRUSTS THE PIPE FORWARD,  buckling it. A piece of the drill string is BLOWN OUT, smashing into Sharp's  helmet, spider-webbing his faceshield. He's out cold. 
Harry and the guys dive away from the hole. Chick, confused, works the clutch  furiously to no avail. THE DRILLING ARM RAMS THE PIPE back down the hole, where  it BUCKLES, BENDS AND BREAKS IN HALF. 
Tito tends to Sharp..his face has lost all color. Harry approaches the hole.  Looks down. FIFTY FEET DOWN IS A MESS OF MANGLED PIPE, blocking the hole. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Golden continues looking at the THERMAL IMAGING. 
Golden Harry, c'mon, we got thirty minutes. 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
Harry Well, Dan, you're just going to have to goddamn wait 'CAUSE WE GOTTA BIG  PROBLEM UP HERE IN HELL. (turns to guys) Somebody's gotta go down there. 
Chick Don't look at me. 
Bear I can't even get my foot in there. 
Harry turns and eyes A.J.    A.J. stares down the hole. 
Harry Do or die, kid. 
CLOSE ON A.J. as he peers into the hole. 
A.J. Something I've been meaning to talk to you about. When this is all over  and we're back home, I'd like to marry your daughter.... 
Harry stares at A.J., the look priceless. 
A.J. (cont'd) Maybe I'll ask her again later.... 
Harry turns around..looking up at the star-filled sky. A.J. walks over to  Sharp...who's coming to now. 
Harry (to Golden) Oh yeah, Golden? 
Golden (V.O.) Go ahead, Harry. 
Harry Your shuttle pilot just took a nasty shot from a drill string.... 
Golden Is he alright? 
Harry I hope so, he's gotta get us off this shithole. 
INT. DRILLING HOLE 
A.J, tied to a SAFETY TETHER, comes down the hole with a HAND- HELD CUTTER and a  LENGTH OF ROPE. He reaches the obstruction. The DRILL PIPE has been mashed,  bent, buckled. Severed ends stab into the sides of the hole. A.J. starts cutting  with the hand- held cutter. 
EXT. DRILLING HOLE 
The guys stand there, watching. Nothing happens. Agonising seconds pass.  Suddenly the ground rumbles. Another EARTHQUAKE. It slowly starts to subside. 
INT. DRILLING HOLE 
The hole shakes. A.J. freezes, sweating. 
Harry (V.O.) A.J., we need you. I need everything you got. 
A.J. wrestles with the severed pipes, untangling them, tying the ROPE to them.  He gives the rope a tug. Chick and Bear, above, pull up the broken pipes. 
EXT. DRILLING HOLE 
Sharp Enter interface with the weapon. 
Pitts clicks a six digit code into a DIGITAL PAD on the DEVICE'S REMOTE  DETONATOR. 
Pitts Device armed. 
The NUCLEAR DEVICE has a small SLED with RATCHET WHEELS to let it slide down the  hole slowly. Sharp and Watts lift one end of the gurney. THE NUCLEAR DEVICE  slides off the gurney toward the MOUTH OF THE DRILLING HOLE. 
NT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
The thermal and seismic sensors BEING TRANSMITTED FROM FREEDOM START GOING CRAZY 
Skip It's a mess up there...! 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
ANOTHER TEMBLOR hits, the worst yet, 9.7 on Earth. Watts falls, losing her grip  on the gurney; her end collapses. THE NUCLEAR DEVICE lurches sideways off the  gurney and rolls away from the drilling hole...... 
The NUCLEAR DEVICE slides off the gurney.... 
INT. DRILLING HOLE 
A.J. experiences the DEEPEST, MOST SINISTER RUMBLE YET, emanating form the  asteroid's core, something from hell. There's a horrendous WHOOSHING SOUND. 
Golden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote detonator is not  functional. One of the crew is going to stay behind and.... (deep breath) ...manually detonate the device. 
Golden looks over at Grace. She is stunned. The news is just sinking in. 
Golden Don't stay for this. 
Grace I'm not leaving. 
Temple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier. (to Grace) Your father better  be a man of his word. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CABIN 
PAN FROM HARRY...to A.J. to...to Chick....to Lev...to Bear. Everyone is huddled  inside the cabin. 
The SMASHED REMOTE DETONATOR, a 2000-foot spool-drum of ELECTRICAL WIRE and a  KNIFE sit on the table. 
Sharp (stoically) I'd trade places with any one of you. But we need two people  to fly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys draw. 
Sharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's going to draw  straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes, no one moves. 
Sharp Who's first? (no response) Clockwise then. 
Sharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev. 
Lev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws. The strand is  LONG. Lev exhales. Next... 
Chick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand. Pulls slowly.  LONG. He exhales. Next... 
Bear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and pulls quickly,  decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s  turn.... 
A.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts in his chair.  The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J. looks at Harry. They lock  eyes. 
Harry Your turn. 
A.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry. 
Chick (starts to get up) I can't watch this. 
Harry (stern, hard) Sit down, Chick. 
Chick sits down. Harry looks at A.J. 
Harry Draw. 
A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches and begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls. It is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his hand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small smile. 
A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the Earth. 
A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half medallion. 
A.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. It just ain't gonna be  on Earth. 
They slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry and A.J. exchange a  long look. 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 
Watts flips switches. Suddenly the jets ignite! 
Watts Ignition! She's started! 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 
Skip turns to Golden excitedly. 
Skip They got Freedom goin'! 
INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CARGO BAY 
A.J. and Harry stand in the airlock, helmets on. Harry carries the two thousand  foot spool-drum of wire. The airlock opens. Harry and A.J. descend onto the  asteroid. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 
Golden looks at the CLOCK running down - ten thirty-three... Ten thirty-two... Ten thirty-one... 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
Harry and A.J. approach the NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's half in, half out of the  drilling hole, as they left it. Harry and A.J. alligator-clamp the end of the  wire spool-drum onto the nuke's DETONATION DEVICE. 
A.J You never answered my question. 
They finish attaching the wire. 
A.J. pulls the piece of TUBULAR ALUMINIUM out of the nuke's ratchet wheel  delivery sled. The NUKE descends downhole, slowly spooling out wire from the  SPOOL DRUM. 
A.J. About Grace, Harry. (laughs nervously) I know it ain't gonna happen now,  but....if things were different...What would you say...? 
Harry walks back toward Freedom. A.J. follows. 
Harry I always wanted a son. And if I had....I'd want him to be like you. 
Harry hands him the pipe section. 
Harry (cont'd) You're going to need some magic in the world. You can marry her, A.J. 
A.J. laughs, being told at this dire time in his life. He looks at Harry with a  hint of bittersweet smile. 
A.J. Mean "could have...?"

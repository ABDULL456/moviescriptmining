EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't hide her natural beauty and panache. She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other bags. 
She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and personal affects. 
Al INT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Al 
Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her mind. 
After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car. B1 EXT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Bl The SUV drives off down the city street. 
C1 EXT. CITY OVERPASS - DAY C1 
The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in the background, growing more distant by the second. 
2 INT. CAR, RURAL ROAD - DAY 2 
The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and absolutely breathtaking. 
GPS SYSTEM Turn right up ahead. 
Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 2. 
Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house. She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks the address on the house, and gets out of the car. 
3 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 3 
Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN. The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open. 
JENNIFER Hello? 
Jennifer cautiously steps inside. 
4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4 
The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution. Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube TVs with their plastic casings cracked. 
JENNIFER Hello? 
Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Hello? 
EARL (O.S.) I'm a coming, I'm a coming. 
JOHNNY Didn't mean to frighten you. 
Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way. He's sinewy, but athletic and strong. Jennifer regains her composure. 
JENNIFER No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost anyway. Looking for Mockingbird Trail? 
JOHNNY You are definitely lost. 
JENNIFER Really? I thought-- 
JOHNNY Nah, you sure missed it. It's a good ten miles back, left turn after the big red mailbox. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4A. 
JENNIFER Oh, okay, I think I saw that. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5. Johnny flashes his smile, picking his teeth with a toothpick. Jennifer stands there uncomfortably. 
JOHNNY You, uh... staying at the cabin? 
Jennifer hesitates for a second. Just as Jennifer opens her mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage. 
In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that look like they could bend steel. 
STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of pork rinds. 
STANLEY Howdy ma'am. 
He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp. 
ANDY I'd sop that up with a biscuit real good. 
Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny, who is still awaiting her answer. 
JENNIFER Uh... no. I mean yes. 
As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down. She is definitely something to look at. 
Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to the guys, then back to her. 
JOHNNY You know, you're running a little hot. Want me to uh... maybe I should check under your hood? 
Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded. 
JENNIFER How's that line working for you? 
The gas pump clicks off interrupting. But Johnny just stands there looking at her. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5A. 
JOHNNY I don't know, how's it working for you? 
Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner, pulls the pump out. It gets laughs from the peanut gallery. Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed. She looks to the pump again. $19.78. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6. 
JENNIFER Let me just... 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8. She takes a deep, replenishing breath, and then goes back to 
WRITING-- 
A10 INT. CABIN - DAY A10 
CLOSE ON: Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a furious pace. Blocks of text keep scrolling away. Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key, a writer's high if you will. Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis. Then she hears a sound off in the trees. She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a harmonica. Then a few even more distant "heeeeeeweeeee". After a beat she innocently smiles figuring it's just some boys off in the distance having a party or something. Jennifer leans back, smiles briefly and pour herself a glass of wine. 
11 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH - DUSK 11 
Jennifer sits at the table, her laptop propped open in front of her. She's talking away on the phone as she stops for a moment to take a sip from a glass of red wine. 
JENNIFER 
(INTO PHONE) .Lonely? Are you kidding? I should've come out here on my first book... The wind kicks up and a in the distance a door is slammed shut. It startles jennifer. She looks in the direction of the sound. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Sorry, something just... Another slam, and again. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Barb, hold on a minute... 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8A. Jennifer sets down her lap top and puts the glass of wine on the arm of the chair. She gets up and looks off into the dusky woods. Then back to the house. A light breeze kicks up and SLAM. Again. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Let me call you back. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 9. Jennifer snaps the phone shut, and walks down the steps of the front porch. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Hello? In response, she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as night encroaches. Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see a 
SHED. SLAM! The SHED DOOR is kicking open and closed in the breeze. She makes her way towards the shed. All EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK All Jennifer gets to the shed. The door is wide open. She steps inside. 
B11 INT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK B11 
Inside there is an array of old gardening tools. Pots, garbage cans. Some different chemical bottles including a jug of LYE. Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the shed. She moves in further as-- 
SLAM! The door shuts behind her - 
JENNIFER Shit! 
C11 EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK C11 
Jennifer exits, and securely closes the shed door. After a beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was more than just a door blowing in the wind, then heads back to the cabin. 
D12 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH -DUSK D12 
Jennifer walks up to the chair, moves her laptop, sits and then as she grabs her phone she knocks the glass of wine off the arm of the chair into her lap. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 10. 
JENNIFER Ohhhhh... You gotta be kidding. She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and picks up her things to heads in the cabin. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Way to go Jennifer... The last of the days light is disappearing. 
12 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 12 
STANLEY She even gave him a kiss for "servicing her." Look, here's Matthew running from the cabin like a schoolgirl. They all gather around. POV CAMERA: Matthew runs from the cabin, dropping tools as he goes. Jennifer stands in the doorway calling after him. The camera goes closer on Jennifer -- The guys break up. Johnny is a bit more serious. 
ANDY Now that's some fine camera work, even better than the time you filmed yo' self hangin' your nana's cat. 
JOHNNY What's this about a kiss? 
STANLEY Matthew here says she gave him a kiss right on the cheek. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 17A. 
JOHNNY Bullshit. 
MATTHEW No, she did Johnny. She kissed me. 
JOHNNY Don't lie to me dipshit. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 18. 
STANELY If you all don't shut the hell up you'll miss the encore. All eyes turn to Stanley as Stanley pushes some buttons on the MINIDV cam. Andy comes over and looks at the LCD screen. 
STANLEY Get ready for it. ON MINIDV: The footage that Stanley shot is obviously the previous night through Jennifer's kitchen window. 
ANDY I'll be. Look at the rack on that pony. Andy punches Stanley in the arm. Johnny just stares at the screen. 
ANDY (CONT'D) You dirty dog. Where the hell'd you get that? 
STANLEY I've been working nights. 
ANDY Sure is something to look at. Matthew is clearly uncomfortable, but he desperately needs to be one of the guys. 
MATTHEW Yeah, and she likes me... she was nice to me. Stretching a rubber band. 
ANDY Nice? To her, you're nothing but a shitter fixer. Hell, she wouldn't even give Johnny the time of day. Johnny snaps his head up and looks at Stanley. 
JOHNNY Bullshit. I could tame that ass if I wanted to. 
ANDY You saw her Johnny... stuck up city bitch. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 18A. 
STANLEY Yea, girls like that think you're hardly good enough to pump their gas. Johnny lights up another cigarette. He points at Andy. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 19. 
JOHNNY Let me tell you something. I had her creaming in her panties. 
ANDY And she had you shitting yours. Least her car alarm did. The guys yuck it up. 
JOHNNY 
(SEETHING) You don't think I could have her anytime I want? Andy looks away and begins to reel in his line. Stanley stuffs his face with some crap so he doesn't have to answer. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Bitch like that comes up here for one reason. Sitting in that window, tits flapping in the wind for all to see. You know? 
MATTHEW Nah... She's not like that, Johnny. Johnny snorts, condescendingly. 
JOHNNY How do you know, ya fuckin' virgin? Let me tell you something. They're all like that! Fucking big city cock-teasing whore is all she is. He flicks his cigarette and it sizzles out in the water. Then he gets right up in Matthew's face. 
JENNIFER Wha... what? 
JOHNNY You heard me, show Horse. Show me your teeth. 
JENNIFER That's... I'm not going to... please leave. 
JOHNNY (quiet, but firm) Show the teeth... Andy walks over and hands Johnny the small wooden bat he used to kill the fish. Johnny smacks it against his palm. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) .or lose the teeth. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27A. Andy walks back to the couch and flicks another match at Jennifer. She recoils with fear as she reluctantly gives a half-smile, her teeth clenched together. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 28. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) No. Put two fingers in the side of your mouth. Then two fingers in the other side... and pull. Jennifer looks at Johnny like he's seriously disturbed as Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point. Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth. She pulls her lips away from the gums, spreading them grotesquely. It's completely humiliating. Jennifer stops. 
JENNIFER Now please... I'm begging you... Johnny slides off the counter. 
JOHNNY Uh, uh. Again. Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls. Johnny reaches into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with his thumb and forefinger. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Alright. Good girl, Show Horse. Johnny pulls down on Jennifer's teeth, forcing her to the floor. Jennifer looks as if she's about to cry, near her on the ground is the broken glass. Stanley and Andy needle each other like schoolboys. Matthew shuffles nervously, clearly uncomfortable at being there. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) I'll tell you something sweetheart... know why you ain't got no boyfriend?... 'Cause all them city guys are faggots. Johnny turns to her. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) But uh... since he isn't here. Johnny pulls out his revolver. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) This is your man. He moves closer to her, rubbing the gun against her cheek, her chin. The blood drains from her face as - 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Why don't you give him a kiss- With terror in her eyes, Jennifer quickly kisses the gun- 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Nah, not like the peck you gave Matthew... let's see a real kiss. He slides the barrel into Jennifer's mouth. Jennifer gags instinctively. Johnny holds the back of her head, not allowing her to pull away, and offers some "encouragement." 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose like it was your first time. Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back into her cheek, causing it to bulge out. Naturally, Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical. Especially once Jennifer begins to cry. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) 
(TO JENNIFER) On your knees. Jennifer complies. Johnny holds the gun in front of his crotch and again forces it into Jennifer's mouth. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) if I don't like your enthusiasm, I may cum early. (cocks the gun) And that's something you really don't want. Jennifer has no choice. She begins to fellate the gun, as deep as she can take it without gagging. Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure. Finally, he's had enough. He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils, gags. Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this hell as Andy stands up from the couch. 
ANDY My turn. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29A. 
STANLEY Come on, let Matthew have a go. It's his girlfriend and he hasn't even wet his whistle yet. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 30. 
MATTHEW I...I ddd...don't want to. Johnny walks up to Matthew, angrily, and slaps him across the face. He points to Jennifer. 
JOHNNY What do you mean you don't want to? 
(TEASING) sh...she likes me... she kissed me. Now shut up and prove it. Matthew holds his fist against his face. 
ANDY Aw, fuck it. I ain't waiting. Andy grabs the VODKA BOTTLE. He walks over to Jennifer, still on her knees, and positions the bottle right in front of his crotch. 
38 INT. CABIN - DAY 38 
Sheriff Storch and Jennifer enter the cabin. It appears empty. 
SHERIFF STORCH Hello? 
(BEAT) Miller? Miller, this is the Sheriff. if you and your boys are still in there, you come on out right now. Sheriff Storch disappears into the kitchen for a second... then back out as he makes his way over to the foot of the stairs. He looks up the staircase. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) Miller, if you're up there, you'll be leaving by the window. No answer. Sheriff Storch looks at Jennifer. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) Stay here. Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs. Jennifer, uncomfortable at being left alone, backs away to the wall. Every noise, every foot step makes her shiver. After a few seconds, the Sheriff comes back to the top of the stairs. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 34. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) It's empty. He walks back down. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) No sign of 'em. If they were here, they're gone now. Sheriff Storch makes his way through and walks back into-- 
39 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 39 
Jennifer follows him and watches as he inspects it closely. His eyes fall on the box of liquor bottles. 
SHERIFF STORCH You here alone? 
JENNIFER Yes. 
SHERIFF STORCH 
(RE: LIQUOR) With all this? 
JENNIFER I wasn't going to drink it all this weekend. I... I planned on being here for a couple of months. 
SHERIFF STORCH Drink some tonight? 
JENNIFER Yes, well, they were. They forced me to. He moves away and walks back through the cabin. As he does, he spots the glass shattered on the floor... and the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her. Takes a long hard look at them, then looks back up to Jennifer. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) One of them, he was up there, went through everything. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 35. Sheriff Storch taps the broken glass with his thick boot. 
SHERIFF STORCH (pointing to the glass) They do this, too? 
JENNIFER Please, I don't care about those things. They shoved a gun in my mouth... Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her. 
SHERIFF STORCH Okay, okay Ma'am. It's okay now. Them boys are gone. You're safe now. Jennifer nods to him, still shaken. Storch looks to the lock on the back door. He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back and forth. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) (re: back door) Was this locked? 
JENNIFER Yes. Of course. 
40 EXT. CABIN - DAY 40 
Sheriff Storch steps onto the porch. Jennifer follows. Sheriff Storch looks down and sees the dead bird at his feet. He pokes it with the barrel of his shotgun. 
SHERIFF STORCH How long you been here? 
JENNIFER Just a few days. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) I asked you a question. Jennifer trembles with fear. 
JENNIFER Please... 
JOHNNY Show him those teeth, Show Horse. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38A. Sheriff Storch brings the gun back up to her mouth - slides it under Jennifer's top lip and pushes it up. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 39. 
SHERIFF STORCH Whinny. With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun, Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor. Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) I said, whinny. Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND. Not really a whinny, but more of a half-cry, half-snort. Naturally, this amuses Andy and Stanley -- who is, of course, filming it -- to no end. 
STANLEY Oh, man. Oh, man. 
SHERIFF STORCH 
(TO JENNIFER) On your knees. And keep going. Jennifer gets to her knees. As instructed, she whinnies, interspersed with sobs. Johnny slaps her ass viciously. 
JOHNNY Keep whinnying! Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes. Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but-- Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriff's face. The slightest scratch across his lip. Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny, licks his lip and nods his head. 
SHERIFF STORCH Think you outta tame this little mare of yours. Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead. 
JOHNNY Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get up. Or you won't get a sugar cube. Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them, defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far back. She lets out a half-moan. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 40. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) 
(TO MATTHEW) Take off your clothes. We're about to pop your cherry. Matthew shakes his head. His wrist is not beat red from the rubber bands. Snap! 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) I'm not asking, now cut that rubber band shit faggot. 
STANLEY Come on, Matthew. You want to talk the talk, then walk the walk, you virgin. Johnny flicks open a pocket knife. He tickles Jennifer's bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin, past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants - her pants drop to the floor. 
JOHNNY 
(TO MATTHEW) Do it now. Or else I slice her chin to cunt. This gets Matthew moving. A few seconds later, he's in his boxer shorts, with his hands crossed in front of his crotch. Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall. He then yanks his boxers down. Matthew immediately covers up his crotch. 
STANLEY Matthew, what the hell? It's not even hard! Matthew sweats profusely. 
SHERIFF STORCH Well, maybe it's not totally his fault. After all, she's not doing much to get his motor running. Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) Dance. Jennifer begins to cry again. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 41. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) Stop it. Or else I'll really give you something to cry about. Now dance for the boy... Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room. It is sad, pathetic, and downright frightening. 
JOHNNY Come on. Move that rear of your's Show Horse. Prance for us. Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he walks back in closer to her, in her face. 
SHERIFF STORCH You dance like that in those city clubs? Jennifer closes her eyes. Tears stream down her face. 
STANLEY She dance like that they'd throw her butt to the curb. 
JOHNNY Prance like you mean it. Like you do when you want to get laid. With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass and hard. 
Andy sits on a log blowing softly into the harmonica as the rest of the guys lounge around casually as if they instinctively knew she'd end up here. Jennifer is too shocked to move, too tired to cry. Jennifer tries to escape but Johnny stops her. He grabs her by the shoulders and throws her to Andy who smacks her down in the shallow water. Andy pounces down on her back. Stanley kneels down right in front of Jennifer's face. He places the MiniDV cam only a few feet in front of her. He then turns the LCD so it's facing Jennifer -- so she can actually watch herself being abused. Andy pulls her eyelids wide open and holds them there. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 44A. 
STANLEY You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch? It smarts. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 45. Andy shoves her face down into the water - then pulls her up. ON MINIDV CAM: Eyes pried wide open, Jennifer gags as the dirty water pours from her nose - mouth - she desperately tries to breathe -- Andy shoves her face down again and again as Stanley films. 
STANLEY (CONT'D) Hold her head down! Hold it down!! 
JOHNNY Alright. This filly's got a few more races to run-- Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer. Although she can't even turn around, she senses their presence. Storch gets down into her face. 
SHERIFF STORCH I hope you got some fight left in you. I like it rough. 
JENNIFER 
(BARELY AUDIBLE) Please. Please. I'm... so hurt... Sheriff Storch spits onto the ground. 
SHERIFF STORCH Not to worry Darlin'. I'm an ass man. Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants. He kneels down behind her.. Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new level of pain as her head is thrust back down. Then, out of the corner of her eye, Jennifer catches a glimpse of the Sheriff's GUN, still sitting in its holster. Her eyes immediately go to Stanley who's busy swapping out the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one-- Then she sees Matthew leaning against a tree, a vacant look in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers. Andy site on is ass, playing his harmonica... Her eyes continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight. Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 45A. As Jennifer's body is being jerked back and forth, she reaches - and reaches - closer with each stretch when-- 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46. A heavy work boot comes down on her hand, crushing it. Jennifer looks up. Johnny glares down at her, then unzips his pants as he moves in closer to her face. 
JOHNNY No teeth Show Horse. No teeth. Her vision grows hazy. The sky, water, and ground all seem to meld together. 
TO BLACK: 
BACK IN ON: 
44 EXT. FISHING HOLE - LATER 44 
Cruel laughter brings Jennifer back to. Somehow she manages to lift her head to see Stanley pulling up his pants. 
ANDY Wow, Stanley, 30 seconds. Must be a record for you. 
JOHNNY Don't you know you should wait for the lady? 
STANLEY Bitch was too tight, even after ya'll... Sides, she's all bloody... I wanted to finish up. 
ANDY Right and we thought Matthew here was gonna be the pussy. 
JOHNNY Don't be so proud of yourself Andy. I clocked you at just over two minutes. Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to her feet. The men all stare, impressed at her resolve. Jennifer's torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them. It's a miracle she can even walk. She continues until the forest ends and she comes upon a-- 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46A. 
45 EXT. WOODS - DAY 45 
She staggers up to the edge of the woods and comes to a clearing, she leans on a tree and sobs hysterically, breaking down. 
AA45 EXT. BRIDGE, TREES - DAY AA45 
Ahead of her a dirt road leads to a small bridge and an open area. Painfully she staggers towards the bridge, her beaten and bruised body pained with each step. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 47. The others appear behind her. They laugh at her as she continues further down the bridge. 
A45 EXT. BRIDGE - DAY A45 
SHERIFF STORCH Yeah, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Found marijuana cigarettes, case of booze, looked to me like she was a party girl... a very wild one. 
EARL Yeah, yeah. I had her pegged from minute one. She wreck the place? 
SHERIFF STORCH Nah, place is fine. She packed up and split. 
EARL My lucky day. 
SHERIFF STORCH Why's that? 
EARL No refund policy. 
SHERIFF STORCH Christmas come early. Enjoy it. 
EARL (changes the subject) Speaking of early, only a month 'til quail season. Don't know about you but I'm getting tired of shooting squirrels. 
SHERIFF STORCH Me too. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 54. Earl nods. Sheriff tips his hat and walks out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
54 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 54 
THE CAMERA tilts down from the treeline and falls back on Hendersonville. It's serene, peaceful and lonely. Matthew sits in a small boat. He's been patrolling for Jennifer's body, but now the boat just sits in the middle of the swamp where the river runs out. He stares out into the water as we slowly creep closer, and closer until we're extremely close on his face, his eyes unmoving. 
A55 EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY A55 
POV: A car with two women pulls up to the gas pump. Johnny comes out of the garage and saunters over to them. Johnny playfully harasses the women. To a casual observer, it would seem harmless. But we know it could be the prelude to something unspeakable. Finally, the women pull away. Johnny walks back into the garage, a smug, self-satisfied smile on his face. 
55 INT. SERVICE STATION, GARAGE - DAY 55 
Andy is bent over Jennifer's car, or at least what's left of it. At this point, it's nothing more than a shell. He wears a welding helmet and is hard at work with a blowtorch. 
ANDY (from under the car) Round up some tail out there? 
JOHNNY Maybe. Guarantee you they'll be back. Johnny looks up as Stanley stumbles into the garage, holding a six pack of beer. 
STANLEY It's happy hour. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 55. Johnny opens his hands, signaling Stanley to toss him a can. Andy shuts off the blowtorch and lifts up the helmet. 
ANDY Fucking A. Johnny cracks open the beer and takes a gulp. He wipes the back of his hand across his mouth. 
JOHNNY 
(TO STANLEY) You bought beer? What'd your mother put you back on an allowance? They all laugh. 
STANLEY Just figured we deserved a break. Andy holds up his beer in a mock toast. 
ANDY To your moma. Johnny points to Andy, his beer still in his hand. 
JOHNNY Just one, you hear me? Don't need you passing out on your watch you lightweight. Andy takes a large sip. 
ANDY Heck, just let Matthew take all the shifts. He's been down there everyday anyway. Even when it's not his turn. They all look to one another. 
JOHNNY The fuck's he doing down there? 
EARL (CONT'D) Sheriff? 
SHERIFF STORCH Okay. I'll give her a call. 
EARL Good. You want the number? 
SHERIFF STORCH Nah, It's late. I'll pick it up from you in the am. We're still on for tomorrow, right? 
EARL Yeah, of course. Sheriff Storch hangs up. Mrs. Storch looks up. 
MRS. STORCH Is everything okay? 
SHERIFF STORCH Just fine.

ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 59. 
62 OMITTED - NOW 857 62 
63 EXT. WOODS - DAY 63 
BLAM: A SHOTGUN blasts as smoke billows from the barrel. In the distance, the shapes of Sheriff Storch and Earl come into focus. 
SHERIFF STORCH Can you believe there used to be a limit on quail? Goddamn things are like locust now. 
EARL Much to our good fortune. Earl points to a nearby log. 
EARL (CONT'D) Let's take a break. My dogs are barking something fierce. Earl plops down on the log. 
SHERIFF STORCH You're getting old, Earl. I remember back when you and my old man chased that buck out of the hollows on Stickler's Farm before bagging it. 
EARL 
(LAUGHS) Those were the good of days. Sheriff Storch joins Earl on the log. He reaches into his hunting bag and pulls out a bottle of really good whiskey. 
SHERIFF STORCH Here's to the good of days. Earl looks at him, surprised. 
EARL 
(RE: BOTTLE) Wow, fan-cy. To what do I owe? Sheriff Storch smiles, screws off the top, and passes the bottle to Earl. Earl takes a swig. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 60. 
EARL (CONT'D) Some damn fine whiskey. Usually don't have that 'cept at baptisms and weddings. 
SHERIFF STORCH And funerals. BLAM: -- Earl's chest erupts in a geyser of blood. Earl drops to the ground like a rag doll. The bottle falls from his grasp. The whisky flows into the dirt. Sheriff Storch stands up, clutching his smoking shotgun. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) Loose ends, Earl. Loose ends... Sheriff Storch hovers over his prey. Suddenly, Earl's body spasms. His eyes flicker and a nauseating gurgle sounds from deep in his throat. BLAM: -- Sheriff Storch crosses himself -- touching his forehead and both shoulders -- turns away from the corpse.

65 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY 65 
Johnny and Andy are sitting on the porch in lawn chairs drinking beer. Both of them turn to see Stanley bounding up to the station in a tizzy. 
ANDY Jeez look at this.

ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 63. Stanley is still on the ground, making disgusting noises. A combination of sobbing, puking, and wheezing. 
STANLEY You can't tell him Johnny. You can't. Johnny ponders for a second. 
ANDY Shit for brains here's right. We gotta stick together now. 
STANLEY Please, Johnny. He finds out about this... that I had the tape--- 
JOHNNY No... no. We don't breathe a word of this. (points to them both) Not a damn word. Sheriff gets wind of this, we'll all be having "hunting accidents": We clear? Johnny slaps Stanley in the head again for good measure. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) in the meantime, find that little shitwhit Matthew. Me and him are gonna have a talk. 
66 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 66 
Johnny reclines on his couch, watching TV. One hand is down his pants and the other holds a bottle of whisky. Suddenly, there's a CRASH at his front door. Johnny looks up and puts down the bottle, not overly concerned. 
JOHNNY Hello? No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch, annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door and yanks it open. The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop. Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then he closes the door and returns to the couch. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 64. But as soon as he picks up the bottle, there's another CRASH at the front door. Johnny, now pissed, races to the front door and swings it open. A second dead bird has joined the first. Without closing the door, Johnny backs up into his house. A few seconds later, he returns to the front door, pistol in hand. He steps out onto the porch. 
67 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 67 
Johnny holds the gun in front of him. He pivots slowly from side to side, scanning the entire property. No more birds. In fact, nothing at all. Dead silence. 
JOHNNY 
(THREATENING) Who's out there?! No answer. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Shit ain't funny fuckers!!! See how funny a bullet in your ass is! When there's still no response -- Johnny finally backs up into the house and closes the door. 
68 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 68 
Again, back to the couch. And again, the second his ass hits the cushion, another CRASH. 
JOHNNY Got dammit! This time, Johnny races to the door and yanks it open, cocking the gun on the way and fires into the night. 
69 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 69 
Johnny causally looks down - but this time it's not a bird. It's a shoe... Jennifer's shoe. Johnny bends down and picks it up. He studies it. Frowns. Someone's gone too far. Then he hears something scurry off in-the distance. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 64A. Quickly Johnny gives chase - leaping off his porch and racing in the direction of the sound. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 65. Johnny stops, listens, and waits. Nothing but silence. He turns around in all directions. Johnny spits and turns around to walk back and as he does, he notices one of Matthew's colored RUBBER BANDS lying in the mud. 
JOHNNY 
(UNDER BREATH) Son of a bitch. 
70 INT. SHERIFF STARCH'S HOUSE - DAY 70 
Sheriff Storch enters, holding a bouquet of flowers. He closes the door behind him and walks in. 
SHERIFF STORCH Helen? Within seconds, Mrs. Storch materializes, apron on and wiping her hands on a dish towel. 
MRS. STORCH Oh, they're beautiful... Sheriff Storch walks over and gives her a kiss on the cheek. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) What's on that tape?! Is this some kind of fucked up joke? I smashed the damn thing myself! 
JOHNNY Nah, genius over here reloaded. Tape you smashed had nothing on it. Storch looks to Johnny - then snaps his gun towards him.

ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 68. 
JOHNNY Hey, I just found out myself. Storch swings the gun back to Stanley. 
SHERIFF STORCH Eat that tape fatboy. Andy starts to laugh as Starch trains the gun back on them- 
STORCH Shut your pie hole. Think this is funny?! I'll have him shit it down your throat when's he done eating it. Got that boy? .LAM; The Sheriff fires a shot into the air. They all jump, Stanley covers his ears like it hurt. 
SHERIFF STORCH See, there's two kinds of crazy people. One likes to get buck naked and howl at the moon. The other kind does the exact same thing, only in my backyard. The first kind'I don't have to deal with, you know? The Sheriff walks right into Stanley's face as he continues to chew the plastic. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) The second kind, well... you're in my yard. 
JOHNNY It's Matthew, Sheriff. Stanley kept the souvenir, but Matthew's the one that took it. The Sheriff backs off a beat, sizes up the situation. Johnny brings forth the shoe. Sheriff's eyes seethe with rage. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) The crazy bastard left me a present. 
ANDY Fucking retard is obsessed with her. I think he actually feels guilty. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6$A. 
SHERIFF STORCH You dipshits bring him to me! I'm gonna cut his little pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament. 
(TO STANLEY) 
(MORE) 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 69. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) And that's after I'm done shoving it up your dirt hole. Now where is he?! Storch takes a deep breath. He looks at all of them, fuming. 
ANDY We don't know. Isn't coming around much. 
JOHNNY Much? At all. Kid's fucked three ways to Sunday. We can't find him and trust me, we been looking. 
SHERIFF STORCH You losers couldn't find your own asses with both hands and a map. 
(BEAT) You got 24 hours. You understand? I will not hesitate. Not for one second. He fixes them all with a steely gaze and loads the shotgun again. 
72 EXT. CABIN - DAY 72 
Matthew, disheveled and weary, stumbles up the steps of the cabin. We get the feeling that this is almost a daily pilgrimage, as if he returns here to assuage his guilt. He rests his head on the wooden railing of the porch, for a moment it looks as if he's about to cry. 
VOICE (O.S.) (from inside the cabin; creepy and ethereal) Matthew... Matthew's head snaps up. He's almost certain he imagined it, just like he's been imagining many things these days. 
VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Math...ewwww... 
MATTHEW Who's there? Matthew walks cautiously into the cabin. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 70. 
(STRUGGLING) I'm sorry. 
JENNIFER I'm sorry? That's just not good enough. She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins to 
CHOKE HIM-- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Now I want you to cry like a little girl for me. Matthew begins to wail. 
A75 EXT. CABIN, DAY A75 
Matthews screams echoes out through woods, but his, much like Jennifer, go unheard. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
B75 EXT. WOODS. NIGHT B75 
Silence. A full moon hangs low in the night sky, casting an eerie glow over the entire area. A sense of calm restored. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
C75 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT C75 
Jennifer walks into focus - We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the beating and trauma she went through. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 73A. But in her eyes --- her eyes still tell the whole story. This is no longer the Jennifer we've known. She looks down. ANGLE ON: A BIBLE, the old moldy one from the dilapidated shack. It rests on the windowsill - opened to a passage. CZrO$E ON: Exodus 21:23-25: .And if any mischief follow, than thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.. Jennifer looks up. 
JENNIFER Forgive me father, for I will sin. 
76 EST. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 76 Andy and Stanley make their way to the falls. They carry flashlights, but they're turned off as day has broken. Stanley shovels pork rinds into his mouth, and offers some to Andy. They are tired, weary, and you get the sense they have been looking all night. 
STANLEY You want some? My last bag. 
ANDY No, get that shit out of my face. 
STANLEY What's your problem? 
ANDY I'm tired, I'm hungry-- 
STANLEY I offered you-- 
ANDY I don't want that shit. I want real food, I want my bed, I want this bullshit to be over. 
STANLEY Well the sooner we find Matthew... 
ANDY Yeah, that's right. The sooner we find Matthew what?

ANDY Ain't it obvious? We drag that homo back to the sheriff, he's a dead man. 
STANLEY So what? Better him than me. 
ANDY 
STANLEY Good, cause he's coming out in pieces. Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath behind him. 
81 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 81 
Andy enters. The shack appears as we first saw it, only now there are remnants of recent life. 
ANDY Matthew! Where the fuck are you! 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77. Under the table is a pile of filthy old clothes. It almost looks like... a makeshift pillow. He picks up a moldy tin can which once contained some preserved meal. He tosses it to the ground. 
82 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 82 
Stanley waddles out the back of the shack. He stops. About twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree. 
STANLEY Why you little bitch... Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls to the ground in agony 
STANLEY (CONT'D) Oh, God! Oh, my fucking God! ON ANDY: As he exits the Shack to see Stanley on the ground writhing in pain. 
STANLEY (CONT'D) Please! Andy! My fucking leg! Andy races over to assist him. As he offers Stanley his hand, he notices Stanley's eyes catching a glimpse of someone behind him. But as soon as he turns, the wooden BAT, the one from the fishing hole, catches him flush across the face! He's down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the back of the head. 
TO BLACK: 
BACK IN ON: 
83 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 83 
Andy's eyes flicker open. He sees a hand wrapping a rusty wire around the contact of an old car battery. Then he looks up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on. He's draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is completely over the basin. His arms and legs are secured with ropes. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77A. Suddenly, the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough. Andy looks down. A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the trough. Brown water flows from it... Filling it. 
ANDY 
(PAINED SCREAMS) Help! Somebody! Help me! 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 78. His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream. With the trough filling up quickly, Andy realizes it won't be long until the water is above his head. He cranes his neck upwards. After all, were he to stay face down, he would drown -- just like Jennifer would've. 
84 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84 
STANLEY'S POV: It's Jennifer and in her hand is his video camera. 
JENNIFER I know. You like to watch. Don't you. Don't you worry, I'll give you quite a show. She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him. Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in position, duct tapped back against the tree. His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with every move. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Since you like to watch. She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he did to her. She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say something but his pain is too intense. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe it's because you're hungry. Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) You know, you have to eat some real nasty shit out here to stay alive. 
STANLEY Bbbb... bitch! Let me go! She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT INFESTED RODENT into his mouth. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 79. 
JENNIFER What's wrong, you don't like it? I prefer the maggots to the meat. Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over and into a burlap sack. Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of him. Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks. Stanley's eyes go wide. Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip. Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line. 
STANLEY Wh...what are you doing with that? 
JENNIFER 
SCREAMS! 
ON ANDY: Andy continues to struggle. A few seconds later, Jennifer returns, carrying a large bucket. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) I'm impressed. You got a lot of fight in you. Let's see how you do now. Jennifer brings forth the bucket. 
ANDY Wha-- what is that? 
JENNIFER oh, just some lye I found laying around. 
ANDY Jesus, please, what the - no! Jennifer pours the lye into the bucket - the fumes make Andy gag. But he holds his neck up as long as he can - he does not want to put his face down. Jennifer come around in front of him. 
JENNIFER Let's see how long you can keep that pretty little face of yours. Andy strains to keep his head faced at her. 
ANDY Fuck you. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 83. 
JENNIFER You already did that. I didn't enjoy it much. Now it's my turn to fuck you. Andy's neck is straining to keep his head out. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) That's an awfully big head you got. Your neck must be getting tired. Every vein in his neck now bulges. Andy's eyes start to water with tears. 
ANDY 
(STRAINED) Please... 
JENNIFER Andy? 
ANDY Wh--what... 
JENNIFER Fuck you. Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED and 
BURNING-- 
ANDY Ahhhhhhh!!! Jennifer laughs and walks out of the shack as Andy gasps, chokes and spits for his life as- STANLEY'S head is covered in crows. 
86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 86 
The crows jump all over pecking at Stanley's eyes, his cheeks - he is a bloody mess as he lets out a final guttural scream! 
A86 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK A86 
Andy's body continues to writhe in pain. With yet another burst of strength he lifts his head out of the lye-bath revealing a face burnt red, puffy, oozing puss, skin flaking off and his eyes are a ghastly, milky white, pussy, and bloody. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 83A. Finally his body stops convulsing. His head and midsection drop into the water. Blood seeps up the surface from his mouth. 
B86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY B86 
Stanley is dead. His one eye stares straight ahead. Where the other one should be, blood has poured all the way to the ground. 
C86 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY C86 
Andy is dead. 
EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT 
The house is quiet now. A light bulb flickers from inside. 
(BEAT) Aw... what's the matter Show Horse? I thought that's how you liked it? No teeth... right? 
JOHNNY Justh kill me. Kill me you bith. 
JENNIFER We'll get to that. Jennifer pulls out a gun. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
(SING SONG) Look who's here. My boyfriend. Remember him? She takes the gun and caresses it across his face, his chin, and then she SHOVES it in and out of his mouth. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 87. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Give him a kiss. 
(BEAT) Like you really mean it. Johnny finds renewed strength and starts to buck and writhe. ABOVE: The eye hook is starting to pull loose. With every touch of motion, white-hot pain courses through Johnny's body. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Breathe through your nose. It helps. You know, like it was your first time. Johnny's body flails with all his might as- ABOVE: The eye hook loosens a bit more-- 
JOHNNY 
(SPITTING BLOOD) 
WHORE-- 
JENNIFER I hear sometimes a stallion can get a little headstrong. They don't want to be trained... refuse to be broken... 
(BEAT) But everyone has their breaking point, don't they? 
(BEAT) You just have to find it. There's a way to break any animal. Do you know how they do that with horses? Do you, Johnny? I do. She walks away from Johnny and picks up the rusted old gardening sheer. She walks back to Johnny, menacingly slicing the sheer open... closed.. And again... 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) You slice off every ounce of their foul manhood. She slices it closed again. As Jennifer closes in, the look in Johnny's face says it all. But there is simply nothing he can do about it. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 88. Jennifer gets even closer, looking at Johnny's eyes as she reaches down towards his penis-- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) You geld them. SLICE! - Johnny's eyes rolls back as he SCREAMS!!!! She holds the piece of limp, pink flesh in her hand. Despite everything he's been through, this brings forth an entirely new level of pain. He screams and bucks as the EYEHOOK continues to loosen. Jennifer bends down for a moment, bringing something up from the floor. She comes back to a screaming Johnny as she-- 
SHOVES HIS CASTRATED PENIS INTO HIS MOUTH. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) No teeth show horse... no teeth. Johnny flails with all his might, screaming, spitting as-- ABOVE: The eye hook finally gives way. Johnny's tied hands come crashing down directly on top of Jennifer. Jennifer goes flying with a bloody enraged Johnny now free as he grabs and claws after her. Jennifer desperately kicks and scratches to get away from this hideous, blood-soaked monster - but Johnny grabs hold onto her leg - he drags her closer as she loses her grip-- With one solid kick, Jennifer connects with Johnny in the face - he sprawls out from pain - as she gets up and races out the door - Slamming it closed as she exits. She leans up against it holding it closed. 
89 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 89 
Within seconds the door is kicked at, banged at, punched at - Johnny screams wildly from inside as-- Jennifer holds it shut with all her strength. Slowly the cries and banging fade until there is nothing but silence. Slowly she slides down on her bottom... exhausted, spent and completely devoid of all emotion. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 89. 
90 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 90 
HIGH ANGLE on Johnny. His lifeless body lays on the floor surrounded by a pool of blood. 
91 INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY 91 
Sheriff Storch drives through town. He scans each side of the street. His phone rings. He picks it up and answers it. 
SHERIFF STORCH Hi, honey. 
MRS. STORCH What's wrong? 
93 EXT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - DAY 93 
The squad car screeches to a stop right in front of Sheriff Storch's house. Hearing the commotion, Mrs. Storch walks out onto the porch. She's almost knocked to the ground as her husband comes barreling up the steps. 
MRS. STORCH What is -- Sheriff Storch grabs his wife's shoulders. 
SHERIFF STORCH Chastity, where is she?! Mrs. Storch has absolutely no idea what is going on. In her mind, their daughter couldn't be in better hands. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 91A. 
MRS. STORCH What -- she... she went to Hansen Park with Miss Hills. 
(MORE) 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 92. 
MRS. STORCH (CONT'D) She wanted to get to know her students in the program before the year started. Sheriff Storch lets go of his wife. 
SHERIFF STORCH Goddamnit! 
MRS. STORCH 
(GROWING CONCERN) Who is she? Who is this woman? He turns and runs back to his squad car, gets inside, and pulls away even faster than he came. 
94 EXT. PARK - DAY 94 
The squad car skids to a stop on the grass of the park. It's a modest recreation area that has seen better days. Sheriff Storch jumps out of the car, still leaving it running, and sprints into the park. A few feet away, an empty swing blows gently in the breeze. The metal brackets screech loudly with every movement. Sheriff Storch spins around in circles, a maelstrom of confusion. He looks around frantically for anything that will give him a clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter. 
95 INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY 95 
Sheriff Storch gets back inside. He immediately picks up the CB. But just as he opens his mouth to speak, lie glances in the rearview mirror. His eyes meet Jennifer's. Before he can turn, Jennifer pistol whips him in the temple. He falls forward, his head smacking into the steering wheel. The HONKING of the horn echoes throughout the empty park. 
96 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 96 
Sheriff Storch comes to. Blood trickles down from the side of his head. He's bent over the table, pants at his ankles. His SHOTGUN propped up behind him with the barrel inserted into his ass. With every move, a scorching pain courses through his body. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 93. 
SHERIFF STORCH Ahhhhhh! Jennifer walks over to the table and rests her elbow on it. Sheriff Storch speaks through gritted teeth. 
JENNIFER Does that hurt? Come on, I thought you were an ass man, Sheriff. 
SHERIFF STORCH Where is she, you bitch? Jennifer slams the gun deeper. The Sheriff's body goes stiff. The Sheriff screams again. 
JENNIFER I'd be careful how you speak to me at the moment, Sheriff. (BEAT) By "she," I assume you mean your daughter? 
SHERIFF STORCH What'd you do to her? 
JENNIFER She really is lovely, Sheriff. So young. So sweet. I mean, can you imagine? 
SHERIFF STORCH Imagine what? 
JENNIFER Imagine if someone had done this to her. Jennifer walks behind the Sheriff. She wraps her fingers around the barrel of the gun and shoves it in, deeper. The Sheriff's expression is one of unbridled agony. Jennifer continues to sodomize him with the shotgun. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Someone like Andy? 
(HARDER) Or Stanley?

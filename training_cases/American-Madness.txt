OPERATOR 
(mechanically sweet voice) 
Good morning . . . Union National Bank . . . Just a minute 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
6. INT. ENTRANCE ROOM TO VAULTS - MED. SHOT 
Of the inside of a massive vault door, made impressive by the shining, finely cut steel bolts and the many other intricate-looking instruments which adorn it. 
CAMERA PANS UP to a clock overhead which registers 9:03. 
A group of young men, paying tellers, are impatiently watching a teller struggle with the lock that will admit them to the vault. 
TELLER 
Come on, come on, Oscar, what are we waiting for? 
2ND TELLER 
What's the matter? Can't you find it? 
3RD TELLER 
Sneak up on it, boy! 
4TH TELLER 
Oscar, come on! 
CHARLIE 
Say, if it had lipstick on it, he'd find it! 
They all laugh, as Oscar finds the combination. 
OSCAR 
Almonds to you![1] Almonds! 
TELLERS 
Now, now, Oscar - not almonds! 
The CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they pass through the first portal. 
CHARLIE 
Nine o'clock and all is lousy! 
1ST TELLER 
Yes, I spend half of my life waiting for these time clocks to open. Say, where's Matt? 
CHARLIE 
Probably upstairs thinking up that daily joke. 
2ND TELLER 
That guy kills me with his wisecracks. 
3RD TELLER 
Say, when he comes in, let's put on a frozen face. Let's not smile. 
They ad-lib agreement. 
1ST TELLER 
Shhh! Nix! Here he comes 
7. MED. SHOT 
CAMERA PICKS UP Matt Brown, the chief teller, as he strides briskly in and begins turning the combination dial to the main vault. He is about twenty-six, a clean-looking, personable youngster. Several of the tellers are standing close to him, looking on. 
MATT 
How are you doing slaves? 
TELLERS 
Hello, Matt. How're you Matt? 
Matt begins to work the combination of the main lock. 
MATT 
(with his back to them) 
Say, did you boys ever hear the story of the pawnbroker with the glass eye? 
1ST TELLER 
No Matt, what is the story about the pawnbroker with the glass eye? 
MATT 
(as he continues to fiddle with the lock) 
Well, I'll tell you. A fellow went into this shop to pawn his watch. The pawnbroker said, "I'll give you $50 for it, if you can tell me which is my glass eye." The fellow said, "All right, I'll do that. It's the right one." The pawnbroker said, "That's correct. But how did you know it was the right one?" The fellow 
said, "well, it's got more sympathy than the other one." 
He turns, expecting their laugh, but is confronted by stone faces. 
MATT 
Sympathy! You know, the right one had more sympathy than the other one! 
1ST TELLER 
What's the matter? Can't you get this thing open? 
Matt stares in disbelief, then gets the joke. 
MATT 
(contemptuously) 
Six reasons why banks fail! 
This cracks them all up, as a uniformed officer, who has been standing by, works a lever attached to the floor, which lowers a section of the floor, directly in front of the vault. This permits the vault door, which is sunk below the floor level, to swing open. 
TELLERS 
(ad-libbing) 
I love your jokes, Matt! They're so entertaining! A very funny man! 
8. MED. SHOT 
Matt opens the inside door, made up of perpendicular steel bars. The tellers scurry into the cavernous-looking interior. Someone snaps on a light. CAMERA TRUCKS UP TO VAULT. 
Another teller is busy in the cage next to him. Matt addresses him, referring to Charlie. 
MATT 
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar. 
TELLER 
Yeah, what did he do with his first one? 
MATT 
Bought himself a pocketbook! 
The teller laughs heartily. 
15. MED. SHOT 
THE CAMERA PICKS UP Helen as she crosses the main floor of the bank, reaches Matt's teller window and pushes it open. 
MATT 
Hello, Helen! 
HELEN 
(conspiratorially) 
Matt, come here! 
MATT 
Why? 
HELEN 
Come here, honey! 
He leans over, and she gives him a quick kiss. 
MATT 
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us! 
HELEN 
(already walking away) 
Oh, is that so? 
She quickly kisses him again, crosses back, and takes the grand stairs up to the outer office of the bank president as Matt watches with a grin. 
16. INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - FULL SHOT 
Just then, a group of five or six important-looking men enter scene on the way to the conference room. One of the men looks towards Helen's desk. 
17. MED. SHOT 
On Helen and a secretary standing next to her. 
SECRETARY 
(to Helen) 
Oh, oh. Look who's here. 
18. MED. SHOT 
The other clerks and tellers, noticing the newcomers as they file past. 
TELLER 
Hey, psst! 
OSCAR 
Oh, oh. Five ill winds. 
TELLER 
(standing next to Oscar) 
And blowing no good for the old man, either. 
19. CLOSER SHOT ON HELEN'S DESK 
Shooting toward Helen. 
HELEN 
(acidly) 
The four-and-a-half horsemen.[3] 
GIRL 
What are they doing here? There's no board meeting today. 
HELEN 
Search me. 
By this time, the important group of men have reached Helen, and are passing her by, with perfunctory nods. 
CLARK 
(the most important of the important-looking men; to Helen) 
Mr. Dickson in yet? 
HELEN 
Not yet, Mr. Clark. 
CLARK 
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room. 
HELEN 
Yes, sir. 
CLARK 
And tell him not to delay. 
HELEN 
Yes, sir. 
The group of men file through the board room door, and out of sight. 
GIRL 
(to Helen) 
Looks like trouble for your boss. 
HELEN 
Takes more than two tons of directors to make trouble for my boss. 
GIRL 
(as she turns to go) 
Sez you! 
20. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT 
Taking in all of room. The directors are all here, and some sit around a long, narrow mahogany table. Clark, the sour-faced old 
bird we saw previously talking to Helen, paces back and forth agitatedly. 
CLARK 
I've sent for the cashier, gentlemen. He has a list of the loans that Dickson made last month. 
21. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK 
As he stops in his pacing a moment and addresses the directors further: 
CLARK 
And as I told you at breakfast, it is time we did something about it. 
22. CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ 
In thorough accord with Clark's violent attitude is Schultz, a German, whose instinctive conservatism rebels against Dickson's liberal banking methods. 
MATT 
(catches himself in time) 
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it? 
31. CLOSE SHOT 
Shooting toward Matt. 
As she interrupts him: 
HELEN 
No. 
MATT 
Oh, you think I'm lying? 
HELEN 
Yes. 
MATT 
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar. 
HELEN 
Oh, Matt. 
He reaches forward and takes her hands. 
MATT 
Oh honey, why don't we get married? Then you can handle it all. 
Just then Oscar enters the scene, en route somewhere. He stops beside Matt, notices he and Helen are holding hands. 
32. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Helen and Matt separate guiltily. 
OSCAR 
Say, Matt! Matt! Did you hear the news? 
MATT 
No, what? 
OSCAR 
Pardon me. All the big shots are in a huddle, and it looks like Dickson's out on his ear. 
Helen and Matt react to this piece of news. They look at one another. Apparently, it will have a definite effect on their lives. 
MATT 
(to Oscar) 
Oh, you're kidding me, aren't you? 
OSCAR 
No, I'm not kidding. Everybody's talking about it. Ask her. 
HELEN 
I haven't heard about it. 
OSCAR 
Sure, everybody's talking about it. 
33. CLOSE UP - MATT 
As he speaks sadly. 
MATT 
If that's on the level, there goes my assistant cashier's job. 
34. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Taking the three in. 
OSCAR 
Well, I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit. 
As he turns to go out of scene, he looks at Matt. 
OSCAR 
I'll be seeing you, Matt - in the breadline. 
CUT TO: 
35. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM MED. - SHOT 
The men are all gathered around the table now. Apparently, they have been discussing ways and means of ousting Dickson. 
As we cut to this scene, Ives is pouring himself a glass of water. 
IVES 
That ham I had this morning was very salty 
36. CLOSER SHOT ON THE GROUP 
CLARK 
Gentlemen, let's get organized before Dickson gets here. Schultz, can I count on you? 
37. CLOSE SHOT 
On Schultz, who is seated next to Clark. 
SCHULTZ 
Absolutely. 
CLARK 
What about you, Ames? 
38. CLOSE SHOT 
On Ames, who is seated next to Schultz. 
AMES 
That's the way I feel about it. 
CLARK 
Ives, how about you? 
39. CLOSE SHOT 
IVES 
Well, the way I look at it, it seems that 
CLARK 
(interrupting) 
All right. O'Brien? 
40. CLOSE SHOT 
At other end of table, where O'Brien is. 
O'BRIEN 
Well, you've got an awful fight on your hands. That's all I've got to say. 
41. CLOSE SHOT 
On Clark, determined. 
CLARK 
Gentlemen, I think it's time that we do fight. 
CUT TO: 
JANITOR 
Why, I don't know. 
DICKSON 
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform. 
The man exits scene. Bill picks up the conversation where he left off. 
BILL 
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest 
DICKSON 
(interrupting) 
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with. 
(softening) 
Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent. 
BILL 
But listen, Tom, I 
They have now reached the anteroom of Dickson's private chamber, where Helen sits at her desk. 
45. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Dickson comes up to Helen at her desk. A lady sits nearby. Dickson notices her. 
DICKSON 
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke. 
MRS. PEMBROKE 
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. 
DICKSON 
Got my letter? 
MRS. PEMBROKE 
Yes, thank you. 
DICKSON 
Hello, Helen. 
HELEN 
Good morning. 
DICKSON 
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it? 
HELEN 
I don't know. 
DICKSON 
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married? 
HELEN 
(awkwardly) 
Why - well, I 
DICKSON 
Ummm. Stalling, eh? 
(changing tone, professionally) 
Anything new? 
HELEN 
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room. 
DICKSON 
Directors, eh? Long faces? 
He gestures accordingly. 
HELEN 
(she trumps his gesture) 
Longer. 
DICKSON 
(half-under his breath) 
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either. 
Mrs. Pembroke has been standing by, waiting to get a word in edgewise. CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY with him to take in the lady: 
MRS. PEMBROKE 
Mr. Dickson? 
DICKSON 
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . . 
During this speech the phone bell rings. 
46. MEDIUM SHOT 
As Helen picks up the phone and quietly answers it. Bill Saunders is standing nearby, still waiting to talk to Dickson again. 
HELEN 
(into phone) 
Hello . . . 
(she turns to Dickson) 
Mrs. Dickson on the phone. 
Dickson comes over to the desk and as he picks up the receiver, he looks toward Mrs. Pembroke. 
DICKSON 
(to Mrs. Pembroke) 
You'd better hurry over there. He's waiting for you. 
(then into phone) 
Hello, dear . . . 
47. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON 
As he continues, into phone: 
DICKSON 
Where are you? . . . Sure, well, come on down right away. Huh? . . . Yes, of course I remember. It's tonight. 
(smiles) 
See what a social hound I'm becoming! . . . All right, goodbye, dear. 
He hangs up. Mrs. Pembroke is waiting for him to finish. She has apparently been disappointed in the news he has for her. 
MRS. PEMBROKE 
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty. 
DICKSON 
(ill-at-ease) 
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . . 
48. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As they walk toward camera, they glance around the bank with a professional casualness, but obviously very much impressed. Their eyes rove around the place and finally land on some object where they stop. 
CUT TO: 
52. CLOSEUP - CHARLIE 
As he quickly counts out several thousand dollars in bills. 
CUT TO: 
53. CLOSE SHOT - THREE RACKETEERS 
Their eyes glisten. Their mouths water, as they watch Charlie off scene. 
CUT TO: 
54. MEDIUM SHOT 
Inside the railing. Cluett emerges from his office and starts forward, business-like, when he suddenly stops in his tracks. 
55. CLOSEUP - CLUETT 
He stares off at the racketeers. A look of fright comes into his eyes. His impulse is to turn back. 
56. CLOSE GROUP SHOT 
The three gangsters. A quick flash. Their eyes light on Cluett off scene, and they glare menacingly at him. 
LEADER 
There he is! Good morning! 
57. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT 
He changes his mind about avoiding them. His face breaks into a feeble smile of affability as he walks toward them. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches the three men, his hand outstretched in forced amiability. 
CLUETT 
(shaking) 
Good morning! Who do you want to see? 
The gangsters shake hands with him, their expressions remaining unchanged, which adds immeasurably to Cluett's discomfort. 
LEADER 
(flatly) 
You. 
1ST GANGSTER 
(drawling) 
Yeah. We wanna talk to you about a big deal. 
There is a sinister significance in the manner in which he emphasizes "a big deal." Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease. 
CLUETT 
(uncertainly - sickly smile) 
Oh, yes. Well, come right this way. 
He opens the swinging gate in front of him, permitting the three racketeers to enter. They start for Cluett's office. 
58. INT. ANTE ROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Helen sits at her typewriter near a railing, overlooking the bank below. Another girl stands by her, both are staring off scene. 
CUT TO: 
59. INT. BANK LOBBY - MED. LONG SHOT 
From Helen's angle. 
Cluett and the three gangsters going into Cluett's office. 
60. INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Helen and other secretary. 
HELEN 
Hey Pat, come here! Look! 
SECRETARY 
(to Helen) 
That's Dude Finlay, all right - I've seen his picture in the papers hundreds of times. 
HELEN 
I wonder what he's doing with Mr. Cluett. 
SECRETARY 
(still staring - thrilled - shuddering) 
Gee, I'm scared. He's one of the toughest gangsters in town. 
CUT TO: 
61. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. LONG SHOT 
Shooting down the length of the table. The men are all sitting around the large table. Dickson is on his feet. 
DICKSON 
(firmly) 
Gentlemen, you're only wasting your time. There'll be no merger. 
62. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Dickson continues. 
DICKSON 
(the injustice kills him) 
Why should I turn this bank over to anybody else? I've worked twenty-five years night and day to build it up, and now you're asking me to dump it into somebody's lap 
(with finality) 
Nothing doing! 
Schultz, who is seated near Dickson, looks up at him: 
SCHULTZ 
You can make a handsome profit on your stock. 
DICKSON 
I'm not interested in profits. I'm interested in the bank. In the depositors. They're my friends. They're looking to me for protection, and I'm not walking out on them. 
Clark and O'Brien, also seated around close to Dickson. 
CLARK 
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans! 
O'BRIEN 
(admonishing him) 
Take it easy, Clark. 
Ives, seated next to Schultz, becomes alarmed. 
IVES 
(still trying) 
My dear friends . . . 
DICKSON 
(unruffled, paying no attention to Ives) 
It's all right. Let him go ahead. Let him speak his piece. I like it. Go on. 
CLARK 
All right. I'll speak my piece. Dickson, you've got to change your policy. 
63. CLOSER SHOT 
DUDE 
(threateningly - quietly) 
We can take blood from anything  
(pauses) 
If it's comin' to us. 
77. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Shooting toward Cluett. Dude on opposite side of desk, the other two men still standing by the desk. 
A look of alarm spreads over Cluett's face. There is nothing hidden in this threat. 
CLUETT 
(wants time to think) 
Perhaps if you'll wait a little while, I might be able 
ONE OF THE MEN 
(snappily) 
We waited long enough! 
DUDE 
(shrewdly - to the men) 
Nix. Lay off. 
(to Cluett) 
Now - what's the use of getting excited, Cluett? It oughta be easy for you to lay your mitts on that kind of dough 
78. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT 
Shooting past Dude, as Dude continues, slowly, deliberately: 
DUDE 
There's plenty of it in this bank - laying around loose. 
Cluett looks up - horror-stricken. 
CLUETT 
(pop-eyed, choked voice) 
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I 
DUDE 
Why not? 
CLUETT 
(perspiring freely) 
Why, I couldn't do that . . . ! 
DUDE 
(flatly) 
You don't have to do nothing. 
Cluett looks up toward the men - then at Dude. 
CLUETT 
(slowly) 
What do you mean? 
DUDE 
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see? 
There is a pause while Cluett stares at them, horrified, his confused mind trying to assimilate the ghastliness of their proposal. Suddenly he starts to rise. 
79. MEDIUM SHOT 
As Cluett gets to his feet and faces Dude across the desk. 
CLUETT 
No, no, I couldn't - I couldn't do anything like that. I 
Smack! The rest of his speech dies in his throat. The man to his right has slapped him across the face with his open palm. Taken unaware, Cluett's hand goes to his cheek. He stares at them, bewildered and frightened. 
Cluett, feeling himself trapped and helpless, slowly sinks into his chair. 
CUT TO: 
80. INT. ANTEROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT 
Helen sits at her typewriter. A very dignified, beautiful woman of thirty approaches her. She is Phyllis Dickson, Dickson's wife. She radiates refinement and culture. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(pleasantly) 
Good morning, Helen. 
81. CLOSER SHOT 
At Helen's desk, as Helen looks up at Mrs. Dickson. 
HELEN 
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson. 
MRS. DICKSON 
Is that busy husband of mine busy? 
HELEN 
(indicating conference room) 
He's at a board meeting. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(not unexpected) 
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose. 
HELEN 
I'm afraid so. 
MRS. DICKSON 
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank? 
HELEN 
No. 
MRS. DICKSON 
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you? 
HELEN 
Hardly. 
82. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON 
Shooting past Helen. 
MRS. DICKSON 
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me! 
HELEN 
All right. 
83. MEDIUM SHOT 
Helen laughs as Mrs. Dickson leaves in the direction of Cluett's office. 
CUT TO: 
(trying hard) 
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(laughs) 
Now let me see, what comes next? 
(a mocking tone) 
Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis? 
88. CLOSEUP - CLUETT 
He is suddenly reminded of his pact with Dude Finlay. Terror returns to his face. 
CLUETT 
Tonight? 
He suddenly gets an idea. He was told to be with someone around midnight. Someone who would be an alibi for him. He stares off at Phyllis Dickson. Why not? 
MRS. DICKSON 
(continuing) 
Doesn't that come next? 
89. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
CLUETT 
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis? 
MRS. DICKSON 
See, we're getting along famously! 
CUT TO: 
90. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MEDIUM SHOT 
Clark is in a state of agitation. The other directors seem worn by the ordeal. Dickson remains adamant. 
DICKSON 
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them. 
CLARK 
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency! 
91. CLOSER SHOT AT THE TABLE 
All the men in the scene. 
DICKSON 
I know what you mean by that. You want me to hang on to our cash. Well, I don't believe in it. The law demands that I carry a certain legal reserve, and I'm doing it. The rest of our money is out working . . . working to help industry . . . to help build up business 
92. CLOSEUP - CLARK 
As he almost shouts at Dickson. 
CLARK 
In the meantime, you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank. Well, we won't stand for it! 
93. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Of the group, as Dickson turns to Clark. 
DICKSON 
You have to stand for it. 
Meek little Ives once again tries to say something: 
IVES 
(exhausted) 
But my dear friends . . . 
SCHULTZ 
(interrupting) 
You're forcing us to take action against you, Dickson. 
Dickson looks at him: 
DICKSON 
Go ahead - take all the action you want! 
He looks about at the others as he continues: 
DICKSON 
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear! 
CLARK 
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith! 
DICKSON 
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me. 
94. CLOSEUP - CLARK 
As Dickson's voice continues. Clark reacts appropriately. 
DICKSON'S VOICE 
Before I take a man into this bank, and before I extend credit to anyone, I satisfy myself on one thing - do I believe in him? 
95. CLOSE PAN SHOT 
On the other men - CAMERA PANNING from one to the other as Dickson's voice comes over the shot - finally CAMERA STOPS on Dickson. 
DICKSON 
So far, my judgement has been right one hundred per cent. One hundred per cent! When I start going wrong, you won't have to take any action. I'll turn the bank over to you. Then you can 
merge all you want to. I won't be the fellow to run it then. Good day, gentlemen! 
He exits scene. 
CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM as Dickson passes briskly through his outer office, stopping only to speak to Helen at her desk: 
DICKSON 
(cheerfully) 
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him. 
HELEN 
Yes, sir. 
CUT TO: 
96. INT. CLUETT'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT AND PHYLLIS 
CLUETT 
(mid-stream) 
and after dinner, we could go 
MRS. DICKSON 
(not at all angry) 
Oh! Oh, no! I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly. 
CLUETT 
(simply) 
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight! 
97. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO 
Favoring Mrs. Dickson. 
Matt crosses to the desk as Dickson is speaking. 
102. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK 
As Matt stops in front of Dickson. Matt cannot share Dickson's enthusiasm. The scene he just witnessed has taken the joy out of everything. 
MATT 
It's all right. Thanks. 
DICKSON 
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . 
(the idea pleases him) 
Not a bad thought, eh? 
He suddenly notices Matt's lack of enthusiasm. 
103. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO 
Shooting toward Dickson. 
He leans forward to look at Matt closely: 
DICKSON 
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it. 
MATT 
(feebly) 
Sure, I think it's swell. 
DICKSON 
(scrutinizing him closely, very much hurt) 
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real. 
104. CLOSE SHOT - MATT 
Shooting past Dickson. 
Matt makes an attempt to snap out of it - and answers quickly. 
MATT 
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all. 
(working up a little enthusiasm) 
Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough. 
105. MEDIUM SHOT 
DICKSON 
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married? 
MATT 
Well, I 
DICKSON 
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh? 
They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Phyllis Dickson. Both men look up as she appears in the door. 
106. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON 
As she stops in doorway. She glances fearfully, first at Matt and then at her husband, trying to sense whether Matt has said anything. She is quickly assured by Dickson's affable greeting. 
107. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Dickson comes toward her, arms extended: 
DICKSON 
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear. 
MRS. DICKSON 
Hello, darling. 
He kisses her. Then throws his arms around her for an exaggerated "teddybear" hug. Over Dickson's shoulder, Phyllis looks gratefully at Matt. 
108. CLOSE SHOT - MATT 
He returns her glance. His eyes are unable to disguise his contempt. 
109. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Dickson and Phyllis. He releases her. 
DICKSON 
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man! 
MRS. DICKSON 
(with a half-smile) 
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you. 
DICKSON 
Oooh! That has the earmarks! 
He notices Matt, still standing there, uncomfortably. 
DICKSON 
(good-naturedly) 
Are you still here? Go on - go to work! What do you think I pay you for? 
Matt exits. 
CUT TO: 
110. INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MEDIUM SHOT 
As Matt comes out and moves quickly forward as if anxious to get away from the embarrassing situation he found himself in. Helen, upon seeing him, jumps up. 
HELEN 
(excitedly) 
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job? 
MATT 
(dolefully) 
Yeah. 
111. CLOSE TWO SHOT 
She is perplexed by his unenthusiastic attitude. 
HELEN 
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death. 
MATT 
Come here. 
(he takes her aside) 
You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there. 
HELEN 
Well . . . ? 
MATT 
Well, he was making love to her. 
Helen, although she had a vague suspicion, is shocked. 
HELEN 
(after a pause) 
DICKSON 
(assuringly) 
Happy now? 
MRS. DICKSON 
(mock-pouting) 
No. 
116. MEDIUM SHOT 
He takes her in his arms and kisses her. 
DICKSON 
(tenderly) 
Poor kid, you know, I have been neglecting you. 
MRS. DICKSON 
Oh, I don't care, darling. I love you, anyway. 
A buzzer sounds again, and Dickson answers the intercom. 
DICKSON 
Yes? 
HELEN'S VOICE 
Mr. Sampson . . . 
DICKSON 
All right. Send him in. 
There is a knock on the door. Dickson moves away from his wife. He looks toward the door. 
117. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR 
Sampson, an executive in the bank, enters. Sampson goes to Dickson with some papers in his hand. He lays the papers on the desk before Dickson. 
DICKSON 
Well, Sampson, what is it? 
SAMPSON 
Here's the data on the Clyde deal. 
118. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK 
Dickson is all absorbed. 
DICKSON 
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay. 
SAMPSON 
I'm afraid he's been stalling. 
DICKSON 
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . . 
SAMPSON 
He says he can't get away in the daytime. 
DICKSON 
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off. 
SAMPSON 
Yes, sir. 
120. CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS DICKSON 
She stands by a window, listening. There is despair in her look as she hears him making arrangements for tomorrow night. Dickson's voice comes over this shot: 
DICKSON'S VOICE 
I'm sick and tired of these people dilly-dallying. People who can't make up their minds 
Mrs. Dickson's eyes close hopelessly, and she feels defeated. Again shut out from his scheme of things, she realizes he is incurable. On this picture of resignation: 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN 
INSERT: CLOCK OVER THE VAULT, reading 
CAMERA PANS DOWN to open vault. 
121. INT. VAULT - MED. SHOT 
Inside, several of the tellers are putting their cash away. One of them is just entering with his truck. 
MATT 
Everybody in? 
TELLER 
I guess so. 
MATT 
Where's Charlie? 
TELLER 
(amused) 
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it. 
AD-LIB VOICES 
Good night. Good night, Matt. 
CUT TO: 
122. OUTSIDE OF VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Cyril Cluett is standing at the bottom of a spiral staircase from which he has just descended. He stops a second and watches Matt, off scene. Cluett has gloves on, his hat in his hand, preparatory to going home. Matt does not see Charlie. 
CUT TO: 
123. OUTSIDE OF THE VAULT - CLOSE SHOT 
Matt and Helen standing near the vault door. 
HELEN 
What's keeping you? 
MATT 
Oh, Charlie again. 
HELEN 
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you? 
MATT 
(still upset) 
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff-necked, horse dollar.[6] 
HELEN 
Oh now, don't be silly. 
MATT 
(disgusted) 
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her. 
HELEN 
Now you've got me worried, dear. 
Yes. 
CLUETT 
Have you the correct time? 
DRIVER'S VOICE 
CLUETT 
12:05. Fine. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(looking out) 
What's this? 
CLUETT 
My apartment. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(mock-melodramatic) 
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home. 
CLUETT 
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(definitely) 
No. I know the answer to that one. 
(shaking her head) 
I think you'd better take me home. 
CLUETT 
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank? 
130. CLOSER SHOT ON THE TWO 
MRS. DICKSON 
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals 
(on second thought) 
I think I will have a drink. 
CLUETT 
Good for you. Come on. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
131. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CLUETT'S APT. - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Cluett and Mrs. Dickson emerge from the elevator and cross to his apartment, CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. Cluett fumbles in his pocket for the key. 
MRS. DICKSON 
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class. 
CLUETT 
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife. 
MRS. DICKSON 
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7] 
CLUETT 
A misunderstood bachelor. 
Cluett smiles. He has the door open by now and stands aside to permit her to enter. 
CUT TO: 
132. INT. CLUETT'S APARTMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
At door. Phyllis Dickson has just stepped in, and Cluett follows. He closes the door and locks it. 
CLUETT 
(mock-melodramatic) 
And now fair woman, I have you in my power. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(playing along) 
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache! 
CLUETT 
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here. 
CAMERA TRUCKS WITH THEM as he chases her into the next room. She alights on a piano bench, and runs her fingers up and down the scales. Suddenly Cluett stops. He stares off, a look of amazement in his face. Mrs. Dickson turns and follows his gaze and she, too, is startled. 
CAMERA PANS QUICKLY over to the other side of the room. Matt sits on the edge of a chair waiting for them. He rises, looks off toward Cluett and Mrs. Dickson. As he starts forward, CAMERA PANS BACK to Cluett and Phyllis. 
MRS. DICKSON 
Why, Matt! 
CLUETT 
(when he recovers from his surprise) 
What are you doing here? 
Matt enters the scene. 
MATT 
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important. 
CLUETT 
Oh, yeah? 
Cluett steps over to a bell cord and pulls it. 
MATT 
He's not here. He left at nine o'clock. He said you gave him the night off. 
Cluett wheels around, infuriated. 
CLUETT 
What do you want? 
133. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO 
Favoring Matt. 
MATT 
(uncomfortably) 
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you. 
CLUETT 
(sharply) 
I'm listening. 
MATT 
(hesitatingly) 
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it. 
(a glance toward Mrs. Dickson) 
You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone. 
As Cluett starts away: 
139. INT. OF BANK - NIGHT 
A series of quick vignettes: 
Cluett's watch, showing 12:07. 
A wall clock, showing 12:07. 
A night watchman, alerted by suspicious noise, creeping up to the vault. 
The night watchman, shot by figures in the shadows. 
A small number of men rush out of the vault, clutching money bags and toting guns. 
The night watchman, getting off a shot, before he crumples to the floor. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN 
140. INT. VAULT ROOM OF BANK - CLOSEUP ON DOOR 
The vault door, partly opened. Over the shot we hear excited murmurs. 
CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING BACK SLOWLY, until it takes in the full room. A fingerprint expert is working on the time clock for finger-print impressions. The medical examiner bends over the body of the watchman, whose face is covered with a cloth. A detective in charge of the proceedings stands around, looking very officious. 
DETECTIVE 
What do you say, Doc? 
DOCTOR 
Oh, I'd say about eight or nine hours. 
DETECTIVE 
Well, you'd better call the coroner. 
CAMERA CONTINUES TRUCKING BACK, until it passes a group of tellers and clerks in a huddle. They listen breathlessly as Oscar, the youngest of the tellers, relates his story. For the moment he is the center of attraction, and he revels in it. 
OSCAR 
(breathlessly) 
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the dead watchman at my feet. You coulda knocked me over with a pin. 
AD-LIB FROM LISTENERS 
(murmuring) 
Gee . . . Can you imagine . . . 
OSCAR 
Do you see that clock? Right there. That's where the bullet hit. When I saw that, you coulda knocked me over with a pin. 
CLERK 
Was there much blood? 
OSCAR 
Blood! 
(gesturing toward body) 
Come on over fellas. I'll show you. 
The clerks head toward the dead body, but are intercepted by the officious detective. 
DETECTIVE 
(officiously) 
Get back there . I don't want anything touched until the Inspector gets here. 
The clerks, awe-stricken, retreat. 
CHARLIE 
(running up) 
Oscar, what's the matter? 
OSCAR 
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet. 
CHARLIE 
No kidding? 
OSCAR 
No kidding. When I saw it, you coulda knocked me over with a pin. 
CHARLIE 
Where's Matt? 
OSCAR 
Matt? 
CHARLIE 
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . . 
OSCAR 
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office. 
CHARLIE 
He has? 
OSCAR 
Yeah. 
CLERK 
Say, did Matt do it? 
OSCAR 
Don't look at me. I don't know. 
TELLER 
Say, he did look kinda funny yesterday, didn't you notice it? 
OTHERS 
Yeah, he did. I noticed it too. 
OSCAR 
You coulda knocked me over with a pin! 
CUT TO: 
141. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - MATT'S FRIGHTENED FACE 
He sits in a chair. The side of his face is swollen from Cyril Cluett's punch of the night before. 
INSPECTOR'S VOICE 
(like a tri-hammer) 
Come on, come on. You might as well tell me the truth. What did you do with the money? 
MATT 
I didn't do it. I told you all I know, Inspector. 
CAMERA TRUCKS BACK revealing the other occupants of the room. The Inspector leans over Matt, firing questions at him. Two detectives are also there, one at the door, the other near Matt. Helen stands in a corner, pale and fearful, looking on. 
INSPECTOR 
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you? 
MATT 
(rises in indignation) 
I wasn't anywhere near this place 
INSPECTOR 
He feels himself cornered. The Inspector's voice comes over the shot. 
INSPECTOR'S VOICE 
Did you happen to be awake when he came in last night? 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
Yes, sir. I was having me hot mustard bath. 
INSPECTOR 
What time was it? 
172. MED. CLOSEUP - GROUP 
As Mrs. Halligan continues. 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
for the rheumatism, you know. 
INSPECTOR 
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan? 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know. 
The Inspector is getting impatient. 
INSPECTOR 
What time was it? 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
Huh? 
INSPECTOR 
What time did Matt Brown get in? 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after 
INSPECTOR 
(snappily) 
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in? 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . . 
INSPECTOR 
Was it twelve o'clock? 
173. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Dickson, Matt, and the rest of the group. Some show their amusement. Dickson and Matt, however, are serious. Mrs. Halligan's voice comes into scene. 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
No, it wasn't twelve - 'cause the Dooley sisters . . . 
INSPECTOR'S VOICE 
(interrupting her quickly) 
Was it one o'clock? 
174. CLOSE SHOT 
Inspector and Mrs. Halligan. 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause . . 
INSPECTOR 
(jumping her) 
It couldn't have been earlier? 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
No. It wasn't earlier because . . . 
INSPECTOR 
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet. 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
(firmly) 
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one. 
INSPECTOR 
(exasperated) 
There you are! 
175. MEDIUM SHOT 
Matt speaks: 
MATT 
Aw, she doesn't know what she's talking about. 
Mrs. Halligan looks at him, offended. 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
Who don't know? 
She comes toward him threateningly. 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it 
INSPECTOR 
(coming after her, takes her arm) 
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks. 
Inspector leads her to the door. On the way Mrs. Halligan continues to mumble her protest against Matt's insult. 
MRS. HALLIGAN 
For two nickels I'd knock his block off. I never told a lie in me life. 
She exits out of room. 
176. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Dickson steps closer to Matt. 
DICKSON 
(heartsick) 
Is that true, Matt? 
Inspector comes up to them now. 
INSPECTOR 
Of course it's true - and he knows it. 
DICKSON 
(tenderly) 
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night? 
MATT 
(after a pause) 
AD-LIB FROM CROWD 
We want it now! We don't want no speeches! 
182. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON 
As he addresses the crowd: 
DICKSON 
Listen to me now. It takes time. I've got seven paying tellers working just as fast as they can. If you'll all calm down, I'm making arrangements to keep the doors open until four o'clock this afternoon and you can be paid today. 
183. MEDIUM SHOT OF THE CROWD 
As they cheer their approval and return to their buddies. 
184. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Dickson starts back toward the offices, Sampson comes to meet him. 
SAMPSON 
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour. 
DICKSON 
Don't you think I know it? 
They both start walking toward Dickson's office - CAMERA TRUCKING WITH THEM. As they pass the conference room, Schultz comes out and stops Dickson. 
SCHULTZ 
We're still waiting for you, Dickson. 
Dickson looks up, studies Schultz a moment, as if trying to make up his mind whether to consult the Board of Directors or not. 
CUT TO: 
185. INT. DIRECTORS' ROOM - MED. SHOT 
The door opens and Dickson enters, followed by Schultz. They all look up. Dickson goes up to them. 
DICKSON 
Well, gentlemen, we've got about one more hour to go. You know what that means? 
186. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Dickson and the Directors. 
DICKSON 
(continuing) 
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help? 
CLARK 
(defiantly) 
What do you mean, help? 
DICKSON 
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes. 
CLARK 
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes? 
DICKSON 
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it? 
187. CLOSE SHOT 
Clark and Schultz. 
CLARK 
(this is just what he's been waiting for) 
Oh, is it? Since when? Judging from the way you've ignored us, you wouldn't think so. 
SCHULTZ 
We tried to reason with you, but you wouldn't listen to us. 
188. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Shooting toward Dickson. 
CLARK 
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them? 
DICKSON 
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob. 
189. CLOSEUP - CLARK 
CLARK 
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've 
wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president. 
190. CLOSEUP - DICKSON 
DICKSON 
(quietly - tense) 
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you? 
(his voice rising) 
Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever. 
191. WIDER ANGLE 
Taking in the others at the table. 
SCHULTZ 
You have no choice. 
DICKSON 
I haven't? I'll shut the bank first. 
CLARK 
(terrified) 
Say, you can't do that 
DICKSON 
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill. 
With which ultimatum, he crosses to the door and exits, CAMERA PANNING WITH HIM. 
CUT TO: 
192. INT. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Dickson barges out. He stops in front of the door, and looks off toward lobby. 
193. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - FULL SHOT 
Pandemonium has broken loose. Men and women are hysterical. The police battle with recalcitrant depositors in a desperate effort to maintain order. Strong men push weak ones out of the lines. Wild-eyed women jostle and scramble to get near the paying tellers. Sex and priority rights are totally disregarded. Above it all the din is deafening. Men and women are clamoring for their life's savings, ready to commit murder to retrieve their little stakes. 
CUT TO: 
194. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSEUP - DICKSON 
His face clouds. As he stands there watching the chaos, slowly the deep concern vanishes from his face and his jaw sets in grim determination. He starts toward the stairs. 
CUT TO: 
195. ENTRANCE OF BANK - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Cyril Cluett enters from outside, looking guiltily around. Then he starts forward and exits from scene. The moment he is gone, Detective #3, who followed him out, appears in the doorway and crosses in the direction taken by Cluett. 
CUT TO: 
196. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
203. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR 
As Detective #3 enters the room. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to the Inspector. 
INSPECTOR 
What did you find out, Mike? 
MIKE 
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere. 
INSPECTOR 
Never mind all that. What did you find out? 
MIKE 
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint. 
INSPECTOR 
Dude Finlay? 
MIKE 
Yes, sir. 
204. CLOSE SHOT - MATT & HELEN 
Helen slowly lifts her head from Matt's shoulder. Her eyes widen as she hears the name of Dude Finlay. Mike's voice comes over this shot. 
MIKE'S VOICE 
He stayed about half an hour, and then he came right back here. He's in his office now. 
INSPECTOR 
(slowly dawning realization) 
That's where I must have seen that guy 
Helen starts out of scene. 
205. MEDIUM SHOT 
As Helen leaves Matt's side and crosses to the Inspector and Mike. 
HELEN 
Did you say Dude Finlay? 
INSPECTOR 
Yes, why? 
HELEN 
He was in the bank yesterday. 
206. CLOSER SHOT ON THE THREE 
INSPECTOR 
(suddenly alert) 
He was here? 
HELEN 
He came to see Mr. Cluett. 
INSPECTOR 
Are you sure? 
HELEN 
Yes, sir. 
207. CLOSE SHOT - MATT 
As he listens intently to Helen and the Inspector. 
INSPECTOR'S VOICE 
Who was with him? 
HELEN'S VOICE 
Two other men. They all went into Mr. Cluett's private office. 
INSPECTOR'S VOICE 
(pleased) 
Now we're beginning to get somewhere. 
208. MED. SHOT 
Taking in all the people in the room. The Inspector turns to the detective and speaks quickly: 
INSPECTOR 
Kelly! You stay here with Brown. 
(to Tim) 
Tim, you and Mike come with me. We're going down to Cluett's office. 
He crosses to the door, followed by Tim and Mike. 
209. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR 
As the Inspector turns back and calls: 
INSPECTOR 
Oh, Kelly - call me up in Cluett's office in about five minutes. 
KELLY'S VOICE 
What'll I say? 
INSPECTOR 
I don't care what you say. Sing "Mother Machree"[8] if you want to, but call me up. 
Inspector, Tim and Mike go out. 
CUT TO: 
210. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
On the elderly lady depositor and bank guard, among the milling crowd. 
GUARD 
(above the din) 
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right. 
LADY 
(to bank guard) 
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please! 
GUARD 
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right. 
(leading the old lady - pushing a path through the crowd) 
Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please! 
CUT TO: 
211. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT DICKSON 
Seated at his desk, talking into the phone: 
DICKSON 
Good heavens, man, you're taking no chances. No, I'm perfectly willing to sign everything over to you. What more do you want? I need action. I've got to have it within the next half hour. 
(pause) 
Yeah, sure - the board of directors turned me down, but you know why. 
Well! Did Dude Finlay tell you that? 
CUT TO: 
219. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - KELLY 
KELLY 
(into phone) 
What? Dude Finlay? Sure, I got him here! You know, for a minute I didn't catch on . . .

On the Inspector. 
INSPECTOR 
(into the phone) 
Yeah. We got him here right now. Yeah, yeah. Okay Kelly, good work. Looks like 
221. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT 
He feels himself trapped. He glances around the room quickly to determine his chances to escape. He keeps edging closer to the door with his back to it. His hands sneaks down and grabs hold of the doorknob. 
Suddenly, Cluett snaps open the door and like a flash is out of the room. 
222. MED. SHOT OF ROOM 
As Cluett's figure disappears. The detectives are startled by the sudden move. 
INSPECTOR 
(hanging up receiver) 
get him! 
The detectives dash out, Inspector following.

CUT TO: 
225. SOMEWHERE IN THE CROWDED OUTER OFFICE - MEDIUM SHOT 
Inspector and detectives enter. Look around quickly. 
DETECTIVE 
(looking off, and spotting Cluett) 
There he goes! 
They rush out of scene, their hands on their guns, concealed. 
CUT TO: 
226. INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - FULL SHOT 
Metal lockers line the entire room. Cluett comes to door on other side of the room. Just as he gets there, he hears the detectives entering off scene. Quickly he changes his mind and springs into a space between a row of lockers and the wall, at the same time drawing his gun. 
Inspector and detectives enter. The Inspector and one of the detectives advance into the room cautiously, holding their guns in front of them. Kelley, the other detective, shrewdly separates from them. 
DETECTIVE 
He must be here. There's only one door. 
INSPECTOR 
All right. Find him. 
Cluett slips into a locker and closes the door behind him. They hear the noise off scene. 
INSPECTOR 
What was that noise? 
DETECTIVE 
Sounded like a locker. 
INSPECTOR 
A locker, eh? Well, search every one of them. He must be in one of 'em. 
They search the lockers one by one, until the Inspector happens upon the one with Cluett inside. He leaps out, gun drawn. 
227. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT 
From Inspector's angle. 
CLUETT 
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun. 
INSPECTOR 
(calming tone) 
All right, Jack, all right. 
228. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The detective and Inspector. The detective drops his gun, but the Inspector keeps his levelled, toward Cluett, off scene: 
INSPECTOR 
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you. 
CLUETT 
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you! 
He starts slowly forward. 
The Inspector ignores the warning. He takes a few more steps forward. 
229. CLOSEUP - CLUETT 
From Inspector's angle. 
CLUETT 
I warn you, Inspector - I'll shoot! 
He levels his gun. 
230. CLOSEUP - KELLEY 
He lifts his gun and aims for Cluett, off scene. 
231. CLOSEUP - CLUETT 
He is frightened, but desperate. He has his finger on the trigger, ready to fire. 
CLUETT 
(nervously) 
If you take another step, I'll 
A shot is heard. The gun drops out of Cluett's hand. His arm goes limp. His face screws up in pain. 
INSPECTOR 
(rushing forward to grab him - to the detectives) 
Let me see it! Let me see it! It's only his finger. Get me a towel. 
(to Cluett) 
Now take it easy, buddy. Take it easy. All we want to do is talk to you. 
CUT TO: 
232. INT. A TELLER'S CAGE MED. - CLOSE SHOT 
Shooting over the teller's shoulder. 
My wife? What's she got to do with you? 
INSPECTOR 
(out of the side of his mouth - to a detective standing next to him) 
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name. 
Dickson comes over to Cluett, grabs him by the arm. 
DICKSON 
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night? 
CLUETT 
(hysterically) 
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying. 
DICKSON 
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment? 
CLUETT 
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes. 
Dickson grabs Cluett and shakes him. 
DICKSON 
(a shriek) 
You're lying! 
243. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
INSPECTOR 
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away. 
DICKSON 
(hard) 
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute. 
CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to his desk, and calls Helen on the intercom. 
DICKSON 
Helen! 
HELEN'S VOICE 
Yes? 
DICKSON 
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone. 
There is an awkward pause while Dickson waits. He is obviously agitated. Then the phone rings. 
DICKSON 
(answering it) 
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night? 
CUT TO: 
244. INT. DICKSON HOME - CLOSEUP - MRS. DICKSON 
MRS. DICKSON 
(into phone - disconcerted) 
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night 
CUT TO: 
245. INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - DICKSON 
DICKSON 
(very sombre) 
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment? 
CUT TO: 
246. INT. DICKSON HOME - CLOSEUP - MRS. DICKSON 
MRS. DICKSON 
(into phone) 
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . . 
CUT TO: 
247. INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Favoring Dickson, but showing Cluett and the others. 
Dickson slowly puts the phone receiver down. His face is ashen. He is shaken to the core. 
CLUETT 
(miserably) 
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't 
DICKSON 
(an explosion) 
Get out, get out! 
INSPECTOR 
All right. Let's go. 
The detectives get on either side of Cluett and silently they march him out of the room. Inspector and others follow, leaving Dickson alone. When they have gone out: 
248. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON 
Left alone, he is a tragic figure. An incessant parade of disturbing thoughts tumble over each other in a hectic march across his chaotic mind. He grips his throbbing temples in an effort to crush out the torturous thought that Phyllis was involved in an intrigue with Cyril Cluett. 
CUT TO: 
249. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT 
Most of the directors seem to be weakening. O'Brien is remaining staunch to Dickson. Clark alone, holds out. 
O'BRIEN 
Clark, you're insane to hold out any longer. Now let's get some money over here and stop this run. 
AMES 
If we close our doors, our stock won't be worth a nickel. 
Meek little Ives once more tries to speak: 
IVES 
My dear friends, I 
O'BRIEN 
(interrupting) 
I'll lay you ten to one, Dickson won't give in. 
250. CLOSER SHOT 
Featuring Schultz and Clark, standing together. 
SCHULTZ 
Maybe they're right, Clark. 
CLARK 
(weakening) 
All right, I'll go and have a talk with him. 
Dickson flings the door open. Clark and the other directors are startled out of their business. Clark holds the necessary transfer papers in his hand. 
DICKSON 
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this! 
CLARK 
We've been waiting fifteen minutes 
DICKSON 
(waving papers away) 
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world. 
While he has been speaking, several of the directors have edged over to the door. They are perceptibly impressed. 
277. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK 
He has remained unmoved, staring at Dickson, as if trying to determine what kind of ruse is this. 
DICKSON'S VOICE 
Come on boys! Come on Clark! It'll do your heart good. 
CAMERA PANS WITH CLARK, as he crosses slowly to the door and looks out. 
DICKSON 
Look at that. They're shoving their hard-earned money across the counter with a ten to one chance against them. 
278. CLOSER SHOT OF GROUP 
As they edge out onto balcony overlooking scene. 
DICKSON 
If you fellas want to save this bank, get some real money over here right away. 
O'BRIEN 
(decisively) 
That's enough for me, Dickson. I'm ashamed of myself. I'll have a hundred thousand dollars over here in five minutes. 
O'Brien starts away and crosses to a phone. 
Dickson turns to the others. 
DICKSON 
Now you're talking! Ames? 
AMES 
I'm sold. 
He goes off. 
DICKSON 
All right. Schultz? 
SCHULTZ 
(only a moment's hesitation) 
This is your bank, Dickson, and I'm with you! 
DICKSON 
Ives? 
279. CLOSE SHOT - IVES 
At last he can say something. 
IVES 
(shaky voice) 
My dear friends, that's what I've been trying to say all afternoon. 
DICKSON 
Go ahead and say it. 
(turning to Clark) 
Clark, you can do twice as much as any of them. How about you? 
280. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK 
CLARK 
Oh, I don't agree with you, but if everybody's gone crazy, I'll go crazy too! 
CUT TO: 
281. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - SERIES OF CLOSEUPS 
As Clark and the other directors make their urgent phone calls. 
SCHULTZ 
(into phone) 
This is Ben Schultz talking. Send a hundred thousand cash over here to the Union National right away. 
CLARK 
(into phone) 
Send all your available cash to Union National! 
AMES 
(into phone) 
Currency - small denominations 
CLARK 
(into phone) 
in tens and twenties 
IVES 
(into phone) 
Say, I want one hundred and fifty thousand dollars over here right away. 
(listens) 
I am in my right mind. No, no, no. Not one hundred and fifty dollars. Say, listen you guys, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Yes! 
LAP DISSOLVE TO:

POLICEMAN 
Open up! 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
283. INT. BANK - AT THE DOOR 
A dozen policemen precede the entrance of a parade of uniformed guards, who carry in one hand sacks of money, their other hands clasped firmly on their guns. The crowd in the lobby stands aside, awe-stricken. 
AD-LIB FROM COPS 
Heads up 
Make way, there 
Hey, you, look out! 
Murmurs of approval are heard from the crowd. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
284. INT. BANK NEAR FRONT DOOR - MED. SHOT 
As the crowd is leaving the bank. Everyone is smiling and happy.

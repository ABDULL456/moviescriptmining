Melodramatic music swells over the Girl's butt in pink sheer underwear as she lies on the bed. 
TITLE CARDS OVER IMAGE. 
LOST IN TRANSLATION 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
POV from a car window - the colors and lights of Tokyo neon at night blur by. 
CUT TO: 
In the backseat of a Presidential limousine, BOB (late- forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, staring out the window. 
P.O.V. from car window- We see buildings covered in bright signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of whiskey in a Suntory ad... more signs, a huge TV with perky Japanese pop stars singing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT 
Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky rise. 
The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.   Eager BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT 
Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by Japanese businessmen below his shoulders. 
The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto 
the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt. 
Bob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo. 
The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long sentences in Japanese. 
TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, translates but it is only a short sentence now. 
TRANSLATOR He wants you to turn, look in camera and say the lines. 
Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it works from Japanese to English. 
BOB That's all he said? 
TRANSLATOR Yes, turn to camera. 
Bob thinks let's just get it over with. 
BOB Turn left or right? 
The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director answers her in a long excited phrase. 
TRANSLATOR Right side. And with intensity. 
BOB Is that everything? It seemed like he was saying a lot more. 
The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on. 
TRANSLATOR Like an old friend, and into the camera. 
DIRECTOR (to Bob)) Suntory Time! 
They get ready, and roll camera: 
Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera: 
BOB For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time. 
The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The translator nods. 
TRANSLATOR Could you do it slower, and with more intensity? 
BOB Okay. 
The Translator answers for him in four sentences. 
ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line. 
BOB For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT 
Shinjuku High rises sparkle. 
INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT 
Tall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city. 
A sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays. Bob sits alone with a scotch at the bar. 
Some drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over their shoulders recognize him. 
WOMAN Lip my stockings! 
He backs away, as he tries to understand her. 
WOMAN Lip them! 
She throws her leg up to him on the bed. 
BOB Huh? 
She pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands. 
BOB Oh, you want me to rip them? 
He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just snap. 
She pretends to struggle. 
WOMAN Please let me go! 
He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense. 
WOMAN Let me go! 
She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know what she wants. 
She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black. 
BOB I think you should leave. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY 
In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At another table a JAPANESE COUPLE in sunglasses chain smoke and drink coffee. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY 
Bob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his stay. 
In the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding. 
Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands out in the crowd. 
She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the elevator doors. 
Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave. 
MISS KAWASAKI Mr. Harris 
He is approached by a group of eight excited people from the commercial company there waiting to take him. 
PRESS AGENT (as they are on their way) We just got a request from Tanabe Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan! It is a big honor to be invited to his show. 
Bob feigns enthusiasm briefly. 
MISS KAWASAKI Can you stay until Friday? 
She looks at him. 
CHARLOTTE Oh. 
She lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her. 
CHARLOTTE I'll just have a beer. 
He makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days. 
BOB What about you? Why are you here? 
CHARLOTTE My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here. 
BOB How long have you been married? 
CHARLOTTE Two years. 
BOB Try twenty-five. 
CHARLOTTE You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche? 
BOB I'm thinking about it. 
CHARLOTTE 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife? 
BOB Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia. 
CHARLOTTE (amused with too much info) Oh. 
BOB What do you do? 
CHARLOTTE I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring. 
BOB What did you study? 
CHARLOTTE Philosophy. 
BOB Oh, what do you do with that? 
CHARLOTTE I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot. 
BOB It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though. 
CHARLOTTE Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too. 
BOB Thanks. 
They clink glasses. 
CHARLOTTE I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
The hotel is filled with business people. A dressed up FAMILY is going to lunch. We follow a jet-lagged Charlotte and John, as they walk down the lobby hall. 
An energetic blonde actress, KELLY, pops up to them. (She's carrying a copy of Memoirs of a Geisha.) 
CHARLOTTE No, I thought it was funny. Forget it. 
His producer comes up to them. John puts his arm around Charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine. 
PRODUCER (looks at his watch) We should get going. 
JOHN OK, I'll see you later. 
He kisses her on the cheek, and is gone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Charlotte walks into the empty hotel room. C.U. - Charlotte's feet as she clips her toenails. 
CUT TO: 
C.U. -Charlotte's hand by an ashtray, writes in a journal. 
CUT TO: 
Charlotte looks in a mirror, trying on an unfinished scarf she's knitting.  She checks the length on herself. 
CUT TO: 
Charlotte sits on the big window sill checking her messages on the phone. 
CHARLOTTE (O.S.) (voice mail recording) Hi, leave a message... 
We hear the # key as Charlotte hits it to interrupt the message. 
VOICE MAIL You have eighteen new messages. Press - 
She hits a button. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hi Charlotte, I don't know if you're in town... but I'm having a birthday party for my dog, Louise, tomorrow night, at my house around eight... 
She pushes a number to delete the message. 
MOTHER (O.S.) fabulous time in Japan!  How exciting, and hope you and your adorable husband are enjoying it...I was sitting next to Cathryn Myles last night at this dinner and she was telling me about her daughter who had this awful boyfriend and a messy break-up and how hard it is,and now she's single and wants to start a family, I'm so glad that you're settled, and not in that situation.  Anyway, call me when you have a chance, I'm trying to put Thanksgiving plans together, whether we want to go skiing or. Daddy wants to stay home and have it here, which might be easier with Lauren and the children, but let me know what your feelings are, I do hope you and John can make it. Call me, I love you. 
Charlotte pushes a button. 
VOICE MAIL (O.S.) Charlotte hangs up 
CUT TO: 
Charlotte lies on the bed, in the knit scarf and underwear She's doing a quiz in a magazine: 
"ARE YOU HAVING A MID-TWENTIES CRISIS? 
ARE YOU FATIGUED? 
DO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOUR CAREER IS GOING? 
DO YOU HATE MOST PEOPLE?" 
CUT TO: 
A quiet group of JAPANESE WOMEN are gathered around a table. Charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being instructed in Ikebana floral design. Each woman has a little vase and elegant flower cuttings. She watches as they delicately arrange the tiny flowers. 
The INSTRUCTOR hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings. Alongside the women, Charlotte tries to follow along. 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL - BATHROOM 
Charlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off. She can see mount Fuji in the distance. 
The audio tape plays on the stereo. 
DR. KENEGARD (dry & monotonous) Plato's text calls this image the "paradeigma".  So the lot is the image that is your inheritance, your place on earth, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul before you even got here- or better said, that is always and continually being selected by your soul,because time does not enter the equation of myth.- 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 
With her back to us, Charlotte looks out the big window. 
John comes up and kisses her. 
CHARLOTTE How'd it go today? 
JOHN Good...I'm tired. 
He hugs her for a moment, leaning on her. 
JOHN I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing. 
CHARLOTTE Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you. 
JOHN You wanna come? 
CHARLOTTE Sure. 
JOHN (doesn't really want her to) Ok. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT 
At a corner table Charlotte sits with John, Kelly, and DJ CLEAN, a skinny kid in a sweatshirt, on tour in Japan. 
Charlotte is bored while Kelly talks on. 
Sausalito performs in the background. 
KELLY ...My Dad was anorexic. 
CHARLOTTE (she's never heard of that) Really? 
John shoots Charlotte a look. 
KELLY (very serious) He was on the American side at the Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about their food the whole time. 
BENZO Where? 
KELLY My dad fought on the American side at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food. 
JOHN (trying) Oh, that's too bad. 
Leaving in her robe, Charlotte runs into Bob, in his robe, going to the pool. 
CHARLOTTE Oh, hi. 
BOB (awkward, but glad to run into her) Hi. Did you have a nice swim? 
CHARLOTTE Yeah. Did you get some sleep? 
BOB No, how about you? 
CHARLOTTE Not really. How long are you here for? 
BOB I'm here for the week. 
CHARLOTTE Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here? 
BOB Ok. 
CHARLOTTE See you later. 
He watches her go. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BOB'S ROOM - EVENING 
As Bob opens his door to his room, a FedEx package falls in his path. 
He opens it - large carpet swatches fall out with a note 
"BOB - WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR STUDY? I LIKE THE BURGUNDY, BUT WHATEVER YOU WANT. LOVE, L" 
He looks at them for a second, they all look the same, and why is she sending these? He puts them down. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
The elaborate chiming doorbell rings. 
Charlotte opens the door to see Bob. He's wearing an orange camouflage T-shirt. She looks at his shirt, suppressing a smile. 
CHARLOTTE You really are having a mid-life crisis. 
BOB (embarrassed) I know, it's stupid. 
He goes into the bathroom to change it. He comes out with it on inside out so it's just an orange T-shirt. 
He asks her to cut the label out for him. She goes to find some scissors. He picks up A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling audio-book box. 
BOB A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this? 
CHARLOTTE No. 
She returns with the hotel room sewing kit. 
BOB I read it, too. 
She smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors. 
Through the windshield they see the Bartender and sidekick coming with baseball bats. 
They hear a bang on the door and Charlie hops in. He makes sure she is ok and shouts something to the Driver, and they speed away. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 
Charlie, in his flashy outfit, sings "God Save the Queen" into the Karaoke mic. He rolls his r's just like Johnny Rotten. 
Charlotte laughs and loves watching Charlie. They're other friends wear the different color wigs they provide at this place. There are big bottles of beer and sake.  They are all pretty formal. Bambi tries to talk to Charlotte with a big grin, he can barely speak English. 
BAMBI How's california? 
CHARLOTTE (smiles) Good. 
BAMBI Good... I like your swimming pool. 
CHARLOTTE Thanks, you guys should come back sometime. 
BAMBI Yes. 
He tries wigs on her. He puts a light pink wig on her and beams. Bob smokes and watches. 
BAMBI Kawaii. (Kawaii means "cute") 
She smiles a lovable smile at Bambi. 
CUT TO: 
Charlie and Charlotte sings "Brass in Pocket" by The Pretenders ("you're special, so special..."), everyone is drunk now, as they all sing along at the chorus. WOMEN keep refilling the glasses. 
CUT TO: 
Mr. Valentine sings a popular slow heartfelt Japanese song that everyone knows and sings along to. Charlotte and Bob look at each other, it is very foreign, but Bob likes being there with Charlotte and her friends. 
She flips through a big binder of songs. 
CHARLOTTE What do you feel like singing, Bob? 
BOB No way. 
CUT TO: 
Bob sings "I fall to Pieces" to Charlotte. Charlie and everyone cheers for him. 
Beer pitchers are replaced. Charlie starts singing "Angle". The little room is fxlled with smoke, Charlotte makes her way to the door to get some air. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KARAOKE BAR HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Taking a break from the crowded and hot Karaoke room, Charlotte sits for a break alone on a bench in the bright hallway. It is quiet with just the muffled sound of music from the Karaoke room. She's wearing a pink geisha wig. Bob sits down next to her. 
Charlotte lights his cigarette with some crazy Japanese light- up lighter. 
She leans her head back - it's getting too heavy. 
She looks at his hands. 
EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT 
POV from cab - Tokyo neon blurs by. It looks beautiful. 
INT. CAB - NIGHT 
Charlotte looks at the neon going by. She looks over at Bob, her eyelids are too heavy for her.

INT. HOTEL HALL - NIGHT 
Bob carries a very drunk Charlotte to her room. Her purse dangling from his arm. 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

He walks down the empty hall, not wanting to leave her. 
As he goes he looks at various trays of leftover room service in the hallway. 
INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Bob comes back to his room, tripping over the carpet samples. 
He makes a phone call from bed. He's still a little drunk and thinking about his night out in Tokyo. 
BOB Lydia? 
LYDIA (O.S.) Hello, darling. 
BOB Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it. 
BOB He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was... 
LYDIA (O.S.) That sounds great  can you hold on... (talks to daughter) What Zoe? 
ZOE (O.S.) I don't want it. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Well, you have to have something for breakfast. Do you want cereal? 
ZOE (O.S.) No. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Just trying to get her to eat something...I'm glad you're having fun. 
BOB I see them every morning. 
They don't know what to say. Somehow it's too intimate having breakfast. She eats her breakfast aware of her every movement. 
C.U. - her POV of soft scrambled eggs. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 
In the distance, Bob swings on a perfect golf course. 
FADE OUT: 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Charlotte lies in bed awake. The clock says its 4 a.m. 
Finally she gives up on trying to sleep, and turns the light on. In John's old T-shirt and Ugg boots, she goes to the couch, looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate presentation left by the hotel. 
She picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a few times before. She hears something and goes over to the door. On her way, she passes her red T. Anthony suitcase overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in it. 
A HOTEL MESSAGE envelope is slipped under the door. She opens it to see a typed note from the operator: 
"From: Mr. Harris. Message: Are you awake?" 
She smiles like she's gotten a valentine. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Bob opens the door, Charlotte's standing there trying to look casual, she's happy to see him (she's put some pants on and flip flops instead of her dumb looking Ugg boots). 
She knocks into a low table, bumping her knee as she comes in. 
Bob pours some cold sake, smoothly. 
Bob and Charlotte watch La Dolce Vita with Japanese subtitles on the TV. 
BOB Hans was very attentive to you. 
CHARLOTTE I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine? 
BOB No, its easy. 
CHARLOTTE How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans? 
BOB I don't know. 
CUT TO: 
Anita Ekberg holds the kitten on T.V. 
CUT TO: 
Charlotte gets up to pour more sake. 
She picks up and looks at a prescription bottle on his night stand and reads the label : Lipitor. 
CHARLOTTE I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet... 
BOB You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing. 
CHARLOTTE But, I'm mean. 
BOB That's ok. 
CHARLOTTE And marriage, does that get easier? 
BOB It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor. 
CHARLOTTE Did that help? Did you learn anything? 
BOB We established that we have no communication. 
CHARLOTTE Oh. 
BOB We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything. 
CHARLOTTE That's too scary. 
BOB When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying. 
CHARLOTTE (getting tired) No one ever tells you that... 
BOB But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you. 
CHARLOTTE That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much. 
BOB Where'd you grow up? 
CHARLOTTE In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there. 
They are starting to get tired. 
BOB I know. 
CHARLOTTE John thinks I'm so snotty. 
BOB You are. 
CHARLOTTE I know, but that's what you like about me. 
She looks over at him. He does like her. 
CHARLOTTE Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together? 
BOB Because that would be too easy. 
They fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite sides of the bed. 
FADE OUT: 
EXT.STREET BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 
Full of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys. 
All over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob dominates the game. 
BOB It's for my daughter. 
CHARLOTTE How old is she? 
BOB Four. 
CHARLOTTE Oh, she'll love it. 
The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf. 
Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. Bob makes fun of her gracelessness. 
BOB Nice one. 
CHARLOTTE (mouth full) Fuck off. 
They have lunch, he makes her laugh. 
He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple. 
BOB What happened to your toe? 
CHARLOTTE I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day... 
She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue. 
BOB That doesn't look good. 
She enjoys the sympathy. 
CHARLOTTE It's bad isn't it? 
BOB We should get you to the doctor. 
CHARLOTTE You think so? 
BOB Yeah, look at that thing. 
She smiles at him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DAIKANYAMA STREET - DAY 
Bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in. He tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a first aid cross, but the DRIVER doesn't understand. Charlotte is enjoying Bob's effort. 
Finally he finds a Park Hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel number. 
BOB How do you say "hospital" in Japanese? 
RECEPTION (O.S.) Excuse me? 
BOB Hospital? 
RECEPTION (O.S.) One moment, please. 
She transfers call, it rings. 
CONCIERGE (O.S.) Concierge desk, may I help you? 
CHARLOTTE Is that for me? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARK HYATT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Bob and Charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel, they stroll in casually, she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in her arm. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL SPA BATH - EVENING 
Bob reclines in the big Japanese wooden tub, steam rises as he is turning red. His phone rings. He dries his hands quickly to reach it before it stops ringing. 
BOB Hello? 
LYDIA (O.S.) Bob? 
BOB Hi, Lydia. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Is this a bad time? 
BOB Uh, no. 
LYDIA (O.S.) (O.S.) It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy. 
BOB Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost. 
LYDIA (O.S.) It's just carpet. 
BOB That's not what I'm talking about. 
LYDIA (O.S.) What are you talking about? 
BOB I don't know. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Is there anything I can do? 
BOB I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better. 
LYDIA (O.S.) What? 
BOB You know, eat healthier. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Alright? 
BOB Not all that pasta. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Fine. 
BOB Like Japanese food. 
LYDIA (O.S.) (sarcastic) Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday. 
BOB Oh, come on. 
LYDIA (O.S.) I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok? 
BOB Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye. 
BOB Do you know where we are? 
CHARLOTTE No. 
She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake "one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee. 
CHARLOTTE Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs... 
They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street. 
FADE OUT: 
INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY - NIGHT 
As they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, the blonde actress, singing to them. 
She stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "Nobody Does It Better" with all her heart. 
Bob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying to be invisible). 
FADE IN: 
INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
Charlotte lies in bed. She picks up a photo next to the bed as she dials the phone.- 
The picture is of her and John on their honeymoon. The phone answers - it's a weird Japanese recording. 
CHARLOTTE Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I'm not sure...I'm going to go to Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you when I get back. Hope it's going good... I love you, bye. 
INT. TRAIN - DAY 
Charlotte watches the Japanese countryside go by out her window. 
EXT. KYOTO - DAY 
Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small figure in the landscape. 
She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono walk under a parasol with their family. 
Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them. 
Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up. 
CUT TO: 
She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves. 
At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine. 
At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch. 
CUT TO: 
INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY 
Exciting music plays as the talk/game show starts. 
Bob, in an elegant suit, goes out to meet the HOST. 
EXT. TOKYO STREETS - DAY 
Bob is walking down the crowded street looking for Charlotte, when his cell phone rings. 
BOB Hello? 
LYDIA (O.S.) Hello, Bob, it's me. 
BOB (can't hear) Hello? 
LYDIA (O.S.) It's Lydia, your wife. 
BOB I couldn't hear you. How are you? 
LYDIA (sighs) Fine. Is it going ok? 
BOB It's ok. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Do you want to- (garbled) 
BOB What? 
LYDIA (O.S.) Do you want to talk to  Zoe? 
BOB Yeah. 
LYDIA (O.S.) (calls in background) Zoe, come say hello to your father... 
A little girl's voice shouts "No!" in the background. 
LYDIA (O.S.) I guess she's busy. 
BOB That's ok. 
LYDIA (O.S.) When are you coming home? 
BOB Tomorrow. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget. 
BOB Ok. 
In the background the daughter calls for her Mommy over and over and a dog starts barking. 
LYDIA (O.S.) Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon. 
BOB Bye. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ICHICAN SUSHI RESTAURANT - DAY 
Charlotte, with sunglasses on, leans against the wall as Bob approaches. 
CHARLOTTE You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that? 
BOB No, we'll find something around here. 
She goes with him. 
BOB I'm sorry. 
CHARLOTTE That lunch was the worst, huh. 
He laughs. 
She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel slippers. 
CHARLOTTE When are you leaving? 
BOB Tomorrow. 
CHARLOTTE (friendly) I'm going to miss you. 
BOB That's what you said the other night. 
CHARLOTTE Well, I mean it more now. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT 
and Charlotte, still in their pajamas, sit at their usual spot at the bar, with the bartender, drinking cold sake. She lights two cigarettes and passes one to him. 
A NEW JAZZ BAND is now playing. The SINGER is full of enthusiasm as they start their stint at the Park Hyatt. 
NEW SINGER Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and we're thrilled to be joining you this week, here at the NY bar in Shinjuku. 
He sings "Where or When" with all his heart. 
Now, old-timers there, Bob and Charlotte look at each other and chuckle. 
SINGER Jt seems we stood and talked like this before,   we looked at  each other in  the same way thenr   but I cant remember where or when... 
Bob and Charlotte sit there together. 
BOB I don't want to go back tomorrow. 
CHARLOTTE I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime. 
BOB Why can't it last? 
CHARLOTTE I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band. 
(alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality changes things...and we can't stay here forever) 
He looks over at her. 
The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there together, the view sparkling. 
SINGER (O.C.) Somethings  that happen for the first time,   seem to be happening again and so it  seems we have met before, and laughed before,   and loved before,   but who knows where or when... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Bob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator. 
CHARLOTTE 
BOB That'd be great. 
CHARLOTT E Ok, see you in a second. 
A member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little silver tray. 
Miss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do with them and has to carry them. 
The Executive Woman from the bar walks up to him. He hangs up the phone. 
BOB 0hr hi. 
EXEC WOMAN You're leaving? 
She looks at him like, we could have had some fun. 
BOB Yeah, yeah, I'm going. 
He sees Charlotte come out of the elevator. 
BOB I have to go, thanks, bye. 
He rushes over to Charlotte. She looks at his bag. 
CHARLOTTE Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave? 
BOB Yes, no. 
She hands him his jacket. 
BOB Thanks. 
She waits for him to say something more. He wants to tell her he loves her, that she should come with him. 
CHARLOTTE That's it? 
The concierge tells him his car is here. 
CHARLOTTE You're leaving right now? 
BOB Yes. 
CHARLOTTE Well... have a good flight. 
BOB Thanks. 
CHARLOTTE (hurt) Ok, bye. 
She walks away. 
A hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if he had a pleasant stay. Charlotte gets in the elevator to go out, the doors close on her back. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY 
It's bright outside the main entrance. A presidential pulls up and the automatic door opens. Bob squints as the Bellboy in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk.

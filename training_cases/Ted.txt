EXT. SPACE - X 
As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States. The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago. And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes. To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever. 
EXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston. 
We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits. That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids. 
Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled, and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball- throwing kids points at the sled kid. 
KID #1 Hey, Greenbaum! 
GREENBAUM Uh oh. 
KID #1 It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know what I'm gonna get him? 
GREENBAUM W...what? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KID #1 My fist in your fuckin' face! 
GREENBAUM Why would Jesus want that? 
KID #2 Get him! 
The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking) approaches the melee. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits. Little John Bennett. That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends. 
JOHN Hey guys, can I play? 
The kids all look at him. 
KID #1/#2/#3 Get outta here! / Get outta here, Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett! 
The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John. 
GREENBAUM Yeah, Bennett, get outta here! 
The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly walks back toward his house. 
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER 
NARRATOR (V.O.) John longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own. And he knew that if he ever found that friend, he would never let him go. 
John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands, looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee. 
INT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
A LITTLE GIRL opens a present as her parents look on, smiling. Inside is a My Little Pony. She smiles with delight. 
INT. ANOTHER SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
A LITTLE BOY opens a present as HIS PARENTS look on, smiling. Inside is a G.I. Joe Hovercraft. The boy is overjoyed. 
INT. A THIRD SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
ANOTHER LITTLE BOY opens a present as his parents look on, smiling. Inside is a "Darth Vader head" action figure case. The boy opens it up, revealing that it's full of "Star Wars" action figures. The boy jumps around ecstatically. 
EXT./ESTAB. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
INT. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - SAME 
NARRATOR (V.O.) And for little John Bennett, Christmas Day brought a very special new arrival. 
John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear. The boy holds it with delight. 
JOHN Wow! 
HIS MOM AND DAD hug him. 
JOHN'S DAD I guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh? 
JOHN'S MOM (KISSING HIM) Merry Christmas, John. 
JOHN Forever and ever? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TEDDY Sounds good to me. 
A huge grin spreads across John's face. He gets up, runs to Teddy and hugs him. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) John was just about the happiest boy in the world. And he couldn't wait to tell everyone the good news. 
INT. KITCHEN - SHORTLY AFTER 
John's Dad sits at the breakfast table, reading the paper as John's Mom prepares eggs and bacon, putting it on their plates. JOHN'S MOM Well, I think we had a wonderful Christmas this year. 
JOHN'S DAD One of the best. (SLYLY) And I particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night. 
John runs into the kitchen. 
JOHN Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's alive! 
John's Mom and Dad look at each other and smile. JOHN'S MOM (PLAYING ALONG) Really, sweetie? Well, that's exciting. 
JOHN No mom, he's alive! For real! Look! 
Teddy walks in and stands next to John. 
TEDDY Merry Christmas, everybody! 
John's Dad scrambles to his feet, knocking plates off the table. John's mom screams. 
JOHN'S DAD Jesus H. Fuck! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TEDDY Let's all be best friends! 
JOHN'S MOM Oh my god... 
JOHN'S DAD John, get away from that thing! Come over here, right now! 
JOHN BUT DAD-- 
JOHN'S DAD GET OVER HERE! 
John reluctantly walks over to his dad, who grabs him and protectively pulls him aside. 
JOHN'S DAD (CONT'D) Helen, get my gun. 
JOHN Dad, no! 
TEDDY Is it a hugging gun? 
JOHN'S DAD Helen, get my gun, and call the police! 
TEDDY I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn't mean to scare anybody. I just wanted John and I to be friends. JOHN Yeah, Dad! I made a wish last night that Teddy was alive, and my wish came true! 
JOHN'S MOM (ASTONISHED WHISPER) My god, Steve... it's a miracle. A Christmas miracle. 
They stare at Teddy for a beat. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Well, it wasn't long before the story of John's little miracle was sweeping the nation. 
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) 
We see an 80's NEWSCASTER behind the news desk. A graphic of the bear is over his left shoulder. 
NEWSCASTER Out of a Boston suburb comes what is, without a doubt, the most incredible story in the history of broadcast news... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DIFFERENT NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) 
We see an 80's FEMALE NEWSCASTER. A graphic of the bear is over her left shoulder. FEMALE NEWSCASTER ...young boy's stuffed animal has magically come to life for as yet unknown reasons. Scientists are stumped as to how... 
AA18 INT. ANOTHER NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) AA18 
We see a `70S SOUTHERN NEWSCASTER with a CHYRON that says "ACTION NEWS GEORGIA". He points manically at the graphic of the bear above his left shoulder. 
SOUTHERN NEWSCASTER Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did! 
INT. JAPANESE NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) A MALE JAPANESE NEWSCASTER and FEMALE JAPANESE NEWSCASTER sit behind the desk. Between them, at the top of the screen, is a picture of the bear. 
FEMALE NEWSCASTER (SPEAKS JAPANESE FOR A FEW MOMENTS) 
The male newscaster turns sharply to her. 
MALE NEWSCASTER (ADDRESSES HER ANGRILY IN JAPANESE) 
JOHN I will, sir. Thank you. I won't let you down, Goose. 
THOMAS What? 
JOHN Top Gun. 
THOMAS So? 
JOHN Tom Skerritt. 
THOMAS Oh. 
John exits. 
INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR FRONT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
John emerges from Thomas' office, and walks out into the front desk area. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and a little bruised. 
GUY There you go, here's your key and rental agreement, and a complimentary map of Boston. Thanks for choosing Liberty, drive safely. 
HUSBAND/WIFE Thank you./Thanks so much. 
The couple exits. Guy turns to face John. 
GUY Hey, heard you got busted. 
JOHN Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened? 
GUY I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted last night, and my phone says I texted somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same person saying thanks. 
JOHN And you don't remember it? 
GUY No. Same as last time. JOHN It... it just seems gay, doesn't it? 
GUY I don't know. Maybe, yeah. 
JOHN Do you think you're part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld? Like one of those gay beat-up clubs? 
GUY I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't remember any of it, I was so fucked up. I might be gay, I don't know. You mind covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go lay down in the john. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Guy starts to leave, when ALIX, a foreign guy with a vague European accent, long dark hair, and a great tan walks up. 
ALIX Hey you buddies. Where's it hanging? 
GUY/JOHN Hey Alix. / Hey, how was the club last night? 
ALIX Ah, I didn't get in because the bouncer was doucheface, but I made friends in the line. 
GUY Oh, well, that's good I guess. 
We see TANYA, an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter from the back with a set of keys. 
TANYA Hi you guys. 
Over the following, Tanya puts the keys away, walks over to her station and sits. 
ALIX You look so pretty today. 
TANYA Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this morning. 
ALIX I can tell, you are less fat than you have been. 
JOHN Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant? Like something where the napkins are cloth? 
GUY For what? 
JOHN Lori and I have been dating four years tomorrow, and I wanted to take her someplace nice. 
TANYA Oh wow, congratulations, John. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GUY You guys`ve been goin' out for four years? 
JOHN Yeah. 
GUY THAT'S IN-- (HIGH-PITCHED) --saaaane, my longest relationship was like six months, and then she farted in her sleep. I'm like, I am outta here, man. Was gone before she woke up. 
JOHN Wow, you're... not very tolerant, huh. GUY Lori ever fart in front of you? 
JOHN Yes. 
TED Hey, Lori. 
John gets up and gives Lori a kiss. 
LORI Ooh. I think you just got me stoned. 
JOHN (RE: GROCERIES) What do we got there? 
LORI Turkey burgers. 
TED Oh. Okay. Are we having homos over for dinner or something? 
LORI (WISEASS) No, just you homos. 
TED/JOHN Whoa!!! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED She's funny, John. You got yourself a regular Toni Collette. 
LORI Wait, who's that? Is that good? 
JOHN She's a comedienne. 
LORI Oh nice. Is she pretty? 
JOHN She's as pretty as she is funny. How was work? LORI Good. 
JOHN How's your dickhead boss? 
LORI Rex is fine. He only hit on me once today, so that's good. 
JOHN I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia. 
LORI He's harmless, I can handle it. 
TED Hey Johnny, while you're up, grab me a beer, huh? 
JOHN (crossing to fridge) Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis? 
TED Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now. 
We see Lori roll her eyes. She's heard this before. 
LORI Jesus. 
JOHN Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski? 
LORI Y'know, I think I might also have a Martina Navra-ti-brewski. 
JOHN/TED Ohhhh, that doesn't work!/Come on, don't ruin it, yeah, that doesn't work. 
LORI Bullshit, what do you mean? 
JOHN It doesn't work, the name has to have a "ski" at the end of it. You just put "brewski" on the end of Martina Navratolova. 
LORI I thought we were just doing funny names. 
TED No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end. Otherwise where's the challenge? If there's no "ski" at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying nonsense. 
EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
It's raining, with an occasional roll of thunder. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME 
Lori lies in bed holding an iPad, reading a gossip news site, with the TV on. John comes out of the bathroom, and cozies up next to her. 
LORI (OFF IPAD) Oh, look, they found those missing hikers. 
JOHN They did? What happened? 
LORI It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I'd chew it off to get you free. 
LORI (SWEETLY) You would? 
JOHN I sure would. (BEAT) Is that cannibalism? 
LORI No, I think it's only cannibalism if you swallow. JOHN Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow. 
He puts it on his wrist. 
LORI I remember you liked it when you saw Tom Brady wearing one in GQ. 
JOHN Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it! She reacts a bit to this. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Y'know, Lori... (INDICATING BOX) Someday, there's gonna be a ring in there. But I wanna wait `til I can get you something really special, y'know? I just don't have the money right now. 
LORI John, I don't need the Hope diamond, all I want is-- 
JOHN I know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti. LORI Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted. 
JOHN Oh, Jesus, here we go-- 
LORI John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives. 
JOHN Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LORI Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten years from now. 
JOHN (rolling his eyes with a SIGH) Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. Look, he's been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He's the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out. 
LORI Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you're not eight. You're thirty-five. And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. You have me. And I love you. 
JOHN I love you, too. You know that. 
LORI Look, I've put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens. 
JOHN Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards. 
She laughs. So does he. 
LORI And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN I can do it all with one hand. 
LORI Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand. 
JOHN I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller. 
LORI We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other. 
They both laugh hard. 
JOHN Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship. 
LORI (SIGH) We can't put the real conversation off forever, John. 
JOHN I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes. 
EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Their car pulls up. They start to get out. 
JOHN (NOTICING) Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere. Can you call it? 
Lori punches his number on her cellphone. After a beat, we hear The Imperial March from "The Empire Strikes Back." 
LORI That's my ringtone? 
JOHN (laughs, embarrassed) Oh, yeah... 
LORI What is it? It sounds negative. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN No, it's from The Notebook. 
He reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she goes inside. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (STRAINING) This is gonna take some doin'. 
LORI All right, well I'll see you upstairs. 
He continues digging for the phone, as she walks inside. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Lori walks toward the apartment, but stops as she hears loud music coming from inside. She approaches the door cautiously and opens it, revealing... 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Lori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women. They're watching "Romancing the Stone," which plays very loudly on the TV. 
LORI What the hell is all this?! 
TED Lori! Hey, you're home early! The ladies and I were just watching "Romancing the Stone." Got it on Blu- Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of the Nile," but I don't know that we'll end up watchin' that one. 
LORI No! Oh my god! 
JOHN Tell me when you get it! 
LORI AAAA, I got some on my thumb! 
JOHN AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- handed! 
LORI Shit! 
JOHN I'll get the next one, okay? 
INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - DAY 
TED She's makin' you do it, isn't she? JOHN (giving up the bullshit) Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time! 
TED What about... thunder buddies for life, Johnny? 
JOHN I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted. 
TED (SIGH) I know you do, Johnny. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise. 
TED And we'll hang out a lot, right? 
JOHN Fuck, all the time. 
TED (arms wide for a hug) Bring it over here. 
John hugs Ted. Ted hugs him back. We hear a squeak, and a high-pitched recorded voice saying "I wuv you." John and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably. TED (CONT'D) JOHN That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no, I know- that doesn't mean-- I'm not - gay. 
JOHN We've got to get you a job. 
EXT./ ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 
EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME 
John and Ted head toward the store. Ted is dressed in a coat and tie, and looks very uncomfortable. 
TED I look stupid. 
JOHN No, you don't. You look dapper. 
TED I look like Snuggles' accountant. 
They pause as John straightens Ted's tie. 
JOHN Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment. 
TED I don't wanna work at a grocery store. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN Well, you have no skills. 
TED I told you, I can totally be a lawyer. 
JOHN As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school. 
TED I'm a special case. I'm a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's give him a job and maybe he'll give us a few laughs," but then they're surprised at what a stellar performance I'm turnin' in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case. 
JOHN Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after. 
John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed. 
TED And if I don't get the job will we still smoke that pot? 
JOHN Probably, yes. 
TED (patting John on the leg) Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach. 
INT. GROCERY STORE MANAGER'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER 
Ted sits opposite FRANK, the grocery store manager. We see his name and title on a desk nameplate. Frank sits at the desk, staring at Ted. 
FRANK So. You think you got what it takes? 
TED Nope. 
FRANK (a beat, then) No one's ever talked to me like that before. You're hired. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Shit. 
EXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON 
John sits on the couch, putting his tie on as he watches TV. Lori comes over and sits down next to him. 
LORI Hey there. 
JOHN Hey. 
LORI Listen... I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn't easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our relationship. 
JOHN Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him. 
She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie. 
LORI Y'know, I don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes... 
JOHN (guiding her down onto the COUCH) Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need one. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
She laughs, and they kiss. 
LORI You know what my favorite thing about you is? After four years, you can still surprise me. To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier... I dunno, I bet you most guys couldn't do it. 
JOHN Most guys don't have you to motivate `em. 
LORI I'm sorry if I was pushy about it... 
JOHN No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It's `cause you're... inevitable. 
LORI (huh?) Inevitable. Well, that's... romantic? I think? 
JOHN No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're inevitable. 
LORI That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend. JOHN But do you get what I'm saying? 
LORI Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same way about you. 
They kiss. 
LORI (CONT'D) (smiling coyly, as she NOTICES) Ooh. Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me? 
John pulls the Flash Gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her. She cracks up. 
EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY 
INT. GROCERY STORE - SAME 
Ted is at his station, finishing checking out a customer. 
TED Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries. 
The customer exits. Ted sighs with boredom. He turns to ELLEN, the large African-American woman at the next station. 
TED (CONT'D) Hey Ellen? ELLEN Yeah? 
TED Who's that over there? 
ANGLE ON A VERY ATTRACTIVE blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away (This is TAMI-LYNN). 
ELLEN That's the new bag girl. I don't know her name, but she seems cute. 
TED Yeah. Very cute. You know what I'd like to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty Fozzie. Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side, then from the other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs and shakes her head "no." 
TED (CONT'D) (TO HIMSELF) Okay, so that's where we'll draw the line. 
EXT. ESTAB./ LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - DAY 
INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - SAME 
John sits at his workstation, playing a TBD video game on his iPhone. Tanya approaches. 
TANYA Hey. How you holding up? 
JOHN Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used to things, that's all. 
TANYA It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went through something like this with my last boyfriend. JOHN Really? 
TANYA Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it. 
JOHN Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost our furry little guy. 
TANYA Yeah. 
John's phone rings the theme from "Knight Rider." He sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open- mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a bra on his head. John picks up. 
JOHN Hey, Ted. 
TED (V.O.) Johnny. What are you doin'? You wanna come over and catch a buzz? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED It's called Kennedy's Head. It's actually pretty mellow. 
JOHN That doesn't sound very mellow. 
TED No, it's-- it makes you cerebral. Like Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That's what it refers to. Decisions under pressure. Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it up. 
John takes a hit off the bong, then glances around. 
JOHN Y'know, this place looks great. 
TED Yeah, it's all Ikea. Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars. 
JOHN How are the neighbors? 
TED There's an Asian family next door, but they don't have a gong or nothin', so it's fine. 
JOHN That's lucky. 
TED How's work? JOHN Sucks. 
TED Ah. 
JOHN You? 
TED It's actualy not bad. Met a girl. She's a bagger. 
JOHN No way, that's awesome. We should double date, you, me Lori and, what's her name? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED White trash name. Guess. 
JOHN Uh, Mandy? 
TED Nope. 
JOHN Madison? 
TED Nope. 
JOHN Britney, Tiffany, Candice? TED Nope. 
JOHN Don't fuck with me on this. I know this shit. 
TED I know you do, and I am not fucking with you. 
JOHN Okay, Brandi, Heather, Channing, Breanna, Amber, Sabrina, Melody, Dakota, Sierra, Bambi, Crystal, Samantha, Autumn, Ruby, Taylor, Tara, Tamra, Tami, Lauren, Charlene, Chantel, Courtney, Misty, Jenna, Krista, Mindy, Noelle, Shelby, Trina, Reba, Cassandra, Nikki, Kelsey, Shawna, Jolene, Earline, Claudine, Savannah, Kasey, Dolly, Kendra, Carla, Chloe, Devon, Emmylou, Becky? 
TED Nope. 
JOHN Okay, was it any one of those names with a Lynn after it? 
TED Yep. 
JOHN Okay. Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Tami-Lynn. 
JOHN Fuck! 
EXT. ESTAB. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
INT. RESTAURANT - SAME 
John, Ted, Lori and Ted's dolled-up and sort of trashy date Tami-Lynn (the bag girl from the grocery store) eat dinner. 
TAMI-LYNN See, I was all pissed off `cause me and my friend Danielle were supposed to go skydiving last year, but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn't go and I was all upset, but then she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up getting to go skydiving, and it was so scary but it was so much fun. 
JOHN Hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then. 
TAMI-LYNN I guess god wanted me to go skydiving, y'know? 
LORI Jesus. TAMI-LYNN Or Jesus, yeah, but whatever. 
TED Hey, isn't this great? The four of us here, having dinner together? Lori, how've you been? Haven't seen you in forever. 
LORI Um, I've been good. Not much going on. My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something. 
JOHN (proud, to Tami-Lynn) Lori's a senior VP at a big PR firm. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LORI It's not that big a deal. 
JOHN (THROWN) W... What? 
LORI I'm just... I'm done. This isn't gonna work. We're in two different places. JOHN Lori, look, I know-- 
LORI You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously. 
JOHN Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did that for you-- for us! And it wasn't easy. 
LORI Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN Okay, look. I've been getting stoned too much. I know that. I've been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance. 
LORI (BEAT) I need a man, John. Not a boy with a teddy bear. 
JOHN I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart. 
Lori can't help but let a small laugh escape. She softens a bit... 
LORI John... this really is your last chance. I can't do this anymore. 
JOHN You won't have to. Trust me. I love you. 
He kisses her. 
LORI (BEAT) Okay. JOHN Aw, sweetie, I love you so much! You won't be sorry, I swear. 
She smiles at him, then: 
LORI Did you really just fart? 
JOHN Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my hand. 
LORI Oh. Wonder where it'll hit first. 
WIDER ANGLE on the restaurant. For a moment, nothing happens. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a couple other men and women) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions. 
GUY AT TABLE (FURIOUS) Who did this to us?! 
GUY #2 AT TABLE (FURIOUS) God dammit! I'm here on business! 
EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY 
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at Ellen's register. 
FRANK What the hell? 
He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and notices him. 
GUY IN LINE Hey, dude, you think you could open more than one register? There's like a thousand people here! 
FRANK There's supposed to be three registers open, for god's sake! 
He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's counter and produce area, then walk into the back storeroom. 
INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away, with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock and horror. 
INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER 
Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted. 
FRANK You had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public. 
TED Yes. 
FRANK (BEAT) That took guts. We need guts. I'm promoting you. TED Oh. 
EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook shot into a trash can. He takes the shot: 
TED Kareem! 
The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters. 
TED (CONT'D) You suck, Kareem. We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and looks around. There appears to be no one in the darkness. 
TED (CONT'D) Hello? 
No answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb. 
REX Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta just clear the air here a little. I... just want you to know that... I mean, yeah, I'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and whatnot, but... look man, I do that with everybody at the office! I'm just a kook! I have no designs on your girlfriend. We work together, and that's it. I think you're a great guy and she's very lucky. 
John is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear this. 
JOHN Well... that's good to hear. 
REX Well, that's how it is, so...there we go. 
JOHN Okay. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
REX Yeah. 
They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's nut. John's phone rings the "Knight Rider" theme. John answers it. 
JOHN Hey, Ted. 
INTERCUT PERIODICALLY BETWEEN JOHN AND TED, who stands in the foreground with one finger in his ear. In the background, we see a party in full swing. 
TED (V.O.) Johnny! You gotta get over here, man! JOHN Why? What's going on? 
TED (V.O.) I'm havin' a little impromptu thing with some people, and John... Sam Jones is here. 
JOHN What?! 
TED (V.O.) Sam Jones. Flash fucking Gordon. Is here. 
JOHN Holy shit! How? 
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
TED Remember I said, my buddy's cousin is friends with Sam Jones? My buddy's in town with his cousin and who's with `em? Sam Jones!! 
INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
TED (V.O.) Sam Jones is here, and John... (softly, into phone) ...his hair is parted down the middle. 
JOHN (EQUALLY SOFTLY) Just like in the movie. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Get over here. 
JOHN Fuck! I can't... I'm with Lori. I'm already on probation here. 
John looks down at the main area of the party, and sees Lori happily chatting with her co-workers. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (AGONIZED) I just... I can't. 
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS TED John. There are moments in a man's life: Nathan Hale, "I regret that I have but one life to give for my country." Alan Hale, "Yes, I accept the role of the Skipper on `Gilligan's Island.'" 
INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
TED (V.O.) John, this is your Alan Hale moment. For god's sake, come share this with me. 
JOHN (beat, then:) I'm coming. 
John hangs up. JOHN (CONT'D) Rex. I gotta go. I'll be back in thirty minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out. She absolutely cannot know I was gone. If you can cover for me... we're cool on all that other stuff. 
REX I got your back, my friend. Been there. She'll never know. 
JOHN This is one man to another. I don't really know you, but I'm trusting you. As a man. This is serious. Can I trust you? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
REX Dude. One man to another. I got you on this. 
JOHN (RELAXING SOMEWHAT) Okay. Thank you. 
John races O.S.... and Rex raises his scotch glass to his mouth. 
REX (SMILING) I'm gonna make traditional to your girlfriend. And then fuck her in the ass. All right. We have a game plan. 
EXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
The "Football Fight" music from "Flash Gordon" starts playing, as John bolts O.S. 
EXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
John sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway. He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts the car, and backs out. 
EXT. BOSTON (VARIOUS) - NIGHT 
CUT TO various shots of John racing through the city on his way to Ted's. Finally, he pulls up to Ted's apartment. 
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
John throws open the door. The place is as lively as it can be. The party is packed with people, including Alix and Tanya, John's co-workers from Liberty. There are also a large number of booze-swilling guys and hot chicks. Ted runs up, wearing a blazer. 
TED Johnny! Thank Christ you made it! 
JOHN Yeah--wait, whaddaya mean? 
TED Anybody can come. 
JOHN Of course. 
TED Mormons are welcome. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN Well yeah--why wouldn't they be? 
TED Exactly, that's what I'm saying. 
JOHN But why even bring that up-- 
TED You don't bring it up. You just let `em in. 
JOHN Yeah, but why mention it? 
TED No one will. 
JOHN So why are we talking about it? 
TED You're talkin' about it, I'm just sayin' let `em in. 
JOHN Yes, let `em in. 
TED Exactly. 
JOHN Right. 
TED Good. 
JOHN Okay. 
TED No Catholics, though. 
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - SAME 
Ted stands opposite a group of party guests who sit on the couch. He holds a knife. 
TED No see, I can do this. 
GUY #1 Shut up. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED My teddy bear biology gives me superhuman reflexes. 
GUY #2 Let him try it, man. 
GUY #1 Fuck it, all right. 
Guy #1 puts his hand down on the coffee table and Ted starts doing the knife trick from "Aliens". He gets it right for a few seconds, then stabs the guy right through the hand. The guy screams in pain. 
TED Well, you never shoulda trusted me, I'm on drugs! 
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER 
John stands with a pair of fake bear ears on his head, doing an impression of Ted as a small group of partygoers (Ted included) watches, laughing hysterically. 
JOHN (AS TED) Hey Johnny, I just had a great idea-- let's go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass! 
TED Oh god, that was a fun day. 
JOHN (AS TED) Johnny, you gotta get over here man, I just tried this DMT all the kids are talkin' about, and I'm in trouble! I think I got sucked inside my chair! 
TED I do not sound that much like Peter Griffin. 
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Ted sits on the couch drawing a pair of Garfield eyes on a topless girl. Below the eyes he has drawn the muzzle and the mouth, and above them the ears. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED See? There. Proof. Garfield's eyes look like a pair of tits. 
TAMI-LYNN Okay, you were right. 
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Ted stands by the TV, singing a karaoke version of "I Only Want to be with You" by Hootie and the Blowfish. 
TED Okay, Johnny, c'mon up here and do this with me! JOHN No no. 
TED Come on! 
JOHN No, I don't sing in front of people! 
JOHN I gotta-- I gotta go! Shit! 
John scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door. 
INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 
John opens the door and runs down the hall. He runs partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs. They stare at each other for a beat. She looks as hurt, angry, and betrayed as a woman can be. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN Lori... I... 
He throws up all over the floor. 
EXT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Lori storms out into the street. After a beat, John runs out after her. 
JOHN Lori! Lori wait! 
She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears. JOHN (CONT'D) I'm sorry! I messed up! I-- 
LORI I want you out of the apartment... tonight. Gimme my car keys. 
JOHN Can I please just explain-- 
LORI No. 
JOHN I was gonna-- 
LORI I have given up a big chunk of my life for you. 
JOHN I was gonna stop in for like five minutes, and then Flash Gordon-- 
LORI Just give me my keys, John! 
He reluctantly hands her her keys. She turns and walks toward her car. 
JOHN Lori... please. I love you. 
She gets in the car and drives away with a screech. Angle on Ted, who is walking out the door. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Johnny, come on upstairs. Tami-Lynn's gonna make some RC Cola from scratch. 
JOHN Fuck you! I don't want to talk to you! 
TED What? 
JOHN Do you know what just happened? Do you have any clue? My life just ended. 
TED Oh come on, she'll go home, watch Bridget Jones' Somethin' Asshole, cry a little bit, she'll be fine, you'll talk to her tomorrow. 
JOHN (EXPLODING) Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?! 
Ted pauses, realizing John is serious. 
TED Well... `course I do, Johnny. Thunder buddies for life. 
JOHN Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life. 
TED Johnny, I'm... I'm sorry. 
JOHN I just... I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can't see you anymore. 
John turns and walks away. 
TED Johnny, wait! Hey, listen! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Ted pushes his own stomach in. We hear his soundbox squeak out the words "I wuv you." John does not turn around. Ted looks after him, then slowly lowers his head sadly. He sits down on the sidewalk, dazed and defeated. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MONTAGE: SET TO MUSIC - SONG TBD 
EXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT 
John pulls up in his car, and sadly goes inside. 
INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT John sits on the bed and turns on the TV. He flips through the channels, seeing various clips of shows. Eventually, he shuts off the TV. He opens his wallet, and takes out a picture of Lori. He looks at it sadly. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MINI GOLF COURSE - NIGHT 
REX Look, I'm an asshole. I know that. It worked for me in high school, and it's been like a reflex ever since. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REX (CONT'D) (sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is you have a fun, casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be something more than a jerk. Besides, you're a huge catch and it's about time somebody treated you that way. 
LORI Fine... I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night. 
REX Great. Pick you up at seven? 
EXT./ ESTAB. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT It's raining outside. 
INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - SAME 
John sulks on the bed, leafing through a Tintin comic book. There's a knock at the door. 
JOHN Who is it? 
TED Johnny, it's me. 
JOHN Go away. 
TED Johnny, open the door, please. I wanna talk. 
John ignores him. A few beats go by, then the window slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing on the floor, soaked. 
JOHN JESUS-- 
Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog. John flinches back, trying not to get wet. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Jesus Christ! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know you're pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. I saw Lori out on a date with Rex. 
JOHN What? 
TED I'm serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell. 
JOHN You're un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her-- 
TED Johnny, it's the truth. I'm tellin' ya-- 
JOHN Get outta here. 
TED (BEAT) You know, you're actin' like a cock, you know that? JOHN What? I'm acting like a cock? 
TED Yes. You are actin' like a giant, V- shaped-funny-lookin'-guy-in-a-porno cock. 
JOHN Huh? 
TED `Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cock--forget it. What I'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself. 
John glares at him. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED (CONT'D) Lori was right about you. You can't take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life. 
JOHN Oh, and you can? 
TED I don't have to, I'm a fuckin' teddy bear! Y'know somethin', I didn't tie you up and drag you to that party. I wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend. 
JOHN Oh, yeah? Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life? 
TED Whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't care enough about your relationship. 
JOHN You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it? 
TED Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin' your mind? That's your choice, John! And you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy. 
JOHN (BEAT) You know... sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old... and I wish I'd just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin. 
TED (BEAT) Say that one more time. 
JOHN Teddy... Rux-fucking-pin. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him, wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like the facehuggers from "Aliens." John stumbles around the room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door, shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face. John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed, reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible. John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him. 
JOHN (CONT'D) AAAAAA!!! Fucking Jesus fucking Christ! god fucking dammit!!! Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat, each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor). John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back onto the bed. Ted taunts him. 
TED C'mon, motherfucker! 
John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor, yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily. Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing deteriorates into sobs. 
ANGLE ON Lori and Rex. Rex is visibly derisive, but we see that Lori is softening. It's working... 
JOHN (CONT'D) WE'RE AN ALL-TIME HIGH / WE'LL CHANGE ALL THAT'S GONE BEFORE / DOING SO MUCH MORE / THAN FALLING IN LOVE 
REX (fake voice, covering his mouth and looking away) You suck, get off the stage! (then, for Lori's benefit) Hey, come on guys! 
The crowd starts to take the cue. 
CROWD Get off the stage! / Boooo! / You suck! / We wanna hear Norah! / Come on! 
ANGLE ON Ted in the wings. 
TED Ah, god. 
JOHN SO HOLD ON TIGHT / LET THE FLIGHT BEGIN... (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ANGLE ON a crazed audience member, who rushes the stage, racing toward John. 
CRAZY GUY You're an asshole! 
John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at the last second, so the base is sticking out horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops. 
NORAH Jesus. 
A few concert personnel rush out to check the guy. STAGEHAND Someone call an ambulance! 
The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert security personnel haul him offstage. 
EXT. HATCH SHELL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Rex escorts Lori to his car. 
REX That was insane. Did you see the way that guy's body hit the ground? It was like a rag doll! LORI Yeah, I'd rather just not talk about it. 
REX You want to go get a drink after this? I feel like I could use one after seeing a guy almost die. 
LORI Nope, I think I'd rather you just take me home. 
REX One drink, come on. 
LORI Nope, not really feeling up to it. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
REX Alright, alright, I get it. I don't blame you. When you think about it, it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that. 
LORI Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed. Listen, John and I may have our problems but at least he tried. You know what? I don't feel like talking to you about this. 
She walks away. 
REX Where you going? LORI Taking a cab. I'm going home. 
As she disappears out of earshot, Rex closes his eyes and releases a fart. 
REX Finally. 
EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN & LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SAME 
Lori gets out of the shower, and begins towelling off, still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex. After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out into the hall. There's no one there. 
TED (O.S.) Down here, I swear to god I'm not lookin' up your towel. 
She looks down with a start, and sees Ted standing there. He's blocking his view with one hand. 
TED (CONT'D) Not lookin' up your towel. Not lookin' at your funny business. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LORI (pulling towel closer to her) Ted? What're you doing here? What do you want? 
TED I need to talk to you. 
LORI Look, if you're here to fight John's battle for hi-- 
TED Lori, do me a favor and let me talk first, and then you can say whatever you want. There's a beat. She reluctantly considers. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Lori, now in a robe, sits down on the couch, facing Ted. 
TED Look, John loves you very much. More than anything in the world. And he's fallin' to fuckin' pieces without you. He knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn't all his fault. If you'll just give him one more chance to be with you-- 
She rolls her eyes. 
TED (CONT'D) Listen to me! If you'll just give him one more chance... I promise I will leave and never come back. He'll be all yours. Just give him one more chance. 
EXT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY 
Donny's car pulls up. The house is a low-class, creepily shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in "Silence of the Lambs"). It's close to one end of the base of a bridge. 
INT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY 
Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls, there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings, photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in public that Donny clearly took himself. TED Whoa... 
DONNY Yes, as you can see, you've been part of our family for quite some time. Welcome home. 
TED Heh, you know what's hilarious, I got tons of pictures of you guys at my house. 
ROBERT Daddy, is he all mine? 
DONNY He's all yours, my little winner. You've arrived at a lucky time, Ted. It's almost Robert's play hour. 
TED I'm guessin' you guys don't have a PS3. I'm guessin' you're more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family. 
INT. ROBERT'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Ted is led into Robert's room. It's a fairly sparse room with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with a wig stands in the corner. 
TED Huh. Wig horse. 
Robert sits down on the floor, smiling at him. Donny stands in the doorway. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNY Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert now. So you will do as he says. 
TED Y'know, you think you're just gonna get away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin' example you're settin' for your kid. 
DONNY (leaning in to Ted with ANGER) LANGUAGE!!! 
Ted flinches nervously. Donny moves back. 
DONNY (CONT'D) When I was a little boy, I saw you on television. And I thought you were the most amazing, most wonderful thing I'd ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father if I could have a magical teddy bear, too. And he said no. And I was heartbroken. I decided that if I ever had a son, I would never say no to him. 
TED Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn't hurt. 
ROBERT Me and Ted are gonna be best friends, daddy. 
DONNY Yes. You are. Happy play time. Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted. 
TED Jesus fucking Christ! 
ROBERT No! Daddy said no bad words! 
TED Yeah well, fuck your dad. 
Ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it. It doesn't budge. He takes a running leap at it, but just bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor. 
TED (CONT'D) Shit! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Robert stands over him. 
ROBERT I said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it. 
TED That's a great story, I felt like I was there. 
ROBERT Daddy gave me an ouch. Now I have to give you an ouch. 
Robert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of Ted's ears with the other hand. Robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. Ted screams as loud as he can. Robert looks at him, holding the ear. 
TED Okay... okay, kid. You win. We'll do it your way. You wanna play a game or somethin'? It's play time, let's play a game. 
ROBERT Yeah, I wanna play a game! 
TED Good, good, hey, how `bout we play a little game of hide and seek? 
ROBERT I love hide and seek! I'll hide! 
TED Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right? 
ROBERT Yes. 
TED Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don't ya think? 
There's a beat. Robert stares blankly at him, then: 
ROBERT Okay, you hide first. 
TED Great. Fantastic. Okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ROBERT Do I need to wash my hands before this game? 
TED You... well-- no, you-- god, that's a weird fuckin' question, no, just start countin'. 
TED (holding head in pain) Aaaaa! Shit!! 
INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
They continue watch with held breath, as they keep up. 
INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Ted shakes himself off, still a little dazed, and climbs back up. Robert climbs into the way back and grabs one of his legs. 
ROBERT No! You're being bad! 
Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and brandishes it threateningly at Robert. 
TED Back off, Susan Boyle. 
Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump. 
INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
JOHN Easy... 
LORI I know. 
JOHN EASY-- 
LORI I know! 
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Lori's car moves closer to Donny's. There's a tense moment with some back and forth cutting... and then Ted makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori breathe energetic sighs of relief. 
TED Johnny! Total T.J. Hooker, right? 
John and Lori laugh. 
JOHN Yes! Fuckin' A right! 
INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Donny sees what's happening in his side mirror. He puts his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back) and tumbling into the back seat. 
TED God dammit! 
Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack. 
ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off. 
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Donny's car scrapes against the side of the tunnel, sending sparks flying. 
INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Donny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the floor on the passengers' side. Donny rips the sack off his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window. He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is opposing traffic moving in the other direction. 
EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks. 
LORI Shit! 
She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they continue on into the city. 
EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Donny's car races through the streets, pursued by John and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways behind. 
INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side. He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat. He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then, with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but can't. 
EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop. Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit. TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly. That little rip has done something... He shakes it off, and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and disappears inside. ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the sidewalk after them. 
INT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS 
Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him down a bit. 
ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through the garage door, and running inside. They look around for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK ON JOHN. 
ROBERT (O.S.) NO!! 
John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at them! 
ROBERT (CONT'D) You can't have my teddy bear!! 
When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look down at him. 
LORI Oh my god. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED (weak, slow breathing) Johnny... 
Ted looks glassy-eyed for a beat. John starts to frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing. 
JOHN Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all! 
Lori starts helping him, desperately grabbing chunks of the white cotton. 
TED Johnny... 
John leans back over Ted. 
JOHN You're gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You're gonna be fine. 
TED (WEAK) Jesus, I look like the robot from "Aliens". 
JOHN No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're gonna be okay. 
TED I... I don't think so. I'm... I'm in trouble. I need... I need to tell you something. 
JOHN What is it? 
TED Don't... don't ever lose her again. She's the most important... most important part of your life. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: TED (CONT'D) Even more than me. She's your thunder buddy now. She's-- 
Ted closes his eyes... and dies. ANGLE DIRECTLY ABOVE TED as we pull away, and it starts to rain... 
EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The rain is pouring now. Lori's car pulls up. She and John hurry out, John holding the remains of Ted. They race inside. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
John and Lori burst in with the remains of Ted. They're both drenched from the rain. Lori frantically searches drawers for sewing materials. She finds a needle and thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to sew him up as John watches intently. 
LORI John... I don't know if this is gonna-- 
JOHN Just try. Please. Just try. 
She continues sewing, until she is all finished. They wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower their heads. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER 
John sits on the couch, head in hands. Ted still lies on the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his shoulder. 
LORI John... I'm sorry. You did everything you could. I'm... I'm just so sorry. 
She gently puts an arm around him. There is a thunderclap outside. John does not react. 
LORI (CONT'D) (almost too softly to be HEARD) You're not afraid... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ANGLE ON TED (shortly after) as a white sofa blanket is placed over him. John and Lori shut off the lights, and exit... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT 
John is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying awake. She sighs restlessly, and gets up. She walks over to the window, and looks out. 
EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME 
ANGLE UPWARD - We see a cloudy sky, much like the one from that night when John was a child. As before, there is a small clear patch in the center. A shooting star whizzes by through the opening. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Lori's eyes widen a bit in recognition. She stares at the shooting star for a beat, then closes her eyes and makes a wish... 
EXT./ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - TIME LAPSE 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
John wakes up, looks around groggily, then remembers. He gets out of bed, and walks toward the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
He pauses for a beat... and walks in. The blanket is where it was left. John slowly removes it. Ted is still motionless. John lowers his head sadly. Suddenly, Ted's eyes snap open. 
JOHN Ted! 
TED (RETARDED-SOUNDING VOICE) I'm alive, Johnny! 
JOHN Oh my god! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED (RETARDED-SOUNDING VOICE) I'm alive! Your magical wish worked!

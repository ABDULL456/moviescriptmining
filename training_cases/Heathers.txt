November 17, 1987 
FADE IN: 
EXT.   SUBURBAN STREET--DAY 
VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit. Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing. 
EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY 
VERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder. 
EXT.   PROMENADE--DAY 
VERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre. 
EXT.   THE SAWYER HOME--DAY 
Reveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home. 
She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob. 
INY.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY 
VERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she launches into voice-over narration. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Heather told me she teaches people Real Life. 
Composed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the mirror then rambles off. 
INT.   HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY 
Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling high school hallway with a frozen smile. 
VERONICA (V.O.) She said Real Life sucks Losers dry. If you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly. 
OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA 
With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle. 
VERONICA (V.O.) I said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly. She said Yes. 
THE DIARY PAGE 
VERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words echoed by her voice-over. 
VERONICA (V.O.) I said You're Beautiful. 
A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen to recklessly rocket across the written words. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.) God, come on Veronica! 
VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful, trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA. 
VERONICA What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my... 
HEATHER MCNAMARA God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather. 
From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE. She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye." 
HEATHER DUKE Yeah, she really wants to talk to you. 
VERONICA Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus... 
INSIDE THE CAFETERIA 
VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE, strides into the lunchroom pandemonium. 
The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back. 
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking lot toward four HEAVY METALERS (one female) hanging out on a car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over. 
VERONICA (V.O.) ..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers are the same. Didn't you see The Breakfast Club? 
BETTY FINN'S TABLE 
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER set themselves down with BETTY FINN and her LOOK-ALIKE FRIENDS. 
HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl in the commercials and the videos. 
JOCKS' TABLE 
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts of the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity. 
HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) I'm the blonde in the bikini on the horse holding a Pepsi can. 
INT.   SMOKE-FILLED HALLWAY 
In a dark, smoky hallway, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER cough toward a batch of STONERS in tattered forms of dress. 
HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) I'm the princess being spanked on the throne by Billy Idol's guitarist's guitar. 
INT.   THE SCHOOL LIBRARY 
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER click-click across the school library floor to where an ALL-OUT NERD studies in solitude. 
HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) What do I get out of being friends with losers. I give them a piece of a winner and they stain me with loserness. 
PARKING LOT 
Heavy Metaler MATT grins. 
MATT You get five million dollars but some Martians are going to zap you in two days. You hear that, Clyde? That's got to be the most spooky-ass question I've ever heard. 
BETTY FINN'S TABLE 
BETTY FINN daintily peeps up. 
BETTY FINN I think we should use the money for an End-of-the-world get-together. We could invite guys. 
JOCKS' TABLE 
RAM sputters out some chicken to bellow. 
RAM I'd pay Madonna one million dollars to ride my face like the Kentucky Derby. She should be paying me, though. 
STONERS' HALLWAY 
A FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET starts to speak, then stops... 
FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET What? 
LIBRARY 
The ALL-OUT NERD lashes out. 
ALL-OUT NERD This is important. With taxes, I'd be only getting 3.5 million and.... 
PARKING LOT 
Heavy Metaler CLYDE turns from his friend MATT. 
CLYDE If you want a good way to go out before the aliens land, get a lion from the zoo. Put a remote control bomb up its butt. When the lion starts tearing you up, press the bomb button. You and the lion die like as one. 
Two Heavy Metal lovers, JACKIE and STEVE, intertwined against the windshield blankly respond. 
JACKIE AND STEVE Cool. 
CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE 
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER continue their conversation chugging through another busy cafeteria lane. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest. 
VERONICA Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth? 
HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE burst back between them. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA Oh God, here we go... 
POV ON MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK 
J.D. There are no stupid questions. 
VERONICA If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do? 
J.D. (suavely) That's the stupidest question I've ever heard. 
JOCKS' TABLE 
The JOCKS witness VERONICA and J.D. 
RAM Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley? 
KURT Veronica is into his act. No doubt. 
RAM Let's kick his ass. 
KURT Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though. 
J.D.'S TABLE 
An intrigued J.D. laconically answers the question. 
J.D. Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach. 
VERONICA How very. 
HEATHER CHANDLER breaks VERONICA's daze of admiration. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Come on. 
VERONICA (to J.D.) Later. 
J.D. Definitely. 
KURT and RAM move into the exiting VERONICA's place. RAM sticks his finger through a piece of pie on J.D.'s plate. 
RAM You going to eat this? 
KURT What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio? 
RAM Answer him dick! 
KURT Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule? 
J.D. It seems to have an open door policy for assholes though, doesn't it? 
KURT What did you say dickweed? 
J.D. I'll repeat myself. 
J.D. gracefully stands, reaches into his coat, and pulls out a a .357 Magnum. He fires twice at the viewer. 
EXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY 
Croquet wickets have been set up in standard form. VERONICA and the HEATHERS stand at various positions in the yard holding different colored mallets next to matching balls. HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her ball through the middle wicket. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something. 
HEATHER CHANDLER He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail. 
VERONICA No way. He used blanks. All J.D. really did was ruin two pairs of pants...Maybe not even that... (giggling) Can you bleach out urine stains? 
HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her red ball into HEATHER DUKE'S green one. 
HEATHER CHANDLER J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys. 
VERONICA Never say never. 
HEATHER DUKE What are you going to do, Heather? Take the two shots or send me out? 
The Girls look to the doelike HEATHER DUKE with incredulous faces. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast? First you ask if you can be red, knowing that I'm always red... 
HEATHER CHANDLER places her foot on her red ball. She swings her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent green one rocketing into a flower bed. 
HEATHER DUKE Shit. 
HEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket. 
HEATHER CHANDLER (to HEATHER DUKE) Damn. It's your turn Heather. 
HEATHER DUKE No, it's Heather's turn. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Corn nuts! 
INT.   7-11 
Stylishly dressed-to-massacre, VERONICA reaches out to a bag of Corn Nuts as J.D.'s off-screen voice disarms her. 
J.D. (O.S.) You going to pull a Big Gulp with that? 
VERONICA No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well. 
J.D. I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane. 
VERONICA Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe. 
J.D. The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee? 
VERONICA I didn't. Cherry. 
VERONICA smiles at her Coolness. J.D. returns the smile. 
7-11 PARKING LOT 
VERONICA and J.D. slurp by J.D.'s ferocious motorcycle. 
VERONICA Great bike. 
HEATHER CHANDLER sounds her car horn with a grimace. VERONICA glares at her then turns back to J.D. 
J.D. Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company? 
VERONICA I don't know. Should you? 
J.D. My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State." 
VERONICA Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place. 
J.D. Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect? 
VERONICA (gently joking) Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University. 
VERONICA grows serious as the car horn sounds again. 
VERONICA It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends. 
J.D. I don't really like your friends either. 
VERONICA It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit. 
J.D. Maybe it's time for a vacation. 
The car horn blares again. 
INT. DORMITORY ROOM--NIGHT 
DAVID, Heather Chandler's fine looking college beau, leads VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER into a cramped, eclectically tacky dorm room. Music pounds the door. 
The semi-handsome BRAD leans aainst a desk while a WHINING STUDENT talks with COED ONE who sits on the floor. 
DAVID Throw your coats on the bed, girls. 
WHINING STUDENT That exam was so bogus. 
COED ONE Oh I know. Which exam? 
DAVID Veronica, this is Brad. 
BRAD Excellent. Did you girls bring your partying slippers? 
HEATHER CHANDLER Yeah, let's party. 
DAVID She loves to party. 
As they head out the door, BRAD whispers something in BRAD'S FRIEND's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh. 
INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT 
The viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party VERONICA to the traumatic dormitory party itself. The sobbing monocled VERONICA writes at her desk. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Dear Diary, I want to kill and you have to believe.....damn pen! 
VERONICA frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to write. She throws the pen across the room and pulls out another. 
VERONICA (V.O.) You have to believe it's for more than selfish reasons. More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle. You have to believe me. 
VERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door. 
BRAD How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come on. 
VERONICA Hey really, I don't feel so great. 
BRAD Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent. 
BRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing. 
VERONICA I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice.... 
BRAD Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid. 
VERONICA You don't deserve my fucking speech! 
VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed causing him to slide off onto the floor. 
DORM HALLWAY 
VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm. 
BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish. DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set down her beer and walk toward VERONICA. 
DORMITORY ALLEY 
The fire in the trashcan is raging. 
DORM HALLWAY 
A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA. 
HEATHER CHANDLER What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze. 
VERONICA Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please? 
HEATHER CHANDLER No. Hell no. 
VERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds. 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Betty Finn was a true friend and I sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd be like offing the Wicked Witch of the West. Or is it East? West! I sound like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing her aerobicized ass but tonight let me dream of a world without Heather. A world where I am free. 
DORM HALLWAY 
VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth. A smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss. VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background. 
DORMITORY ALLEY 
VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the trashcan bellows like Mt. Vesuvius. 
HEATHER CHANDLER You stupid cunt! 
VERONICA You goddamn bitch! 
The flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic light. 
HEATHER CHANDLER You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke! 
VERONICA Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up. 
HEATHER CHANDLER (totally in control) Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games. 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps. 
J.D. Dreadful etiquette. I apologize. 
VERONICA (exhaling deeply) S'okay.... 
J.D. I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match? 
VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead.... 
VERONICA Sure. But I'm Blue. 
EXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT 
The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest together by the first wicket. 
J.D. holds up a bottle of Pine-Sol. 
J.D. I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself. 
VERONICA Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her. 
VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent, scouring powder) into a glass beer mug. 
VERONICA O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon? 
J.D. Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue. 
J.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts. 
VERONICA What are you doing? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that. 
J.D. Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking. 
J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of orange juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering. 
VERONICA Just give me a cup, jerk. 
J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange juice into the cup. 
VERONICA Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something. 
J.D. Yeah, great. 
They both start coughing harshly. 
VERONICA No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely. 
J.D. Chick-en. 
VERONICA You're not funny. 
J.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down at the mess of toxic containers. With both arms, VERONICA clumps the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put them away. J.D. swaggers back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs back into view. 
J.D. I'm sorry. 
J.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes with a grudging smile. 
VERONICA Bonehead. 
VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups. 
Not the one with milk and orange juice in it. 
HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM 
HEATHER CHANDLER angelically sleeps as VERONICA and J.D. enter. 
VERONICA Morning, Heather. 
Like a lion, HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation? 
VERONICA We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Did we? How the hell'd you get in here? 
J.D. Veronica knew you'd have a hangover. So I whipped this up. Family recipe. 
J.D. holds out the ceramic cup. HEATHER CHANDLER snorts. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Did you put a phlegm globber in it or something? I'm not drinking that piss. 
J.D. I knew this stuff would be too intense. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink it just because you call me chicken. 
They do. They're right. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Just give me the cup, jerk. 
HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in anger. She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all. She then launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Corn nuts! 
HEATHER CHANDLER'S eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes through the glass coffee table. VERONICA and J.D. freeze. 
J.D. Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup. 
PAULINE I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled to be given an example of everything I've taught you. That example is Heather Chandler. I have the note! 
PAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note. The class AAAHS. 
MALE STUDENT All right! 
PAULINE I'll pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself. Let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all. Who wants to begin? 
FEMALE STUDENT I heard it was really gnarly. She drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed.... 
PAULINE Now, now, we're not here to rehash the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions. 
THE ALL-OUT NERD Are we going to be tested on this? 
A stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks. The note continues to be breathlessly passed around. 
PETER Heather and I used to go together, but she said I was boring. I realize now I wasn't really boring. She was just dissatisfied with her life. 
PAULINE That's very good Peter. 
VERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by putting her hands over her face. 
PAULINE Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share. 
VERONICA Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness. 
The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues, realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience. 
VERONICA She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death. 
PAULINE cries. The PUPILS applaud. VERONICA queasily smiles. 
INT.   THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY 
The GIRLS are finishing up putting on their clothes. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so unfair! We should get a whole week off not just an hour. 
HEATHER DUKE Write the School Board. 
HEATHER DUKE gnaws on a chicken leg as she speaks. 
VERONICA Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA Yeah, where's your urge to purge? 
HEATHER DUKE (belching) Fuck it. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA pulls a Swatch from one of the lockers. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA Look, heather left behind one of her Swatches. She'd want you to have it, Veronica. She always said you couldn't accessorize for shit. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA tosses the watch to a spooked VERONICA who stands up and solemnly puts it on. The FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET stops next to their bench. 
FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET I'm sorry about your friend. I thought she was your usual airhead bitch. Guess I was wrong. Lot of us were. 
HEATHER DUKE bobs up from the world's largest sno-cone. 
HEATHER DUKE What a waste. 
VERONICA zombiesquely moves into the shower area. 
HEATHER DUKE (V.O.) Oh the Humanity. 
THE SHOWER 
VERONICA turns on a shower and lets the water spray against her clothes. 
THE LOCKER ROOM 
HEATHER MCNAMARA Veronica, what are you doing? 
SQUEALING GIRL Everyone in the shower! 
The SQUEALING GIRL runs into the shower fully clothed. TWO GIGGLING GIRLS follow suit. The HEATHERS look to each other, laugh, and run in. 
INT.   THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE 
Heavy Metalers MATT, CLYDE, and STEVE plus Geek RODNEY sneak into a darkened room. Girls' laughter drifts in. 
MATT Do I deliver or do I deliver? 
RODNEY Hurry up, we're going to get caught. 
FRED DEAN Hey Dad, how was work today? 
FRED DEAN slams down his rowing machine and straddles it before answering his own question. He rows as he speaks. The Brady Bunch sputters on the T.V. screen before him. 
FRED DEAN It was miserable. Some damn tribe of withered old bitches doesn't want us to terminate that fleabag hotel. All because Glenn Miller and his band once took a shit there. It's just like Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas? 
J.D. That was the one with the wheat right? 
BIG BUD DEAN The Save the Memorial Oak Tree Society. Showed those fucks. 
J.D. turns to VERONICA with a bemused smile. 
J.D. Thirty Fourth of July fireworks attached to the trunk. Arraigned but Acquitted. 
FRED DEAN Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend. 
J.D. Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica. 
VERONICA Hello. 
VERONICA, with a forced smile, reaches to shaked FRED's hand. FRED DEAN extends his hand but makes no effort to stop rowing hence his hand pulls away from VERONICA. Pop and son laugh. 
J.D. Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner. 
VERONICA (awkwardly standing) My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano. 
J.D. Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad? 
BIG BUD DEAN stops rowing to grin a You-Think-You're-Tougher- Than-Me-But-You're-Not smile to J.D. 
BIG BUD DEAD Right, son. 
VERONICA (weakly) Right. 
EXT.   THE SAWYER PATIO--DUSK 
Just as in the earlier patio scene, DAD and MOM SAWYER are seated at a patio table with an empty chair between them. Pate is on the table. DAD smokes a cigarette. 
DAD Take a break Veronica, sit down. 
VERONICA walks into view and sits down. 
VERONICA All right. 
DAD So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like? 
VERONICA I don't know, it was okay, I guess. 
MOM Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender? 
VERONICA Maybe. 
DAD (looking at his cigarette) Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things? 
VERONICA (smiling) Because you're an idiot. 
DAD Oh yeah, that's it. 
DAD immediately takes another drag with a wide grin. 
MOM (shaking her head) You two.... 
VERONICA Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow. 
INT.   HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--DAY 
A montage commences showing the HEATHERS preparing for the funeral. HEATHER MCNAMARA models an all-black outfit in front of a dressing table mirror. She storms away, pouting. 
INT.   HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--DAY 
Bobbing up from a fashion magazine whose cover story is FUNERAL CHIC, HEATHER DUKE finishes applying black lipstick. A look of horror passes over her face and she savagely scrubs her lips. 
INT.   CHURCH--DAY 
A MORTICIAN puts the finishing touches on HEATHER CHANDLER, smoothing out her clothes and buffing her face. He gently kisses her forehead then quickly rebuffs the spot. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM 
HEATHER MCNAMARA models another black outfit. She responds this time with a satisfied smile. 
HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM 
Traditionally made up, a smiling HEATHER DUKE brings a crucifix earring to her ear and attaches it. 
RAM pushes BRACES down harder. 
KURT Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks. 
RODNEY Leave him alone, Kurt. 
J.D. rides by on his motorcycle. He turns to watch KURT, wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that reads THE TRUE KILLER across the top. KURT is spooked. 
RAM (O.S.) Say it! 
BRACES Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks. 
Unamused, RAM throws BRACES to the ground. BRACES semi-cries. 
BRACES I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm! I can't get enough of them. Satisfied? 
KURT I'm sure your friends are happy to hear that. (with a lisp) Right, guys? 
ANOTHER PLACE IN THE PARKING LOT 
VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA sashay through the parking lot. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet lately, consoling me and stuff. It'll be really very. Promise. 
Moving into the background, BRACES wipes dirt and blood off his face as his friends glumly watch on. 
VERONICA All right, but I hope it isn't going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows. 
EXT.   COW PASTURE--NIGHT 
A COW stands sleeping. Giggling and drunk, KURT and RAM scramble around the COW. Uncomfortable and sober, VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA look on. 
KURT Is it sleeping, dude? 
RAM I think so, man. 
KURT Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest. 
RAM Punch it in! 
KURT and RAM slam their knuckles and then lean against the COW, poised to shove. HEATHER MCNAMARA manages a smile but VERONICA glares it away. 
KURT Count of three, guy. 
KURT AND RAM One. Two. Three! 
An O.S. Moo and the Jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes against the mortified faces of VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA. 
DEEPER IN THE PASTURE--LATER IN THE NIGHT 
KURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA. 
KURT "When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing....." 
VERONICA Yeah, right, asshole. 
VERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline. Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT squints up the hill and falls over backwards. 
J.D. What is this shit? 
VERONICA I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off. 
KURT (still face down) "Feel like making bah da dah bah da dah, feel like making love." 
J.D. Another fucking Heather. (harshly laughs) I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior tonight. Seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination. We've broke through the peer pressure cooker. So what if we had to kill Miss Popularity.. 
VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill. 
VERONICA So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus! 
J.D. Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee. 
J.D. solemnly reaches toward VERONICA. She, less solemn, takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill. 
KURT "And she's buying the stairway to heaven.." 
INT.   NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY 
In a cluttered school workshop, Editor DENNIS and a YEARBOOK GIRL, wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, confer over a layout sheet. Dennis's Famine Fund partner PETER DAWSON pouts behind them. 
DENNIS I'm not belittling the Famine Fund Peter, but we're talking teen suicide! Westerburg finally got one and I'm not going to blow it. 
PETER Great. Heather gets the headline and I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon. 
J.D. Do you take German? 
VERONICA French. 
J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber. 
J.D. These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm. 
VERONICA So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding. 
J.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring. 
J.D. We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look like they shot each other. By the time Kurt and Ram regain consciousness, they'll be the laughingstock's of the school. The note's the punchline. How'd it turn out? 
VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both papers. 
VERONICA First tell me this similarity is not incredible. 
J.D. (warmly) Incredible similarity. 
VERONICA pulls back the note and reads. 
VERONICA Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole. 
J.D. Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word. 
VERONICA We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play. 
J.D. (rapid-fire) They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce. 
VERONICA Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K. 
VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her. 
J.D. It doesn't work on small animals! 
VERONICA Oh. 
J.D. Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed. 
J.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the contents on the bed. 
J.D. We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick. 
VERONICA You must have had fun. 
J.D. You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up... 
J.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly raises out two bottles of Perrier water. 
J.D. Perrier water! 
VERONICA Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way. 
J.D. This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress. 
VERONICA (mock-seductively) Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go? 
J.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss. 
EXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT--NIGHT 
A tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk through the parking lot toward the woods. 
RAM (singing) Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and... 
KURT Shut the fuck up, all right. 
RAM Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in! 
KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM. 
EXT.   CLEARING IN THE WOODS--NIGHT 
VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods. She nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT and RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods. 
KURT Hi Veronica. 
VERONICA (forced cheerfulness) Hi Guys. Glad you could make it. 
RAM smacks his hands together. 
RAM So do we just start fucking? 
The two officer explode out of the car. 
THE CLEARING 
J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun. 
VERONICA Kurt doesn't look too good. 
J.D. Remember he's left-handed. 
A quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand. 
MILNER (O.S.) Keep going until you hit the clearing! 
J.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into the clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop. 
McCORD Mother of Shit! 
MILNER Call in! 
MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out. 
MILNER I heard something out there. I'm checking it out. 
MILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is holding the pulse of KURT KELLY. 
McCORD This is Officer McCord and I've got two dead bodies in the woods behind Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback. 
IN THE WOODS 
VERONICA and J.D. flow through the trees. An Owl hoos. 
ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS 
MILNER blindly barrels through the woods. 
JUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS 
VERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and start running up a grassy hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top. 
J.D. Faster! 
IN THE WOODS 
MILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving. 
THE HILL 
VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting. 
MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill. 
THE SAWYER CAR 
VERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin taking off their clothes. 
THE HILL 
MILNER continues to move up the hill. 
THE SAWYER CAR 
VERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace. 
OUTSIDE THE CAR 
MILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie- talkie startles him. 
McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie) Milner, can you hear me? What's going down? 
MILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-talkie. 
MILNER Think what I heard was just a stinking owl. All I got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car. Should I pry them apart? 
McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie) Forget it. I got all the answers back here, partner. 
THE SAWYER CAR 
Seeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking. 
THE CLEARING 
MILNER runs back into the clearing. 
J.D. You mean the time you blew Kurt Kelly's ass away! 
VERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a framed picture of a woman, at the roaring J.D. 
VERONICA You can be so immature! 
J.D. (looking off) You kids are making too much damn noise. 
FRED DEAN is revealed to be standing in the front doorway, holding a chest exerciser and waving a videocassette. 
FRED DEAN We beat the bitches. 
VERONICA (mumbling) Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home. 
FRED DEAN Judge told em to slurp shit and die. 
FRED DEAN crams the cassette in his V.C.R. and hefts up a chest exerciser. He begins pumping away as the image of a shabby building appears on the massive T.V. 
FRED DEAN I put a Norwegian in the boiler room. Masterful. When that blew, it set off a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs. 
The building blows up. FRED DEAN cackles. J.D. politely applauds. FRED pops out the videocassette and bounces away. 
FRED DEAN It's great to be alive! 
VERONICA Do you like your father? 
J.D. Never given the matter much thought. Liked my mother. 
J.D. picks up the framed picture that Veronica threw. 
J.D. They said her death was an accident. But she knew when the explosives were set to go off. She knew... 
VERONICA slowly sits down next to J.D. with dazed concern. 
VERONICA Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for... 
J.D. Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi? 
VERONICA Maybe. 
J.D. exhales in frustration and changes some more channels. 
J.D. Whoa! Amazing! 
THE T.V. SCREEN 
A music video flashes on the Dead T.V. screen. THREE GORGEOUS WOMEN, stylishly furnished, evocatively wail the female moans heard throughout the film. The video viewpoint then pans to two overly gorgeous young men wearing trendy hair and trendy clothes. They sing/shout before an all-white background. A SUPER in the corner reads BIGFUN/TEENAGE SUICIDE (DON'T DO IT). 
BIGFUN (T.V.) TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW! PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW! 
J.D. It's the new BigFun video! 
VIDEO:   INT.   A GIRL'S BEDROOM--DAY 
Now in full screen, the video viewpoint cuts to a very depressed and very cute, white, female VID VICTIM ONE sitting at her dressing table. She pours a bottle of pills into her hand. 
BIGFUN (V.O.) BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO! 
BIGFUN magically materialize next to VID VICTIM ONE. The pills in her hand have turned into jellybeans. She is ridiculously happy. 
BIGFUN TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! 
J.D. pulls out a gun with an ethereal expression on his face. 
J.D. We've made MTV. 
J.D. fires into the radiant image of BIGFUN, destroying the T.V. and disgusting VERONICA, who bolts off the couch. He raucously crawls after her. 
VERONICA We're breaking up. I am out! 
J.D. Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor. 
J.D. playfully tackles VERONICA. This calms rather than angers. She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit. 
VERONICA You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you. 
J.D. Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. 
VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and eventually into a walking-out-the-door position. 
VERONICA I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase.... 
J.D. Phase my ass! You'll be back! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back. 
A Male hand picks up the phone. It's College boy DAVID. 
DAVID Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on anybody's carpet lately? 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA cringes. 
VERONICA Is this David? Heather's David? What are you doing.... 
HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM 
DAVID What can I say? I was pretty broken up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed somebody super-sensitive like Heather D. 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA I'm delirious for the both of you. Can you put Heather on? 
HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM 
DAVID proudly looks down off-screen to his lap. 
DAVID She can't really talk right now. 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away, VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night table drawer and draws up another address book; this one is frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and dials..... 
VERONICA Hello, Betty..... 
EXT.   SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY 
BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face. 
BETTY I don't believe it. I'm winning. 
VERONICA Don't get cocky, girl. 
BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up. 
BETTY I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends. 
VERONICA That's bullshit. Just shoot. 
BETTY once again bends and raises. 
BETTY Ronnie, I'm still a virgin. 
VERONICA (warmly) Shoot. 
BETTY finally shoots. Feebly. 
VERONICA Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked. 
BETTY Ronnie! 
VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's. 
BETTY Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way. 
VERONICA It's not my style, okay? 
BETTY Nice guys finish last. I should know. 
VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing toward the porch and a statuesque HEATHER DUKE who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her. 
HEATHER DUKE Brav-o! 
BETTY FINN (nervously) I've got to get going, Veronica. See you at the studio. 
VERONICA Sure. See ya. 
HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA Croquet won't be the same without Heather. 
HEATHER DUKE hustles back toward a passing BETTY FINN. 
HEATHER DUKE Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special isn't going to be taped at the studios. It's going to be done in the Park. 
BETTY But I thought... 
HEATHER DUKE (heading back) It's going to be like a big picnic. Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED! 
THE NEWS SET 
VERONICA apologizes to a blissfully oblivious WHITNEY JAMES. 
VERONICA I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering. 
WHITNEY JAMES Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up. 
WHITNEY JAMES tears open a bag of Corn Nuts and showers some into her mouth. She speaks as she sucks and chews. 
WHITNEY JAMES I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's exciting stuff. My personal faves are those kids from loaded families grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a B.M.W. on their birthday, they're still quote-unquote depressed. It's ridiculous. People who say money can't buy happiness don't know where to shop. 
WHITNEY JAMES titters. VERONICA is a statue of mortification. 
EXT.   THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--TWILIGHT 
In the neighborhood park, gloomy members of various cliques sit in silence at picnic tables. All are ludicrously wearing Guest Passes. BETTY FINN mumbles down to her potato salad. EARL FRAZIER stoically stares off into space. Heavy Metaler CLYDE holds an absurdly large picnic basket. 
CLYDE What the fuck? 
NEWS SET 
Completely flabbergasted, VERONICA manages a light tone. 
VERONICA The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness. 
WHITNEY JAMES Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda. 
VERONICA It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up. 
WHITNEY JAMES Sure. Ciao. 
STUDIO FLOOR 
Sickened, VERONICA stumbles onto the studio floor. Studio lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE grabs VERONICA by the arm and shouts into the air. 
PAULINE Everyone take their places on the stage! (to Veronica) Isn't this thrilling?! 
VERONICA But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right. 
PAULINE What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch. (shouting upward) Could we get some more light up here? 
THE STAGE 
The pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage. Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar. 
VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar. 
PAULINE Our schools have been torn apart by tragedy. Let's fuse them back together through love. Let's clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove. 
The students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp hands. VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the stage. 
PAULINE (O.S.) Let's begin a new happiness... 
VERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN. He pushes up a console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the circle of hand-holding students is, to slowly spin around the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES. 
PAULINE ...with no more suicide... 
STUDENTS (eeriely) Oh yeah... 
Ripping off her pink armband, VERONICA freezes. Standing at the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is J.D. He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast. 
J.D. Holy traumatic experiences, Batman. I'm sorry you felt you had to put yourself through all that shit. I told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in the past already, right? 
PAULINE No more problems.... 
Devastated,  VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIAN's console. 
VERONICA Oh yeah. 
VERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle of handholding, pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES. 
J.D. Cute. 
WHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before coolly leaning over to her microphone. 
WHITNEY JAMES Let's go for another take. 
OUTSIDE STUDIO DOORS 
VERONICA bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. She kicks off her shoes and begins to jog barefoot through the station hallway, weaving through various REPORTER-types. 
EXT.  OUTSIDE T.V. STATION--TWILIGHT 
VERONICA I said I was sorry. 
HEATHER DUKE You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers. 
VERONICA You're not funny. Ouch! 
VERONICA rubs her feet. HEATHER DUKS shakes her head. 
HEATHER DUKE (Heather Chandleresque) What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue. 
VERONICA Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on. 
HEATHER DUKE Oh shit, yeah. 
HEATHER DUKE hastens to the radio and flicks it on. Ripping open a bag of corn nuts, she sets herself down next to VERONICA as a TROUBLED MALE VOICE cuts the air. 
TROUBLED MALE VOICE (Radio) I know it's supposed to be funny that they never get off the island, but still, sometimes I feel like I'm on that island and Gilligan can be just so stupid sometimes. 
HEATHER DUKE This sounds like a good one. 
INT.   RADIO STATION BOOTH 
A slob D.J. cackles into a W.E.T.C. conference call-type box. 
D.J. Dude, you've got to remember if it wasn't for the courage of the fearless crew, the Minnow would be lost. The Minnow would be lost! Next call! 
TROUBLED MALE VOICE But Skipper hates me.... 
The D.J. rudely clicks off the TROUBLED MALE VOICE. 
D.J. Whoa, they're coming out early tonight. What ever happened to teen pregnancy and acne? You've got the Dogcatcher on W etcetera and you're listening to Hot Probs. Who am I talking to? 
INT.    HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT 
HEATHER MCNAMARA is sitting clandestinely on her bedroom floor talking on the phone and through her radio. A dim Minnie Mouse lamp provides the room's only light. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up at a Madonna poster on the wall. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up to her Minnie Mouse lamp. 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA and HEATHER DUKE simultaneously move into stunned kneeling positions, half-realizing who the caller is... 
D.J. (radio) Hey babe, I need a name? 
RADIO STATION BOOTH 
The D.J. looks to the conference call box with exasperation. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA (box) My name is Minnie. 
D.J. Ah, Minnie. Don't tell me, Mickey just confessed he got A.I.D.S. from Goofy at a New Year's Eve Party. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM 
A broken-down HEATHER MCNAMARA sobs. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA God has cursed me, I think. The last time I had sex, the guy killed himself the next day. I'm failing Math. 
VERONICA'S BEDROOM 
HEATHER DUKE excitedlly jumps up as HEATHER MCNAMARA drones on. 
HEATHER DUKE                 HEATHER MCNAMARA (radio) Holy shit, that's            My whole life is a mess. Heather! We'll               I was supposed to be crucify her!                 captain of the cheerleading team, but I probably won't VERONICA                because I miss practice when Oh man, she knows we         my Dad visits. My parents listen to this show!         are divorced and stuff and.... 
INT.   CLASSROOM--DAY 
A blackboard reads POOR LITTLE HEATHER. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Heather told everyone about Heather. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA is revealed in the front row wearing her cheerleader uniform. To the left, HEATHER DUKE dishes with some dreamy GUYS. At the back of the classroom, VERONICA, monocle in eye, writes in her diary. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather Chandler's head and Heather Duke's head has sprouted in its place like some mythological thing my eighth grade boyfriend would know about. Heather's even doing the old note trick. 
A HOMELY GIRL is seen reading a note, glancing to a TYPICAL JOCK. VERONICA takes in the wicked panorama of the classroom. 
VERONICA (V.O.) I did it J.D.'s way. I did it Pauline's way. Nothing's changed. I guess that's Heather's way. And jesus, what about J.D.? I can't get him out of my head. Are we going to the Prom? Or to Hell? And where's Heather going? 
HEATHER DUKE, petition in hand, sashays toward the Country Club Kids table. 
COURTNEY Oh great. Here comes Heather. 
COURTNEY'S FRIEND Shit. 
INT.   SCHOOL BUS--DAY 
HEATHER DUKE chirps to a schoolbusful of various STUDENTS. 
EXT.   BLEACHERS--DAY 
The provocatively dressed Petitioner charms a bleacher of Jocks. 
STAIRCASE WINDOW 
HEATHER DUKE continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of the staircase window. 
INT.   FAST FOOD RESTAURANT--NIGHT 
Now in Heavy Metal gear, HEATHER DUKE slams down the petition atop a booth of Metalheads. 
INT.   THE SMOKE-FILLED HALLWAY--DAY                                   139 
Decked out in denim, HEATHER DUKE vanishes into the Stoner Hallway smoke, with the petition. 
THE STAIRCASE WINDOW 
HEATHER DUKE further writhes in the sunlight until VERONICA's perplexed voice cuts into her bliss. 
VERONICA (O.S.) Heather? 
HEATHER DUKE brings down her arms and the petition and turns to VERONICA, revealed to be descending down the steps. 
HEATHER DUKE Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me! (giggling) My God, you haven't signed! 
VERONICA People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton... 
HEATHER DUKE (verbally winking) So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others.... (happiness evaporating) Hey, just sign the petition! 
VERONICA Don't talk to me like that. 
HEATHER DUKE It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it? 
VERONICA (queasy) No. 
HEATHER DUKE Jealous much? 
VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE with all her might. 
VERONICA Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch? 
HEATHER DUKE Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made her Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh! 
HEATHER DUKE stumbles down the stairs. J.D.'s voice cuts into VERONICA's concentration. 
J.D. (O.S.) Wanna go out tonight? 
VERONICA grimly turns to see a smirking, descending J.D. 
J.D. Catch a movie? Miniature Golf? 
VERONICA (jokingly but caustically) I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide. 
J.D. I could be up for that. I've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on? 
VERONICA somberly steps forward to J.D., grabs his elbows, then pulls him gently, seemingly for a kiss. She spits in his face and bolts down the stairs, calling up to him. 
VERONICA It's over, J.D.  Over! 
J.D. I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back! 
INT.   SAWYER LIVING ROOM--DUSK 
Intensely clutching her schoolbooks, VERONICA walks through the front door into the living room where MOM and DAD sit with aggressively compassionate faces. VERONICA is a bit confused. 
VERONICA Yes? 
MOM and DAD glance at each other before MOM speaks. 
MOM Your friend Jason Dean just stopped by. He seemed very concerned about you. He said he thinks you might try to kill yourself. 
DAD You have been depressed lately. Oh, he said this is for you. 
VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers. She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at his clutched arm with a nervous smile. 
VERONICA Rodney, where's everybody going? 
RODNEY It's Friday..... 
VERONICA Oh my God, the damn pep assembly.... 
RODNEY Yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class... 
VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to inquisitively move forward through the crowd. 
THE GYM 
J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors. He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set of stairs. 
THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM 
VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY. 
VERONICA Rodney, what's underneath the gym? 
RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA. and says........ 
RODNEY The boiler room. 
VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the staircase beside the gym. 
HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM 
J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly pick the lock. He swings open the steel door. 
VERONICA (O.S.) May I see your hall pass? 
J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him, pointing the bedroom gun at him. 
J.D. I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you! 
VERONICA Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground. 
J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer. 
VERONICA Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head. 
J.D. You didn't say Simon Says. 
J.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully retrieves it. 
THE GYM 
The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard. Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away. 
THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM 
VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs. J.D. raises the gun to her head. 
J.D. Live by the sword... 
VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the boiler room, jarring the gun loose. 
They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall. VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs scissors-style around her and trips her. 
THE PREP ASSEMBLY 
The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb. 
THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY 
A snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him. 
J.D. You think just because you started this thing, you can end it? 
J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps. 
J.D. You, really didn't think I'd, forget, forget, to disconnect the.... 
VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D. grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door. 
A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58... 
THE PEP ASSEMBLY 
The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave". BETTY FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act, all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. EARL and the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening before the crowd.

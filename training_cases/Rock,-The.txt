THE ROCK

Revised 10/10/95 
BEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE: 
An impressionistic montage: 
A SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We never see him fully. 
The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint. 
On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL COMBAT. 
IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be... 
IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND. 
Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus 
A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION and we see -- 
A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the communication ... 
AII  CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S EYES and FADE IN: 
EXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING 
Two groundskeepers on "ride 'em" lawn mowers, BENNIE and MARLIN, smoke Camels and watch the MARINE OFFICER from the opening montage.  He's alone, across the cemetery. 
BENNIE You'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away. 
ACROSS THE CEMETERY 
Brig.  Gen.  FRANCIS XAVIER HUMMEL stands before a headstone: BARBARA MCLEAN HUMMEL 1946-1996. 
HUMMEL Hi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to do.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have approved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it feels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking. 
Hummel puts new flowers on the grave.  Walks off. 
EXT.  ACCESS ROAD TO ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Heavy rain.  A road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility.  A canvas covered ARMY TRUCK blows a tire in the road.  The DRIVER gets out. Inspects the tire. 
INT.  ARMY TRUCK - NIGHT 
FOUR MARINES in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor into a MANHOLE IN THE ROAD. 
EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT 
Three ARMY M.P.s at the front GUARDHOUSE.  GENERAL HUMMEL pulls up in a SUBURBAN.  The M.P.s immediately recognise him and stand more rigidly. 
ARMY M. P. General Hummel, sir.  It's an honour. Is the Colonel expecting you, sir? 
HUMMEL Held better be.  This is a security inspection. 
ARMY M. P. Yes, sir! 
The M.P. waves Hummel in, saluting crisply. 
INT.  GRATED STORM DRAIN IN BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT 
The four marines from the truck are waiting, readying arms.  The leader is looking at his watch.  Gives a hand signal to the others, and up they go -- 
EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT 
The four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered positions in the compound. 
200 YARDS AWAY - TWO ARMY "MAGAZINE CHECKERS" emerge from a building with clipboards, on routine check. 
INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT 
The Army M.P.s escort General Hummel inside.  THREE ARMY GUARDS spring up from their SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.  Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid at attention.  COLONEL CALLAHAN emerges from an adjacent room, sleepy-eyed. 
COLONEL CALLAHAN General Hummel!  This is a surprise! 
HUMMEL That's the idea, Colonel. 
EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT 
Two marines position themselves outside the door to the bunker compound's elevated watch tower. 
Along one side of the lab is a plexi-glass wall. Inside the plexi-glass is an airlocked GAS CHAMBER. F.B.I chemists LONNER and LING motion to Goodspeed. 
DR. LONNER 
C'mere, Billy. (points inside gas chamber) A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas. 
INSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF POISON DETECTION INSTRUMENTS. 
ISHERWOOD Bosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it. 
GOODSPEED Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out your hand. 
Isherwood does so.  It's shaky. 
ISHERWOOD I'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it- 
Hold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO: 
INT.  GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open.  Goodspeed and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter. They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate. 
A GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes (like a salt shaker) descends from the ceiling.  Inside are COCKROACHES. . 
GOODSPEED Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys. 
DR. LING (into mike) We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed. 
GOODSPEED (into helmet mike) July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside. 
Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they gingerly lift the lid. 
INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with "UNICEF" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a POISON SENSOR past each. 
GOODSPEED Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes. 
ISHERWOOD This is thrilling. 
Isherwood lifts out a DOLL.  Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes crazy... ! 
GOODSPEED Careful, goddamn it Marvin! 
The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm. 
OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked "exhaust" and another marked "emergency." 
A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit. 
IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST FANS begin to suck it up. 
IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and explode, guts splattering the vessel walls. 
ISHERWOOD What's hap...  what's happening....? 
DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel. 
DR. LING Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're okay. 
Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and grabs A SCALPEL.  Cuts open the doll's chest. 
GOODSPEED I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits. 
ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble and corrode. 
DR. LING What's the really bad news. 
GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4 EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES. 
GOODSPEED Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building. 
Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting. 
ISHERWOOD The acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit... 
GOODSPEED Chill, Marvin. (yells outside) WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS? 
Dr. Lonner flips on the sprinklers.  The pipes KNOCK.  A FEW PATHETIC DROPS trickle from the SPRINKLER HEADS. 
DR. LONNER Something's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name are they gonna give us a new building ... 
DR. LING Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin. 
Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several 6 inch needled SYRINGES. 
DR. LING You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it. (Goodspeed continues to inspect-the device) Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote. 
Isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe. 
CARLA Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? (GOODSPEED frowns) Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years. 
GOODSPEED We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, inside and out ... 
CARLA Billy, this probably isn't the best time ... Bill, I'm uhhh. 
CARLA I'm pregnant. 
GOODSPEED 
You're what ... ? 
She holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO: 
EXT.  DESERT AREA (SOUTHWESTERN U.S.) - DAY 
TWO = Y GUNSHIPS roar over camera and land next to the two Humvees.  The Huey's doors open.  Marine Captains FRYE and DARROW, both late 20's, drag out two MARINE LANCE CORPORALS, bound and gagged, and sit them down.  Other marines roll gurneys laden with chem rounds, rockets and other equipment onto the Hueys. 
They Hueys ascend and SCREAM off across the desert and CUT TO: 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - AFTERNOON 
Establishing shots of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island in the middle of San Francisco Bay. 
EXT.  ALCATRAZ ISLAND - AFTERNOON 
A PARK RANGER (JOE) leads a group of 80 TOURISTS across the prison exercise yard.  In the background looms the city of San Francisco and Golden Gate Bridge. 
PARK RANGER JOE Alcatraz - "the Rock" - is the most famous, and was the most feared, prison ever built.  Here the inmates were allowed one hour of daily exercise. 
FEMALE TOURIST Is it really true no one escaped? 
PARK RANGER JOE True, madam.  From 1936 until the prison's closing in 1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one's believed to have made it to shore - alive at least. 
The tourists file off toward the MAIN CELL HOUSE.  Bringing up the rear are Gen.  Hummel, Maj.  Baxter, Sgt.  Crisp, Capt.  Hendrix, and Pvts. Scarpetti,.  Royce, Gamble and Starling, all in civilian clothes. 
Hummel motions to Crisp, who bleeds off with Scarpetti and Royce. Hummel and the others continue with the group. 
INT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Cell Blocks B and C, which inmates called "Broadway." A long corridor with three tiers of cells on each side. 
The Ranger leads the tourist group inside. 
PARK RANGER JOE Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly; Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells. 
The Ranger pulls the CELL DOOR OPEN/SHUT LEVER (recessed in the wall at the end of cell block).  All the cell doors on the first floor slide open. 
PARK RANGER JOE Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S. Park Service cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz - temporarily of course. 
The tourists laugh and move inside the cells. 
EXT.  ALCATRAZ - WHARF - AFTERNOON The side across from San Francisco. The TOURIST BOAT is docked in front of the U.S. PARK RANGERS' OFFICE. 
Sgt.  Crisp and Pvts.  Scarpetti and Royce walk up to the Ranger's office.  They look left and right, then enter. 
INT.  ALCATRAZ - U.S. PARK RANGERS OFFICE - AFTERNOON TWO PARK RANGERS and a SECRETARY look up. 
ALCATRAZ PARK RANGER You're not supposed to leave the tour, guys.  Is there a problem? 
SGT.  CRISP Big problem. 
INT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL BLOCK - AFTERNOON 
The tourists are in the cells, looking around.  Park Ranger Joe notices Hummel, Baxter, and the other marines standing behind him.  Smiles: 
PARK RANGER JOE Don't want to be locked up, fellahs? 
HUMMEL Not today.  You go ahead. 
PARK RANGER JOE I don't think so hah hah. 
Baxter draws a .45 and places it to Ranger ioe's head. 
HUMMEL I think so. 
Startled, Park Ranger Joe backs into a cell.  Baxter grabs the cell door open/shut lever and yanks it.  The cell doors CLANG shut.  Hummel, Baxter and the others walk off. 
TOURISTS Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going on... ? 
EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PARADE GROUND - AFTERNOON 
Hummel and Baxter walk up to the PARADE GROUND as THE TWO HUEY GUNSHIPS approach.  They hover above the parade ground.  Cpts.  Frye and Darrow rope-deploy from the Hueys.  They stand at attention, saluting Hummel and Baxter. 
CAPTAIN FRYE General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow. 
HUMMEL Well, I cannot.  So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances. 
CAPTAIN HENDRIX But General, you'll be prosecuted. 
HUMMEL Yes, Captain.  And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take your posts, gentlemen.  Semper fi. Hummel's men fall out and exit.  Baxter, the last to exit, salutes Hummel. 
INT.  PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Many people around a table, each with a DOSSIER on Hummel: 
F.B.I. Director Womack (still in tuxedo), F.B.I. agent Margie Wood, White House Chief of Staff HAYDEN SINCLAIR, National Security Advisor LOUIS LINDSTROM, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs GENERAL ALBERT KRAMER, Air Force General PETERSON, and C.I.A. Director MILTON AMWAY. 
GENERAL KRAMER Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets.  It wasn't discovered until the shift change this morning. 
ON THE SCREEN - A YOUNGER HUMMEL in Vietnam. 
GENERAL KRAMER Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time. 
MORE SLIDES OF HUMMEL in various international theaters. 
HAYDEN SINCLAIR Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal of...  Jesus. (looks up) The man is a hero. 
GENERAL KRAMER A legend.  During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C. single-handedly.  Saved his whole company.  Hence the nickname "gunfighter." 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? Anybody read it? 
RAYDEN SINCLAIR No.  Give me the skinny. 
GENERAL KRAMER The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting American lives.  I happen to share General Hummells view. 
The door opens.  A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in. 
NAVAL ATTACHE General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the table. 
GENERAL KRAMER Frank, this is Albert Kramer. 
HUMMEL Hello Al.  Howlre Judy and the kids? 
GENERAL KRAMER They're fine.  I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I. Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom, and C.I.A. Director Amway.  You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. Can you help us out? 
INTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary. 
HUMMEL I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ... 
HAYDEN SINCLAIR Southern China?  We never admitted we sent troops into China. 
There is a pause. 
HUMMEL Who is that.  Identify yourself. 
Everyone stares at sinclair. 
HAYDEN SINCLAIR White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General. 
HUMMEL How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair. 
RAYDEN SINCLAIR I'm thirty-three. 
HUMMEL Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth.  He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time. 
Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again, who hands him a phone and whispers: 
NAVAL ATTACHE The President calling from Moscow. 
Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking sotto voice. 
GENERAL KRAMER Continue Frank. 
HUMMEL Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and El Salvador.  Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen.  No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred.  These men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial. (beat) This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading Company" account to an account I designate.  From these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families.  The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses.  Am I clear? 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that? 
HUMMEL Identify yourself. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK F.B.I. Director Womack, General. 
HUMMEL You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales. 
GENERAL KRAMER Frank, Jesus, this is classified information. 
WOMACK (stunned) Is this true? 
General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes. 
HUMMEL If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from.  Good luck. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I am very uncomfortable about this. 
INT.  WOLFBURG PENITENTIARY - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT A long row of cells. CAMERA slowly DOLLIES past cell after cell.  Sullen INMATES stare blankly at us ... 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK (O.S.) I knew, I knew someday, this would come back to bite us. 
CAMERA moves through a door marked "ISOLATION." At the end of a gloomy corridor is a CAST-IRON DOOR. 
BACK TO THE PENTAGON CORRIDOR 
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly. When was the last time you saw him? 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK when he escaped from San Quentin. 
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY The man was an S.A.S. trained killer. 
BACK TO WOLFBURG - IN THE ISOLATION CELL 
TWO FEDERAL MARSHALS open the cell.'s steel locking bar.  They push open the door.  Dark inside.  A MAN sits on the bed. 
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY Can we risk letting.him out? 
A SHAFT OF LIGHT cuts across the cell floor. 
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY The question is: can we not? 
THE SHAFT OF LIGHT slices the face of JOHN PAUL MASON.  He is British, at least once was, imprisoned without trial for 33 years on U.S. soil. For now, we have no idea why. 
EXT.  WASHINGTON D.C. - DULLES AIRPORT HANGAR - MIGHT 
Raining.  An F.B.I GULFSTREAM 4 JET sits on the tarmac. 
EXT.  F.B.I. GULFSTREAM - NIGHT 
F.B.I. Director Womack sits with FRANCIS REYNOLDS, 30, an Assistant U.S. Attorney from the Justice Dept. GOODSPEED sits across the aisle. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I'm told you're our best chemical weapons man, Goodspeed. What's your education? 
GOODSPEED B.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Excellent.  What do you know about V.X. gas? 
Pause. GOODSPEED stares at Womack. 
GOODSPEED This isn't a training exercise, is it sir. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK No Goodspeed.  It's not a training exercise. 
HOLD ON GOODSPEED'S reaction, and CUT TO: 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - FEDERAL BUILDING - DAWN 
Dawn breaks over San Francisoo.  A BLACK SEDAN and BLACK SUBURBANS pull up to the F.B.I.'s West Coast office.  Goodspeed, Womack and Reynolds get out, go inside. 
INT.  F.B.I. - OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING 
We watch MASON being led into an INTERROGATION ROOM, his legs in irons, his hands cuffed behind him. 
'We are watching through a TWO-WAY MIRROR, and WIDEN TO: Womack, Goodspeed, Reynolds and ERNEST SANCHEZ, S.F. Bureau Agent in Charge, are watching Mason.  Sanchez is a gruff guy with the subtlety of a heart attack. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK The following is a state secret.  Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution.  His name is John Mason.  A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962, escaped in 1963. 
AGENT SANCHEZ Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ... 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez.  Do not argue and do not question.  He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin, from which he escaped in February, 1976.  He's been held at Wolfburg since.  He has no identity.  He does not exist.  Understood? (turns to Sanchez) I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took through the island's tunnels. 
AGENT SANCHEZ You want him conscious or unconscious afterward? 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Don't even entertain it.  This man laughs at strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either. 
GOODSPEED Why's he going to help us now? 
U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS (hands Womack PARDON) Mason's papers are in order, sir. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon. 
AGENT SANCHEZ Steep price for some information. (waves pardon away) I don't need that to get what you want. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Sanchez - try subtlety. 
AGENT SANCHEZ It's my middle name. (to Goodspeed) Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something. 
Sanchez exits. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK (grumbles) I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ... 
MASON  turns away.  As if SANCHEZ no longer exists. Suddenly, over a wall-mounted INTERCOM: 
U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS (V.O.) Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word with you? 
SANCHEZ Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail. 
SANCHEZ tosses a quarter on the desk and exits. 
IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Impressive, Sanchez. 
GOODSPEED You mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot? 
SANCHEZ He'll eat him alive. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK He's already had you for the first course. (hands GOODSPEED the pardon) Go. 
GOODSPEED takes the pardon, goes for the door. 
THE INTERROGATION ROOM 
GOODSPEED enters.  He's completely out of his element, has no idea what he's doing, and is-suddenly face-to-face with this.... MASON creature. 
The two men regard each other. 
GOODSPEED Take his cuffs off. 
The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists.  MASON rubs his wrists, staring now at Goodspeed. 
MASON Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa? 
So much for Goodspeed's confidence. 
GOODSPEED No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. (rallys) Mr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man, provided you cooperate. 
He slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason.  MASON looks at the pen, then Goodspeed. 
MASON What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed. 
GOODSPEED (lying) I'm a field agent. 
MASON Tell me what you really do. 
IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Don't answer that, GOODSPEED .... 
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM 
GOODSPEED I'm a chemical biological weapons expert. 
MASON registers this information.... 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid .... 
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM MASON stares at the pardon contract, thinking. 
MASON You said I'd be a free man.  Define free 
GOODSPEED Uhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered. 
MASON I know what the fucking word means, idiot.  In this context. 
GOODSPEED I don't understand.... 
MASON During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail? 
GOODSPEED Well yes I suppose ... 
MASON You suppose? 
GOODSPEED Yes.  You'll be outside. 
IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed. 
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM 
MASON What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed? 
GOODSPEED A hostage situation.  A matter of life and death. 
MASON thinks.  He picks up the pen. 
MASON (looks at mirror) Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists.  I want a shower and a new suit of clothes. 
INT.  GOODSPEED'S APARTMENT - DAY 
CARLA stands in the threshold of the apartment, watching the answering machine -- 
GOODSPEED (V.O.) (on the machine) I repeat, don't come to San Francisco. 
CARLA Like hell I'm not... 
She exits, slamming the door. 
INT.  F.B.I. VAN - BACK COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS , GOODSPEED clicks off the phone, thinking, nervous.GOODSPEED notices that MASON is staring at him. 
MASON (sotto) Who's Carla?  And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco? 
GOODSPEED doesn't answer.  He notices the F.B.I. AGENTS staring at Mason and him. He straightens up. 
GOODSPEED You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know. 
MASON You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed? 
The van STOPS: the rear doors open to the FAIRMONT HOTEL SERVICE ENTRANCE. 
INT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY Top floor suite with a private elevator.  Grand, with French doors leading to a balcony. Director Womack, GOODSPEED and F.B.I.Agents Star and Hunt are in the room.  Jackets off, shoulder holsters on. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I personally picked this suite. (points at elevator) Only one exit. 
IN THE SUITE'S BATHROOM 
Steamy, from the shower.  F.B.I. Agent Cord sits on the sink.  MASON'S VOICE emanates from the shower.  He's singing some ditty off-key.  But MASON isn't washing. 
INSIDE THE SHOWER STALL -- Mason's tampering with the BELL HOUSING of THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE on the shower wall. 
MASON pops off the bell-housing. he pulls out the nylon clothesline cord (it's thick, about 10 ft.) and rips it from the bell housing.  Tests its strength. 
Satisfied, he knots A NOOSE on one end of the clothesline cord, then coils. 
IN THE BATHROOM - MASON emerges from the shower wearing a huge hotel bathrobe. 
Cord hands him a SUIT OF CLOTHES.  MASON inspects them. 
MARSHAL CORD Put 'em on.  You've got forty-five minutes. 
MASON You going to stand there and watch? 
MARSHAL CORD That's right. 
MASON well if it excites-you ... 
MARSHAL CORD Put the goddamn clothes on. 
IN THE SUITE'S LIVING ROOM Womack is dumping the contents of a BARBER'S BAG on the sideboard. 
Hands THE HOTEL BARBER, a swishy guy, a COMB, ELECTRIC TRIMMER and BIB. The BARBER frowns. 
BARBER I can't do a decent job with these. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK That's all you get. 
BARBER I'm an artist, not a barber. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK (holds up scissors) without these he can't stab you in the throat. 
MASON, dressed, emerges from the bathroom.  Motions the barber toward the balcony. 
MASON Shall we do this outside?  In the sunshine? 
The barber gulps.  Follows MASON onto the balcony. 
ON THE SUITE'S BALCONY MASON sits in the sun on a balcony chair.  Bib on. 
BARBER How would you like it sir? 
MASON whatever's in style. 
BARBER oh fabulous.  You look shabby.  Shall I snip and cut the shabbiness away? 
The barber begins trimming Mason's hair... 
THE BALCONY - SOME MINUTES LATER Mason's hair and beard are neatly trimmed.  The barber holds a mirror up; MASON examines himself. 
MASON Good.  Thank-you. 
The barber stands.  Clears his throat.  Rubs his thumb and forefinger together. 
MASON Yes of course.  My secretary will take care of you.- (to Agent Star) See to the good man will you? 
MASON  looks at Humvee's CELLULAR PHONE.  Grabs it.  Studies it. He's never used one before. 
MASON Modern conveniences.  Cheers. (punches numbers) San Francisco. Jade Angelou.  That's A..n..g..e..l .... 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS (HILL #1) - DAY AT THE INTERSECTION - THE TRAFFIC LIGHT is red.  A SPARKLETTS WATER TRUCK proceeds into the intersection. 
103 INT.  MASON'S   CAR - DRIVING - DAY 
MASON runs the red light.  The Sparkletts truck is in the intersection. MASON  violently throws the wheel.  The Humvee swerves to avoid the Sparkletts truck -- 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS (TOP OF HILL #1) ~ DAY -- but doesn't make it.  Mason's Humvee SLAMS into the Sparkletts truck's BACK END, knocking it sideways.  The HUMVEE blasts through the intersection as -- 
70 WATER BOTTLES (5 gallon each) tumble off the Sparkletts truck.  The bottles roll down the hill, gaining speed. 
104A INT.  MASON'S HUMVEE ~ DAY the call connects. 
JADE ANGELOU (O.S.) Hello? MASON Is this Jade Angelou? 
JADE ANGELOU (O.S.) Yes.  Who is this?

INT.  GOODSPEED'S FERRARI - DAY 
GOODSPEED Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing? HE'S ON THE PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit. Gotta go. 
GOODSPEED looks at SPARKLETTS BOTTLES bearing down on him 
INT.  S.F. POLICE CRUISER - DAY Two S.F. PATROLMEN.  Their eyes widen too as -- THE SPARKLETTS BOTTLES are bouncing now, roll down on them at 45 m.p.h. A BOTTLE SMASHES through the windshield, showering the Patrolmen with glass. 
EXT.  SAN FPANCISCO STPEETS - (MIDWAY UP HILL #1) - DAY Chaos.  Bottle after bottle smashes down on the - 
front-running vehicles.  DENTING HOODS.  SMASHING WINDSHIELDS.  THREE F.B.I. SEDANS and GOODSPEED'S FERRARI negotiate the crashing cars. 
They race through the carnage after Mason. 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS -   . (HILL #2) - DAY 
MASON'S HUMVEE explodes over the crest of a hill at 90 m.p.h. and soars. A beat, then -- 
THE F.B.I. SEDANS, followed by GOODSPEED'S FERRARI soar over the crest of the hill. 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - (BOTTOM OF HILL #2) - DAY At the intersection here, TWO S.F. ROAD WORKERS are sliding a STEEL PLATE over a 6 ft. deep ditch cut in the asphalt (for a water main or equivalent). 
The Road Workers, hearing the WAIL OF MASON'S HUMVEE, look up and dive away just at THE HUMVEE blasts over he steel plate, dislodging it from its positioning.  It TEETERS on the lip of the ditch. 
THE F.B.I. SEDAN hits the teetering steel plate, which collapses -- causing the sedan to be swallowed up halfway into the ditch, it's rear end sticking up in the air.  Seconds pass, then -- 
THE SECOND F.B.I. SEDAN SLAMS into the frontrunning SEDAN'S..EXPOSED UNDERCARRIAGE.  Both vehicles are obliterated. 
GOODSPEED'S FERRARI, in the most hair-raising slide ever filmed, veers and misses the mangled F.B.I. sedans. 
Now it's just MASON and GOODSPEED and CUT TO: 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - (TOP OF HILL #3) - DAY 
MASON'S HUMVEE, with GOODSPEED'S FERRARI close behind, races down a street on the crest of a hill. 
IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD - A CABLE CAR is turning down the hill. Mason's Humvee also turns down the hill, but as the Humvee rounds the corner -- 
AN OLD WOMAN starts crossing the street.  MASON  throws the wheel swerving to avoid her, and -- 
-- THE HUMVEEIS BUMPER catches the BACK OF THE CABLE CAR, dislodging its rear steel wheels from the CABLE CAR TPACKS.  With the front wheels still lodged in the tracks, the cable car becrins to slide sideways. 
GOODSPEED'S FERRARI clears the cable car's sliding back end and sprints after Mason's Humvee. 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - MIDWAY DOWN HILL #3 - DAY 
the Humvee and Ferrari blast down the hill.  The street is thick with vehicular traffic. 
So THE HUMVEE swerves, leaving the street. 
onto the sidewalk.  Where... SNAP SNAP SNAP it knocks down every parking meter, then hits A LADDER in a cordoned off area.  On the ladder, a LINEMAN is fixing a MUNICIPAL POWER LINE.  The ladder collapses; THE LINEMAN falls, flailing through the air. 
GOODSPEED slams on the brakes.  The Ferrari spins 180 degrees and lurches to a stop facing uphill. 
INT.  GOODSPEED'S FERRARI - DAY THE AIR BAG'S exploded in Goodspeed's face. GOODSPEED Shit shit SHIT SHIT ... 
EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - MIDWAY DOWN HILL #3 - DAY 
GOODSPEED looks up the hill.  GOODSPEED'S EYES bug. 
GOODSPEED'S POV - THE CABLE CAR is still sliding down the hill sideways. 
THE SLIDING CABLE CAR, its wheels SPEWING SPARKS down the hill.  The LAST PASSENGER dives. it's now empty and sliding straight for Goodspeed's Ferrari ... 
MASON I'm here with you, aren't I? 
JADE Why now?  I mean why today. 
MASON I was driving through San Francisco.  I decided it was time. 
JADE Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result. You can imagine I'm pretty confused. 
MASON I tried to explain in my letters. 
JADE Ahh.  Your letters.  They weren't very easy to follow. 
She fishes in her pocket.  Pulls out A LETTER.  WHOLE SECTIONS OF THE LETTER have been scissored out.  Mason. frowns. 
MASON I see. (grumbles) Bloody prison censors. 
JADE How about explaining now? 
In the b.g. we HEAR POLICE SIRENS.  MASON looks around. 
MASON Maybe this isn't the best time... (off her look) Jade.  Here sitdown. 
MASON and Jade sit on a bench.  MORE SIRENS in the b.9. MASON looks off nervously. 
MASON All will be explained.  You must trust me on this. Someday very soon, after I get a few things settled, I will come back for you.  What I need to know is: do you want me in your life? 
JADE How can I answer that?  I don't know if we can.... after 19 years, just start like that. 
MASON We are the same blood. 
JADE But I don't know you. 
MASON where to begin. (sighs) My name is John Paul Mason.  I'm Scottish. I attended Dartmouth Naval College.  My favorite color is green.  I like books.  I like a good joke.  At one time I shot a pretty fair round of golf.  I'm in my 60's and I've been in jail half my life. (Jade looks away) Maybe it's better I go. 
She smiles.  Puts her hands on his. 
JADE No. You're doing okay. 
Police sirens BLARE.  And the entire park.is suddenly surrounded by F.B.I. AND POLICE VEHICLES. 
JADE You lied to me. 
GOODSPEED approaches.  MASON makes no attempt to move.  Jade turns to him. 
GOODSPEED (flashes his I.D.) F.B.I. miss.  Your father is working with us.  He's helping us resolve a.... (looks at Mason) .... dangerous situation. 
JADE He is? 
GOODSPEED Yes madam.  We've got to go, John. 
MASON  extends his hand to Jade.  She takes it. 
MASON Jade - remember what I said. 
They hug.  Then MASON walks off with GOODSPEED and -- 
-- Jade opens her hand, revealing the PIECE OF PAPER upon which Mason wrote his instructions. 
ACROSS THE PARK - F.B.I. AGENTS STAR and CORD run up. 
GOODSPEED (sharply) No cuffs until we get to the cars, 
They continue toward the waiting cars. 
MASON You surprise me, Goodspeed.  Now I'm going to surprise myself: thank-you, you could have handled that differently. 
GOODSPEED (tight) You almost got me killed.  Twice. 
MASON Hows your jaw? 
GOODSPEED wheels on MASON and swings.  SNATCH.  MASON catches Goodspeed's fist.  Three inches from his face. 
GOODSPEED It hurts. 
SANCHEZ, DIRECTOR WOMACK and the F.B.I. AGENTS approach. Womack's arm is in a sling; he's in a volcanic rage. 
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK You cocksucker you dislocated my shoulder and cost the city of San Francisco ten million dollars.  You try to escape again and Agent Chaney here will break your legs. 
AGENT CHANEY, large and mean, comes to Mason's side. 
MASON Pleased to meet you. 
INT.  PIER 39 - F.B.I. COMMAND CENTER - DAY Night is falling.  A large warehouse room with windows looking out to Alcatraz Island.  Looks like N.A.S.A. 
AT A RECTANGULAR TABLE - MASON sits at the head of the table 122 in front of a SCALE MODEL OF ALCATRAZ.  COMMANDER ANDERSON and ten NAVY S.E.A.L.s look toward Mason. 
SANCHEZ Chemical Weapons isn't a cakewalk, Goodspeed. 
GOODSPEED splashes cold water on his face. 
GOODSPEED I've got some bad news and some really bad news sir.  Maybe the bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good .... 
SANCHEZ Spit it out. 
GOODSPEED My girlfriend's pregnant. 
SANCHEZ (pause) What's the really bad news. 
INT.  PIER 39 - OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - DAY 
SANCHEZ (V.0.) Goodspeed, GODDAMN IT ...

HUMMEL (V.O.) Hummel. 
SECURITY ADVISOR LOUIS LINDSTROM Hello Frank, Lou Lindstrom.  I'm in the oval office with General Kramer. 
INTERCUT - ALCATRAZ INFIRMARY / WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE 
GENERAL KRAMER We're having some problems with the account transfer, Frank. 
HUMMEL Don't tell me your problems, tell me your solutions. 
GENERAL KRAMER We've spoken to the President. He's not too happy about this. 
Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair enters. 
HUMMEL Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance ... 
HAYDEN SINCLAIR The only thing the President will give you is a fair trial after you're caught, General. 
HUMMEL That you, Sinclair?  What exactly do you do at the White House? Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine? Are you his golf caddy, Sinclair? 
HAYDEN SINCLAIR Now you give me some coddamn respect, General .... 
HUMMEL You want respect, you child, you coffee server?  Let's talk about Dave Ridgeway. 
GENERAL KRAMER Who's Dave Ridgeway, Frank? 
HUMMEL A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle.  His mother and young wife were told by the Pentagon that he went A.W.O.L. Let's talk about the respect he got. 
LOUIS LINDSTROM This is going nowhere Frank .... 
HUMMEL Then let me tell you what is: The most lethal poison gas known to man into San Franciscols business district.  You have twelve hours to deliver the money or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen. 
CLICK.  National Security Advisor Lindstrom stares at the phone.  Shakes his head. 
LOUIS LINDSTROM What's the word from Mojave? 
GENERAL KRAMER General Petersen can give us no definite assurance on the Willy Peter capability. 
The men stare grimly at each other. 
LOUIS LINDSTROM Greenlight the S.E.A.L. incursion. 
General Kramer picks up the phone and CUT TO: 
EXT.  NAVAL AIRSTRIP (INCURSION STAGING AREA) - DUSK- The INCURSION STAGING AREA (a base in the S.F. vicinity) GOODSPEED and MASON, in black dry suits, join COMMANDER ANDERSON and nine other S.E.A.L.s. 
Four S.E.A.L.s will be identified: BOYER, REIGERT, DANDO, and SHEPHERD. 
COMMANDER ANDERSON Listen up, men.  Mr. MASON here will run point for us.  Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your hip, Mason.  You breath, he breathes with you.  Understand? 
LIEUTENANT SHEPHERD, young, laconic, nods at Mason. 
The FIBER-OPTIC CAMERA turns, looking in a 360 degree radius, and transmitting images of -- 
THE PRISON SHOWER - a tiled room with shower heads and a 20 160A ft. ceiling.  Above, a mezzanine circles the showers; here Alcatraz's guards once watched inmates below.. 
INT.  DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT 
Commander Anderson views the shower room images on a TINY (2 inch by 2 inch) WRIST-HELD VIDEO MONITOR.  The shower is deserted, but there's something of interest ~- 
A MOTION DETECTOR (a blue beam flashed from a transmitter to 161A a receptor) across the grate. 
COMMANDER ANDERSON Motion sensor. 
Anderson gingerly lifts the grate.  Reigert wiggles his hands past the edges of the grate and nudges the beam transmitter (with one hand) and the beam receiver (with the other) away from the grate. 
INT.  INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 
A SILENT ALARM next to Pvt.  Royce blinks on.  Royce turns to Maj. Baxter. 
ROYCE Sir.  Anti-disturbance temblar tripped in the shower.  We got visitors. 
INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - SHOWER ROOM 
The grate pops open.  S.E.A.IL.s BOYER and REIGERT, wearing NIOHT VISION GLASSES, emerge taking defensive positions back-to-back.  Commander Anderson follows.  Then, one by one, the rest of the S.E.A.L.s emerge. 
COMMANDER ANDERSON (to Lt.  Shepherd in the drainage pipe) Stand fast. We'll secure the area. 
ANDERSON directs Boyer and Reigert to a TILED COLUMN.  They creep across the tiled floor, taking "check and defefid" positions behind the shower's TILED COLUMNS.  But suddenly, shockingly.....FLOODLIGHTS flash on.  Coming from the mezzanine above. 
The S.E.A.L.s whip off their night vision goggles. 
165 INT.  PIER 3-9 - MOBILE COMMAND TRAILER - NIGHT 
ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - We see the illumination of the shower room (transmitted from the S.E.A.L.s cameras.) 
SANCHEZ What's that...what the hell is that? 
INT.  ALCATRAZ - DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT Goodspeed, Mason, and Lt.  Shepherd react to the sudden illumination above. GOODSPEED (whispers:) What's going on? 
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD (whispers) Don't know. 
INT.  SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT 
The S.E.A.L.s whirl around, startled, unnerved, squinting into the blinding whiteness of the floodlights. 
HUMMEL (V.O.) Drop your weapons. 
The S.E.A.L.s, terrified, hesitate but do not drop their weapons They stand back-to-back, weapons trained at the catwalk. squinting into the white light. 
The S.E.A.L.s behind the tiled columns take cover. we cannot yet see Hummel and the marines.  This plays with as much tension as possible. The situation is chilling: 
COMMANDER ANDERSON Anderson here, General Hummel. Commander.  Team Leader. 
HUMMEL (V.O.) Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck at their feet- 
INT.  PIER 39 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 
ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - We see the floodlights above on the Mezzanine and hear Hummells voice: 
SANCHEZ Oh Christ this isn't happening. 
INT.  ALCATRAZ - SHOWER ROOM MEZZANINE- NIGHT 
HUMMEL looks down at the S.E.A.L.s. Baxter's text to him.  The other marines are at positions around the mezzanine perimeter, M-16's trained and ready. 
COMMANDER ANDERSON Sir, we know why you're out here.  God knows I agree with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against all enemies.  Foreign, sir, and domestic. (shouts now) General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud.  You know goddamn well that I cannot give that order... 
BEHIND A COLUMN - S.E.A.L.s REIGERT and BOYER stare into the floodlights. 
HUMMEL Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.  I'm not going to ask again. 
ON THE MEZZANINE 
CPTS.  FRYE, DARROW and PVTS.  COX, MCCOY, have their weapons trained; they're pumped and trigger happy. 
HUMMEL Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here. 
COMMANDER ANDERSON You men following the General: You are United States Marines and under oath you forgotten that?  We all have shipmates we remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that doesn't give you the right to mutiny. 
HUMMEL That's a nice speech, Commander.  I heard plenty like it in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.  They all added up to zero.  Pretty words aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander.  Now abort this mission. Goddamn it, abort. 
BEHIND THE COLUMN - S.E.A.L. BOYER, just 20, having never seen combat, is trembling with fear, indecision. 
S.E.A.L. BOYER It's us or them, Reigert, fuck they're gonna waste us ... 
S.E.A.L. REIGERT Get a grip on yourself .... 
MASON No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think? 
GOODSPEED You don't have to get all bent out of shape. 
MASON What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel I was going through to freedom five minutes ago. 
GOODSPEED All right, all right.  Don't call me idiot, okay? 
MASON what did I do to deserve this?  What God did I offend ..... 
GOODSPEED begins to wade into the pool. 
MASON Stop. (GOODSPEED stops) There.  And there. 
GOODSPEED squints.  The water slithers with COTTONMOUTHS. MASON unpack the QUART OF MOTOR OIL in spray bottle. 
MASON Cottonmouth snakes.  They breath through their skin.  Oil clogs it.  They hate the stuff. 
MASON sprays the motor oil across the pool.  The snakes scatter.  The pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK.  MASON wades in.  Goodspeed follows. 
The COTTONMOUTHS, repulsed by the oil, stay away. GOODSPEED tries not to look at the snakes.  They make it across. 
GOODSPEED Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're the convict, and you have all the guns. 
MASON slaps the .9 MM pistol into Goodspeed's hand walks off. GOODSPEED follows. 
INT.  ALCATRAZ - TUNNEL UNDER PRISON MORGUE - NIGHT 
MASON  and GOODSPEED arrive at a fork in the tunnel. _ 
DOWN THE FORK IN THE TUNNEL - is the PRISON MONO-RAIL SYSTEM: a single rail suspended from the tunnel ceiling, upon which SMALL CARTS are suspended. 
GOODSPEED The morgue? 
MASON  nods.  Moves to a STEEL-RUNGED LADDER leading to a GARBAGE CHUTE against the wall.  			GOODSPEED follows. 
INT.  ROOM ADJACENT TO MORGUE - NIGHT 
MASON and GOODSPEED emerge from the garbage chute.  They hear VOICES in the next room. 
INT.  MORGUE - NIGHT 
PVTS.  GAMBLE and STARLING are guarding the poison. Starling's walking around.  Gamble's seated on a MORTICIANIS TABLE, smoking. 
The door bursts open.  MASON stands in the doorway.  GAMBLE dives away. STARLING whirls, raising his M-16. 
MASON'S HAND flashes.  THE SAW-TOOTHED KNIFE flies the length of the room and buries in Starling's neck. 
MASON Never hesitate. 
Gamble fires from his position around the corner.  MASON and Goodspeed dive for cover behind a cabinet. GOODSPEED fires from cover without looking, his gun raised over the cabinet.  Mason, underneath the cabinet, fires at GAMBLE'S FOOT.  Gamble, shot, hits the deck. 
GAMBLE unclips a GRENADE.  Before he can pull the pin.... 
MASON FIRES HIS CLIP EMPTY at the AIR CONDITIONER MOUNT on the ceiling above Gamble.  The mount gives; the ENORMOUS AIR CONDITIONER falls, crushing Gamble.  Gamble's GRENADE, still secured with the pin, rolls away. 
GOODSPEED rises.  Looks at Gamble under the air conditioner.  Just HIS LEGS stick out. (Note: the rest of the scene's action plays out around Gamble's legs. 
GOODSPEED You didn't learn that in prison. 
MASON No, and I used to be a lot quicker. 
GOODSPEED I've got some questions for you but they can wait. 
GOODSPEED opens the CORPSE DRAWERS revealing the V.X-. CHEM ROUNDS (shaped like big tennis ball cans). 
GOODSPEED carefully lifts out a chem round.  MASON grabs one, accidentally knocking it against the drawer. 
GOODSPEED Careful.  The second you don't respect this, it kills you. 
GOODSPEED and MASON set the V.X. chem rounds on the mortician's table. GOODSPEED pulls out his EQUIPMENT KIT.  Begins detaching the tops of the chem rounds. 
GOODSPEED reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out..... a STRAND OF V.X. POISON PEARLS: ping-pong ball sized glass bubbles filled with poison. 
GOODSPEED I need a hand here. (MASON looks anxiously at the poison pearls.) Mason.  Now. 
GOODSPEED hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.  MASON  holds it like a string of wind chimes. 
MASON What...  exactly does this do to you? 
GOODSPEED Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system. (hands over another poison pearl strand) Then loss of muscular function. Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled on the floor, then your skin turns black... 
MASON stares uneasily at the pearl strands. 
MASON Sounds like my first marriage. 
IN CART 1 - MASON  AND GOODSPEED duck as the GRENADE PROJECTILE wings over their heads, continues down the tunnel and DETONATES against the tunnel wall. 
CART 1 roars through smoke and debris left by grenade explosion.  As it rounds a corner, MASON grabs A SPLINTERED TIMBER and releases from the cart.  CART 1, with GOODSPEED alone continues down the mono-rail. 
MASON  yanks down a 5 ft. long BROKEN SECTION OF SEWAGE PIPE and presses himself against the tunnel wall. 
AS CART 2 rounds the corner... 
WHAM!!  MASON  swings, hitting Scarpetti flush in the forehead, killing him and blowing him off the cart.  Cart 2, without Scarpetti, continues down the mono-rail. 
MASON  waits.  As CART 3 rounds the corner 
MASON  swings again But Hendrix is waiting for it. Hendrix grabs the swinging pipe and pulls MASON into Cart 3! 
IN CART 3 - HENDRIX AND MASON FIGHT SCENE 
Mason's sprawled on the floor of the cart.  Hendrix levels his M-16. MASON whipsaws the legs under Hendrix, bowling him over, the M-16 falling away from the cart. 
MASON and Hendrix get to their feet.. They trade blow after blow as the Cart ROARS through the tunnel. 
IN CART 1 ~ GOODSPEED looks over his shoulder at MASON and Hendrix locked in mortal combat.  He pulls the CART BRAKE.  Cart 1 begins slowing down.  CART 2 (Scarpettils) rams into it. Now Carts 1 and 2 are together.  And on comes -- 
CART 3 - Hendrix knocks MASON to the floor of the cart.  Hendrix dives atop Mason, strangling him. mason's head is bent over the front lip of the cart.  MASON looks down the mono-rail track.  To his horror he sees CARTS 1 and 2 slowing down ... 
IN CART 1 - 			GOODSPEED realizes that his cart is going to ram Mason's outstretched head.  He releases the brake, and Cart 1 picks up speed ... 
IN CART 3 - Hendrix draws the knife.  Hendrix raises the knife.  With his last strength, MASON rolls away.  Hendrix plunges the knife down, missing Mason, him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the front lip of the cart.  MASON SCREAMS at Goodspeed. 
MASON BRAKE! ! ! 
IN CART 1 - GOODSPEED pulls the cart brake and -- 
-- CART 3 SLAMS into CARTS 1 and 2 at 20 m.p.h., crushing Hendrixls head and torso between Carts 2 and 3. 
The collision knocks MASON off Cart 3, SLAMMING his head against the tunnel wall.  MASON  falls unconscious.to the tunnel floor, while -- 
-- CART 1 is shoved by the collision across.a DITCH OF WATER in the tunnel floor. GOODSPEED groggily gets to his feet. Jumps down from the cart. 
GOODSPEED Mason! 
In the midst of this PVT.  ROYCE runs up.  Sees MASON concussed, helpless.  Royce draws his GLINTING KNIFE.  Kneels over Mason.  He's going to cut his throat. 
GOODSPEED Wait. 
Royce lowers the knife.  Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed.  The ditch is 20 ft. wide and filled with dank, stagnant water and we've seen dank, stagnant water before. 
GOODSPEED Pretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me? Punk. (beat) What're you waiting for?  Limp dick. 
ROYCE I am going to fuck you up something fierce.  You rolled the wrong number, shithead.  You crapped out. 
And ROYCE begins to wade into the ditch.  And GOODSPEED is looking at the water, waiting... ROYCE is waist deep now. Royce feels something. He winces.  Looks down at -- 
FIVE COTTONMOUTH SNAKES, fangs wide and white, plunging into him.  Royce screams.  His knees buckle.  He falls to his knees in the water.  A COTTONMOUTH stuck to his neck... Royce SHRIEKS again ... 
And slides gently under the water. 
GOODSPEED I rolled snake-eyes.  Shithead. 
Goodspeed, hand over hand on the monorail, eases the cart across the stagnant ditch.  Hops out.  MASON gets to his feet.  The two exchange a look. 
MASON Limp dick? 
GOODSPEED It's all I could think of. 
They stumble off down the mono-rail tunnel. 
MASON I think I've got arthritis.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - GOODSPEED'S CELL - MORNING 
GOODSPEED stares blankly into space.  INTERCUT between the two cells again. 
GOODSPEED Jesus. (thinks) Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was?  Make a trade? 
MASON Some trade.  They'd get the microfilm and I'd get a bullet in the head. 
GOODSPEED I see your point.  Something's been on my mind.  About your escape. 
MASON What? 
MASON  rises.  Lifts the bed.  Pulls off the bed's heavy ROLLING CASTER. Knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope. 
GOODSPEED You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe - that much I've got ' But... howld you get out of your cell? 
MASON leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell block.  The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length. 
GOODSPEED (cont'd) I only ask because, in our current situation, it might be useful information ... 
The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the rolling caster tied to it.  MASON  holds the other end of the rope through the bars of his cell. 
MASON Trade secret, Billy, I'll tell you this:	it was easier than getting in. 
MASON fiercely yanks the rope toward him.  The heavy rolling caster jerks from the floor.  The CASTER, pulling the rope, flies past Mason's cell -- 
-- shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block, still pulling the rope, where -- 
-- the caster-pulled ROPE catches the CELL RELEASE LEVER against the wall.  The rope coils, WRAP WRAP WHAP, around the release lever handle. 
MASON tugs the rope taut like he's just snagged a fish. Then he pulls slowly and delicately. 
THE CELL DOOR RELEASE LEVER pulls down and -- 
-~ MASON'S CELL DOOR (and all the doors on that tier) open at once.  And MASON smiles. 
INT.  GOODSPEED'S CELL - MORNING GOODSPEED hears the doors opening above him. 
GOODSPEED Hey!  Hey what's happening? (no response) Mason.  Mason? 
Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens. GOODSPEED exits the cell.  MASON stands there. 
MASON You're on your own, kid.  Your gear's over there. 
MASON  motions to a HEAP OF THEIR GEAR (clothes, weapons, flares) in the corner of the cell tier. 
GOODSPEED Shit.... 
GOODSPEED grabs his guns and gear and follows after Mason. 225  EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel sits behind the desk.  Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him. Silence.  Hummel stares at his phone.  The tension is palpable.

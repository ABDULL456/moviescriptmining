HONEYDRIPPER 
Written by 
John Sayles 
We hear a strange, single, BENT NOTE. 
1   EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - ECU FINGERS - LATE AFTERNOON        1 We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption- 
WIDER 
SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire. 
His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them- 
LONNIE Leave off with that, Scratch. 
SCRATCH Aint bothering you. 
LONNIE Yes it is.     That aint no kind of music. 
We see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it- 
SCRATCH Least I make a sound. 
LONNIE Yeah and it's a nasty one. 
Lonnie looks at the sky- 
SCRATCH You want to try again tonight? 
Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from the setting sun- 
LONNIE Might as well. 
2   EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON                        2 SLIDE GUITAR plays. A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS- 
We TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON, the bolls plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze. 
A HARVEST HAND steps into the shot, looks toward the setting sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the row in front of him. We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them. 
The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction- 
3   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PINEY WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON                3 MUSIC CONTINUES.   We see the boys walking on a PATH through the PINES- 
4   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, RAILROAD TRACKS - AERIAL SHOT - LATE         4 AFTERNOON 
MUSIC CONTINUES. We float over RAILROAD TRACKS cutting through flat, piney woods, catching up the boys, who walk on the ties- 
5   EXT. ARMY BARRACKS - EARLY EVENING                             5 MUSIC CONTINUES. The boys stroll past white buildings of an ARMY BARRACKS. SOLDIERS, black and white, DRILL on the grounds- 
6   EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE, RIVER - EARLY EVENING                    6 The river rolls past us in the FG as the boys cross a RAILROAD BRIDGE. We SUPERIMPOSE- 
ALABAMA   -   1950 
OPENING CREDITS END 
7   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT                               7 We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads. 
BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up with Lonnie and Scratch. 
The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and go up on their toes to peek in through a window- 
8   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                     8 An OVERHEAD ANGLE of long fingers on piano keys- 
SINGER 
A woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY, leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS- 
BERTHA MAE I know a gal name of Betty Sue Shook it so much She got the German flu No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same 
As she sings we PAN and TRACK, moving through the large, near- empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE- 
BERTHA MAE You women don't worry About your life She made Jack the Ripper Throw away his knife- 
Only a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and bar stools. A pretty young woman in her late teens, CHINA DOLL, is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening aimlessly. 
STOKELY Cause he does all his best work on his knees. 
Stokely almost chokes with laughter- 
MACEO Never mind him, he just a drunk- 
STOKELY I hear she put a ring through it and use it to yank him around the house. 
Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm- 
MACEO You know Tyrone don't allow no scufflin here, Slick. 
STOKELY I oughta get me a old woman too, take care of the groceries. Just got to sweet-talk her some, give her a good poke now and then- 
MACEO You gonna drink, Stokely, or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head you about to get? 
DELILAH Gentlemen- 
They all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the back of the club. She is dressed for church- 
SLICK (doffs his hat)    Miss Delilah- 
DELILAH Let's behave ourselves. (sees) What are you boys doing in here? Out! 
Lonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out.   Delilah turns her attention to China Doll- 
DELILAH And what are you doing behind that bar? 
CHINA DOLL It's just for a minute. 
DELILAH That's sixty seconds too long. Maceo, you get back there and take that child's place. 
China Doll mopes as she steps out from behind- 
DELILAH You bring people their food. Don't you be messing with their liquor. 
CHINA DOLL Nobody's eating. 
DELILAH That's cause nobody's here but these couple lost souls, haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil. 
Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the door- 
BERTHA MAE At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer- 
Maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of NADINE, a large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has just stepped in- 
NADINE Evenin, Maceo. You lookin good tonight. 
MACEO Likewise, Miss Nadine.   What can I do for you? 
NADINE (flirting) You know what you can do for me, sweet man. 
Maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time- 
MACEO What would you like to drink? 
DOORWAY 
Ty watches the CROWD in front of the Ace of Spades.   Delilah comes up to join him, indicates his drink- 
DELILAH How many is that tonight? 
TY Don't dog me about that, baby.   Not tonight. 
DELILAH I don't want China Doll behind that bar. 
TY She got to help out. 
DELILAH Not there she doesn't. You know she's not sposed to get excited- 
TY Not much chance of that in here. (wistful) Harvest hands all been crowdin into Toussaint's place. The young ones. 
DELILAH You'll get some of them. 
TY They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they gone. 
DELILAH (joking)   Maybe that's the wages of sin. 
BERTHA MAE You know where to find me if you need me. 
Bertha Mae pulls Slick out the door. China Doll watches after them, troubled, while Ty pours himself another drink- 
MACEO (softly)   I put the box on now, Ty? 
TY Yeah.   Put the box on. 
MACEO Imonna crank it up some, see if we can draw a little life in here- 
Maceo crosses and plugs an ancient-looking tabletop JUKEBOX in. 
The jukebox sputters to life, LIGHTS FLASHING ON and MUSIC BLARING for a moment, then the LIGHTS FLICKER and all the POWER in the club goes OFF! 
9   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                     9 The Honeydripper SIGN is the last to FLICKER and DIE. 
Lonnie and Scratch watch from under the streetlight- 
LONNIE There it go again. 
SCRATCH Lectricity don't like that jukebox. 
10   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                   10 DARKNESS. 
MACEO Damn. 
TY China Doll? 
A MATCH is struck, FLARES as China Doll lights a KEROSENE LAMP she's pulled from under the bar- 
CHINA DOLL Got to get the power company in here- 
TY No you don't. They turned my juice off last month- don't want them sniffin around that splice job Maceo done. 
MACEO Must be a short circuit in the juke here- 
He yanks the plug out of the wall as Ty steps up to reassure the few patrons- 
TY Don't worry folks, bar's still open. 
NADINE It's nice like this.   Kind of romantic. 
MACEO Imonna have to go out back, wiggle some things around. 
NADINE Don't be wigglin nothin round less I'm there to see it. 
Maceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a FLASHLIGHT. He freezes in his tracks as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM hits a FIGURE standing in the doorway- 
It is SHERIFF HIRAM PUGH, large and in charge.    Pugh strolls into the club as if he owns it. 
SHERIFF PUGH Evenin, folks. 
TY Evenin, Sheriff. 
Sheriff Pugh looks around the near-empty club- 
SHERIFF PUGH Your lights gone out. 
TY Looks like it. 
SHERIFF PUGH Don't know but that be a vilation of somethin or other. 
Ty has played this game before, trying to hold his ground without pissing off the white man with the badge- 
TY We just about to close up here. 
Pugh sniffs the air- 
SHERIFF PUGH Your wife been cookin? 
TY Not tonight.   Went to the revival tent. 
SHERIFF PUGH (grins) I stood by there a while. Them nigras was singin up a storm. 
Ty doesn't respond. Sheriff Pugh stops right next to Stokely, giving him a dead-pan stare as he speaks. Stokely won't meet his eyes- 
SHERIFF PUGH I just come out here to look in on Toussaint- had that shooting two nights ago. 
SHACK THOMAS (points) Switchman's shed, right over there, has got a cot. Don't mind the rats none, less you got food on you- and I can see you and a good meal has been strangers for some time. 
Sonny looks at the shed, unenthusiastic- 
SHACK THOMAS You get into town tomorrow an need somethin, tell em Shack Thomas sent you. They know who you talkin about. 
SONNY Thanks. Hey, what's the name of this town? 
Shack points to the SIGN hanging down from the lip of the platform roof- 
SIGN 
HARMONY The sign reads- 
SONNY (O.S.) Name like that, must be a good place for musicians. 
PLATFORM 
Shack laughs as he heads away- 
SHACK THOMAS Only night I ever spent in jail was a town called Liberty. Sun comes up, you'll see where you landed. And you best be out of that shed by first light. 
13   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - LATE NIGHT - CU MONEY                    13 A few wet, crumpled BILLS and dirty COINS are spread out on the bartop- 
MACEO (O.S.) It's just a weekday night- 
WIDER 
Still operating by LANTERN LIGHT, Ty and Maceo look at the night's dismal take, as China Doll lays chairs on top of tables- 
TY I owe the chicken man, I owe the ice man, I owe the liquor man- 
MACEO Least you don't owe the electric company. 
TY (indicates the dark room)    Yeah, that's a big relief. 
MACEO (worried)    You thinkin bout closing down? 
Ty frowns, reaches under the counter and brings up a POSTER. He spreads it out on the counter top. It reads- 
SPECIAL ATTRACTION 
New Orleans Singing Sensation 
`GUITAR' SAM 
TY What you think? 
MACEO Biggest act in New Orleans, got him a hit on the radio- 
TY He's playing here Saturday night. Figured I'd wait till Bertha Mae was gone to put this up. 
Ty turns to look for the right spot to fix the poster- 
MACEO Here?   You mean like in this room here? 
TY You know the Tomcat Club in Texarkana? 
MACEO Big Jim Jamison's place- 
TY Just went out of business. 
MACEO Damn- 
TY And since Sam is giggin his way over to Tulsa, that means he got the date open- 
MACEO But you aint never had a guitar pl- 
Ty gives Maceo a warning look, which China Doll notes- 
TY I'm having one now. 
MACEO What you gonna pay the man with? 
Ty glances at China Doll, uneasy- 
TY You just worry about gettin these hung up everywhere in the county tomorrow. Payday come Saturday, he gonna draw alla them cotton pickers and soldiers boys in here, get us back in the black. 
She gives him a weary look- 
DEX (shakes his head)   You got my sympathies. 
15   EXT. TOWN - TRAIN TRACKS - EARLY MORNING                     15 A WIDE SHOT of the TRACKS that cut the town in two. 
CLOSER 
Sonny stands on the tracks just as the SUN RISES, pondering- which side of the tracks is for white people, which for the colored. 
He hears GUITAR MUSIC to one side, steps cautiously toward it- 
16   EXT. MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - EARLY MORNING             16 Sonny wanders down the street lugging his sack and case, moving toward the sound of a SLIDE GUITAR being played expertly- 
An irate-looking WHITE LADY glares at Sonny as she picks up the milk bottles from her stoop, steps inside and slams the door. Sonny moves ahead, uneasy- 
We TIGHTEN on his face as he stops to listen, the MUSIC ECHOING, seeming to come from here, then from there, then suddenly from right behind him- 
He turns- 
POSSUM, blind, with his chair tilted back against the not-yet- open GENERAL STORE, PLAYS expertly on a beat-up old GUITAR. Sonny lays his case down to listen for a moment, watching the man's fingers- 
Possum gets a whiff of him.     He keeps playing as he speaks- 
POSSUM Somebody slept in the railroad yard. 
Sonny watches the blind man's fingers move on the strings- 
SONNY Yall can play that thing. 
POSSUM Been doin it near forever. 
SONNY (looking around) Listen, which side of the tracks am I- 
POSSUM The wrong side for you. 
SONNY What you doing here then? 
POSSUM White folks look right through me. How much mischief an old blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow? 
Sonny surveys the street- 
SONNY Where our people go for music around here? 
POSSUM There's a couple places just a little bit out of town. At the crossroads. 
SONNY Long walk? 
POSSUM You in a hurry? 
Possum finishes his song- 
SONNY How old is that box you playin, Pops? 
POSSUM (smiles) Second one that ever was- an the devil's got the first. How bout yours? 
Possum gently nudges Sonny's case with his toe.   Sonny is surprised at the blind man's perception- 
SONNY Brand new.     Made it myself. 
POSSUM (whistles)     Made it hisself- 
SONNY That's right. So these clubs- 
POSSUM Old Toussaint, owns the Ace of Spades, don't feature live music. And Pinetop Purvis, owns the Honeydripper Lounge? He don't care bout no guitar. Won't have one under his roof. 
SONNY That don't make sense. 
Possum scratches his head- 
POSSUM Yeah- when a musician put his hand to murder, nine times outa ten it's a drummer done it. But Pinetop a piano man- 
SONNY He killed somebody? 
POSSUM That's the story.    Might be true, and it might not. 
17   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING - TY                          17 Ty is tacking one of the Guitar Sam POSTERS on the front of the building. 
CHINA DOLL Aint gonna tell me something I haven't heard worse. 
MACEO Well, Nappy goes out and has him a- a porkchop or two, let's say- and he comes back from Toussaint's one night feeling no pain, smelling like- like porkchops- the way a man will- and he falls out on Nadine's couch and commences to snore. Wake up the next mornin, finds she had took all his clothes off without him knowin it- 
TY Man was dog drunk- 
MACEO Miss Nadine come in with a skillet in her hand, hot grits bubbling in it, says "Baby, I got your breakfast." "Not this morning, Nadine," he says, sittin up, "don't think I could eat a thing." "Well then," she says, "we can't let this go to waste, can we?" and she dump that whole hot bubblin mess right in the man's lap. 
TY (wincing)    Owwww! 
MACEO Then she got busy with that hot iron on his head. Screams didn't bring the neighbors in, she would of killed that man. 
They are all quiet for a moment, contemplating- 
TY You got to admit it, though- woman is an artist with that Singer machine. 
SONNY (O.S.) Scuse me? 
They turn to see Sonny standing in the doorway- 
SONNY Which one of you is Mr. Pinetop? 
Ty's eyes fix on Sonny's face for a moment- something familiar there- then go down to the guitar case at his feet- 
TY We aint hirin. 
SONNY I can play anything- 
Ty indicates the Guitar Sam POSTER hanging behind the bar- 
TY Already got me a professional. 
Sonny looks a little shaky- 
SONNY Guitar Sam really coming all the way out here? 
TY That so surprising? 
SONNY No, no-- uhm, Mr. Shack Thomas said that if I was to- 
TY You know Shack? 
SONNY We uh- we travelled together- 
Ty gives him a once-over- 
TY When's the last time you ate solid food, young man? 
Sonny has to think- 
TY (to China Doll) Take him back and fix him somethin, China Doll. Standin there all hungry-eyed, puts me off my breakfast. 
SONNY That's real kind of you- 
Sonny pulls his hat off as he follows China Doll, who is suddenly quiet and self-conscious, back to the kitchen- 
MACEO Must of come in on the northbound last night. 
TY Look like he got cooties, too. Straw in them boxcars is full of em. 
MACEO Never cared to travel that way. 
Ty grows somber, reminiscing- 
TY I was out there ridin them rails between the wars. Seem like half the country headin west rolled past the other half comin back east. (musing) Every one of us scrapin for the next meal- 
COOL BREEZE (O.S.) This is the place. 
They turn to see COOL BREEZE, a hard-looking, sharply-dressed character, leading the prosperous looking MR. SIMMONS into the club as if they aren't there- 
COOL BREEZE Yall can tear things down, put things up- got a lot of potential. 
MR. SIMMONS Looks bigger in here than it does from the outside. 
TY I help you gentlemen? 
COOL BREEZE Just showing the man gonna run this place what he's got. 
TY Another hundred. 
MACEO We'd have to clear three hundred- 
TY I figure we charge folks two dollars to get in, then drinks- 
MACEO (shakes his head) What I'm sayin is, less he sees the green up front the man won't get off the train. 
A TRUCK HORN honks outside- 
MACEO What's that now? 
Ty, mind working, looks desperate as Maceo exits to see who's honking- 
19   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING                                 19 A battered TRUCK sits in front of the club. ZEKE, a taciturn white man, and his black loader step out as Maceo approaches- 
MACEO (calls out) Bout time you fellas run by. We just about dry here. 
The loader lets down the tailgate to reveal CASES OF BEER AND LIQUOR. He begins to pull them out and pile them on the ground- 
ZEKE Your boss in? 
Maceo shouts back into the club- 
MACEO Tyrone!   Whiskey wagon come by! 
Ty steps out of the club carrying one of the Guitar Sam posters- 
TY Y'all a day late. 
Ty nods at the Ace of Spades club across the way- 
TY Old Man Toussaint gonna chew you out. 
ZEKE Toussaint went over to another supplier upstate. We just got you, then we headin down to the army base, officers' club needs servicin. This fifty-six dollars- 
TY (weak grin) My credit no good anymore? 
Zeke only has to look at the loader, who starts to put the cases back onto the truck- 
TY Whoah, whoah- what's your hurry? 
ZEKE Nobody that's right in his head sell liquor on credit. Specially not to no darktown roadhouse. 
TY Well this is like a special case, see- we got the harvest coming in, soldiers at the base gonna be let out on leave- Saturday night. Aint enough hootch in this truck to satisfy what we gonna sell- 
ZEKE You pay as you go.   That's bidness. 
Zeke walks toward the cab of the truck, Ty following him, desperate, waving the poster- 
TY You can come by Monday, get paid and take back every damn drop I aint sold! We got Guitar Sam lined up, you know what that means?! 
Zeke steps in and slams the door, the loader doing the same on the other side of him- 
TY I'll pay you extra- penny a bottle on the beer and a nickel on the whiskey! 
The truck engine coughs- 
TY (desperate) What if I throw in five dollars up front, just for you fellas- ? 
Zeke pulls away- 
TY Come on, man, everybody give credit, that's the American way! 
But the truck is gone down the road.   Maceo comes up beside Ty, watching forlornly- 
MACEO Maybe we could buy some busthead from Willie Pettigrew. 
TY With that sheriff sniffin around every night? Land my black ass in jail for good. 
Another TRUCK pulls around the bend from the opposite direction- 
MACEO Then what we gonna do? 
The new truck slows to a stop by them.    The DRIVER pokes his head out- 
DRIVER Got a liquor delivery for a Mr. Lucien Toussaint? 
TY You got that boy eatin out of your hand. 
CHINA DOLL Luther's the only one didn't pull my hair when he sit behind me at Sunday school. 
TY Well I hope you got a little that sugar left, cause we got to spread some on Miss Bertha Mae Spivey- 
CHINA DOLL You gone ask her to come sing again? 
TY Imonna ask her for money. Word is she got a whole pile of it squirreled away. 
China Doll stops, breathing heavily, bends to put her hands on her knees- 
CHINA DOLL Daddy- 
TY Come on, girl, we in a rush here- 
CHINA DOLL I got to rest. 
Ty softens, walks back to stand beside her- 
TY I'm sorry, baby.   You catch your breath. 
China Doll smiles weakly- 
CHINA DOLL So- why Miss Spivey gonna give you money, you don't let her sing at the club any more? 
TY Gonna make her a partner. 
CHINA DOLL Partner in what? 
TY In the Honeydripper. 
CHINA DOLL But all you ever say it's just a hole you pour good money into- 
TY That don't matter.     Imonna make her a proprietor. 
CHINA DOLL `tress'.   Like waiter and waitress. 
TY Proprietress. She got to like the sound of that. 
26   EXT. MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - WINDOW, POSTER           26 One of the GUITAR SAM POSTERS appears in the front window as Maceo tapes it up- 
A trio on teenage girls stop to look at it as they pass (Possum is nowhere to be seen)- 
Maceo steps out to join them, eager to close the deal- 
MACEO Lovely ladies out to make a purchase- 
OPAL That the same Guitar Sam is on the radio? 
MACEO The very one. 
OPAL What's he look like? 
MACEO Fine lookin man. Real lady killer from what I hear. Got that New Orleans style to him. 
OPAL You ought to have a picture up there. 
MACEO Oh, we'll be gettin some of those when he comes in on the train. The main thing is, the man is electrified- and you know what that means. 
27   EXT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE                                     27 Formerly a fairly grand house, Bertha Mae's hasn't been painted for awhile and the yard could use some work. Ty coaches China Doll as they climb the stairs- 
TY We make like we just come by to see how she's keepin, and then I'll kind of mention how I been thinking of bringing her on as a partner- 
CHINA DOLL Left the door open. 
China Doll pushes the front door all the way open. We can hear Bertha Mae's VOICE singing on a scratchy old RECORD. 
China Doll peeks in to see- 
28   INT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR                         28 -Slick, sitting at the bottom of the STAIRS that lead to the second floor, looking lost and bewildered- 
SLICK She's gone. 
TY Oh. 
Ty frowns.    He was all geared up for the siege- 
Gatlin spits- 
GATLIN Grab a sack. 
32   EXT. PINEY WOODS - CROSSROADS - AFTERNOON                   32 Maceo nails a Guitar Sam POSTER to a tree, looks over his handiwork. 
An ARMY PLATOON trudges into the crossroads, sweat-soaked and footsore- 
Maceo watches, pleased, as the black soldiers check the poster out as they pass- 
MACEO Saturday night, fellas! Every fine- looking colored woman in the county gonna be there- don't want to miss it! 
A white LIEUTENANT passes, giving Maceo a dark look.   Maceo salutes- 
MACEO Afternoon, sir.   Nice lookin bunch of soldiers. 
33   INT. MAYOR WINFIELD'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY             33 Delilah sits at the dining room table with a sandwich she's made herself. We hear PERRY COMO on a RECORD somewhere in the house. She hasn't gotten two bites down before Amanda wanders in, crossing to the liquor cabinet- 
AMANDA Oh dear, I believe it's about that time- 
She pulls out a DECANTER OF WINE- 
AMANDA Would you care to join me? 
DELILAH No thank you. 
Amanda pours herself a glass of wine- 
AMANDA Of course you won't join me, you don't partake. That was thoughtless of me. 
DELILAH That's all right. 
AMANDA So you don't take spirits and- what else? In your church? 
DELILAH I'm sort of between churches right now. I been thinking about changing over to the Holiness, but I- I haven't been sanctified yet. 
AMANDA Ah- 
DELILAH There's been a minister in this week- 
AMANDA The tent out by the fairgrounds. 
Delilah nods.   Amanda takes a drink- 
AMANDA The church I grew up in- we were Pentacostals- they wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church. And dancing- any kind of dancing, music, card playing-- well, it was very strict. They took up serpents. 
DELILAH I've heard of that. 
AMANDA I tell Floyd these stories and he's horrified. They've always been Methodists, Floyd's family. 
DELILAH They're good people too. 
AMANDA When I married Floyd-- oh, it was quite a scandal among my relatives. As if I'd taken up with somebody in a cult. 
DELILAH It can be a trial, married folks differ in their religion. 
AMANDA And your husband is a--- ? 
DELILAH Unaffiliated. 
AMANDA Unaffiliated. I see.    He has his-- social club- 
DELILAH The Honeydripper. 
AMANDA Such a colorful name. 
DELILAH Yes. 
AMANDA He must devote a great deal of his energy to it. 
DELILAH It's just him and Maceo Green runs it, and then I go over and cook some when I get off here. 
AMANDA That's very- supportive of you. Considering the sort of- environment- 
DELILAH (defensive) I been in those barrooms most of my life, Miss Amanda. 
Amanda realizes she has probed too deep, tries to back up- 
Sonny is way behind the others, not dressed for the work, wincing as he pricks his fingers for the umpteenth time. NED, a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite direction in a parallel row, takes pity on him- 
NED Y'all never done this job before. 
SONNY Can't say I have. 
NED You want to set your pins out wide, bend over from the hip- 
Sonny widens his stance- 
NED -and don't be bobbin up and down all the time. When you up, be up, but when you on the row, stay down. 
Sonny digs in and keeps low- 
NED But most important, you got to get you a rhythm. Everything in this life got a rhythm to it- even pullin cotton off the plant. 
SONNY Lay it out for me. 
NED Not my rhythm- your rhythm. That's between you and the day and the work you got before you. Once you on it, don't let nothin and nobody push you off it. 
SONNY I'm going so slow. 
NED You gettin paid by the pound or by the hour? 
SONNY I'm not gettin paid at all.   None of us are. 
Ned cackles- 
NED Then I suggest you work that into your rhythm too. 
A DEPUTY calls out- 
DEPUTY Let's see more pickin and less talkin over there! 
NED Gettin right on it, Boss! 
Ned picks his way behind Sonny. Sonny starts to rock slightly, looking for a rhythm of movement he can maintain- 
36   EXT. 1ST OPPOSITE COTTON FIELD                            36 The free pickers sit on and around the truck that brought them, eating lunch. Dex watches the prison laborers across the road as he SHUFFLES a battered DECK OF CARDS, sitting with a couple of the other men- 
DEX Them boys fryin over there. 
JUNEBUG That Judge Gatlin's gang- he work them people from can until can't, ever damn day, and when his fields is picked he bid em out to the neighbors. Harvest time comes round here, you sign up with somebody fast or you stay outa sight. 
Dex waves flies away from his face, spits- 
DEX Ate a peck of dust today. 
JUNEBUG Take some water. 
DEX Only thing wash the dust out is whiskey. 
JUNEBUG (smiles) Aint enough whiskey in this world wash out what I swallowed in my life. 
Dex riffles the cards- 
JUNEBUG What we playin for? 
DEX Two bits a hand. 
JUNEBUG That's kind of steep- 
Dex laughs and starts to deal a card at a time to the players- 
DEX Hell, I member playin this game one night- Memphis is Boss Crump's town, folks is gamblin before they can walk- ten dollars a hand. I caught a winnin streak that cleaned out half the sportin men on Beale Street. Got up from that table, my money was as long as train smoke- 
JUNEBUG What happen to it? 
Dex raises his voice so the woman he checked out in the morning can hear- 
DEX Spent it all on fine-lookin women. 
He calls to where Ham stands in knee-high grass, a heavy stick in his hand, staring intently at the ground- 
DEX Yo, Missippi- 
JUNEBUG His name Hamilton. 
DELILAH You work so hard at the Lounge, and what it brings in- 
TY Isn't even as much as what you make polishin that white lady's silver. I know. 
DELILAH I didn't say that. 
TY You didn't have to. 
Delilah gives up, knowing he's set on his mood- 
DELILAH It'll just have to work out, then. 
A strained silence.   Delilah crosses to the back door- 
DELILAH Meetin gonna start without I'm there. 
TY Your soul not the one needs savin, baby. 
She gives Ty a lost look, steps out.   The screen door slams. China Doll sees how worried Ty is- 
CHINA DOLL It's all gonna be fine, Daddy. Everbody in town talkin bout Guitar Sam comin to Harmony. 
39   EXT. REVIVAL TENT - NIGHT - WIDE SHOT                      39 A CHOIR sings at the front of the LANTERN-LIT tent, a CONGREGATION of salvation-seekers filling the benches- 
CHOIR Mother died- Yes she died and left me It was long- long time ago Oh but I searched Searched her record over I found mother just had to go 
UNDER TENT 
CHOIR Oh she cried son, Son don't you worry Oh you know the Lord Always fix a way 
Delilah arrives at the rear of the tent, finds herself a spot on a bench- 
CHOIR She left me standing Standing along the highway Oh wondering- which way I must go! 
REVEREND CUTLIP watches his singers, clapping out time with his big hands- 
CHOIR As I walked- All along the highway I was seeking my Lord each day She left me standing Standing along the highway Just wondering- which way must I go! 
`Amens' and other sounds greet the end of the song. Reverend Cutlip steps to the center of the platform and looks around at the souls gathered- 
REVEREND CUTLIP The Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, will twist you and turn you, it will run you this way and that way, it will tempt you with many a detour-- for the Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, is designed to lead us astray! 
He gets an `Amen!' from someone in the crowd- 
REVEREND CUTLIP It meanders away from the Light and into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits! 
The congregation start to get into it, RESPONDING, rocking with the rhythm of the sermon, flapping their PAPER FANS that advertise Beauchamp's Funeral Home in the hot night-- 
REVEREND CUTLIP It snares us with the thorns and thistles of wickedness, it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and laid out on a crooked plan! That's not the road we want to be on, Brothers and Sisters, that's not the path we need to follow! 
The Reverend picks up speed- 
REVEREND CUTLIP We got to get on that other road! The one that leads to salvation! The one that leads to glory! The one that leads to the right hand of God! Praise His name! 
CONGREGATION Praise the Lord! 
REVEREND CUTLIP The thoroughfare I'm talking about, the righteous path we got to tread, is called the Highway to Heaven, and by the great Lord above it is straight and it is narrow! (MORE) REVEREND CUTLIP(cont'd) Keep your eyes on the prize and your feet on the street and you won't ever make a mis-step, you won't ever falter, you won't ever stumble, because Jesus will show you the Way! 
Several people in the audience are up and SHOUTING now, getting into the Spirit. Reverend Cutlip shifts gear, filling his voice with a sense of dread and warning- 
REVEREND CUTLIP But you got to pay attention to who it is walking beside you, Brothers and Sisters, got to be wary against those who will hold you back from your journey! There's many a loved one got to be left behind! Cause you either on the road or you lost in the wilderness! 
DELILAH 
We TIGHTEN on Delilah as she listens, upset, taking this all very personally- 
REVEREND CUTLIP (O.S.) You either headed for glory or doomed to damnation! You either in with the Lord or you in with the Devil- and they aint no in-between! 
40   INT. JAIL - NIGHT                                           40 We TRACK past CELLS full of black PRISONERS- 
KING (O.S.) Tulsa aint so bad but for the smell- 
NED (O.S.) Got them stockyards near the jail- 
KING (O.S.) That's right- and the flies. Course, I had me in a cell in Georgia once, six other men, didn't have no window atall. 
NED (O.S.) Must of got caught on one a them freights. 
A silence.    Maceo is moved by the scene- 
MACEO Would have liked to been there. I mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it. 
Ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand, distraught. This is the end for Ty, no strategies left, nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat- 
TY Mace, Imonna lose my club. 
MACEO Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that- 
TY I got no more cards to play- 
MACEO Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person- 
TY (angry) I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed- 
WHAP! He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it CRASHES into the bar and flips open. Ty and Maceo stare at the contents- 
TY What the hell that sposed to be? 
Maceo pulls out a home-built SOLID BODY GUITAR, a painted white rectangle with a complicated PICKUP jury-rigged over the strings and yards of ELECTRICAL CORD hanging off it- 
MACEO Some kind of guitar. 
TY A guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs. 
China Doll rushes in, upset- 
CHINA DOLL They gone and arrest him! 
TY Arrested who? 
CHINA DOLL Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested him and sold him over to Judge Gatlin. 
TY Who's Sonny? 
CHINA DOLL Sonny that was here yesterday morning. 
TY Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that- 
Maceo plucks a string.    Not much of a sound- 
MACEO It's electric- 
TY I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get more music out of it than that mess gonna make. 
MACEO Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out- 
He dumps the sack Sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of tubes and wires, also home-modified- 
MACEO -your amplifier. Which is what this thing must be. 
CHINA DOLL Sonny said he fix radios in the Army. 
TY Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway? 
CHINA DOLL Daddy- 
TY Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs- 
MACEO A sideman- 
TY Sit over there and be all clean and polite. Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies- 
MACEO Old time music- 
CHINA DOLL Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be arrested for! He was just lookin for work. 
MACEO They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up. 
CHINA DOLL But he doesn't belong there! 
Maceo turns the guitar over in his hands- 
MACEO You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal. 
TY I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass! 
SHERIFF PUGH You think you too smart for the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone? Think you can go it by yourself. 
He puts his feet down and sits forward, drilling Ty with his eyes- 
SHERIFF PUGH You'd rather eat roofin nails than come to me for a favor- 
TY It's not a favor if I got to pay- 
SHERIFF PUGH Oh, you gonna pay all right. You don't hand me that money Sunday mornin, you got yourself a new partner. Same deal as I got with Toussaint. How'd that be? 
Ty considers.   He doesn't have any options- 
TY (deadpan)    You'll get the fifty. 
SHERIFF PUGH (smiles)    And that wife of yours- 
TY (wary)   Delilah- 
SHERIFF PUGH Them fried chicken sandwiches- if I was to come by, now and then, check up on my interests- 
TY She be happy to fix you whatever you want. 
SHERIFF PUGH My wife's cookin would gag a maggot. 
TY Different people got different kinds of talents. 
Sheriff Pugh heaves himself to his feet- 
SHERIFF PUGH Lurleen aint discovered what hers is yet. Let's go fetch that boy. 
53   EXT. 2ND COTTON FIELD - DAY - SHOTGUN                        53 A SHOTGUN in a deputy's arms- 
POV - PICKERS 
Faces dripping sweat, prison gang pickers stoop to their work- 
TY 
Ty stands by his beat-up old Ford at the side of the road, watching, remembering. 
A few of the PRISON LABORERS look up, curious, as Sonny is led over- 
DEPUTY This the one? 
Ty nods, looks to Sonny- 
TY You got any ideas about turning rabbit on me, you best get rid of em now. 
SONNY You payin my way out? 
TY Till Monday. 
SONNY How come? 
They get INTO THE CAR- 
TY You like draggin that cotton sack? 
SONNY No. 
TY Then don't ask questions. 
Ty pulls away, leaving the less fortunate stooped in the field- 
54   INT. SEWING ROOM - NADINE                                    54 MUSIC plays on the RADIO as Nadine masterfully works her SEWING MACHINE and Maceo stands by uneasily. He holds up the denim jacket Sonny left at the club- 
MACEO This size, right, but it's got to shine. 
NADINE And when you need this? 
MACEO Tonight. 
NADINE (considers) That's a tall order. 
MACEO It's got to happen. 
NADINE (fishing) You know, I do my best work, my fastest work, when I'm happy. 
CHINA DOLL I had the rheumatic fever when I was little, left me with a weak heart. 
SONNY Oh. Mine been actin funny too- since I laid eyes on you. 
She acknowledges his flirting with a little smile and comes up with a MASON JAR full of clear LIQUID- 
SONNY What's that? 
CHINA DOLL Just some ole moonshine they keep around. 
China Doll crosses back to Sonny- 
SONNY (concerned) What you gonna do with it? 
CHINA DOLL They always joke about how this stuff'll straighten your hair right out- 
She twists the lid off, sniffs the liquid, reacts to its strength- 
CHINA DOLL Imonna just make yours relax a little. 
56   INT. PARLOR                                               56 TIME TRENIER, an older musician with a permanently stoic expression, sits watching his pupil, a YOUNG BOY, torture the SCALES with a CORNET. He glances up at Ty and Maceo, trying not to plug their ears as the boy continues to PLAY- 
MACEO Mr. Time Trenier- that's a name to be reckoned with. 
Time doesn't seem to react to the flattery- 
MACEO Story goes that you used to play with Buddy Bolden. 
TIME Played with most all of em down there. 
MACEO And King Oliver- 
TIME One band falls apart you find yourself another one. Never any shortage of bands, down New Awlins. 
TY I didn't know you was givin lessons. 
TIME Pays the rent.   Almost. 
TY You interested in a playin job? 
TIME Your place? 
MACEO (tentative) It's uhm- backin up a man on the electric guitar? 
TIME (shrugs)     If you can pay, I can play. 
TY Got to dress sharp. 
No need to say this to Time Trenier.       You could cut yourself on the creases on his pants- 
MACEO It aint like a all-night thing- you just start out and there's gonna be a accident- 
Ty shoots Maceo a look- 
TIME Accident. 
TY Sudden loss of power.      Lights out. 
TIME (shrugs again)      It's your gig, man. 
TY Eight o'clock. This aint colored people time and it sure aint New Awlins time. I mean eight o'clock on the money. 
TIME If you got the green I'm on the scene. 
TY That's a deal then. 
MACEO You know any drummers? 
TIME (nods)     I'll bring you one. 
TY Nothin fancy, he just got to keep time- 
TIME Time is my name. 
Ty and Maceo wince as the kid hits a particularly SOUR NOTE- 
57   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, 2ND COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON        57 The free pickers are lined up at the side of the road- 
SONNY How'd you get your start? 
Ty sighs, sits back from his work- 
TY Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin. I used to come out and play his left hand for him. 
SONNY How old you were? 
TY (shrugs) Thirteen, fourteen. This one night it was goin hot and heavy and Joe just passed, right there at the piano, in the middle of Black Bottom Stomp. They propped him up at the bar, stuck a drink in his hand, and told me to keep poundin them ivories. (shakes his head) There was a meanness hanging over them juke joints, there was murder in the air. You stopped playin for a minute, it come down like a flock of crows. 
Sonny stops by a poster for the `REGINALD ERSKINE BAND featuring Tyrone "Pinetop" Purvis'- 
SONNY This is you- 
TY Big band days, on the road. If a railroad train run through it, we played it. 
SONNY (reading) `Reginald Erskine'. Don't believe I ever heard of him- 
TY Big tall light-skin fella out of Carolina, said he's part Cherokee. Couldn't play nothin, but he waved his little stick and had this long greasy hair he throw around like Cab Calloway. 
SONNY And you were the piano man. 
TY Piano man, arranger, you name it. 
SONNY That must of been somethin, see the country first class. 
TY I don't know about first class, but we seen the country. 
SONNY How come you stopped? 
TY (shrugs) Got tired of carrying another man's water. Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas. 
He bangs the last nail in- 
TY Met Delilah and wanted something of my own. 
SONNY Well you don't have nothing to worry about, Mr. Pinetop. I won't let you down tonight. 
Ty looks at Sonny, considers telling him what the plan is- 
TY No-   I don't spose you will. 
Ty gets up and goes into the back. 
Sonny crosses to the tangle of wires coming out of the wall behind the counter and snaking off in every direction. He grabs hold of one, thinking- 
59   INT. PURVIS HOUSE - KITCHEN                                  59 Delilah is in her kitchen, HUMMING a GOSPEL SONG to herself, apron on as she begins to make a pie. She pulls a METAL FLOUR CANNISTER down from the shelf, flips the lid off- about half full. 
She starts to scoop flour out from it and something falls out- a small CLOTH PURSE. She picks it up to put it aside, then frowns at the way it feels. She shakes flour off, unzips it- 
Nothing inside. 
60   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BACK ROOM                             60 Maceo loads bottles of beer into the ICEBOX, wincing as the sounds of a SCREAMING ARGUMENT blast in from the bar- 
DELILAH (O.S.) How could you do that? 
TY (O.S.) Imonna put that back and double- 
DELILAH (O.S.) You don't go gamblin with my baby's money! 
TY (O.S.) I had to send off the advance pay or the man don't come and play- 
DELILAH (O.S.) I don't care what you took it for, I saved that money up for China Doll- 
Delilah bursts through the swinging door into the back room, pursued by Ty, trying to explain- 
DELILAH -and you got no business puttin your fingers on it! 
TY China Doll don't need any school, baby, she could walk into one of them shops right this minute and get a job! 
DELILAH There's got to be some line you won't cross, some thing you won't do- 
TY The world starts throwin me breaks, woman, maybe I'll catch religion and walk the straight and narrow like them Bible thumpers you sit up with, but till that day, I- 
DELILAH Reverend Cutlip is right about you! 
WHAM! Delilah slams the back door as she storms out. Ty turns and CRACK! kicks an empty crate halfway across the floor before stomping out to the bar. Maceo opens a beer with the church-key hanging from the icebox handle, takes a gulp and sits to ponder this new development- 
REVEREND CUTLIP Is there anyone out here tonight gonna answer His call? Is there anyone out here tonight gonna come forward and be saved? 
DELILAH 
Delilah is standing, tears running down her cheeks, filled with the emotion of the moment- 
REVEREND CUTLIP The fire is heatin up, Brothers and Sisters, and Judgement Day is nigh! Aint no time to hesitate, you got to come on down and take Him into your heart! 
Delilah starts to walk down the aisle- 
REVEREND CUTLIP That's right- come on down! They no turning back now- feel the Lord's hand at your back- got to leave all them sinners behind! 
Delilah stops in the middle of the aisle, trembling, unsure- 
REVEREND CUTLIP (sees her) You got a voice in your heart, Sister- that's the Lord talking! You hear him? 
Delilah starts to nod her head, weeping- 
REVEREND CUTLIP That voice telling you where you need to be right now! You just got to move your feet and get there! 
70   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BACK ROOM - NIGHT                        70 China Doll fusses with Sonny's hair after he hangs his guitar, dangling with electrical hookups, over his head- 
CHINA DOLL You look good. 
Ty steps back in with them, wiping sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. He looks Sonny over- his hair slick and shiny, the outfit Nadine sewed up for him tight and sparkling- 
TY (impressed) Damn- 
CHINA DOLL He looks good, doesn't he Daddy? 
TY Honey, I want you to get right by that front door and take over collectin the cover charge. And if anything should happen- like go wrong or something- you just step out and walk away from the club, hear? 
CHINA DOLL What's gonna go wrong? 
TY Oh- our Guitar Sam here gets them soldier boys jumping it could get a little rough- just be on your toes, that's all. 
CHINA DOLL Okay. 
She starts away- 
TY China Doll- 
CHINA DOLL Yeah? 
TY You know there aint a thing in this world I wouldn't do for you. Even if I mess up sometimes, you know that, right? 
China Doll looks at him, not sure what brought this on, but pleased to hear it. The CALLS for Guitar Sam grow LOUDER from the floor- 
CHINA DOLL I know that, Daddy. 
TY You go on, now. 
China Doll exits and Ty looks back to Sonny- 
TY Well, you look like something might of come outa New Orleans- 
SONNY I forget to tell you- I fixed your hook-up. 
TY My what? 
SONNY Where the electricity comes in?    It was all- 
MACEO (O.S.) Ty! 
They turn to see Maceo stepping in, concerned- 
MACEO We got a situation out there- 
TY You don't think I know that? 
MACEO Got the law in the house. 
71   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BARROOM                              71 Sheriff Pugh stands near the piano, putting a considerable damper on the mood in the room. Ty hurries out to him, with a panic-stricken smile on his face- 
TY Didn't think we'd be seeing you so soon! 
SHERIFF PUGH (looking around) Got a nice crowd in here tonight, Tyrone. See them army uniforms- 
He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to introduce the next song- 
TOUSSAINT (O.S.) You is a lie! 
A shocked silence. 
The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony finger at Sonny- 
TOUSSAINT You is a lie, boy! I known Sammy since he's drinkin mama's milk, hell, I known his Mama herself when she live up to Plaquemine- and you aint him! 
The audience looks to Sonny for his defense- 
Ty holds his breath.   Maceo brings the baseball bat up from behind the bar. 
Sonny just smiles- 
SONNY That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin bout, Pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam. 
Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs- 
TOUSSAINT As long as we straight on that. 
JUNEBUG Get on outa there and let the man play! 
A CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back to his microphone- 
SONNY Imonna play you one I come up with today while I was havin my hair cut- 
He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with, then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap- 
SONNY Oh China Doll Can't get you offa my mind! Oh China Doll I can't get you offa my mind! If you be my baby Gonna leave all them others behind! 
The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny, instant groupies- but we RACK to China Doll, transfixed, as she is drawn toward the stage- 
SONNY Oh China Doll Think about you day and night! Oh China Doll I think about you day and night! Can't forget you baby Oh when you gonna treat me right? 
Time Trenier steps in for a growling SAX BREAK- 
TY 
Ty looks around the crowded, rocking room- 
POV - SHERIFF PUGH 
The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door. The last person he passes turns toward Ty- 
Possum? 
But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone. 
TY 
Ty frowns, troubled. Under the sax now we hear a dissonant SLIDE GUITAR, the haunting notes Possum was playing at the train station. Ty searches the crowd- 
POV 
The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the crowd dancing- 
There's Possum again, at the bar, face turned toward Ty. 
TY 
We TIGHTEN on TY.   Why is he here? 
POV - POSSUM 
Possum turns his head slowly, fixes on something, and we PAN to see Dex and Ham standing toe-to-toe, snarling into each other's face. 
We PUNCH IN tighter and tighter on the young men, body language telling us a fight is about to break out- 
ECU TY 
Ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor to reach them and the FLASHBACKS come again, the SAX MUSIC growing echoey and menacing- 
INT. BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK The shaky perspective and over-saturated colors again, tight on the men struggling, the Girl cowering, then Young Tyrone twisting the Guitar Man's wrist and thrusting, again and again, hugging close to him, then pulled away and the- 
-KNIFE falls to the floor, BLOODY, and the-

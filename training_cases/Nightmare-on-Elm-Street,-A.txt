A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 
1A.   INT.  (MONTAGE).                                                   1A. 
NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS, all CLOSE and teasing. 
-- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash- dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal. Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten, reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL. 
-- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight razor, until its fingertips are off. 
-- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin, curved, gleaming sharp. 
-- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal being assembled with crude tools, into some sort of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus, against a background light of FIRE, and a deep rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY. 
-- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove. 
-- Then the BLADES attached to all of it. 
-- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like apparatus, filling it out and transforming it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing it to shreds. 
1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1. 
A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN. 
CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of light. 
CUT TO: 
2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2. 
TITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves free. 
A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC. Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and on into the dark.  No reason why it's there. 
Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of something like fingernails across slate.  It sets our teeth on edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running. 
3.    INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 3. 
Suddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN. 
Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC. 
Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas, approaching TINA. 
CLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh. They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND. 
TINA rushes away, hands over her ears. 
ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and everything goes silent. 
CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress, leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE. 
VOICE (O.S.) One two, Freddie's coming for you... 
TINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours out.  And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred face lunges at her.  And it's his fingers that are tipped with the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator. 
TINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow.  The MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back. 
The MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we -- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
4.    INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      4. 
TINA convulses in bed with a SCREAM, looking around wildly. Someone is KNOCKING on her door. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) You okay, Tina? 
TINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look.  TINA sits up and blows out a breath, groggy. 
TINA Just a dream, Ma... (more to herself) Damn dream, is all... 
The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room.  A MAN hovers BACKGROUND.  TINA'S mother waves him away without looking, shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes.  She appraises her daughter. 
TINA'S MOTHER Some dream, judging from that. 
ANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the drive.  Every light in the house and yard is turned on.  We HEAR the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume. 
9.    INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  9. 
ON GLEN, dialing.  Nancy and TINA are watching, giggling. 
TINA I can't believe his mother let him come over here. 
NANCY Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly... 
GLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster. 
GLEN (to TINA) See, I got this cousin who lives near the airport, that it's okay for me to stay with, right?  So I found this sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and... 
The phone is answered.  GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record with a SCRUUPT!! 
GLEN (CONTD) Hello, Mom? (pushes the 'play' button) Yeah, out here at Barry's. 
A JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape.  GLEN moves the machine closer to the phone.  It's a big plane -- sounds like a 747 coming in for a landing. 
GLEN (CONT) Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello. 
The Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a monstrous banshee.  NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled giggles. 
GLEN (CONT) (shouting over the din) Right, right -- I'll call you in the morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure, I, huh?... 
Suddenly the tape goes silent.  GLEN blanches.  Next moment another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming by at 180 mph. 
GLEN (CONT) (reacting to his mother's reaction) Uh... some kid's drag racing outside, I think... 
The sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible COLLISION.  NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn it off, but misses.  There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem -- Glen improvises desperately. 
GLEN (CONT) Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I think there's been an accident out front -- I -- 
NANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS and SHOUTS of charging Huns.  GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and flings the cassette out of the machine. 
Blessed silence at last. 
GLEN (CONT) Right.  I'll call the police.  No, just some neighbors having a fight, I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine! Call you in the morning! 
He hangs up and sags back. 
NANCY Worked like a charm. 
GLEN Jesus. 
TINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER' blasts from the STEREO.  The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST THEM TO THE WINDOW. 
The WIND is moving the bare TREE BRANCH outside.  CAMERA PANS BACK to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy.  We see NANCY poking at a flame in the hearth as TINA comes FOREGROUND to draw the drapes. 
NANCY Nice to have a fire. 
TINA Really.  Turn 'er up a little. 
NANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs brightly over its artificial log.  TINA joins her, heartened. 
NANCY Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too.  He might get jealous. 
TINA Rod and I are done.  He's too much of a maniac. 
GLEN He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him. Like a hand grenade. 
TINA laughs despite herself.  NANCY brightens. 
NANCY See?  You've forgotten the bad dream.  Didn't I tell you? 
TINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten. 
TINA All day long I been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails... 
NANCY looks up with a flinch. 
NANCY Fingernails? (blinks, laughing) That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night. 
TINA looks up. 
TINA What you dream? 
NANCY I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me.  Sort of ...obscenely.  Then he walked out through the wall on the other side.  Like he'd just come to check me out... 
NANCY Rod... 
But ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living room, heading into the darker part of the house. 
ROD We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest. 
ANGLE BACK ON GLEN AND NANCY. 
NANCY We should get her out of here... 
TINA darts to the front door, her blouse half out. 
TINA Hey -- you guys're hanging around -- right? (fake laughing/whine) Don't leave me alone with this lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY! 
She disappears.  GLEN looks at NANCY.  Too innocent. 
GLEN So we'll guard her together. Through the night. (moving closer) In each others' arms like we always said. 
NANCY Glen.  Not now.  I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves. 
She kisses him lightly, then pushes him back. 
GLEN (frustrated) Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway? 
NANCY Because he was scary, that's why. 
GLEN Who was scary? 
NANCY turns and looks at him. 
NANCY Don't you think it's weird, her and me dreaming about the same guy? (GLEN looks away; NANCY stares closer) You didn't have a bad dream last night, did you? 
GLEN gives her a funny look. 
GLEN Me?  I don't dream. 
He takes her inside.  Over the SOUNDS of locks falling shut we 
FADE TO BLACK 
13.   INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  13. 
FADE UP ON an old 50's CLOCK, one of those set into the black plaster body of a stalking panther.  It's just past 2 AM. 
PAN the cold hearth and darkened living room to REVEAL GLEN on the couch, cacooned in sheets.  He's listening miserably to the SOUNDS OF LOVEMAKING coming from the next room.  TINA peaks, ROD howls.  Then silence. 
GLEN Morality sucks. 
CUT TO: 
14.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             14. 
This is a slightly larger room than TINA's.  Adult.  Female. Spare in its appointments.  The streetlight throws the narrow bed into broken shadow and light.  TINA AND ROD lie in each other's arms in the middle of the big bed.  Satiated. 
TINA I knew there was sometihng about you I liked... 
ROD yawns into the pillows, happy. 
ROD You feel better now, right? 
TINA Jungle man fix Jane. 
ROD No more fights? 
TINA No more fights. 
ROD (sleepily) Good.  No more nightmares for either of us then. 
He pulls the covers over his head.  He's almost out already. 
TINA (beat) When did you have a nightmare? 
ROD (under the blankets) Guys can have nightmares too, y'know.  You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something. 
He rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over his head.  A dirty red and yellow cover. 
TINA (sleepily) Where'd you get this snotty old thing? 
SNORES from ROD.  TINA yawns, turns off the light and snuggles against ROD, pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too. 
Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare staggers into view fifty feet behind her.  TINA falls back into the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.  The MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his right hand as he spreads his arms wide.  He starts scraping the steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.  Orange sparks spurt out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home! 
CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and closer.  She begins to shake uncontrollably. 
TINA Oh, shit, please God... 
KILLER (softly, approaching) This is God... 
He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider. TINA runs for her life. 
27.   WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27. between the girl and her pursuer.  The MAN is fast; the distance between them closes with each heartbeat.  TINA overturns ashcans -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a window.  Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and disappear in fright. 
28.   EXT.  TINA'S STREET.  NIGHT.                                       28. 
TINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help.  No help comes.  In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on the block to be turned off.  The MAN roars out from behind a tree -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl! TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be trapped against its locked front door. 
She hammers against its thick wood. 
TINA Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy! 
The MAN slows.  He has TINA now and knows it. 
MAN She's still awake.  Nancy can't hear you. 
TINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN.  Smudged by deep shadow, he's big and hideous.  He wears the same dirty yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin over his misshapen face.  And on his fingers are the steel talons. 
29.   CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29. finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.  Then another.  We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in SLOW MOTION. 
ANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one flopping onto TINA's naked foot. 
TINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they were huge bugs. 
The MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on his hand.  He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her, sweeping with his cutting hand! 
TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines, and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.  But the face only slides off to the bone.  The MAN presses in, and TINA contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder -- cutting her deeply. 
29A.  TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably        29A. caught in bedclothes!  She falls over her bed's conformter, twists away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her! The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS -- and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until they're beneath it, fighting for life and death. 
30.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      30. 
ROD lurches up into CLOSE UP in the lightless bedroom, half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow inside the dark bed.  ROD grabs groggily, lifting the blanket. 
30A.  IN HIS POV we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see     30A. TWO SHADOWY FIGURES flailing and clawing under the bedspread -- TINA and the MAN -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging against each other. 
ROD drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake and terrified.  Then the horrible TINA's GASPS change to the CRIES of a terribly wounded victim.  ROD instantly jerks back the bedspread. 
IN HIS POV we SEE TINA struggling and flailing along on the sheets, the MAN nowhere in sight. 
ROD T-tina!? 
Suddenly TINA -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by overwhelming force and pinned to the bed.  Next instant, her nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her torso.  From no visible instruments!  A huge irrigation of blood floods the bed. 
Terrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into the light -- smashing it to bits. 
31.   CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around.  In the blue FLASHES OF      31. ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark smear, dragged feet first! 
ANGLE ON ROD -- paralized by terror! 
ANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES -- moving with her up the wall and bumping around the corner onto the ceiling.  She's just looking at who's dragging her, eyes glazing. 
REVERSE IN HER POV -- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN, dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body.  SEEN in FORCED PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless plane. 
ANGLE DOWN ON ROD -- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room.  ROD'S screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor. 
ROD What the hell's going ON here! Tina! 
ANGLE ON TINA -- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor. But she's dragged away from it.  The lamp swings back, it's wires gushing more SPARKS. 
CLOSER along the ceiling as TINA rakes a long furrow in the ceiling with her fingernails.  But her eyes are glazing, glazing.  And then they fall closed. 
WIDE, UP ON THE CEILING, as her body suddenly flops loose, hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed. 
REVERSE ON ROD -- staring like a terrified child. 
ROD Tina -- 
REVERSE IN HIS POV -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash of blood.  A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then ECHOES off into infinity.  ROD staggers up, staring around as if hoping to see this phantom. 
ROD You motherfucker!  I'll kill you for that! 
LT THOMPSON Terrific.  What the hell was she doing there? 
PARKER She lived there. 
LT THOMPSON OMIT 37.              I don't mean her --                           OMIT 37. 
38.   INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  38. 
THOMPSON enters his office and confronts NANCY and her mother, MARGE SIMSON. 
LT THOMPSON (CONTD) I mean you. (accusingly, to Marge) What the hell was she doing there? 
MARGE SIMSON is in her middle thirties; a good-looking woman despite the hour and circumstances. 
MARGE Hello to you, too, Donald. 
THOMPSON stops, the steam suddenly out of him.  The girl is a wreck and he winces to see it. 
LT THOMPSON Marge. 
THOMPSON glances at PARKER and the other UNIFORMED COPS who are in the room.  As a man they head for the door.  There's no question who the boss is here.  THOMPSON turns to NANCY.  She fumbles a smile. 
LT THOMPSON (CONTD) How you doing, pal? 
NANCY Okay.  Hi, dad. 
NANCY's dress is dark with dried blood, her skin clammy and the color of paste.  MARGE shoots her ex-husband a worried glance. THOMPSON pulls a chair close to NANCY. 
LT THOMPSON I don't want to get into this now, god knows you need time. (hotter) But I'd sure would like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night -- especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane. 
NANCY weaves. 
NANCY Rod's not a lunatic. 
LT THOMPSON You got a sane explanation for what he did? 
The girl is shredding a Kleenex, staring off. 
MARGE Apparantly he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina. 
NANCY (quietly) It wasn't that serious... 
MARGE Maybe you don't think murder's serious -- 
NANCY sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing. 
NANCY She was my best friend!  Don't you dare say I don't take her death seriously! (lower, near tears) I just meant their fights weren't that serious. 
The girl holds the woman's eyes a moment, then looks away. 
NANCY (CONTD) (to herself) She dreamed this would happen... 
LT THOMPSON What? 
NANCY She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone. 
A tear splashes off the arm of her chair. 
MARGE She's been through enough for one night.  You have her statement. 
The mother and daughter rise; THOMPSON raps on the door and PARKER opens it. 
LT THOMPSON (to MARGE) I suggest you keep a little better track on her -- she's still a kid, y'know. 
MARGE wheels on him. 
MARGE You think I knew there were boys there!?  You try raising a teenager alone. 
Then she and the girl are gone.  THOMPSON glares at PARKER. 
LT THOMPSON (low to PARKER) See they get home okay. 
PARKER shoves his hands in his pockets.  ON HIS FACE we 
FADE TO BLACK 
39.   INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  MORNING.                                   39. 
BURN ON 
NANCY The door was locked from your side. 
ROD grabs her hard.  His muscular body tenses. 
ROD Don't look at me like I'm some kind of fucking fruitcake or something, I'm warning you. 
VOICE (O.S.) Morning, Mr. Lane. 
42.   The boy jerks around.  NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at    42. ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes. 
LT THOMPSON Now just step away from her, son. Like your ass depended on it. I'm warning you. 
ROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible sadness.  Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell. 
THOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY jumps between -- 
NANCY No! 
THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious. 
THOMPSON Jesus -- are you crazy!? 
He plunges past the girl. 
42A.  EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                42A. 
ROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before -- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another angle.  The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is soon wrestled to the ground.  Next moment one of the cops is holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see.  THOMPSON looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR. 
ROD (O.S.) I didn't do it -- ! (fading) I didn't kill her, Nancy! 
The car's door slams and ROD is gone.  NANCY turns to her father, livid. 
NANCY You used me, daddy! 
LT THOMPSON (exasperated) What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night! 
NANCY spins angrily and walks away. 
LT THOMPSON Nancy!  Hey! 
But she just keeps going. 
FADE TO BLACK 
43.   INT.  CLASSROOM.  DAY.                                             43. 
FADE UP ON an ENGLISH TEACHER and CLASS, NANCY among the kids, trying to concentrate. 
TEACHER According to Shakespeare, there was something operating in Nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that was rotten -- a canker, as he put it. 
The TEACHER'S eyes glance across the room.  ANGLE ON NANCY; yawning but listening. 
TEACHER (CONTD) Of course Hamlet's response to this, and to his mother's lies, was to continually probe and dig -- just like the gravediggers -- always trying to get beneath the surface.  The same was true in a different way in Julius Caesar. Jon, go ahead... 
She nods to a SURFER who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of the class.  He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the Bard. 
SURFER (reading aloud) Uh, In the most high and palmy state of Rome... 
WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.) California's the most high and palmy state, man. 
The SURFER halts with a grin; KIDS snicker. 
ENGLISH TEACHER Can it. 
She glares them back into silence.  The SURFER starts over, as we CUT TO NANCY. 
She's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the warm, close boredom of the classroom. 
SURFER (O.S.) In the most high and palmy state of Rome, a little ere the mightiest Julius fell... (NANCY's head pitches forward; she jerks it back up, barely awake) The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the Roman street... 
44.   NANCY's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous       44. weight.  By the time her cheek's against the desk, the SURFER'S VOICE is ECHOED and DISTANT.  But another voice, TINA'S, is very near, very much present.  A sad, thin plaint. 
TINA (O.S.) Nancy. 
NANCY gives a start.  Her eyes lock onto something. 
45.   REVERSE.  TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight     45. out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall. There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber body bag.  Dark red and yellow.  Weaving slightly, the merest suggesting of movement within it. 
46.   BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46. shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter.  She looks back out the door. 
WIDER ANGLE.  EVERYBODY is staring at NANCY as if she's gone mad.  The ENGLISH TEACHER rushes over, herself frightened by the terror in the girl's eyes. 
TEACHER Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every- thing's all right now -- Nancy!. 
60.   NANCY jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to     60. leap from any direction.  But there's only the sea of staring eyes. 
NANCY begins methodically picking up her books. 
TEACHER I'll call your mother. 
NANCY No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go straight home.  I'm okay. 
She marches for the door. 
TEACHER You'll need a hall pass! 
But the girl's gone. 
61.   EXT.  THE SCHOOL.  DAY.                                            61. 
NANCY walks out of the building, shaken.  Then she pauses at one of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against its bark, teeth set.  NANCY starts to shake, and next second she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child.        OMIT 61A. OMIT 61A. 62.   But she shakes herself silent.  Wipes the tears away with a slash  62. of sleeve.  She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then reacts in surprise and pain.  She lifts her arm and stares at the spot she's touched. 
INSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of a half-dollar. 
WIDER ON NANCY.  Utterly, chillingly confused. 
62A.  TINA, against the tree inches from NANCY, (SC 7) -- turns to her and says -- 
TINA Couldn't get back to sleep at all. (beat) What you dream? 
63.   EXT.  A BUSY STREET.  DAY.                                         63. 
NANCY is walking quickly, head erect, jaw set.  Then she enters her father's Police Station. 
64.   INT.  VAN NUYS POLICE STATION.  DAY.                               64. 
NANCY crosses directly to the GARCIA. 
NANCY My dad here? 
GARCIA looks up from his paperwork. 
SERGEANT GARCIA Lieutenant. 
LT THOMPSON emerges from another room, uneasy to see NANCY. 
LT THOMPSON Decide to take a day off after all? 
NANCY Dad, I want to see Rod Lane. 
THOMPSON doesn't miss a beat. 
LT THOMPSON Only family allowed, Nancy.  You know the drill. 
NANCY Just want to talk to him a second. 
LT THOMPSON He's dangerous. 
NANCY You don't know he did it. 
LT THOMPSON No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag. 
NANCY flinches; her father shows the first signs of color in his neck. 
NANCY I just want to talk to him. (beat, lower) Please, Dad. 
THOMPSON shifts almost imperceptibly towards GARCIA, then turns back to NANCY. 
LT THOMPSON Make it fast. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
65.   INT.  CELL AREA.  DAY.                                             65. 
A GUARD exits pushing a cart of food trays.  NANCY waits warily until he's gone, then looks back to ROD LANE.  ROD looks more like a captured coyote than a human; haggard, ribbed, expecting poisoned bait.  His hair is wet, his clothes are borrowed jeans and work shirt. 
NANCY (low) And then what happened? 
ROD I told you. (reluctantly) It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her. 
GLEN makes the Twilight Zone sound. 
NANCY Okay? 
GLEN Okay, okay. (beat) I think. 
She comes very close to him. 
NANCY You won't screw up, right?  I mean, a whole lot might depend on it. 
The way she's looking at him gives him the creeps. 
GLEN Okay, I won't screw up. 
77.   Nancy takes a deep breath.  Then without another word turns off    77. the TV and the light. 
GLEN (IN DARK) Jesus, it's dark in here. 
NANCY Shhh.  Now listen, here's what we're gonna do... 
78.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          78. 
FADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest sound.  We MOVE with her.  But nothing, not even the dog barking earlier, is there now.  NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns and trees behind her. 
NANCY (stage whisper) You still there? 
Across the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a tree. 
GLEN Yeah.  So? 
NANCY Just checking -- keep out of sight! 
GLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of sight.  NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into a dark alleyway.  Then she forces herself to walk into it. 
79.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               79. 
MOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into shadows.  Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more threatening and expectant.  The feeling is of immense tension -- we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any second. 
But he doesn't.  In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed.  The only thing strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to 
80.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      80. 
The Police Station.  It takes her a little by surprise, it just seems to have appeared. 
MUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely back down the dark alley. 
NANCY (CONTD) Still there? 
81.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               81. 
We only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED. 
GLEN'S VOICE (OS) (yawning) Still here! 
NANCY On your toes, right? 
NANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't.  She turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight. 
82.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      82. 
MUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees.  It's a low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she looks through it. 
83.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          83. 
NANCY'S POV down into ROD LANE's cell.  The boy is on his rough cot, twitching in disturbed sleep.  And a long SHADOW is sliding across the wall. 
A big SHAPE appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's cell, and as IT walks closer NANCY can barely see it's the shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow.  The KILLER from all of their nightmares. 
And this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the cell, like so much evil Jello.  Halfway through he pauses, turning to check over his shoulder.  We see the bars clearly penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles. Then he turns back to ROD and moves forward, and within another heartbeat is beside the boy. 
84.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      84. 
NANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror.  She looks behind her for help. 
NANCY (CONTD) Glen. 
No answer. 
NANCY (CONTD) (louder) Glen?! 
NANCY darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it. 
Safe at last. 
She listens at the door.  Nothing.  She crosses to her bed.  Next second the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a shower of shattered glass! 
NANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat. 
The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing onto NANCY's bed.  Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls.  Defenseless, she snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying.  NANCY dives for escape in a virtual blizzard. 
The KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers. 
ANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS. The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her eyes.  Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane! 
But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to NANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG! 
96.   Instantly the MUSIC STOPS.  And a moment later the room is         96. light. 
WIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING AND FIGHTING on her bed. 
ANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening noise.  He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a straw. 
It's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight. 
NANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room, untangling herself from her bedclothes.  Wary and furious, her voice hoarse. 
NANCY Glen, you bastard... 
The boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm.  She's absolutely livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange. 
GLEN What I do? 
He reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard, and terribly hurt, too. 
NANCY (low) I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay awake and watch me -- Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad dream. (eyes wild) But you.  You shit -- what do you do -- you fall asleep! 
She stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed at how out of control she's become.  And suddenly she breaks, sinking into her 	torn bedclothes and rubbing her head. 
NANCY (CONTD) (mostly to herself) I must be going nuts... 
MARGE (OS) Nancy? 
Her mother's door opens OS. 
GLEN Oh, shit. 
NANCY composes her voice as best she can. 
NANCY Yes, mother? 
MARGE's flip-flops approach outside the door.  GLEN barrels out the window -- NANCY dives for the bed, jams off the light and disappears under the covers.  MARGE, bleary eyed herself, opens the door and flicks on the light. 
MARGE (beat) You okay? 
NANCY (weakly) Yeah.  Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep. 
MARGE (beat) Okay... You need anything, just call. 
NANCY Okay. 
MARGE closes the door.  NANCY immediately sits up and looks at the window.  A single bone-white feather floats down in the moonlight.  Then it's sucked outside and is gone. 
97.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      97. 
GLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and SCREECHES to a stop.  GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the station. 
GLEN You mind telling me what's going on? 
NANCY's races into the station without answering. 
GLEN (CONTD) Oh, I see.  That makes it all perfectly clear. 
98.   INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      98. 
NANCY goes straight to the SERGEANT's desk. 
NANCY Garcia, I want to see Rod Lane again. 
GARCIA winces. 
They lay ROD at NANCY's feet; a strange Pieta.  NANCY's father looks at her in spooked suspicion. 
LT THOMPSON How'd you know he was gonna do this? 
NANCY says nothing. 
FADE TO BLACK 
105.  EXT.  FOREST LAWN CEMETERY.  DAY.                                  105. 
BURN ON: 
THE FOURTH DAY 
FADE UP ON a stark afternoon.  On a hill of sere grass overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into its grave. 
A small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the MINISTER raises his hand in benediction. 
MINISTER Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God be with this young man's soul. 
ON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S PARENTS.  Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks.  Furtive, quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all share, something beyond even this second death among their children.  Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the others weren't even there. 
MINISTER (CONTD OS) His life and his death attest to the Scripture's warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword. 
ANGLE ON GLEN, watching -- 
NANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute. 
MINISTER (CONTD OS) But let us recall also our Lord's admonition that we 'Judge not, lest we be judged.'  Let us attempt only to love.  And may Rod Lane rest in peace. 
NANCY (quietly) Amen to that much. 
The mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them.  She pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S PARENTS.  They almost, it seems, speak.  Then MARGE hurries on. 
WE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON.  Both are worn and on edge.  THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette, offering one to MARGE. 
LT THOMPSON How's Nancy doing? 
MARGE I don't think she's slept since Tina died. (shakes her head) She's always been a delicate kid. 
THOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of nonchalance. 
LT THOMPSON She's tougher than you think. Any idea how she knew Rod was gonna kill himself? 
MARGE No.  All I know is, this reminds me too much of ten years ago. 
THOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks away. 
LT THOMPSON Yeah.  Well... Let's not start digging up bodies just because we're in a cemetery. 
He gives her a look that could cut stone.  MARGE toses down her cigarete and crosses to NANCY.  The girl is simply staring off over the valley. 
MARGE (very gently) Time to go home, baby. 
She moves her away from the brink of the hill. 
106.  EXT.  CEMETERY PARKING AREA.  DAY.                                 106. 
MARGE opens the door of the station wagon for NANCY.  NANCY turns to them both, speaking in a still, small voice. 
NANCY The killer's still loose, you know. 
She has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up MARGE'S spine. 
LT THOMPSON You saying somebody else killed Tina?  Who? 
NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile. 
NANCY I don't know who he is.  But he's burned, he wears a weird hat, a red and yellow sweater, real dirty, and he uses some sort of knifes he's got made into a sort of... glove.  Like giant finger- nails. 
As NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by her, 	the faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely of color. 
LT THOMPSON (low, even, to MARGE) I think you should keep Nancy at home a few days.  'Til she's really over the shock. 
MARGE I got something better... (to NANCY) I'm gonna get you help, baby. So no one will threaten you any more. 
She takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car, locking the door from outside.  NANCY never taking her eyes from her father's as the car bears her away. 
FADE TO BLACK 
111.  A MONTAGE OF SHOTS, of the EKG GRAPH, its inky needles calming,    111. of a METER tracing the quieting of NANCY's pulse, and of OTHER INSTRUMENTS, indicating life processes we can only guess.  All smoothing out. 
112.  CLOSE ON NANCY on TV MONITOR, asleep like the child she is.        112. Innocent. 
MARGE lights a cigarette, angry at her helplessness. 
MARGE What the hell are dreams, anyway? 
DR KING Mysteries.  Incredible body hookus pokus.  Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares... (leans closer) Did you know that in the last three years twenty Philipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died. 
He gives a "Ah don' know" shrug.  MARGE looks out into the sleeping room.  NANCY is a motionless bundle in the middle of the bed. 
113.  ANGLE ON A NEEDLE on an EKG dipping to a lower reading.            113. 
114.  WIDER ANGLE -- the mother and DOCTOR watching.                     114. 
MARGE What happened?  That needle sank like a rock. 
DR KING (quietly) She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed.  All normal. She could dream at any time now. (beat) Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet.  Waiting to see what shows up. 
115.  INT.  THE SLEEPING ROOM.                                           115. 
We can see NANCY drift from the initial stage, over the brink into deep sleep.  Her hair falls into her eyes; her face relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters.  THE MUSIC DEEPENS, and begins to hint at the tones of the NIGHTMARE THEME. 
116.  INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.                                          116. 
DR KING and MARGE watch the instruments' every move. 
One of the machines begins a slight CHIRPING.  KING scans it, liking what he sees. 
DR KING Okay, she's started to dream. 
He leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an instrument approach.  MARGE THOMPSON licks her dry lips, fighting a turn of nausea. 
MARGE How can you tell? 
DR KING R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this -- 
He prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note pad. 
DR KING (CONTD) Beta Waves are slowing, too. She's dreaming, all right. A good one, too. 
MARGE watches the TV MONITOR.  It's in extra-close on NANCY's eyes -- and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons. 
KING points to a moving graph.  A needle's begun waving lazily between plus and minus three.  The DOCTOR nods, assured. 
DR KING (CONTD) Typical dream parameter.  A nightmare, now, would be plus or minus five or six; she's just around three point -- 
He stops.  Outside, visible through the glass, NANCY twists around.  Eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the predator's approach. 
MARGE looks from her daughter to the DOCTOR, color draining from her face. 
MARGE What the hell's this?  She awake or asleep? 
The needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then surges well above the eight mark.  A strange MUSIC CUE -- disonant and threatening, creeps in -- the NIGHTMARE THEME slurred into awful minors and weird disonance.  KING stares at the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass. 
DR KING Can't be.  It never gets this high... 
The needle swings even higher, benind. 
DR KING (CONTD) Jesus H. Christ. 
He's cut off by the high-pitched KEENING of the girl, the SOUND cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar. A warning BEEPER has begun, the instruments light up like a Christmas tree -- and outside in the sleeping room, NANCY is contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts.  KING knocks over his chair in his sprint for the door. 
117.  INT.  SLEEPING ROOM.                                               117. 
The DOCTOR and MARGE come in on the run -- NANCY's flailing and screaming as if the devil himself were after her.  KING grabs her to shake her awake; 
ANGLE ON NANCY (eyes open) -- looking in terror -- SOUND ECHOED STRANGELY. 
IN HER POV -- dressed in KING'S clothes -- the horribly scarred MAN reaches out. 
WIDER -- (NANCY'S eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots out with incredible force and knocks DR KING flying! 
The NURSE and MARGE both descend on her -- 
and again in her SLEEPING POV we see the MAN stagger for her. 
WIDER ON NANCY -- (still in her nightmare) -- fighting like a tiger with both MARGE and the NURSE -- sending the NURSE sprawling -- leaving MARGE hanging on for dear life. 
130.  OMIT                                                          OMIT 130. 
131.  EXT.  THE VALLEY AND HILLS.  NIGHT.                                131. 
HIGH, WIDE SHOT.  The moon is above the horizon.  A cool wind slides a bank of white fog inland.  The valley and its lights stretch forever, an endless net of illumination and darkness.  A coyote HOWLS on the dark hill. 
132.  EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      132. 
A palm frond scuttles across the center of the parking lot.  LT THOMPSON arrives in an unmarked car. 
COP (passing) Lieutenant Thompson -- what you doing in at this time? 
LT THOMPSON Can't sleep, thought I'd come break up the poker game. 
The COP laughs and goes his way.  THOMPSON's smile evaporates. 
133.  INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      133. 
THOMPSON enters and checks the log.  Nearby, SGT GARCIA pours coffee. 
SERGEANT GARCIA If it was any more quiet we could hear owls farting. 
LT THOMPSON Is quiet, isn't it? 
SERGEANT GARCIA (too casually) How's your girl? 
THOMPSON looks at the Desk sergeant a moment, then tosses down the log. 
LT THOMPSON She's sensible.  She'll sleep sooner or later. 
134.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          134. 
The neighborhood is utterly still, most of the homes already dark.  But not NANCY's.  Or GLEN's. 
ZOOM TO GLEN'S LIGHTED LIVING ROOM WINDOW. 
135.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  135. 
GLEN's father watches eleven o'clocks news, a dreary FILM CLIP (STOCK) of war and refugees in a far-away land. 
MR LANTZ takes a pull on his Bud. 
MR LANTZ You'd think they'd have some- thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging himself. 
MRS LANTZ walks through the room, drying her hands on a dishtowel. 
MRS LANTZ Maybe we're all making more out of it than we should. 
She heads upstairs.  MR LANTZ pops the automatic tuner.  CARSON blinks ON. 
CARSON (TV) I wouldn't touch that line with a ten foot pole. 
ED MCMAHON and the AUDIENCE laugh in delight. 
136.  INT.  GLEN'S HOUSE/UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  NIGHT.                      136. 
MRS LANTZ comes along the upstairs hall and knocks gently at a closed door. 
MRS LANTZ Glen?  you all right? 
She puts her ear to the door and listens. 
MRS LANTZ (CONTD) Glen honey? 
No answer. 
137.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         137. 
GLEN lies sprawled across the bed, long legs flung over the end, head not visible. 
His mother enters.  She looks at the boy, turns off the TV. Looks at him again. From this angle she can see his head, earphones crammed over it rasping their tinny noise.  But no movement from the kid at all. MRS LANTZ crosses and pokes him in the ribs.  GLEN lurches up, arms windmilling. 
GLEN Whuu? 
He refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones. 
MRS LANTZ How can you listen to Carson and a record at the same time? 
GLEN swings his legs over the edge of the bed and shakes his head to clear the cobwebs. 
MR LANTZ Know what I think?  I think that kid's some kinda lunatic. 
The woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her forehead. 
MRS LANTZ Shouldn't say such a thing about the poor child.  If you mean the bars, Marge's just being cautious, her being alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately. 
The woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room.  As he goes inside he takes one last look. 
MR LANTZ (CONTD) Well, she ain't gonna hang around our boy no more. 
Once the two are inside, the door is locked. 
148.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        148. 
CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  VERY CLOSE.  Her eyes stare ahead, red-rimmed, anxious.  She picks absently at the thick bandage covering her forearm.  The long cuts from Fred Krueger's fingers are bleeding again, but she doesn't even care anymore.  Too late to sweat the small stuff.  She crosses the room. 
On the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker, the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned alarm clock, and a phone. 
NANCY pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the dregs, then looks to the clock. 
INSERT CLOCK -- ten minutes to midnight. 
NANCY'S eyes go to the door. 
WIDER.  Fully clothed and in a jacket now, she creeps to the door and cracks it, just to make sure.  Then freezes. 
149.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE NANCY'S DOOR.                                149. 
IN NANCY'S POV through the door we see MARGE, rummaging around in the linen closet not fifteen feet away.  There's no way NANCY can get past her.  The woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap. 
150.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        150. 
NANCY eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole, watching through it with a sinking heart. 
NANCY (very quiet, very intense) Hang on GLEN... 
151.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         151. 
GLEN, coat now on, goes to his window, checking. 
152.  INT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          152. 
GLEN'S POV -- NANCY'S porch is deserted; front door closed, lights out.  No sign of NANCY. 
153.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         153. 
GLEN shrugs, takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed. 
GLEN Well, I'm not gonna risk sneaking out until she does. 
He puts the earphones back on. 
154.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        154. 
Absolutely frustrated, NANCY turns from the keyhole to the window. She opens the blind and eases back the curtain. 
155.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT. 
IN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's window. 
156.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         156. 
GLEN lies on his bed, fully clothed, earphones over his ears, CARSON droning from the TV.  And the boy's eyes begin to droop. 
157.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     157. 
NANCY picks up her phone, bites her lip, then begins dialing. 
158.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         158. 
TIGHT ON PHONE as it begins RINGING loudly. 
WIDER SHOT, revealing GLEN asleep BACKGROUND, the MUSIC still LOUD in his earphones. 
159.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  159. 
RINGING here, too, just as MR LANTZ is turning out the lights for bed.  He stops in the dark, scowling. 
MR LANTZ Who at this hour? 
She races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and banging on the bars like a mad woman.  But there's no getting through.  She staggers back, stymied and furious.  Then somebody moves behind her in the dark. 
VOICE (OS) Locked. 
NANCY jumps around in shock.  Her mother has posted herself on the couch with her bottle. 
NANCY (furious) Give me the key, mother. 
MARGE I don't even have it on me, so forget it. 
The word is final.  NANCY runs past the woman to the back door, to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks and SCREAMING in teenage fury.  But it's no good.  The house is her prison. 
MARGE (CONTD) (drunk satisfaction) Paid the guy damn good to make sure you stayed put.  You ain't goin' nowhere, kid.  You're gonna sleep tonight if it kills me. 
NANCY clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a heart-wrenching, eardrum-breaking cry of love in despair -- 
NANCY GLEEENNNNNN! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
164.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         164. 
CLOSE ON GLEN'S FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE.  The MUSIC is tinny from the earphones, the TV SOUND DISTANT AND ECHOED.  The boy is breathing deeply now, slowly and gently.  Then, unmistakeably, he begins to SNORE.  Very faintly, far in the background, we can hear NANCY. 
NANCY (OS) Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep! 
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND STRAIGHT UP as the SNORES merge with a weird, unsettling MUSIC CUE.  The boy lies sprawled, still clothed, in the middle of his bed.  Save for the bedside lamp, the room is dark. 
FULL WIDE ANGLE FROM THIS HIGH SPOT looking down at him as from the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling.  THE MUSIC REACHES A TERRIFYING PITCH OF ANTICIPATION -- THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY. 
There's a heartbeat's pause.  Then with tremendous force, two powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and grab GLEN around the waist! 
Next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him down!  His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed!  His hands are last to go, clawing for a hold.  But soon they vanish as well, dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the caved-in bed and into the abyss. 
There's HIDEOUS SCREECHING of MUSIC jamming in with GLEN's ECHOING SCREAMS -- then an unholy, sudden silence. 
Next moment what's left of GLEN is vomited up from the pit of the nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and wires...streaming out and over the bed.  Then the pit in the bed is gone as if it were never there. 
Drawn by the terribly screams and struggle, GLEN's mother bursts into the room.  The women stares for one moment of horrified disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god-awful SCREAM imaginable.  The cry splits the night. 
165.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          165. 
The SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR.  Uniformed POLICEMEN spill out FOREGROUND. 
LT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.  By habit or by premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.  His eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through her bars.  She gives a little wave. 
Unnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's home.  MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we can hear the mother's WAILING inside. 
166.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        166. 
CLOSE ON NANCY'S BIG OLD WINDUP ALARM CLOCK.  Its big and little hands sweep together at midnight. 
BURN ON: 
THE NINTH DAY 
There's a BABBLE of POLICE RADIOS, SIRENS WINDING DOWN, RUNNING FOOT-STEPS, SHOUTS, NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS and DOGS BARKING as CAMERA LIFTS TO NANCY'S FACE.  Set.  Unafraid.  Ruthless. 
The girl pulls the window shade on it all, then looks at her bed. 
NANCY Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your court. 
167.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM/NANCY'S KITCHEN -- INTERCUT.  NIGHT.      167. 
168.  LT THOMPSON is halfway across the living room when he stops.       168. Something dark and red is welling from a crack in the ceiling. One of his men is rigging a bucket beneah to catch the leaking. The telephone rings and PARKER picks it up. 
PARKER Lieutenant.  It's your daughter. Says it's urgent. 
THOMPSON turns away from the dripping. 
LT THOMPSON (low) Tell her I'm not here, tell her... 
PARKER Uh, she just saw you, sir... 
THOMPSON nods, crosses and picks up the telephone.  SCREEN SPLITS; we see both. 
LT THOMPSON (CONTD) Hello Nancy. 
NANCY Hi daddy.  I know what happened. 
DISSOLVE TO HER HANDS wrapping bare lamp wire around two thumbtacks stuck into the insides of the pinchers of a common wooden clothespin.  The wire goes OFF SCREEN. 
ANOTHER ANGLE as she inserts a Lifesaver between the two prongs. One end of the fishline is tied to the lifesaver.  The whole now is stretched taut about three inches off the living room carpet. 
ON NANCY carefully filing a hole in a LIGHTBULB. 
OH HER pouring powder and shot from shotgun shells into the opening in the bulb until it's full, then sealing it with tape. 
DISSOLVE TO HER screwing the bulb back into the floor lamp, and placing the thing near the foot of the stairs.

175.  INT.  NANCY'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                            175. 
-- NANCY completes installing a sturdy sliding bolt to the outside of her own bedroom door. 
-- NANCY screws a hinge into the wall directly above her door. Attached to the hinge is the shank of something -- some kind of tool.  We can't see what it is because CAMERA never quite frames the whole thing. 
-- NANCY tiptoes to her mother's door and peeks in. 
176.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     176. 
MARGE lies propped in her bed looking back at NANCY.  Her drunkeness has been altered by the SIRENS and BABBLE outside into a sort of comatose clarity. 
MARGE Guess I should'n'a done it. 
NANCY Just sleep now, Mom. 
MARGE Just wanted to protect you, Nan.  Just wanted to protect you... 
MARGE slides over on her side.  NANCY smooths her hair, covers her as she would a child, then exits the room. 
DELETE SC 177 
178.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        178. 
The girl enters, turns out her bedside light, slips out of her dress and puts on her nightgown.  Then she kneels by her bed. 
NANCY (quietly) Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. 
She gets into bed and pulls the blankets to her chin. 
CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  She stares straight up at the ceiling for a long moment, then closes her eyes. 
CUT TO: 
179.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  179. 
LT THOMPSON trudges down the stais and confronts GLEN'S FATHER. 
LT THOMPSON I know it's hard to think at a time like this, Walter, but can you think of anyone who could've done such a thing? 
The father stares away, his voice low and dull. 
MR LANTZ He done it. 
THOMPSON looks at the man, baffled. 
LT THOMPSON Who?  Who did that? 
MR LANTZ Krueger. 
LT THOMPSON Krueger? 
The father gives him the strangest look. 
MR LANTZ Had to've done it.  No one else was in there. 
LT THOMPSON How you know that? 
MR LANTZ Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! (getting control) Sorry.  Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams. 
He blinks. 
MR LANTZ (CONTD) Maybe god's punishing us all... 
LT THOMPSON (much lower and hard) Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about. 
MR LANTZ Like Rod Lane? 
Hardly able to catch her breath, her hair tangled, her nightgown torn, she drops the net.  She sits on the bed, turns on the bedside lamp and re-examines her room.  No one there but herself. 
It's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe.  Her face is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless.  She rattles her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness. 
NANCY I'm crazy after all... 
At that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage! 
He lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY pitches backwards and scrambles for the window.  But she's stopped by the bars. 
KRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head.  As he crashes backwards NANCY flings open the door of her room and dives through -- only to rebound off someone on the other side -- 
187.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             187. 
MARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard, knocking the wind out of herself.  NANCY sees what she's done, jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt home.  Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to something up there that's still just barely out of sight. 
Next instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's bedroom as fast as she can. 
KRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her and locking it in a flash. 
The MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door. 
But the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific force. 
CLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING.  The string jerks against a single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling. 
WIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with a terrific blow.  As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to camera just what it is! 
ANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony, lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull. 
WIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway, catching it just above the thigh.  He cartwheels head-over-heels and lands flat on his back! 
Instantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her might!  It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal flagpole. 
NANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his head. 
Enraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like the utter homicidal lunatic that he is. 
CUT TO: 
188.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                             188. 
HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level.  NANCY jerks open the window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars. The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard. 
NANCY Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got him trapped!  Where are you!? 
189.  ANGLE ON the street.  PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees    189. NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and screaming like a lunatic.  But her meaning is utterly lost in the noise of the ambulance next to him. 
PARKER (yelling up at her) Everything's going to be all right!  Everything's under control! 
ANGLE at the window.  Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his response. 
NANCY Get my father, you asshole! 
PARKER does a little take.  That almost sounded sane. 
PARKER (OS) You heard what I said!  Now get back inside or I'll tell your dad! 
191.  Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.  NANCY whirls around just in time   191. to see KRUEGER bull in!  NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped against the bars and has nowhere to go.  The man bunches his knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.  NANCY closes her eyes -- 
Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two. 
MARGE No! 
She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives. Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars behind. Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand, keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter! 
MARGE Nancy -- for god's sake's run! 
But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father. 
NANCY Daddy!  Where are you! 
192.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          192. 
PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house, sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window. Something begins to dawn on the man.  Just a little. 
PARKER Poor woman's got her hands full with that kid.  Maybe I better tell the lieutenant. 
He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house. 
The CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile. 
CORONER (CONTD) Only place I ever heard of such a thing before was ten years ago.  Remember that fucker Fred Krueger? 
LT THOMPSON has just knocked PARKER sprawling in his race to the stairs. 
PARKER Hey -- your daughter's acting kinda -- ! (THOMPSON'S gone) Strange... 
201.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        201. 
CRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the bars.  The house shudders and glows orange behind her.  She sees her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house! 
NANCY DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE! 
LT THOMPSON Oh, Jesus -- Nancy! (to his men) Hey!  We got a fire! 
202.  ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR.  Many MEN batter the door down as     202. black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS fill the air.  Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms. But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild woman. 
NANCY I got him -- I got Fred Krueger! 
THOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then runs in after her.  The others follow, coughing and choking. 
203.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         203. 
THOMPSON collides with NANCY as she brakes, frozen.  THE SMOKE IS BELCHING OUT OF THE CELLAR, but whoever was locked in there certainly isn't now.  The door is flat on the kitchen floor. 
LT THOMPSON What the hell are you talking about, Nancy? 
NANCY wheels without answering.  A series of tiny, isolated fires burn across the living room and up the stairs.  Firesteps. 
NANCY (CONTD) He's after Mom!  Come on! 
She darts across the living room, following the flaming footprints of FRED KRUEGER up the stairs before THOMPSON can stop her. 
LT THOMPSON NANCY! 
204.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     204. 
NANCY STOPS IN THE SPLINTERED DOORWAY -- a ragged gold-red light splashing her horrified face. 
205.  REVERSE IN HER POV -- FRED KRUEGER, literally a man of fire, has   205. a screaming MARGE pinned to the bed and is crawling all over her!  NANCY gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him. 
By the time LT THOMPSON races into the room NANCY'S seized a heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames. The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the flames. 
NANCY He's under there!  Watch it! 
206.  THOMPSON pushes the girl back -- yanks out his .38 and pulls off   206. the first cover.  No movement.  He pulls back a second one, ready to fire.  But the only thing he sees is the blackened half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if she were sinking into a lake.  A blackened, gnarled hand goes last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared. And it's as if no one was ever there. 
NANCY turns and looks at LT THOMPSON, her face white as her ghostly hair.  THOMPSON shoves his .38 back in its holster and finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely manage. 
NANCY Now do you believe me? 
PARKER barges in.  The room is filled with smoke, the bed is stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal. 
PARKER You find him? (looking closer at THOMPSON) Sir? 
LT THOMPSON just walks by him.  PARKER chases after. 
PARKER (CONTD OS) (fading) Sir -- here, let me light that for you -- Lieutenant?  What happened? (gone) 
WIDER, ON NANCY alone in the room.  She turns and looks at the bed.  MUSIC slips in and builds.  The bed has changed color. It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow. 
207.  CLOSER ON NANCY from the direction of the bed.  MUSIC SUDDENLY     207. STOPS, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over NANCY. 
Then FRED KRUEGER's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops through. 
NEW ANGLE -- KRUEGER, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer, clumps onto the floor between NANCY and the door. 
NANCY falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a strange, almost sublime transformation. 
NANCY (quietly) I know you're there, Krueger. 
She turns and faces him. 
FREDDIE You think you was gonna get away from me? 
NANCY shakes her head. 
NANCY I know you too well now, Freddie.

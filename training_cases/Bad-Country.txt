FADE IN: 
LANDSCAPES 
A rusted Chevy El Camino drives against dissolving Louisiana landscapes - broad, barren, pounded by the rain. 
I/E. EL CAMINO, TRAVELING - DUSK 
Occasional oncoming headlights illuminate the driver's face: Tense, course features, thick beard... He's BUD CARTER, 31. 
AN INTERSTATE SIGN PASSES ON THE RIGHT: "WHISKEY BAY" 
Bud pulls onto a dirt road, into a TRAILER PARK and stops. 
INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - DUSK 
TITLE IN: Denham Springs, Louisiana. 1983. 
We're staring at three sacks of sample unmounted EMERALDS, set on a filthy counter. 
SOUTHERN MAN'S VOICE O.S. Now these here are Brazilian, from Bahia. Deep cuts. Damn good. These is India, paler, but also good. And this is Columbia. From them limestone caves up in Muzo. 
WIDEN to reveal NADY GRACE, 35. A tattooed man with thinning hair, leading Bud through the sale... 
GRACE Now them first two, you gonna get your money's worth. (re: COLUMBIA EMERALDS) This one here's more expensive, but that's 'cause there ain't a nigger flaw in one of 'em. They hard as steel and emerald green as emerald green fuckin' comes. Lookit that. 
BUD That's nice. 
GRACE That's the real McCoy. That's what that is. 
BUD Tell you what... Bag 'em all. The market's got a hard-on for this shit. 
GRACE I hear that. (across the room) Jake, get on it. 
ACROSS THE ROOM are two other men -- JAKE and DOUG. Ex-cons at a table, riffing through Bud's cash. 
A CURTAIN YANKS BACK and RAY WHEELER, 29, enters. Dope-thin, bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray clicks on the TV and opens a beer. 
TV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception. 
NEWSCASTER ...And today, thirty-one year old Gary Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, to charges of second-degree murder in the slaying of accused sex offender, Jeffrey Doucett. 
Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar. Using a credit card, Ray starts chopping lines. The SOUND continues throughout the scene... 
NEWSCASTER (TV) ...District Court Judge Frank Salia, scheduled the trial one year to the day after Doucett was first arrested. 
Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of emeralds. Bud SEES packed carelessly underneath, uncut DIAMONDS. 
BUD What do you got there? Diamonds? 
GRACE That's thirty grand. Out the door. You interested? 
BUD Ain't got the scratch right now. But I am interested. 
And the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent... 
NEWSCASTER O.S. ...As a result of numerous threats made weeks ago, tight security surrounded the courthouse. However, missing from today's hearing, was the arresting officer. 
Bud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last statement. He sneaks a look. 
NEWSCASTER From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office... 
A wave of static scrambles the picture. When it clears... 
NEWSCASTER O.S. ...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter. 
Bud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM. 
EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME 
Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance. 
INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 
TV IN: Signal wavers. It's archive footage of Baton Rouge Airport. A prisoner, JEFFREY DOUCETT, escorted by police. 
NEWSCASTER Doucett was being extradited to Baton Rouge. 
Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping. Watches the TV. 
Grace is bagging emeralds. 
Jake and Doug count cash. 
Bud keeps the TV in sight. Quick glances. Mind racing. 
TV IN: The procession moves past a row of pay phones. At one phone, a discreet figure, GARY PLAUCHE, turns... 
SHERRY Comin' up. 
Bud blows smoke, distant from the others. 
MARANDINO Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'. 'Been workin' this case for months. And you ain't said shit. 
BUD They had a lot of weight. Too much. 
COBB It's a ring. Organized burglary. 
BUD You saw them guys. You think that half ass crew was organized? 
MARANDINO (laughs) They shit their pants in unison. 
COBB What are you gettin' after, Bud? 
SHEPARD You think it was someone else's score. 
Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on. 
BUD I think its a part of somethin' bigger. 
Bud takes his shot. 
BUD Tomorrow morning we put our friends under the lamp. If they know this "someone else", we'll know him too. 
EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - ESTABLISH - NEXT DAY 
A dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY 
Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM, where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler. 
RAY I told you... I keep tellin' you... I don't know nothin'. That's it. 
COBB That's not it. We've been here all morning. We'll stay here all night. 
Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose). 
MARANDINO The stones you were fencin' belonged to an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers". The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both owners can verify their belongings, and have. (beat) Who you fencin' for? 
GRACE Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit. 
MARANDINO Then your name's on a dozen other jobs, just like it. 
GRACE That's bullshit. 
MARANDINO No, that's a promise. 
Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview... 
COBB We got a series of burglaries in the area. All over the last six months. All still open. You don't talk, it's on you. 
RAY Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that. 
COBB Any idea who does? 
RAY No! Okay? Fuck no. 
Bud sets down his coffee, calm. 
INT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM 
Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated. 
MARANDINO ...Answer the question. 
GRACE (exploding) MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS! 
The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down. 
BUD Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb to be any more than a courier. I know you're coverin' for someone else. NOW TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS! 
GRACE I ain't a rat! 
BUD YOU AIN'T A RAT?! 
Bud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS. 
MARANDINO Easy, Bud. Go easy. 
GRACE (to Marandino) STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM! 
Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off. 
BUD LOCK THE DOOR! 
Marandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder, nearly rips it off his face. 
BUD I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll throw you in an eight by nine and have you fucked in the ass by every inmate in the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! 
Grace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks. 
BUD GIVE ME A NAME! 
GRACE (hacking) He's from Whiskey Bay--! 
BUD --GIVE ME A NAME!! 
LYNN Help... My baby...my baby... 
Bud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn. Bud lowers Lynn to the floor. 
BUD (to Cobb) CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW! 
BEDROOM - TIME CUT 
A door slams open to reveal... 
A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG. Draped across the far wall. Windows taped over. Walls painted black. 
Military surplus on every shelf and surface. Helmets. Uniforms. Body armor. Bayonets. 
Bud in the doorway. Shepard joins him. 
BUD Toss everything. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
Several COPS(now on scene) ransack the house. Ripping open cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor... 
GARAGE 
Cobb flips a switch. A lamp illuminates a workbench. 
COBB Alright, I want everything seized! 
Cabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open. Cops stop cold, blown away by what they see: GUNS. Everywhere. 
LIVING ROOM 
COP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25 below a chair cushion. 
BATHROOM 
COP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he removes a dripping .357. 
KITCHEN 
Several STATE TROOPERS lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table. 
ATTIC 
Floor peels back. Flashlights illuminate: AMMUNITION BOXES. ASSAULT RIFLES. GRENADES. BONDS and COUNTERFEIT PLATES. 
MARANDINO Motherfucker's got a general store. 
LIVING ROOM 
Cops talk excitedly over one another. Shepard leans over a mounted A.C. He finds a string and very slowly pulls up a ziploc bag filled with DIAMONDS. 
SHEPARD God damn...there's some weight. 
KITCHEN 
Bud takes a seat at the table... 
For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS. 
BUD I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct. (smiles) So how you like Baton Rouge? 
Jesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly. 
Cabinets slam open and closed. Dishes hit the floor. 
JESSE What happened to my wife? 
BUD Water broke. She's en route to the hospital. 
COP #3 is searching the refrigerator. Jesse watches as if he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on... 
Jesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own... 
Bud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS. 
BUD This is new. 
Bud examines a vial's label: "CYANIDE." 
BUD What's the cyanide for, Jesse? 
JESSE Extracting impurities. 
Bud, right with him, grins. 
BUD Impurities from what? 
Jesse, calm. Deadpan. 
BUD You're in a bad situation here, pal. 
JESSE I'll make bond. 
Bud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it. 
BEDROOM 
Shepard, searching the room. Drawers, cabinets. Then leans down to peer under the bed... 
INTERCUT: 
INT. OFFICE, MARION PENITENTIARY, ILLINOIS - NIGHT 
CHARLIE BOWERS, on an official phone. At Jesse's name, he's DEAD QUIET... 
BUD Charlie, you there? 
CHARLIE What's your interest in this guy, Bud? 
BUD Well, we got him on weapons and burglary. But I got a feelin' there's more. 
CHARLIE Damn straight, a lot more. Race riots. Smuggling. Extorting a guard. I had a few run-ins with him myself. 
BUD What else? 
INT. BEDROOM, BUD'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN 
Bud lies in bed, wide awake. The PHONE CONVERSATION carries over... 
CHARLIE V.O. You could say this is where he peaked. 
KITCHEN - DAWN 
Coffee pours into a mug. Then a shot of Irish Whiskey. 
CHARLIE V.O. He's a white supremacist. The worst kind, if there is one. 
Bud, dressed now. The table is covered with various reports and photos from Jesse's file. BUD'S EYES guide us through... 
CHARLIE V.O. Came in on armed robbery and assault... 
Bud picks up a photo: Jesse's Angola mug shot, age 23. 
CHARLIE V.O. But word in the system said, he's a contract killer for the Aryan Brotherhood. 
Photos of Jesse's tattoos: SUN-WHEEL on the shoulder; HELL HOUNDS around the biceps, THOR'S ELAPID covering his back. 
CHARLIE V.O. In here, the guy became an organizer... 
INT. BUD'S CAR, TRAVELING - MORNING 
Bud's face goes in and out of light and shadow. 
CHARLIE V.O. Controlling hits and movements inside the system. Prison to prison. State to state. 
INT. LOWER FLOOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - MORNING 
Bud is walking with MURPHY, captain of the guards... 
CHARLIE V.O. Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo Nazis, he unified the front... 
Bud and Murphy descend steps to a grim CORRIDOR. 
CHARLIE V.O. All them prison gangs in the world... Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it. The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse Wheeler was their ring leader. 
The PHONE CONVERSATION fades out... Presently: 
BUD So what the fuck happened? 
MURPHY Processing ain't open till morning. We threw him in holding last night. 'Fore we even turn around, it's like we're back in the fuckin' Alamo. 
BUD He attack the guards? 
MURPHY Guards are fine. But he took on three niggers like they stole from him. 
Murphy stops outside a solid steel door. 
MURPHY I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it happened, our block was the quietest it'd ever been. Wish we had ten just like him. 
BUD Open the door. 
INT. ISOLATION CELL - CONTINUOUS 
Bud enters. Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks BOLT. We're in a stone closet. No bed or sink. No light. 
BUD Heard you refused a public defender. 
Jesse's bruised face moves through shadow. 
BUD At the gas station...When you were arrested, I put a gun to your head. You expected someone else. 
JESSE You don't look like cops. 
BUD And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the fridge, explosives...tells me you're scared. 
Jesse's eyes emerge from the dark. Bud, looking right at him. 
BUD I know who you are. 
JESSE If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in here alone. 
Bud smiles and walks to the door. 
BUD One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this morning. (grins) There is no bond. 
HOLD on Jesse. 
Bud BANGS on the door. Locks UNLATCH. The door opens and Bud steps calmly out to the hall... 
Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back. 
RAY His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like somebody painted 'em. 
Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up. 
JESSE They come at you? 
RAY Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can feel it fuckin' coming. 
Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back. 
The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained face as the bar lands with a CRASH. 
INT. YARD CORRIDOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY, LATER 
A long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate. Ray, behind Jesse. Says low: 
RAY Hey, Jesse... (silence) Sorry I put you back here. I never meant-- 
JESSE (turns) "Sorry", Raymond...? You ain't sorry. (pause) I took you into my home. I tried to clean you up. And you steal from me...? You take my fuckin' diamonds? (dead to rights) 'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my son. 
Ray swallows hard. Nothing he can say. 
INT. METRO OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY 
CLOSE ON numerous files of ARYAN GANG MEMBERS. Arrest sheets, paperwork and photos. 
BUD O.S. Alright, let's work this... (beat) In prison, Wheeler is credited for the expansion of the Brotherhood. When Federal split up members, they had to reorganize. So they tattooed their blood types and serial numbers on one another. 
COBB O.S. Recede and multiply. 
BUD O.S. Exactly... 
REVEAL NOW Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a table, used as a converted eating area. 
BUD Put 'em in prison, they get stronger. Everywhere you send one, they recruit in numbers. Within five years, their numbers were over ten thousand. 
MARANDINO Wheeler directed all that, huh? 
Shepard is flipping through a worn, thick file. 
BUD What do you got there, Shep'? 
SHEPARD Interpol wired us files on three known Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana: Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this man... Lucian Adams. 
He opens the file, revealing mugshots of LUCIAN ADAMS, 51. Dark eyes. Sharp, gun metal features. 
SHEPARD High priest of the Aryan National Party. His "ministry" of Christian Identity and Paramilitary Order has stood for over a decade. Check this out... 
Shepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot) Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound. 
SHEPARD Wheeler was just seventeen when he met Lucian at the Patriotic Congress. 
MARANDINO No shit. 
SHEPARD Today, Lucian's one hell of an entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores. Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks runnin' all across the God damn country. 
Bud's been quiet; says now: 
BUD Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I need an angle. 
COBB For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news would spread like wildfire. The AB's gonna know about it. They'd gonna know about it nationally. (re: his coffee) Pass the sugar. 
Marandino does. 
BUD That's if he was a surface informant. I don't want him to testify. I want to keep him on the street. (to the group) Look, this guy's been in it a long time. He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his hands free. I can feel it. 
MARANDINO Braddock ain't gonna go for this. 
BUD I'll handle that. 
Everyone looks to Bud. 
BUD We got one chance here. 'Cause if this falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more dead than alive. 
INT. CAFETERIA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - EVENING 
A sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see. 
Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit. 
Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly sit across from the Wheeler brothers. 
CZAPP How you doin', Ray? (off Ray's look) We was just over there wonderin' why you ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to your kin. 
RAY I was gonna. 
CZAPP (grins) I'm sure you was. 
Czapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up. 
CZAPP Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you... 
ROACH Fuckin-A, heard a lot. 
CZAPP Name's Czapp... You can call me, "Bossman." (beat) I kept an eye on your brother the past few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray? 
RAY (low) Yeah... 
INT. VISITOR'S GATE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY 
Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, goes through security check. INFANT SON in her arms. 
VISITING AREA 
Wives, girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners. 
TABLE 
Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, holding their son, across from Jesse... 
LYNN Life. You know how fuckin' long that is, Jesse? 
Lynn's hands are shaking. 
LYNN So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run? (upset) Your friends are comin' by the house. Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin' for the God damn phone to ring. 
Jesse is silent. 
LYNN You said we were done with this. That they were out of our lives. 
The baby begins to CRY. 
LYNN We have no money, Jesse. Which means we have no fucking food. ...Say something, would you? 
JESSE It's gonna be okay. 
LYNN I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life... 
The baby WAILING now. 
LYNN (quietly crying) ...For our baby. 
TIGHT ON JESSE, for the first time, appearing powerless. 
As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away from his son, and glances up... 
Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching them... 
BUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare. 
INT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER 
A CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She wipes her eyes, holding the baby. 
The back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled clothes. 
BUD Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter. 
LYNN I know who you are. 
BUD You have a ride home? 
LYNN We took the bus. 
Bud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter. 
BUD Take a cab. 
Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn. 
BUD 'You need anything...anything at all. Be sure to call me. 
They look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an unspoken moment. And Bud walks away... 
Lynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And the card. 
INT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY 
A Guard buzzes Jesse through. 
PRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out. Jesse walks past, enters... 
HIS CELL 
...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk. 
Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray... 
JESSE Ray... 
No response. Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder. 
JESSE Raymond, take a look. 
Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant. 
THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR... 
Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes. Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying... 
TIME CUT: 
EXT. LOADING DOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK 
Pouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance. 
INT. JESSE'S CELL - DUSK 
JESSE You tell him I'll come by. 
CATFISH (no longer smiling) That's good. I'll see you real soon then. 
As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE. 
PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long lens camera, triggers snapshots. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons. 
Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element. 
BUD Hey, Mike. 
BRADDOCK Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch. He's down from Washington. With the Attorney General. 
FITCH Martin. Just call me Martin. 
Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes. 
BRADDOCK Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case for a Federal sponsor. 
BUD How long you been with the Attorney General, Fitch? 
FITCH Just over a year. 
Bud looks at Braddock. 
FITCH I want to assure you my education and experience is more than adequate to handle a case of this potential. 
BUD Is that right... 
Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down. 
BRADDOCK Why don't we get to the particulars? 
FITCH Right. Alright. (clears throat) To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need something substantial. A bait. In the Justice Department, we have this mission statement... We decide who the target is, what's the threat assessment, the cost value, over what time table it's gonna take place... Which target do we go after first. We don't want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target, you understand? 
BUD No. 
FITCH Well, exposing bodies has limitations. Those people are dead. We can't retrieve their lives. 
Bud blinks. 
BRADDOCK He means there might not be enough to back Jesse. 
BUD Keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead. 
FITCH What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads. He'll need to present something that separates him from those we're going to arrest. If Jesse can't offer something continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of much help. 
Bud stares at Fitch. 
A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches. 
WAITRESS Ready to order? 
FITCH (cuts in) Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort on the side. 
WAITRESS You'll take what? 
FITCH (curt) It's a dressing. 
WAITRESS Well...we got ranch, thousand island and oil. Which one you want? 
Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch: 
BUD Lost my appetite. 
And walks out. 
EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY 
Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They say nothing till they reach the car. 
BUD I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds want to help, that's fine. But not him. 
BRADDOCK What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's not your partner, Bud. This case is beyond our capacity. It requires resources we don't have. 
Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof. 
BUD They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They send us some kid with a year under his belt?! He don't even know what state he's in... You want him in charge?! 
BRADDOCK You're God damn right I do! You're out on a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job to make sure you get back! 
BUD This is bullshit. 
BRADDOCK That may be. What it ain't, is open for discussion. 
Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car. 
INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING 
A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth. 
JESSE Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I could tell y'all things. Names. Locations. What boat is movin' what drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get cut up and why. ...But what I got to know is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's right by me and keep my head from gettin' shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is, you need me. You ain't got enough cops with enough sense or enough time, to clear them crimes that already been committed and will be. (pause) Y'all need me... I got the devil's address. 
REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE. 
INT. METRO OFFICE - NIGHT 
An organizational chart, as Bud pins AB mug shots, arrest sheets and surveillance photos wall to wall. 
Bud steps back, observes. His case building. Getting huge. 
MONTAGE OUT/TO: 
EXT. BACK PATIO, LUCIAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Wood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table. 
KIERSEY There's a variety of matters to discuss today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial starts next week. One of the jurors reached out. He's asking six thousand up front plus a job at four hundred a week. That guarantees a hung jury with a push for an acquittal. 
LUCIAN Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the trucking firm. 
KIERSEY (as he writes) Construction on the building Morris brought us, in south-east Florida, is complete. Every unit sold. We should see revenues of one point four million over our original projections. 
Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips. 
KIERSEY Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle East. They put a final offer on the table. They'll fund our operation in Louisiana if we agree to act on their behalf. Political targets mostly, on the basis of our approval... (beat) I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a sample of their resources. 
LUCIAN "Final offer?" Demands... (beat) Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for it. By the time they realize, we'll have our return. (laughs to Jesse) You believe they're travelin' all the way to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LUCIAN'S BACK YARD - LATER 
Jesse and Lucian walk together through green, expansive countryside. A pair of Arabian mares graze nearby. 
LUCIAN I want you runnin' point on this one... 
JESSE I'll be honest, I was hopin' for somethin' bigger. 
LUCIAN What do you got in mind? 
JESSE How 'bout a few of them heads off the list? 
LUCIAN We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz. What do you want to go back to that for? 
JESSE The money's worth twice this. Bring back a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart, it's thirty, right? 
Lucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny. 
LUCIAN Tell you what. Do this other thing we got lined up... (beat) Then I'll give you that taste. 
EXT. HENDERSON INDUSTRIAL ZONE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT 
Dark, factory skyline. Burnt out cars sit before a WAREHOUSE. 
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
HEADQUARTERS for the Baton Rouge operation. A beehive of government activity. TECHNICIANS listen to tapes... PHONES ring off the hook... Bud and Fitch going over the case: 
FITCH There's pressure from Washington. They send compliments for Jesse's work. But our primary concern is that list. I need names we can protect. 
BUD We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it. 
FITCH If Jesse can just get a direct order... from Lucian to him, on a wire-- 
BUD --A wire?! He just went back to work, you want him to wear a fuckin' wire? (beat) Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's phone, that's what you should do. 
FITCH He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get would be inadmissable. 
BUD It's information, Fitch. 
Fitch, annoyed, but staying on track. 
FITCH Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay. He's disconnected from everything, like a ghost. 
Bud, cooling his heels. As the phones RING and RING... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A violent rainfall. 
AERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the deep woods to reveal a TRUCK STOP ahead. 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 
Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade is pulled back, allowing entrance... 
Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LUMBER STORAGE, TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 
The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE. 
Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. 
Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS... 
Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth. 
Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR) reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down... 
...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a moment. 
JESSE (low, deadly) Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave you where I find you. Got that? 
PAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes. 
JESSE Unload the fuckin' truck. 
Jesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join. 
INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
Televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot-out. AGENTS work, uncomfortable, as Bud and Fitch argue. Explosive... 
FITCH Keep your voice down! This was out of my control! 
BUD I'm telling you, your agents best pull their shit together! Who the hell y'all trying to protect?! 
FITCH Look, Carter. This is a joint task force with multiple agendas, that run up the chain of command through me. Intel came forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem Kazuri - an international arms dealer - would be present at this meet. ATF was tasked to observe and report. 
BUD That ain't what they did--! 
FITCH --No! Because your informant-- 
BUD My informant, that's right!-- 
FITCH --Your informant and his psychopath crew greased half our political interests -- over a bag of fake cash! You weren't informed, so what? 
BUD Well I better be informed! 'Cause this ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all got a collaborative agenda in the works? I want to see it. These other agencies, what time-lines they lookin' at? What deadlines and why? 
FITCH Above your pay-grade-- 
BUD (overlapping) And is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies, who are right now charting future mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?! 
FITCH That's not your concern, Carter! 
Braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room... 
BUD We're not talkin' about me!! 
BRADDOCK Bud! 
BUD (spins) What?! 
BRADDOCK You're over-involved here. 
And Bud's taken off stride. Braddock looks Bud right in the eyes, so there's no doubt... 
BRADDOCK I'll handle this. 
Bud, red with anger, walks out. 
Braddock watches him go. Fitch comes over, relieved... 
FITCH Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been berating my agents for the last hour. 
Braddock pours a cup of coffee. 
FITCH We're trying to band-aid a situation here, and frankly, Carter's preference for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all be in my report... 
BRADDOCK (interrupts) "Isn't helping?" 
A big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in... 
BRADDOCK "Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what happened here, Fitch. We work for the same cause doesn't mean we work for you. What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter delivered the biggest informant in the history of this state to your lap, and you and the people you work for are gonna let it go to shit. (beat) You can expect that will be in my report.

INT. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN 
STEELWORKERS warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs. The seven story furnace is deafening. 
ENTRY AREA 
Lucian is met by Kiersey. They walk together through glassed in hallways to a closed office door. 
Lucian keys in, REVEALING a disheveled Morris seated in a chair with two large AB Soldiers on either side. 
INT. STEEL MILL OFFICE - PRE DAWN 
Lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris. 
MORRIS Look. I had no previous knowledge of any business with Muslims. So if stealing me here in the middle of the night, is some kind of accusation-- 
LUCIAN I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I do find it interesting that right about the time I employ you, my operation starts having problems. 
MORRIS Yes, but-- 
LUCIAN That is interesting...isn't it? 
Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely. 
LUCIAN I want to know if this was an isolated incident. If the ATF impeding on my work is the result of a deeper threat. 
MORRIS What are you suggesting? 
LUCIAN I'm suggesting you contact your friends in Washington. 
MORRIS With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's not what I was retained for. 
LUCIAN Well now it is. 
Lucian puts on his reading glasses, opens a dossier. 
LUCIAN Three months... 
Lucian peruses surveillance photos: Images of AB activity goes by in a blur. Lucian's eyes absorbing, rigid, unerring. 
KIERSEY (reading) This is U.S. Attorney John Nokes, at the helm. He's been after us for years. 
LUCIAN Who they got for a mouthpiece? 
MORRIS A "mouthpiece"? 
LUCIAN Who's the rat in the woodpile? Who the fuck's giving 'em information? 
MORRIS I couldn't dig that deep. But it's someone close. (pause) I suggest you gentlemen disband. Immediately. 
Kiersey, foraging through reports. Page after page. Each minutely detailed. 
KIERSEY Lucian... 
LUCIAN Yeah. 
KIERSEY The investigation's local point is a detective out of East Baton Rouge. (beat) His name's Bud Carter.

JESSE'S POV: as the door opens slow, HE/WE SEE ON THE PORCH: 
LUCIAN 
seated comfortably in a chair... 
LUCIAN Couldn't sleep. 
Jesse looks to the darkness. Dogwood trees. Thick growth. EERIE SILENCE... 
JESSE Got somethin' on your mind? 
LUCIAN (without looking at him) There's been an adjustment to the list, Jesse... 
Jesse's silent. YOU CAN CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE... 
LUCIAN We got this...heathen. A whore of an Irishman...down in Baton Rouge. He's protected. Got a lot of guys around him. That's why it pays. That's why nobody wants the job... That's why we're here talkin'. 
JESSE Who is it? 
Lucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address written on back. 
Jesse flips over the photo: It's Bud, in uniform. 
LUCIAN This cop... he's got a mouthpiece... somewhere. Ain't yet figured out who. In the meantime, shut him down. 
ON JESSE, a frozen moment. He forces out the words: 
JESSE It's done. 
With that, Lucian gets up and leaves, disappearing into darkness.

And Jesse sits there, several moments...WAITS...BREATHES... Then he exits the truck...

A VAN arrives, stops. No headlights, two hundred yards from the house. INSIDE THE VAN: Catfish and Buzz. Several AB SOLDIERS in back, armed to the teeth. 
BUZZ That's his truck. 
CATFISH (nods) Let's see what he does. 
The motor ticks and ticks and... 
...THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN AS AB SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE FROM SUB MACHINE GUNS. 
Jesse drops behind a neighbor's sedan. 
Bud dives behind the Chevy. ROUNDS SLAM through sheet metal, interior, and out the other end. 
AB Soldiers exit the van, spread and keep FIRING. Jesse's sedan takes hits. WINDOWS AND TIRES EXPLODE. 
Bud and Jesse aim over their roofs. Take and RETURN FIRE. 
Catfish emerges, kneels and pumps SHOTS into Bud's Chevy.

AB #4 and #5 move in for the kill, when out of nowhere -- SHEPARD'S CAR SPEEDS ON SCENE -- His door kicks out; SHEPARD PUMPS SHOTS, EXCHANGING. 
Buzz comes up from behind, aims -- BULLETS FLASH AND PUNCH THROUGH SHEPARD. 
INSIDE THE HOUSE 
Bud swings the M-16 through the glass and BLASTS AWAY, killing AB #4, as Jesse staggers toward the house, holding his wrist...

CUT TO: 
EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME 
Catfish, Buzz and AB Soldiers flank the house. 
INT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME 
On the floor, Jesse rips out his belt, a tourniquet around the armpit. He holds it with his teeth and ties his arm. 
Bud reloads and slides Jesse a .357 Python. Jesse takes it up with his good hand. 
Suddenly in the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES DISCHARGE. THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS EXPLODE. Bud ducks, scrambles, as rounds splinter the wall. 
A BACK KITCHEN DOOR is bashed open and AB #5 steps in, BLAZING SHOTS. 
Bud lets fly -- FIRING. Big bore rounds punch through AB #5. His insides hit the wall. 
WE NOW HEAR DISTANT POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING...

Bud runs out to the street, M-16 FIRING at the fleeing van. 
Bullets shatter the back window as the van speeds around the corner through garbage cans and a residential fence... 
at the gravesite, with Braddock, Cobb and Marandino. A salute is FIRED with rifles. 
LATER 
Bud stands alone. Dry-eyed, vacant stare. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE STREETS - DAY 
Flashbulbs burst rapid-fire as coroner crews and police secure a crime scene: Richard Morris sits dead at the wheel of his car, a plastic bag over his head filled with blood. 
IN THE FOREGROUND, lit by police lights, is Bud and Cobb. 
COBB ...His cranium was smashed with a lead pipe. Then the plastic bag. He choked to death while it filled up with blood. 
BUD Got I.D.? 
COBB 'Name's Richard Morris. He's a top dog lawyer-lobbyist out of Washington. 
Cobb proffers Morris' wallet. Bud sifts through cards -- Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one: 
"Daniel J. Kiersey, Attorney at Law" 
BUD Put a tap on that line. 
COBB Braddock ain't gonna like it. 
BUD Do it. 
Braddock arrives on scene. Disturbed expression: 
BRADDOCK Bud. I just got off with Nokes. 
BUD And? 
BRADDOCK We got a problem.

LABORER #1 steps INTO FRAME with a STOP SIGN. 
LABORER #1 (approaches Tom's window) Wait here a moment, sir. 
A crane moves past, hoisting steel. Tom IDLES the engine. Then:

Tom drives onward, glancing in the REARVIEW: at Laborer #1 watching them pull away, receding in the distance... 
INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON 
JESSE Get me out of here, Bud. I want to see my family. 
Bud, the pit in his stomach widening, struggles to say: 
BUD There is no family. 
FBI #4 Check the bathroom. 
FBI #5 opens the bathroom door. Empty. Both Agents hurry to the window, SEE OUTSIDE: A large TREE six feet out from the ledge and a broken branch at street level. A seemingly impossible escape route. 
FBI #4 (CONT'D) Sonofabitch. This guy's crazy. 
INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - MORNING 
A badly hung-over Bud sits with Braddock, Fitch and numerous agents around a conference table. 
NOKES 
walks the room, says to all: 
NOKES This is an atrocity, gentlemen. Incompetence at it's highest level. I gave you my name. My resources. My trust...Carte blanche. And now this handsome face of mine...can't step foot in Washington, for fear of being laughed off the Hill. 
Nokes circles behind Bud... 
NOKES Now, I'd love to point to Local on this. But truth is, they've carried their weight. We are federally fucked... (looks right at Fitch) Because Federal fucked up. 
Fitch wipes sweat, swallows hard. 
NOKES So. Best idea wins, gentlemen. Chain of command? Point of procedure? I don't give a fuck. That's out the window, just like our informant... (beat) I want Jesse Wheeler found.

INT. STORAGE GARAGE - DAY 
A metal door rises up. Jesse, in silhouette, steps in. 
A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement. 
Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS. 
Jesse hefts his choices. Checking line and breach: A 12 Gauge Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with pistol grip. Les Baer Tactical .45. Glock Semi-auto 9MM. Buck Knife. Duct tape. 5-Gallon gas cans. He loads up a gym bag. 
Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers, shaves his scalp and mustache. 
Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler. Pops the trunk. Throws in the gym bag. Then drives away.

A lone, dilapidated HOUSE BOAT sits heavily in the bayou. Lights on inside. Dense FOG overlays. 
INT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT 
Long-Hair on the couch, watching tv, drinking liquor. SPEED METAL MUSIC blasts from a stereo somewhere. 
There's a METALLIC BANG O.S. 
Long-Hair looks up. 
The screen door rattles. Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat, slowly approaching... 
LONG-HAIR Who's there? 
Sudden surprise as the screen SNAPS OFF and a SILHOUETTE breaks the glass, opens it. 
LONG-HAIR What the fuck?! 
Long-Hair RUSHES for the door as THE BUTT OF A 12-GAUGE SLAMS DOWN LIKE A TOMAHAWK. 
Long-Hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream. 
Jesse steps in, racking the gauge with one hand, takes aim on the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor.

The front lights go out. A terrible darkness. 
INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT 
A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in. Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck. 
They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward, reaches the doorway, creeps through... 
INT. BEDROOM 
The door swings wide on the room, REVEALING: Buzz, on the bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired HOOKER, over a bureau. 
As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse. Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once. 
The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking. Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't. 
The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner. 
Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence. 
BUD That'll never happen. 
FITCH Why the hell not?! 
BUD (turns) 'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He has nothing. Why do you think he lit that fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want it. He would've just left 'em for dead. 
FITCH For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not taking the fall for this! The plan is-- 
BUD No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got balls big enough to relate to this guy. If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in this situation. And you wouldn't be askin' stupid fuckin' questions! (walking away) I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your agents off my ass. 
Bud storms off.

FADE IN:

An expensively dressed Kiersey emerges from a courtroom, flanked by a pair of well dressed AIDES. 
KIERSEY Get back to the office. Follow up on the Arthur Bierce case. I need names and numbers on my desk by three pm. 
The Aides scurry down another corridor, as Kiersey exits the building through the glass front doors... 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MORNING 
Kiersey moves to a parked Cadillac pops the trunk and sets his briefcase inside, when... 
A RUSHING POV FROM BEHIND: Slams the trunk on Kiersey's hands. 
Kiersey SCREAMS, drops to his knees. His wrists wedged in the trunk. And standing over him...is Bud. 
KIERSEY OH, CHRIST! JESUS CHRIST! MY HANDS! 
BUD You know who I am? 
KIERSEY OPEN THE TRUNK! PLEASE! OPEN THE TRUNK! 
Bud kicks him in the stomach, doubles him over. 
BUD You know who the fuck I am?! 
KIERSEY YES! 
BUD Who's Richard Morris?! Why was he killed? 
No answer. Bud pounds on the trunk. Kiersey CRIES OUT. 
BUD I'll break every fuckin' bone you got. Start talkin'. 
KIERSEY (hyperventilating) I can't-- I can't-- 
Bud slams both fists on the trunk. All his weight. 
BUD (off Kiersey's SCREAM) Can't what?! What can't you do?! 
Bud, enraged, kicks Kiersey's ribs in. Again. 
BUD You piece of shit, talk! 
KIERSEY (hysterical) He made Jesse...The investigation... Everything... 
BUD His family? 
KIERSEY Everything! After that, he was just a loose end! 
Bud opens the trunk. Kiersey crumbles to the ground, shaking. 
BUD Where's Lucian Adams? 
KIERSEY I don't know! 
Bud jams a foot in Kiersey's neck. Grabs his hands and bends. We HEAR bones snap. 
BUD Lucian's goin' down. You either go down together, or you give him to me. 
KIERSEY (a mile a minute) I never talk to him directly! I swear, they page me-- 
Bud roughly searches Kiersey. 
KIERSEY --Every night at five, for a six o'clock call! They page from different numbers! 
Bud finds a PAGER on Kiersey's slacks, yanks it off. Then leans down with a smile, venomous: 
BUD You're a dead man, Kiersey. 
A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling. 
Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up, drawing fluid... 
...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip of the needle, pops a cc. 
Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE. 
JESSE Where's Lucian? 
Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in. 
JESSE Where's Lucian? 
CATFISH (barely audible) New Orleans... 
JESSE New Orleans. Where in New Orleans? 
CATFISH New Orleans... 
Jesse looks Catfish dead in the eyes. And death is there... Begging. 
JESSE (softly) I believe you. 
With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly. 
Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose.

EXT. TIBEDAUX'S - SAME 
Cobb runs out of the cafe, pushing through civilians. 
COBB Down! Get down! 
Bud pursues Lucian... 
BUD Stay on the door! I'm goin' in! 
INT. TIBEDAUX'S 
Bud enters- 
Split-second and DOORMAN #2 OPENS FIRE from the waiter's entrance. 
Bud drops and FIRES BACK. Doorman #2 goes down. Bud runs across overturned tables and up a STAIRWELL... 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS, TIBEDAUX'S 
Jesse emerges. AB #9 steps out, FIRES. The bullet hits Jesse's vest, knocking him backwards. 
Jesse levels the sawed-off. FIRES. AB #9 falls in a heap. Jesse rises, keeps moving... 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS, ROOMS - TIBEDAUX'S 
MOVING WITH BUD entering, KICKING down doors, sweeping rooms with his shotgun... No sign of Lucian. 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS, BACK ROOMS 
Jesse is coming... 
...and the SLAUGHTER BUILDS. 
He throws open a door to a BAR AREA. 
AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles. 
A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar. 
HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic wildly. Bottles and glasses explode. 
Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER. 
BEHIND THE BAR 
bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the .45. Above him, strays catch lights, glass filaments EXPLODE. 
INT. UPSTAIRS, HALLWAYS + ROOMS 
Bud KICKS down a door. AB #12 charges out. Grabs for Bud... who breaks the grab, pulls AB #12's neck down, slams his knee into his forehead twice, knocked cold. Grabs his gun. 
A HALLWAY DOOR SWINGS OPEN 
AB #13 emerges, HAMMERING GUNSHOTS. Bud covers. SHOTS BLOW HOLES in the wall.

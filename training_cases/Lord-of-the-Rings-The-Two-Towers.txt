[TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS] 
[Camera pans over the Misty Mountains as voices drift in from the background.] 
GANDALF You cannot pass! 
FRODO Gandalf! 
GANDALF I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor! 
[Camera pans closer to the mountain side.] 
GANDALF Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.] YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!! 
[Gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others. At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around Gandalfs ankle, dragging him over the edge. He clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip.] 
GANDALF Argh! 
[Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains him.] 
BOROMIR No! No! 
FRODO Gandalf! 
GANDALF Fly, you fools! 
[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm] 
FRODO Noooooooooooooooo!!!! 
[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm] 
FRODO [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!! 
[Gandalf falls after the Balrog and grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on his way down. As they continue to plunge into the depths, Gandalf hacks away at the Balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. They continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with Gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. The battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. Just then Frodo awakens as if from a nightmare.] 
FRODO Gandalf! 
SAM What is it, Mr. Frodo? 
FRODO Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.] 
[Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the distance at the Mountain of Fire.] 
SAM Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we dont want to see any closer, and the one place were trying to get to. Its just where we cant get. Lets face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont think Gandalf meant for us to come this way. 
ÉOTHAIN Yes, Ma! 
FREDA [starts to cry] I dont wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama! 
MORWEN Freda, I will find you there. 
[A woman screams] 
MORWEN Quickly! 
[The children ride off.] 
MORWEN [Looks after them] Go child! 
[Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village, burning everything in sights as the Rohirrim scream and run in all directions. Éothain and Freda weep as they look back from a distance.] 
SARUMAN (V.O.) Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall. 
[A group of horsemen ride to Edoras. Éomer is in the lead, carrying a gravely wounded Théodred.] 
[Éowyn runs hastily up the stairs to the Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber. She runs to the bed.] 
ÉOWYN Théodred! 
[Théodred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. He has a bloody gash on the side of his head. Éomer nods to Éowyn in the direction of Théodreds torso. Éowyn draws back the covers and upon seeing Théodreds fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. She looks up to catch Éomers eye.] 
[Éomer and Éowyn are speaking to Théoden-king who sits motionless on his throne, wizened, and aged beyond his years.] 
ÉOWYN Your son is badly wounded, my lord. 
ÉOMER He was ambushed by Orcs. If we dont defend our country, Saruman will take it by force. 
GRÍMA That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.] Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally. 
THÉODEN [mumbles feebly] Gríma Gríma [Gríma leans down close to the King.]My son...? Gríma...? 
ÉOMER Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.] 
GRÍMA Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering. 
ÉOMER War-mongering? 
[Éomer grabs Gríma and pins him against a pillar.] 
ÉOMER How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Gríma? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure? 
[Grímas eyes flicks to right, watching Éowyn as she walks by. Éowyn stops to stare back for a moment before departing form the hall. Éomer jerks Gríma again and clutches his hand around Grímas jaw.] 
ÉOMER Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps. 
[Gríma's eyes look to the left and relax as Éomer is suddenly pulled off Gríma by his thugs.] 
GRÍMA You see much Éomer, Son of Éomund. Too much. [The thugs punch Éomer n the stomach] You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death! 
ÉOMER [Being dragged away] Argh!! 
[Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli hot on their pursuits.] 
GRISHNÁKH [Brandishing a blade in front of Pippins face] Go on, call for help. Squeal! No ones gonna save you now! 
[Suddenly, a spear pierces the Orc's back. Mayhem ensues as Riders of Rohan burst out from their hiding places and ambush the Orcs.] 
MERRY Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their escape.] 
[The hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies and stomping feet. Suddenly Pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him.] 
PIPPIN ARGH!!! 
[The Three Hunters are still chasing after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.] 
LEGOLAS [Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night. 
[Camera pans over the rock and plains, alternating between the band of Uruk-hai and the Three Hunters giving chase. The trackers hear the sound of horses. Aragorn and company hide behind some boulders. A large group of horse-men appears, galloping quickly with their banners flying. Aragorn comes out of hiding as they pass, followed by Legolas and Gimli.] 
ARAGORN Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark? 
[At a signal from Éomer at the lead, the riders make a quick turn and head towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening circles. As they stop, they point their long spears menacingly at them.] 
ÉOMER What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly! 
GIMLI Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine. 
[Éomer hands his staff to another rider, and gets off his horse. Aragorn puts a hand on Gimlis shoulder.] 
ÉOMER I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground. 
[Legolas, in a lightning fast move, points an arrow at Éomer.] 
LEGOLAS You would die before your stroke fell! 
[The riders all point their spears closer at the travellers. After a tense moment, Aragorn pushes down Legolas arm.] 
ARAGORN I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king. 
ÉOMER Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even his own kin. 
[The spears are withdrawn.] 
ÉOMER Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets. 
ARAGORN We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. Theyve taken two of our friends captive. 
ÉOMER The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night. 
GIMLI But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them? 
ARAGORN They would be small  only children to your eyes. 
ÉOMER We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. [Points to a smoking pile in the distance.] 
GIMLI Dead? 
ÉOMER [nods] I am sorry. 
[Legolas puts a hand on Gimlis shoulder in grief. Éomer turns and whistles.] 
PIPPIN Merry! 
[Pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree hes clinging to. The tree starts to move and groan.] 
TREEBEARD Hooooo... 
PIPPIN Argh!! 
[Pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls. The tree catches him before he hits the ground.] 
GRISHNÁKH Lets put a maggot-hole in your belly. [Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.] 
PIPPIN Run, Merry! 
[Merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree.] 
TREEBEARD [Looks at the creatures in his hands] Little Orcs! Burárum... 
PIPPIN Its talking, Merry. The tree is talking! 
TREEBEARD Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps slowly through the forest.] 
MERRY A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest. 
PIPPIN Dont talk to it, Merry. Dont encourage it. 
TREEBEARD Treebeard, some call me. 
PIPPIN And whose side are you on? 
TREEBEARD Side? I am on nobodys side because nobodys on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore. 
MERRY Were not Orcs. Were Hobbits! 
TREEBEARD Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them! 
MERRY No, you dont understand. Were Hobbits... Halflings! Shirefolk! 
TREEBEARD Maybe you are and maybe you arent. The White Wizard will know. 
PIPPIN The White Wizard? 
MERRY Saruman. 
[Treebeard drops them on the ground and the hobbits look up at the White Wizard.] 
[Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor is now closer.] 
GOLLUM See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you. 
[Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walks past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.] 
GOLLUM Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting a wide berth between him and Sam.] 
[Sams foot slipped into muck.] 
SAM Whoa, its a bog! Hes led us into a swamp! 
GOLLUM My name... My name... S... S...Sméagol 
[Suddenly, the piercing cries of the Nazgûl are heard overhead] 
GOLLUM Argh!! 
SAM Black Riders! 
GOLLUM Hide! Hide! 
FRODO Argh! 
[Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the Nazgûl's sword piercing him and the call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths come to him in flashes.] 
FRODO Argh!! 
SAM Cmon Frodo! C'mon! 
[Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes. The Nazgûl appears, tightening his hold on the reins. Camera then shows him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down across the marsh lands. Chilling screams of the Nazgûl fill the air.] 
GOLLUM Quick! They will see us! They will see us! 
SAM I thought they were dead! 
GOLLUM Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No. 
[A loud screech from the Nazgûl flying high above the marshes.] 
GOLLUM [cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss. 
[Frodo feels the call of the Ring and gropes for his necklace. Sam sees this and grabs hold of Frodos hand.] 
SAM Mr. Frodo! Its alright. Im here. 
[The Nazgûl continues to circle overhead and then flies off towards Mordor.] 
GOLLUM Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very close. 
[Scene returns to Fangorn forest. Gimli fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings it to his mouth.] 
GIMLI [Spits] Ptui! Orc blood. 
ARAGORN These are strange tracks. 
GIMLI The air is so close in here. 
LEGOLAS This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... and anger. 
[Groans reverberate through the forest and Gimli raises his axe.] 
LEGOLAS The trees are speaking to each other. 
ARAGORN [Whispers] Gimli! 
GIMLI Huh? 
ARAGORN [Gestures] Lower your axe. 
LEGOLAS That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. 
[The horse comes round to stop in front of Gandalf.] 
GANDALF Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers. 
[The Three Hunters and Gandalf ride across the plains to Edoras.] 
[Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walking through the forest with Merry and Pippin sitting on his shoulders.] 
TREEBEARD My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where Ill keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them. 
[Frodo and Sam are climbing a high rock overlooking Morannon.] 
GOLLUM The Black Gate of Mordor. 
[The enormous Black Gate comes into view with Orcs patrolling and standing guard on the towers and atop the walls. From the right, an army of Easterling soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.] 
SAM Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. 
GOLLUM Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Sméagol does. Master says so. 
FRODO I did. 
[Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.] 
SAM Thats it then. We cannot get past that. 
[A command is heard and an Orc sounds a horn, signalling for the Gate to be opened. Two enormous cave trolls stretch and growl and then pull the mighty Gate open.] 
SAM Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down. 
[He moves closer to the edge. Suddenly, the rock underneath him gives way and he falls.] 
FRODO Sam, no! 
SAM Argh!! 
[Frodo goes after Sam.] 
GOLLUM Master! 
[Two Easterling soldiers see streams of dust coming down the cliff made by Sam and Frodo. They move away from the troop to investigate. Frodo reaches Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the Easterlings move closer and closer, Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself and Sam. The soldiers are now directly in front of Sam, but their eyes see nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer from underneath the cloak. The soldiers soon leave and after a moment, Frodo throws back the cloak and pulls Sam out.] 
FRODO I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. 
SAM I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there. 
[They prepare to make a run for the Gate.] 
FRODO Now! 
[Gollum pulls them back.] 
GOLLUM No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Dont take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always hes looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustnt let him have it. 
[Frodo tries to make a run for it.] 
GRÍMA So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill. 
[Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other intently.] 
ÉOWYN Your words are poison! 
[Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him. Edoras is silent and somber. Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps. He looks around at more somber people.] 
GIMLI Youll find more cheer in a graveyard. 
[Aragorn looks up to the hall again but the lady has disappeared. The company climbs up the stairs to the hall and is met by guards.] 
GANDALF [sees Háma] Ah. 
HÁMA I cannot allow you before Théoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Gríma Wormtongue. 
[Gandalf nods in understanding and signals for the others to surrender their weapons. Aragon hands over his sword and knives. Legolas gives a little twirl to his knives before handing them over to the guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.] 
HÁMA [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff. 
GANDALF Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.] 
[Háma hesitates for a second and then gestures that they follow him into the hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas arm.] 
GRÍMA [Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. Hes a herald of woe. 
GANDALF The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King. 
[As Gandalf approaches Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey the hall and its hostile occupants. A group of men starts to follow their steps with hostility.] 
GRÍMA [Whispering to Théoden.] Hes not welcome. 
THÉODEN Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? [Looks to Gríma for affirmation.] 
GRÍMA A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest. 
GANDALF Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Gríma.] 
GRÍMA His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizards staff! 
[The hostile guards attack. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight as Gandalf continues to approach Théoden. Gamling tries to go forward but Háma holds him back.] 
GANDALF Théoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows. 
[Gríma tries to crawl away unnoticed, but Gimli catches him and pins him to the floor.] 
GIMLI [Growls] I would stay still, if I were you. 
GANDALF Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand] 
THÉODEN [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey! 
[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak, exuding blinding white light. Théoden is thrown back against his seat.] 
THÉODEN Argh! 
GANDALF [Points his staff towards Théoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. 
THÉODEN No parent should have to bury their child. 
[Théoden starts to weep] 
GANDALF He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. (Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.) 
[Gandalf turns to go back to the hall and leaves Théoden to grieve in private. He spots two children on horseback. The boy collapses and falls off the horse. Later, inside the Golden Hall, the two children are eating at a table, and Éowyn is with them.] 
ÉOWYN They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree. 
FREDA Wheres mama? 
ÉOWYN Shh... 
GANDALF This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Théodens chair. Théoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight. 
ARAGORN You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. Éomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king. 
THÉODEN They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. Éomer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war. 
[Gimli takes a bite of his bread as he watches the exchange between Aragorn and Théoden.] 
ARAGORN Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not. 
THÉODEN When last I looked, Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan. 
[Gimli takes a drink and burps.] 
GANDALF Then what is the kings decision? 
[Scene shifts to outside Meduseld] 
HÁMA By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helms Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need. 
[People are moving about, gathering their belongings and preparing to move. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli walk towards the stables.] 
GIMLI Helms Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king. 
ARAGORN Hes only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helms Deep has saved them in the past. 
[They enter the stables] 
GANDALF There is no way out of that ravine. Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks hes leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Théoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold. 
ARAGORN They will hold. 
GANDALF [Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim... thats what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men Ive walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East. 
ARAGORN [Opens the stall gates] Go. 
[Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides out of the stable and over the plains of Rohan.] 
[Éowyn opens a chest in which lies a sword. She unsheathes it and begins to practice. She swings around and is met by Aragorn, who blocks her parry.] 
ARAGORN You have some skill with a blade. 
[With a swift move, Éowyn swings her sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable, gaining the upper hand.] 
SMÉAGOL No! Not Master. 
GOLLUM Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie. 
SMÉAGOL Masters my friend. 
GOLLUM [Tauntingly] You dont have any friends. Nobody likes YOU... 
SMÉAGOL [Covers his ears] Not listening. Im not listening. 
GOLLUM Youre a liar and a thief. 
SMÉAGOL [Shaking his head] Nope. 
GOLLUM Murderer! 
SMÉAGOL [Starts to weep and whimper] Go away. 
GOLLUM Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!! 
SMÉAGOL [Weeping and in a small voice] I hate you. I hate you! 
GOLLUM [Fiercely] Where would you be without me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me! 
SMÉAGOL [Resolute] Not anymore. 
GOLLUM [Startled] What did you say? 
SMÉAGOL Master looks after us now. We dont need you. 
GOLLUM What? 
SMÉAGOL Leave now and never come back. 
GOLLUM No!! 
SMÉAGOL [Louder] Leave now and never come back! 
GOLLUM [Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!! 
SMÉAGOL LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK! 
[Sméagol pants and then looks around.] 
SMÉAGOL We... we told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss. [He hops around in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, gone, gone! Sméagol is free! 
[The next day, while the hobbits were resting, Sméagol comes back with two rabbits and drops them onto Frodos lap.] 
SMÉAGOL Look! Look! See what Sméagol finds! Hehehe! Hahaha! 
[Frodo looks at up him with bloodshot eyes. He smiles at Sméagol and looks at Sam. Sméagol raises a fist in self-congratulation and dances around. He then picks up one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's back in front of Frodo.] 
SMÉAGOL They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat them! 
[He bites and tears into the raw meat. Sam rushes over and snatches the rabbit out of Gollums hands] 
SAM Youll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] Theres only one way to eat a brace of coneys. 
FARAMIR Bind their hands. 
[Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are heading towards Helms Deep. Gimli is on a horse, chatting with Éowyn who is leading it by the reins.] 
GIMLI Its true you dont see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that theyre often mistaken for Dwarf men. 
[Éowyn smiles and looks back at Aragorn.] 
ARAGORN [Gestures and whispers] Its the beards.... 
GIMLI And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground! 
ÉOWYN [Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!! 
GIMLI Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous Whoa!! 
[The horse suddenly rears up and gallops away as Éowyn loses her hold on the reins. Gimli falls off after a short distance and lands with a loud thump.] 
ÉOWYN Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli] 
GIMLI [Struggling to get up] Its alright, its alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate. 
[Éowyn helps Gimli up. She laughs as she brushes him off and looks back at Aragorn with the sun behind her and the wind in her hair. At that particular moment, Aragorn seems enchanted by Éowyns light-hearted image. That night. Aragorn could not sleep and smokes his pipe as he thinks of Arwen.] 
ARWEN (V.O.) The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane It is mine to give to whom I will... Like my heart Go to sleep... 
[FLASHBACK Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell. He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before him, smiling down at him.] 
ARAGORN I am asleep. This is a dream. 
ARWEN [Bends down to kiss him] Then it is a good dream. Sleep 
[She kisses him lightly on the lips and then steps away to look out upon Rivendell. Aragorn closes his eyes but for a while. He looks over at Arwen.] 
ARAGORN Min lû pennich nin i aur hen telitha. (You told me once that this day would come.) 
ARWEN [Turns to look at Aragorn] Ú i vethed... nâ i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han bâd lîn. (This is not the end... it is the beginning. You must go with Frodo. That is your path.) 
ARAGORN [Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i vâd o nin. (My path is hidden from me.) 
ARWEN Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn. Si boe ú-dhannathach. (It is already laid before your feet. You cannot falter now.) 
ARAGORN Arwen 
[Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers on his lips. As her hands moves down to rest on the Evenstar pendant around Aragorns neck, he clasps her hand in his and they gaze into each others eyes.] 
ARWEN Ae ú-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio ammen. (If you trust nothing else... trust this. Trust us.) 
[They kiss.] 
[The next day, on the journey to Helms Deep. Éowyn is walking alongside Aragorn.] 
ÉOWYN Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel. 
[ARAGORN SMILES AND SAYS NOTHING. FLASHBACK Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell, before he sets out with the Fellowship.] 
ELROND Our time here is ending. Arwens time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be evergreen. 
THÉODEN [To Éowyn] You must lead the people to Helms Deep. And make haste! 
ÉOWYN I can fight! 
THÉODEN No! You must do this... for me. 
[Éowyn holds Théodens gaze for a moment and then turn to attend to the villagers.] 
THÉODEN [To his men] Follow me! Yah! 
GIMLI [Tries to get Arod to move] Forward. I mean, charge forward! March forward! [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather unsteadily.] Thats it! Go on! 
ÉOWYN [To the villagers] Make for the lower ground! Stick together! 
[She looks back at the Rohirrim and sees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold each others gaze for a moment before Aragorn turns to join Théoden. Éowyn departs with the villagers in the opposite direction.] 
[Legolas takes aim at the distant target and fells a warg rider. He draws another arrow and kills another. Just as he reaches for a third arrow, he sees Théoden and company approaching. He quickly runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap and joins in the fray with Gimli behind him on horseback.] 
WARG-RIDERS Argh!! 
THÉODEN CHARGE!! 
[The Rohirrim and warg riders crash head on and the battle begins. Théoden and company hack away at the warg riders. In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling at him.] 
GIMLI Bring your pretty face to my axe! 
[Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas kills it with one shot.] 
GIMLI [Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged] Argh! That one counts as mine! 
[As Gimli swings his axe at another warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli, pinning him under.] 
GIMLI Argh! Stinking creature. Argh! 
[As he tries to lift the warg off him, an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills him quickly, twisting his neck, and it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at the Orc and makes a face. He tries to lift both the warg and Orc off him. Just then, another warg comes upon him and bares its teeth, ready to strike. 
GIMLI [Eyes widening] Ooh..! 
[Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes on horseback and throws it at the warg. It dies, landing on Gimli and adding to the pile on top of him.] 
GIMLI [As the warg lands on him] Oooh!! 
[Théoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn is knocked off Hasufel and attacked by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while the latter is half-dragged by the warg. In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off and he rips the Evenstar pendant from Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn tries to let go of the warg but finds his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle himself and is dragged closer and closer to the edge of a cliff at great speed. The warg runs right off the cliff and they both disappear over the edge. The battle is winding down as the Rohirrim finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.] 
LEGOLAS [Looking around] Aragorn! 
GIMLI Aragorn? 
[They come near to the cliff and hear Sharku wheezing and laughing] 
GIMLI [Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing. 
SHARKU Hes [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took a little tumble off the cliff. 
LEGOLAS [Looks towards the edge of the cliff, and grabs Sharku] You lie! 
[Sharku chortles and dies. Legolas looks down at Sharkus fist and finds the Evenstar pendant. He takes it, runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down to see the great drop and rushing waters below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli comes to stand beside him.] 
[As he steps closer to the vessel, Saruman takes hold of Grímas hand and pushes the candle away from the vessel firmly.] 
SARUMAN If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall. 
[He walks away towards the balcony.] 
GRÍMA [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep. 
SARUMAN Tens of thousands. 
GRÍMA But, my lord, there is no such force. 
[Both of them came onto the balcony of the tower. Gríma suddenly sees and hears the enormous armies laid out below in neat rows and is astounded and awed. He continues to hold the extinguished candle aloft as he gapes at the vast army below. A horn is sounded, announcing the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer is heard from the army. Saruman raises a hand.] 
SARUMAN A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand! 
[The army cheers and roars.] 
SARUMAN This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive! 
[The camera keeps zooming out from the balcony over the incredible size of Sarumans army, past Uruk-hai, spears, and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. The camera focuses back on Saruman who then raises his hands in the air] 
SARUMAN To war!! 
[The army cheers and roars even louder.] 
SARUMAN [Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men. 
[A tear flows down Grímas cheek. The Uruk-hai army began their march to Helms Deep.] 
[Merry and Pippin are travelling through the forest, carried by Treebeard.] 
PIPPIN Look! Theres smoke to the south! 
TREEBEARD There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days. 
MERRY Isengard? 
[The two hobbits climb higher up onto Treebeard for a better view.] 
TREEBEARD There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things. 
[Pippin and Merry are now on top of Treebeard and they see a massive army moving across the land] 
PIPPIN What is it? 
MERRY Its Sarumans army! The war has started. 
[Aragorn is floating in the river, unconscious. He is washed ashore and dreams of Arwen.] 
ARWEN [Kissing him on the lips] May the grace of the Valar protect you. 
[A horse arrives and nudges Aragorn, turning him over and nuzzling him.] 
ARAGORN [Mumbles] Brego [He grabs hold of Bregos mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to Helms Deep.] 
[Arwen is lying on her bed, deep in thought.] 
MADRIL Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Théodens people have fled to Helms Deep. [Points at the map] But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate. 
FARAMIR How many? 
MADRIL Some thousands. More come every day. 
FARAMIR Whos covering the river to the north? 
MADRIL We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we wont hold it. 
FARAMIR [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. 
[The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds taken off them by Damrod and another ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod sitting behind them on a rock constantly watching them. Faramir comes up to them and sits.]. 
FARAMIR My men tell me that you are Orc spies. 
SAM Spies?! Now wait just a minute! 
FARAMIR Well if youre not spies, then who are you? 
[Frodo and Sam remain silent.] 
FARAMIR Speak. 
FRODO We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee. 
FARAMIR Your bodyguard? 
SAM His gardener. 
FARAMIR And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look. 
FRODO [The merest hesitation.] There was no other. 
[Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.] 
FRODO We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Mória. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor. 
FARAMIR [Intently] Youre a friend of Boromir? 
FRODO Yes... for my part. 
FARAMIR It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead. 
FRODO [Shocked] Dead? How? When? 
FARAMIR As one of his companions, Id hoped you would tell me. [Pause] He was my brother. 
[Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought. Suddenly someone comes up to him.] 
GONDORIAN RANGER Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found the third one. 
[Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens as Faramir stands before him.] 
FARAMIR You must come with me. Now. 
[Frodo gets up and follow. They come to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking the Forbidden Pool.] 
GOLLUM [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] Myyy PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!! 
[Back in their holding area, Sam and Frodo are alone.] 
SAM We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear. 
FRODO I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell find me. Hell see. 
SAM Mr. Frodo... 
[They both stand as Faramir enters.] 
FARAMIR [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call. The Ring of power within my grasp. 
[Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's neck with the tip of his sword.] 
FARAMIR A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. 
[Frodo is backed up fearfully against the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs the Ring in his hand and jerks himself away.] 
FRODO No!! [He runs away from Faramir] 
SAM Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you understand? Hes got to destroy it. Thats where were going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire. 
[Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then Damrod enters.] 
DAMROD Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements. 
SAM Please. Its such a burden. Will you not help him? 
DAMROD Captain? 
FARAMIR Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. [He turns to leave.] 
[Sam looks after Faramir sadly.] 
[Aragorn is riding towards Helms Deep. On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai army marching with great speed. He quickly makes haste towards Helms Deep and soon sees the refuge.] 
ARAGORN [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn. (Well done, Brego, my friend) 
[He rides into Helms Deep to the amazement of all.] 
REFUGEES Hes alive! 
GIMLI [Pushing his way through the crowd.] Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless you, laddie! 
ARAGORN Gimli, where is the king? 
[Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn makes his way in, he runs into Legolas who stands waiting.] 
LEGOLAS Le ab-dollen. (Youre late.) [They smile. Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns wounds.] You look terrible. 
[To the side, Éowyn sees Aragorn and smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas takes Aragorns hand and gives the Evenstar pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar and claps Legolas on the shoulder.] 
ARAGORN Hannon le. (Thank you.) 
[Éowyn looks on and smiles even as tears fill her eyes.] 
TREEBEARD 'Tis a gathering. 
MERRY A gathering of what? 
[Merry and Pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard gathering.] 
TREEBEARD Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good, good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war. 
[Merry licks his lips in anticipation.] 
[Back at Helms Deep, the women and children are being led into the caves.] 
SOLDIER 1 Move back! Move to the caves! 
SOLDIER 2 Keep moving! 
SOLDIER 3 Quickly now! 
[Old men and young lads are being drafted for war. The women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers, husbands and sons are led away by soldiers. In the armoury, weapons are being distributed. Aragorn picks up a battered sword, looks at it and tosses it back.] 
ARAGORN Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers. 
GIMLI Most have seen too many winters. 
LEGOLAS Or too few. Look at them. Theyre frightened. I can see it in their eyes. [The men around them fell silent. Legolas speaks to Aragorn.] Boe a hûn: neled herain dan caer menig! (And they should be... Three hundred against ten thousand!) 
ARAGORN Si beriathar hýn. Amar nâ ned Edoras. (They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras.) 
LEGOLAS Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hýn ú-... ortheri. Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors. They cannot win this fight. They are all going to die!) 
ARAGORN Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses and then walks away. Legolas makes as if to go after him.] 
GIMLI [Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go, lad. Let him be. 
[In the hall] 
GAMLING Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord? 
THÉODEN Who am I, Gamling? 
GAMLING You are our king, sire. 
THÉODEN And do you trust your king? 
GAMLING [Puts armour onto Théoden] Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end. 
[The villagers are handed their weapons. An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed boy. Another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes. Another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield. Théoden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through.] 
THÉODEN To whatever end Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this? 
[Everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements. Aragorn is sitting on the steps. He sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously.] 
ARAGORN Give me your sword. What is your name? 
HALETH Haleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless.. 
[Aragorn gives the battered sword a few swings.] 
ARAGORN A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no mercy! For you shall receive none!) 
[The Uruk-hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry. The Uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter] 
GIMLI [Jumping and straining to see] Whats happening out there? 
LEGOLAS Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at Gimli with a grin] Or would you like me to find you a box? 
GIMLI [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!! 
[The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouraging the Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously.The women and children in the caves huddle together in fear. Suddenly, Aldor, the old man next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai in the neck.] 
ARAGORN Dartho! (Hold!) 
[The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. With a hollow groan, the Uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. With a cry, the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts charging.] 
THÉODEN So it begins. 
ARAGORN Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!) 
[The Elves notch their arrow and aim.] 
LEGOLAS Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc. (Their armor is weak at the neck and beneath the arms.) 
ARAGORN Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!) 
[Arrows rain down on the Uruk-hai below, killing many.] 
GIMLI Did they hit anything? 
THÉODEN Give them a volley. 
GAMLING [to the men] Fire! 
MAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE Fire! 
[More arrows are released. But the Uruk-hai army keep advancing, with more replacing those fallen.] 
ARAGORN Fire! 
GIMLI [Impatiently] Send them to me! Cmon! 
[The Uruk-hai start to load ladders onto the walls, pushing them up with their long spears.] 
ARAGORN Pendraid! (Ladders!) 
[The Elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. The first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk Berserkers on top of them.] 
ARAGORN Swords! Swords! 
GIMLI Good! 
[Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai climb over the wall.] 
GIMLI Legolas, two already! [Holding up two fingers] 
LEGOLAS Im on seventeen! 
ARAGORN Hurry! Inside! Get them inside! 
GAMLING Into the Keep! 
[They all run towards the keep, Legolas firing two arrows into the Uruk-hai army as he goes.] 
[Treebeard is walking through the forest, carrying Merry and Pippin. The hobbits look dejected.] 
TREEBEARD I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there. 
[Pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam in his eyes.] 
PIPPIN Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take us south! 
TREEBEARD South? But that will lead you past Isengard. 
PIPPIN Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. Its the last thing hell expect. 
TREEBEARD Mmmm. That doesnt make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps youre right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill. 
MERRY Are you mad? Well be caught! 
PIPPIN No we wont. Not this time. 
[Faramir and company draws close to Osgiliath.] 
RANGER 1 Look! Osgiliath burns! 
RANGER 2 Mordor has come. 
FRODO [With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go. 
[Faramir hesitates for a moment.] 
FARAMIR Hurry. [He presses them on] 
FRODO Faramir, you must let me go! 
[Frodo and Sam are pushed on towards Osgiliath] 
[Treebeard, Merry and Pippin come to the southern edge of the forest.] 
TREEBEARD And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully. Theyre always trying to get somewhere where they  Oh!! [He sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds] Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn. 
PIPPIN Im sorry, Treebeard. 
TREEBEARD [With tears in his eyes] They had voices of their own. [His gaze turns to the treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns] Saruman! A wizard should know better! 
[He lets out a ferocious roar that echoes through the forest] 
TREEBEARD There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or the tongues of men for this treachery. My business is with Isengard tonight. With rock and stone! 
[Merry and Pippin turn around as they hear rumbles from the forest. They see many Ents emerging and marching towards them] 
MERRY Yes! 
TREEBEARD Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. Last march of the Ents!

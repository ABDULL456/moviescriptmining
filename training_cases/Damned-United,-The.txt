1   EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                1 
Heavy leaden skies over the arachnoid stands and floodlights of Elland Road stadium: home to Leeds United football club. 
And rain. Sheets of angry, Yorkshire rain. 
TITLE: "THE DAMNED UNITED" 
2   INT. BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                    2 
Flashlights pop as DON REVIE, (late 40's), the most successful manager in English football, walks out in front of a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS. He is flanked by the Chairman of Leeds United, (MANNY CUSSINS, 60's), and several other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board. 
REVIE I'm just going to make a brief statement. 
CAPTION: "JULY 4th, 1974" 
REVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet, filled with the silverware he has won. REPORTERS wait: intimidated. Cowed. 
REVIE (cont'd) Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I accepted the FA's offer to become the next manager of the England national football team. 
A gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved fathers losing their favourite son. 
REVIE (cont'd) Obviously that involves me leaving Leeds United after 13 happy and successful years, which makes me very sad. I'd like to think I have built the club into a family and there must be sadness when anybody leaves a family. However, when one man goes, another steps into his place. I know who I think that person should be, the man to replace me, and I shall make my feelings clear to the directors. Thank you. No further comments. 
REVIE turns and walks out, a volley of REPORTERS shouting questions... 
FADE TO BLACK: 
3   EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY - (1974)                                  3 
We're in a car. Tarmac passes beneath us. Roadmarkings. 
OVER THIS: the sound of a flat Teeside voice, singing along with Frank Sinatra on the radio... 
VOICE (V.O.) "Fly me to the Moon.." 
4   INT. CAR - DAY - (1974)                                       4 
Two young BOYS, (12, 9) stare out of car windows. Raindrops on the panes of glass. Their father, BRIAN CLOUGH, (39), slick, modern, cocky, handsome. About as big a contrast to DON REVIE as it's possible to find, is up front. Driving.. 
CLOUGH (singing) "And let me play among the stars.." 
SIMON When are we there? 
CLOUGH Any moment now. On the right. (singing) "Let me see what spring is like..." 
The car turns a bend, and suddenly the floodlights and stands of a football stadium come into view. The BOYS' eyes widen. 
BOY 1 There it is! Dad! There it is! The BOYS smile in excitement. 
CLOUGH (singing) "..on Jupiter and Mars.." 
`LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB' written on the side of the stadium. CLOUGH smiles, then puts his foot down. The car accelerates past the turning. The BOYS' smiles fade. 
BOY 1 Where are you going? Dad? You've missed it. 
CLOUGH We've something else to do first. Won't take long. (singing) (MO RE) (CO NTINU ED)

The MUSIC continues as the car drives on, turning into the MUSIC of a television program.. 
5   INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY - (1974)                          5 
The `CALENDER' front title sequence, a Yorkshire TV current affairs program. We're in a TV studio. The presenter is AUSTIN MITCHELL, (40).. 
MITCHELL Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts his new job as manager of Leeds United, taking over from Don Revie - the most successful manager in the club's history, under whom Leeds have won everything.. CLOUGH ..not QUITE everything. Not won the European Cup... 
7    EXT. CAR PARK - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     7 
CLOUGH's car pulls up. He and his sons get out. A few waiting press. Cameras. Lights. A few FANS with autograph books. 
JIMMY GORDON Where have you been, boss? 
JIMMY GORDON, CLOUGH loyal trainer, his face creased with anxiety.. 
JIMMY Directors have been waiting more than an hour. C'mon..

CLOUGH Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire weather! (gestures shivering) I tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to Majorca! 
CLOUGH laughs. The PLAYERS stare in silence. Squinting in the drizzle. Condensation coming from their mouths. 
JOHNNY GILES stares. BILLY BREMNER spits and continues talking disrespectfully. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Not much of a welcome, was it? And not so much as a smile from Johnny Giles. 
JIMMY You're five days late!! And did you really need to say that about Majorca? (beat, changing the subject) You know he was Revie's first choice for getting your job. 
CLOUGH Who? Johnny Giles? 
CLOUGH looks over at GILES, who turns away, resumes training.... 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Was he now? And Bremner? 
JIMMY Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His first born. You're never going to get any love from him. 
BREMNER, a flint-eyed Scot, stares at CLOUGH.. 
CLOUGH Great. Here's to happy fucking families. 
8   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     8 
JIMMY GORDON leads CLOUGH and his BOYS down a corridor, where countless photographs of DON REVIE hang on the walls. Holding silverware. 
They pass an open door, with a sign outside, `MANAGER. Mr. DON. REVIE.' CLOUGH stops. Looks at the sign.

6A 8   CON TINUE D:                                              8 
Then pushes open the door.. 
9   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)             9 
CLOUGH walks into the manager's office. The empty chair. The bare desk. His desk. Don's desk. 
CLOUGH takes a seat in the chair. 
Presently, a middle-aged matron, JEAN REID, Don Revie's faithful SECRETARY for 13 years, appears in the doorway.. 
CLOUGH Any chance of a cup of tea, duck? 
JEAN They're waiting for you. Upstairs. 
CLOUGH swings his feet on the desk. 
CLOUGH Who's that? JEAN The Directors. 
CLOUGH For me? Why? 
JEAN For the board meeting. 
CLOUGH Let them wait. Now, how about that cup of tea? 
CLOUGH smiles sweetly, but JEAN stares at CLOUGH. She pointedly doesn't move. CLOUGH lowers his feet. 
CLOUGH Thank you. I'm the best old one, too. 
CUSSINS ...I also did it under the assumption that you'd be coming here wanting the best for the club. For the city of Leeds. So why do I still get the feeling this is all about you and Don? 
CLOUGH Of course it's just about me and Don. Always has been. But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders of Leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big white Colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means I won't sleep and won't eat until I take whatever that man's achieved and beaten it -- beaten it so I never have to hear the name "Don Fucking Revie" again -- beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is Brian Clough. Brian Clough uber fucking alles. Understand? 
The blazers and brass buttons, WHITE-HAIRED ELDERS of Leeds stare at one another.

12   INT. FRONT ROOM - CLOUGH'S HOUSE - DERBY - NIGHT - (1968) 12 
CLOUGH sits glued to a wireless in his front room. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER ..Ladies and Gentlemen, the draw for the third round of the FA Cup will now commence.. 
CLOUGH's eyes widen: he calls out to the others.. 
CLOUGH C'mon, Pete! 
WHITE-HAIRED ELDER Number twenty-two.. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER Derby County, second division.. CLOUGH Here we go. That's us..! 
CAPTION: "SIX YEARS EARLIER" 
PETER TAYLOR, seven years older than CLOUGH, his closest friend, his only true friend, appears breathlessly in the doorway back from a fish and chips run... 
..followed by BARBARA, Clough's wife, and the three children.. 
WHITE-HAIRED ELDER (ON RADIO) Number six.. ON TV: the BLAZER-WEARING ELDER calls into the microphone.. 
BLAZER-WEARING ELDER (ON RADIO) Leeds United! 
RADIO COMMENTATOR Against mighty Leeds United..! 
CLOUGH and TAYLOR cry out in shock..

The telephone rings. CLOUGH picks it up.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) (already knowing it'll be SAM LONGSON) What do you say to that, Mr. Chairman? 
13   INT. SAM LONGSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - (1968)                  13 
He's right. It's SAM LONGSON, Chairman of Derby County, (60's) looks like Krushchev, cue-ball head, voice like a power-drill, a tough haulage millionaire.. 
UNCLE SAM I can hear the cash registers now! 
CLOUGH Happy days, Sir. Happy days. UNCLE SAM You're not wrong, Brian. Take the family out for a meal. Go to The Mumtaz. Tell `em I'm paying. 
14   INT. CLOUGH'S HOUSE - NIGHT - (1968)                       14 
CLOUGH hangs up the phone.. 
CLOUGH Put the fish and chips in the bin. Tonight's on Uncle Sam. We're going posh. Chicken fucking bhuna in town. General excitement. Everyone starts putting on their coats. 
15   EXT. BASEBALL GROUND - DERBY - DAY - (1968)                15 
CLOUGH stands with two men in overalls, indicating a fading `Visitors' sign... 
CLOUGH Right, you two, I want Billy Bremner and Johnny Giles to be able to read THAT... (indicates door-frames) And this woodwork has seen better days.. 
12A 
BREMNER Don never did that. 
CLOUGH Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I never want to hear that man's name again. Ever. Next player who mentions it, or what he did or didn't bloody do in the good ol' days, will spend a week cleaning my boots. (clapping hands) Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean, and sensible. No fifty-fifty's. CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Right, I'll play myself. You might learn something, Irishman. Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts. 
CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys it into a distant goal.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Like to see Don fucking Revie do that, eh? 
CLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY GORDON quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the whistle.. (CO NTINU ED) 
27   CON TINUE D: (4)                                                  27 
The game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove himself, is soon darting about, calling out... 
CLOUGH (cont'd) (clapping hands) Here, son. To feet. Keep it simple. Think and give. On the deck. Nice and crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me. 
CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out.. 
"CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS". 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!! 
CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON runs up to NORMAN HUNTER.. JIMMY Fucking matter with you? He said no fifty-fifty's. 
HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS. Crowding the referee. Intimidating him. 
HUNTER What are you going to do about it? Book me? 
JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on the floor. In agony. Holding his knee. 
28   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DRESSING-ROOMS - SAME TIME                  28 
CLOUGH listens to the PLAYERS laughing at him. Disrespecting him. His face darkens. 
BREMNER (mimicking) "Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts." 
The sound of coarse, cruel laughter among the LEEDS PLAYERS. JIMMY GORDON appears, CLOUGH's two SONS in tow.. 
JIMMY I've got what you were looking for. 
JIMMY holds up a large parcel wrapped in brown paper. CLOUGH's expression changes. 
(CO NTINU ED) 
28   CON TINUE D:                                                  28 
CLOUGH What about the petrol? 
JIMMY In the boot of the car. 
CLOUGH Good lad. 
29   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                      29 
CLOUGH limps down a corridor. In a thunderous mood. Holding the parcel. PEOPLE scatter. 
30   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)              30 
The door flies open. CLOUGH storms into his office. He walks over to the desk. DON REVIE's desk. He unwraps the parcel, and takes out an axe. 
CLOUGH Stand back. 
CLOUGH's SONS watch as their father violently swings the axe down onto the desk. The sickening sound of splintering wood. 
31   EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                 31 
CLOUGH watches the desk burn in a small bonfire outside. MANNY CUSSINS and several DIRECTORS walk out. They are surprised to see CLOUGH by the fire holding an axe... 
CUSSINS Everything all right? 
CLOUGH (sunny, waving with the axe) Fine thank you, Mr. Cussins. 
CLOUGH smiles politely, then turns, and walks to his car. The DIRECTORS watch.. 
CUT TO: 
The trophy is centre-stage. CLOUGH sings a Sinatra classic.. 
CLOUGH "Love and marriage, love and marriage, it's an institute you can't disparage.." 
To everyone's amusement: CLOUGH sings to PETER TAYLOR, not his own wife.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) "Try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion. Try, try, try and you will only come to this conclusion.." 
In another corner: MACKAY is amiably ribbing LONGSON.. MACKAY ..."the man's crocked", "older than time" "broken more bones than Evel Knievel?" 
LONGSON All right, I admit it, I was wrong. 
LONGSON starts eating his trademark felt hat. Much cheering as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty. 
Suddenly, DAVE MACKAY looks up, sees the television. Calls for quiet!! 
ON TV: a live awards presentation. From London. DON REVIE is being presented with an award... 
REVIE ..for Leeds to win the First Division title, and for me to be named as English Manager of the year...feels like a dream come true... 
CLOUGH watches. His expression changes. His eyes burn into REVIE's. 
CLOUGH You enjoy it, Don. Go home, put your feet up and fucking enjoy it. There's a good lad. Because we'll be in the First Division next season. And we're going to have you! 
Loud CHEERS from LONGSON, TAYLOR, MACKAY and CLOUGH. OVER THIS: we fade in the sound of roaring... (CO NTINU ED)

COMMENTATOR'S VOICE The twin towers of Wembley Stadium, the cathedral of English football on a glorious late-summer's day... good afternoon everyone, it's the Charity Shield, the opening Saturday of the 1974 season, and a first chance to get a look at Brian Clough's Leeds... 
48   INT. WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY - (1974)                          48 
DON REVIE is being interviewed by a TV JOURNALIST in sheepskin coat and headphones.. 
JOURNALIST Will you be supporting Leeds today, Don? 
REVIE You'd expect nothing less having been their manager for 13 years. But the fact is I'm here today as manager of England... 
JOURNALIST Do you have any advice to give your successor, Brian Clough, before his first game? A mischievous smile barely perceptible of REVIE's face.. 
REVIE Win. The people of Leeds are used to winning. 
49   INT. WEMBLEY DRESSING-ROOM - DAY - (1974)                    49 
CLOUGH with the LEEDS TEAM in the dressing-room before kick off. PLAYERS changing. The stink of Ralgex. PHYSIOS bandaging the injured. JIMMY GORDON massaging one or two players. 
CLOUGH Right, the team for today is: Harvey in goal, Reaney, Cherry, Bremner, McQueen, Hunter, Lorimer, Clarke, Jordan, Giles, Gray. 
CLOUGH folds a piece of paper. A flicker of vulnerability. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Obviously all eyes will be on us to see how things have changed. Without Don. What might be different under me. Let's show them some of the things we've been working on. Our changes in attitude, too. Our new outlook. New discipline. New approach. (a beat) Let's see some of you playing with a smile. 
Team talk over: the PLAYERS put on their shoes. Make final preparations.

Silence. BREMNER continues to limber up... 
CLOUGH (cont'd) You know, son, I've nothing but the highest regard for you as a player. 
They PLAYERS get the instruction to walk out, towards the roar of the crowd... 
BREMNER No, he's not. 
BREMNER, GILES AND HUNTER turn. Walks back towards the bus.

CLOUGH Right, last time there was a whole division between you and Leeds. Not now. Not today. Today we're here as Second Division champions, and equals with Leeds. John McGovern and Billy Bremner, EQUALS. Kevin Hector and Johnny Giles, EQUALS. Alan Hinton and Peter Lorimer, John O'Hare and Paul Madely. EQUALS. Now, c'mon, chins up. Chests out.

DON REVIE (ON TV) ...obviously it's a terrific achievement for Derby, being promoted to the First Division, but the truth is Leeds United have an unfortunate habit of reminding them just how far they still have to go.. 
TAYLOR Arrogant twat.. 
CLOUGH But he's right. Five nothing. They made us look like fools today. And what was John O'Hare doing? Letting Madeley bully him like that. (MO RE)                         (CO NTINU ED)

TAYLOR Yours. 
CLOUGH He was all over the place. Like the Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to anyone BUT his own. We need a ball player, a natural in midfield. Who'll hold onto it. Keep possession. We're giving it away too easily. 
TAYLOR Someone like Colin Todd. CLOUGH (sharp intake) Oooh, now you're talking. Lovely pair of feet. 
TAYLOR I've heard he wants out of Sunderland, too. They're all jumping ship up there. 
CLOUGH thinks for a moment, then... 
CLOUGH Well, go on then. Sign him. TAYLOR What? We can't. Longson's already told us. Club's in debt. 
CLOUGH Bollocks to that. I've not brought us all the way to the First Division just to sit there mid-table, and be cannon fodder for sides like Leeds. Sign the man. 
TAYLOR Hang on, hang on, careful... 
CLOUGH I'll handle bloody Longson.

CLOUGH is working a session with the Derby PLAYERS. A car screeches into the car park behind. A red-faced, apoplectic SAM LONGSON gets out.. 
UNCLE SAM A hundred and seventy grand?!? For Colin fucking Todd?!? 
CLOUGH Correction, the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd. The best technical footballer in the country. 
UNCLE SAM A salary of three hundred quid a week? You can't pay a footballer that!! 
CLOUGH That's the way things are going, Uncle Sam. Football's all about money now. 
UNCLE SAM I told you never to go over my head again. 
CLOUGH Had no choice. Windows opened up. You were in the bloody West Indies. 
UNCLE SAM WindowS? You mean there were others?!? 
CLOUGH Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy.

CLOUGH stares at REVIE and his lieutenants in their neighbouring dug-out. 
Presently...CLOUGH's view, and our frame is filled by two wheel-chairs carrying disabled/learning difficulties FANS wearing rosettes... 
The wheel-chair FAN looks at CLOUGH for a beat, then violently shakes a rattle... 
WHEEL-CHAIR FAN COME ON LEEDS!!!!! 
CLOUGH's face: shocked. Then, all of a sudden.... 
"RRRRROOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR", a roar goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and his henchmen leap to their feet, delighted. Applauding. 
The WHEEL-CHAIR FAN screams with delight. Makes a `wanker' gesture in CLOUGH's face. 
CLOUGH's face: darkening like thunder.

Already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his tongue.. 
Presently, the door opens, and CLOUGH walks in, carrying a bottle of brandy, Remy Martin. 
CLOUGH Congratulations, lads! Beautiful! That was as perfect a half of terrible football as I've ever seen. The plan you've obviously been hatching to get me the sack has worked a treat, so you deserve a little celebration... 
CLOUGH pours brandy into a tea-cup, gives it to a PLAYER.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) You do want me to get the sack? 
MCGOVERN No, Boss. 
CLOUGH Then why the fuck did you give it to their most dangerous player, Johnny fucking Giles? 
MCGOVERN I didn't see him. 
CLOUGH turns to another PLAYER, (JOHN O'HARE), pours him a shot of cognac... 
CLOUGH You want me to get the sack, Mr O'Hare? 
O'HARE No, Boss. 
CLOUGH That open goal? Looked like a deliberate fucking miss to me. A miss to get your manager the sack. 
CLOUGH turns to a third PLAYER, (COLIN TODD), hands him a cup..

TODD No, Boss. 
CLOUGH The amount of bloody money I paid for you, I must have been out of my mind. You can't even keep on your feet. 
TODD No, Boss. 
CLOUGH turns, and faces the room. 
CLOUGH You've all done a terrific job of getting me the sack. So I'm not letting you out of here for the second half, until you've finished the bottle. 
The PLAYERS stare at one another, holding their drinks. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) DRINK!!! 
CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk off down the corridor. TAYLOR (cont'd) What made you go for the Brandy? 
CLOUGH They were just nervous. Shitting themselves. You could tell. 
TAYLOR You're a bloody genius. I tell you what, Bri - if we can beat this lot, we can go all the way.

REVIE I haven't personally heard Mr. Clough's comments, but they have been reported to me, and our solicitors are looking into them.

CLOUGH Don Revie? Ooooh. (shudders playfully) Don't mention that name to me. 
DAVID FROST It's really like the other House of Commons. You hate to mention him. Why? 
CLOUGH I hate to mention him why? Because he's a very talented man and I don't like him. 
The audience laughs. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) He's a very, very talented man and his record is unsurpassable. But I just happen not to like him. And I don't like the way he goes about football either. Football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in your profession who don't like the way you do your bit.

COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN William Bremner, your conduct in the Charity Shield match was deplorable and cannot be tolerated. 
CLOUGH It was. 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN We understand Leeds are taking disciplinary action against you internally, however the Football Association has to be seen to make an example. We have therefore decided to impose a fine of five hundred pounds..

CLOUGH Thank you.. COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN ...and a suspension until September 30th...

KEITH ARCHER walks across the beach, the scalding sand, sweating under the merciless sun... 
Until he finds CLOUGH. ARCHER takes out his handkerchief, mops his brow.. 
ARCHER You're a hard man to find, Mr. Clough. 
CLOUGH Who's looking? 
ARCHER My name's Keith Archer. Secretary of Leeds United football club. 
CLOUGH looks up, can't help smiling.. CLOUGH Then what are you doing here, Keith? Because from what I'm reading in my paper, and from what I hear on the jungle drums, you've got a bit of a problem at home with your manager flirting with the England job. 
ARCHER He's not flirting... 
CLOUGH (indignant, pointing to newspaper) `Ey, it says it right here. ARCHER He's taken it. 
CLOUGH turns, squints in the light... 
ARCHER (cont'd) Which bring me to the point of my visit. 
BARBARA and PETER TAYLOR look over from the beach, concerned. KEITH ARCHER smiles nervously, politely raising his hat...

CLOUGH It's the top flight, Pete. The First Division. 
TAYLOR But we've given Brighton our word. And they've paid us the money. 
CLOUGH We can pay BACK the money. Bollocks to bloody Brighton. (laughing now, a dismissive wave) I'd go mad. We'd ALL go mad down there. 
TAYLOR Please...give it a year. Give it a chance. 
CLOUGH A year? It'd be death. Death for us all. 
TAYLOR Mike Bamber is a good man.. CLOUGH Oh, do me a favour.. 
TAYLOR He had faith in us, offered us a job when no one would. 
CLOUGH He offered us a job. And now someone else has offered us a better one..and not just anyone. The best team in the country. C'mon, Pete, you know what that means.. It'd be the Charity Shield at Wembley in a months time. The European Cup after.. 
141   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY - (1974)                          141 
CLOUGH and his SONS are packing together CLOUGH's belongings in a couple of boxes. A knock at the door.. 
DUNCAN MACKENZIE comes in, in track suit, a cigarette in hand. Ready for the day's training.. 
MACKENZIE Just wanted to say, it's not right. They should have given you more time. CLOUGH Good lad. 
MACKENZIE Not just me that feels that way, either. 
CLOUGH The sad thing is, it won't work. You can't change a manager like a pair of socks. It'll happen once, to me - and never again. 
CLOUGH shakes CLARKE's hand. 
`Rrrrinng', the phone rings. CLOUGH turns and picks up the phone. He listens, then..

CLOUGH hangs up. Looks at his SONS.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Something we have to do on the way. Won't take long.

CLOUGH No problem. 
CLOUGH smiles. Uncharacteristically vulnerable. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Go easy on me, though. There's a good lad.

CLOUGH's microphone is fixed, he is shown to his seat beside the PRESENTER's. Then CLOUGH notices a third (empty) seat beside his.. 
CLOUGH What's this? We expecting guests? 
Then CLOUGH looks up to see a distinctive BLUE BLAZER, with gold buttons approaching the set... 
Blue blazer. DON's blazer.

CLOUGH's face falls as DON REVIE and AUSTIN MITCHELL turn the corner, in conspiratorial conversation, and out to the seats.. 
It's a set-up! CLOUGH looks over at AUSTIN MITCHELL and the crew, who shiftily avoids CLOUGH's eyes.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) You bastards! 
REVIE is put in the seat beside CLOUGH. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes. REVIE rolls his neck, crosses his legs. Vast, intimidating REVIE. Ready for battle. 
Suddenly, the theme music plays, the FLOOR MANAGER counts down.. 
FLOOR MANAGER Five, four, three.. The PRESENTER looks up.. 
MITCHELL Good evening. Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United. We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don Revie. 
MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH.. 
MITCHELL (cont'd) To Brian Clough first of all. What's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion? 
CLOUGH Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie... 
REVIE See? Not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face... 
CLOUGH ...but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his.

CLOUGH C'mon, Don. You know exactly. (MORE)

CLOUGH (cont'd) 4th March 1968. See? I even remember the date. You came to Derby County, the third round of the FA Cup, and you refused to shake my hand. 
AUSTIN MITCHELL looks up. The CAMERAMEN look up. 
REVIE Never! Matter of principle! I always shake the other manager's hand! 
CLOUGH You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my trainer, Jimmy Gordon's. 
REVIE Then I probably didn't see you!! 
CLOUGH No, you saw me Don. But considered me beneath you. Looked down on me. And dismissed me. Just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country.

REVIE Never would I knowingly refuse to shake a colleague's hand. The truth is, I probably just didn't know who you were.

CLOUGH (blurts out) Well, you certainly know it NOW. 
All heads turn. That came out unintentionally loud. 
REVIE Oh, we ALL know it now. (a beat) We know you as the man who's constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute. Who had one of the best jobs in the country, at Derby, and managed to get the sack. Who had one of the best partners in the game, in Peter Taylor, and threw him away. Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United, a team that in ten years hasn't finished outside the top four, and took them to the bottom of the first division. Yes, it's fair to say we all know who you are now. 
AUSTIN MITCHELL's eyes widen. 
MITCHELL OK, gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there.. 
CLOUGH Well, let's see where we are in a year's time, Donald Revie. REVIE Dear oh dear.. 
CLOUGH Let's see where we both are in five! 
AUSTIN MITCHELL That's it for tonight's show. I'd like to thank Brian Clough and Don Revie for joining me... 
REVIE Thank you, Austin. 
The show wraps up. Theme music starts playing. REVIE removes his microphone, turns and walks out. 
CLOUGH is left staring, hollow-eyed. Wishing the ground would swallow him up..

A silence. CLOUGH continues to drive.

SOURCE CODE Darkness. A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S WHEELS over RAILROAD TRACKS... 
INT. HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING 
COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face. He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented. Slowly he turns his head to one side... PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on their morning commute into a city. Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic strobe pattern. Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun. His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble. Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch. It reads 7:40 a.m. He swallows. A strange, creeping panic. He has no idea where he is. 
EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING 
The train hurls straight at us. NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it. Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
Colter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER BAG. Is that his? Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather NAME TAG reads: "SEAN FENTRESS." It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is starting to freak him out. He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE. CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of soda. Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button- down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and- bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal. 
COLTER Ma'am? Nothing. 
COLTER Excuse me... ma'am? She looks up. Blank stare. 
COLTER What is this? 
CHRISTINA What's what? 
COLTER Where am I? 
CHRISTINA (looks out the window) Almost at Newark. Goes back to her journal. 
COLTER What's Newark? A city? 
CHRISTINA It's more of a hell hole. But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea slams into him. He hangs on to the seat. 
COLTER Woah. 
(BEAT) I think I'm going to puke. 
CHRISTINA (gestures, alarmed) Okay, bathroom's that way. Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating. 
CHRISTINA Go. Seriously. Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length of the car until he finds the RESTROOM. The door is LOCKED. The latch reads "OCCUPIED." Bracing himself, he lurches forward into... 
INT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING 
He freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no, the passengers are different. Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom, he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors. 
CONDUCTOR Ticket? A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed. 
CONDUCTOR May I see your ticket? The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his pockets. 
COLTER I don't think I... 
CONDUCTOR Have to write you up then. He pulls out a citation pad. 
COLTER Is this...? From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The conductor snips his ticket and brushes past. 
COLTER Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it here. Where's this train headed? 
CONDUCTOR New York. Penn Station. 
(PANICKING) What the hell is going on?! 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Just relax, Captain. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
Later. We're still in the tiny chamber. It's stabilized. As has Colter, but in the manner of a dangerous wild animal given a sedative. Embedded into the controls is a two inch-square VIDEO MONITOR. It shows the face of GOODWIN. He's a middle-aged communications officer. Although we know him as Goodwin, his military name badge and rank insignia have been covered up. He wears a headset and sits surrounded by banks of electronic equipment and keyboards. He peers in at Colter, exuding the blandness of a military flight controller. 
GOODWIN Standby for thread one of alpha memory pattern. 
COLTER Who are you? 
GOODWIN You already have that information, Captain. Now think. Recall my name. A long moment. A name floats into his head. 
COLTER Goodwin? 
GOODWIN Correct. 
COLTER How do I know that? I have no idea how I know your name's Goodwin. 
GOODWIN Commencing memory pattern. 
COLTER Listen to me. Something's wrong. I was flying a mission. I was in a chopper. Then I woke up on a train. Now I'm here. Can you explain that? What unit is this? 
GOODWIN You're with Beleaguered Castle. 
COLTER Who? 
GOODWIN You're with friends. 
(PATIENTLY) The exercises will assist you. Are you ready? Just like with the train, he seems to have no choice but to go along with it. 
GOODWIN Memory Thread One. Listen to the following passage: "When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself. She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver. 
(MORE) 
GOODWIN (CONT'D) In the cold slant of light reflected from the back wall of a neighboring building, she saw her evening dress and opera cloak lying on a tawdry heap on a chair." End of thread one. Silence. Is it Colter's turn to speak? 
COLTER I don't get it. Is this a Red Flag exercise? 
GOODWIN Thread Two. Listen. I am holding the following hand of cards: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. 
(BEAT) I repeat: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. End of thread two. Beads of sweat on Colter's forehead. What the hell? 
GOODWIN Thread Three. The following is a recording of a Western Screech-Owl: A rather spooky BIRD CALL plays -- a short whistle, followed by a long trill. The call is repeated twice more. 
GOODWIN End of Thread Three. End of pattern. Acknowledge. Unexpectedly, in the back of his mind, a reply is there. 
COLTER A... Acknowledge. End of pattern. How did he know to say that? A conditioned response? 
GOODWIN Stand by to initiate pattern recall. 
COLTER Go for pattern recall. The response comes to him more quickly. Like lines from an old script. Even if it still baffles him. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) The five playing cards. Arrange them in order of descending values, irrespective of suit. He thinks for a moment. Focus. Play along. Maybe it will all be okay. 
COLTER Queen, two nines, four and a three. 
GOODWIN That is correct. The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name. What was that name? 
BREATHING. 
COLTER (V.O.) Hey. What's happening? The HUM of machinery starting up. 
COLTER (V.O.) Goddamn it, Goodwin, what is all this? The machinery HUM changes modulation. Then gives way to a GENTLE ROCKING SENSATION. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
Colter opens his eyes... SUNLIGHT hits his face. In flickering patterns. He turns to 
LOOK OUT 
A TRAIN WINDOW At the passing woodland scenery. He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat. Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad. Just like before. Other commuters all around him. Everything is exactly the same as before. Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern." Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule. Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from, the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers, the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the window, bursting with summer leaves. Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40 a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in the canvas messenger bag beside him... This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger bag. The books are stamped "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY." He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious. 
Is Goodwin watching him from somewhere? Not knowing what else to do, he takes a few more bites. Enjoying this small pleasure. He reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his 
TRAIN TICKET. CLOSE ON -- THE TICKET. It hasn't been punched yet. CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man opens his can of soda. Just as before. 
COLTER It's a goddamn simulation. Christina's pen stops sketching. She glances up. 
COLTER A three dimensional, completely immersive scenario. Touch, taste, sound, sight and smell. A measure of relief. A way to think about all this. 
CHRISTINA Are you talking to me? 
COLTER Complete with pretty girl. 
CHRISTINA Pretty girl. 
COLTER Every combat simulator has one. In the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno. 
(CONFIDENT NOW) You're an unusual choice for a distraction. 
CHRISTINA And you're a moron. Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of action. The only way he can make sense of this. He starts walking up the rows. 
COLTER Find the bomber. Find the bomber. The conductor approaches him. 
CONDUCTOR Ticket? Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be punched. 
COLTER Everything okay today, chief? 
CONDUCTOR Say what? 
COLTER Anything out of the ordinary? The conductor frowns at him. Who is this guy? 
CONDUCTOR Please take a seat, sir. Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on. All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts. Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter. Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON: The STITCHING on a leather purse. A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray. AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent. A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda can. TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on the floor. Faster and faster. Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone: 
DEREK Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... Then... the CLICK of a LOCK UNLATCHING. 
The restroom door swings open. GUZMAN, the Middle Eastern man, emerges. After a furtive glance around, he quickly takes a seat. Now Colter makes the connection. The bomb in the restroom. The Middle Eastern man emerging from the same restroom. Colter starts down the long aisle. In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin. 
COLTER How's it going? Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable. 
COLTER What's your name? Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The conductor appears, accosting Colter. 
CONDUCTOR Didn't I tell you to take a seat? 
COLTER Goodwin? Where are you? It's over. I found him. Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing happens. 
CONDUCTOR Who are you talking to? An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops. It's too easy. Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just might be a mistake. He reconsiders. 
COLTER Sorry. This guy seemed a little... anxious. I was worried about him. 
EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING 
Guzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him. 
GUZMAN I resent this. This is harassment. You obviously work for someone. 
FBI. CIA. 
(BITTER) I expected this reception in your country. 
COLTER How are you going to pull this off? That bomb has a cell phone detonator. And I don't see a pay phone around here. So I'm betting you got a phone on you with the number already programmed in. 
GUZMAN I have no idea what you're talking about. I am an international business man. An executive. The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching. 
COLTER Open your briefcase. Prove to me there's no phone in there. 
GUZMAN 
(STANDS UP) I will prove nothing to you. Leave me alone. WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending Guzman sprawling to the ground. Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again. Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil. 
COLTER 
(READING) "Hasnan Guzman, Vice President, Shell Oil." Must be a cover. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Philadelphia train now approaching. Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase. 
COLTER Where the hell's your phone? Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS. Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back. Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and malice. 
COLTER I thought so. Now let's see you try to -- A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots, looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is 
THE EXPRESS TRAIN Closing in on the station. The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION. Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's cell phone. Which has remained off. 
COLTER You didn't do it. Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned out by the ROAR of 
THE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER. Everything stops. Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into smothering, forgetful SILENCE... For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than before), the same flickering after-image appears: 
THIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD -- This time they all connect into 
THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL. A BICYCLE WHEEL. 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
The SOUND of MACHINERY STRAINING. Colter is SLAMMED back into his seat -- back in the capsule. All he can do is hang on and gasp for air. 
COLTER Holy fuck! 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Stabilize. Lower your pulse. Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight suit. The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's sweated off five pounds. 
GOODWIN Do you need to urinate? 
COLTER A fucking train just ran over me. 
GOODWIN Do you need to urinate? 
COLTER How are you doing this? Am I on some kind of drug? 
GOODWIN Did you find the bomber? 
COLTER I didn't find the bomber. You fooled me with the Middle Eastern guy. I went for the diversion. What kind of freaky simulation is this? Let me out of here! 
GOODWIN Which Middle Eastern guy? Be specific. 
GOODWIN With Beleaguered Castle. 
COLTER My unit's still in Iraq. I'm flying missions in Iraq. I flew one yesterday! 
GOODWIN Your unit was rotated Stateside three weeks ago. The news comes like a slap in the face. Colter clearly has no memory of this. 
COLTER Then why do I still have Iraqi dirt underneath my fingernails? Goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls. 
COLTER Talk to me! Three weeks? I've been back three weeks? How'd I get in here? Have I seen my family? Does my father know I'm home? "Cause I'd kinda like to tell him if that's the case. 
GOODWIN Listen up, soldier. Goodwin hunches forward, putting his elbows on his desk. As he does so, he inadvertently reveals a glimpse of his military unit SHOULDER PATCH. The insignia contains wings and a lightning bolt against a background of stars. Underneath it is written "CAOC-N." 
GOODWIN The train is just the beginning. Our intel says there are more attacks are coming today. And they're linked with the train. Time is of the essence. Do you understand? Colter barely hears. He's fixated on that shoulder patch. 
GOODWIN Captain? 
COLTER I'm listening. 
GOODWIN D.N.I. Counterterrorism has come up with the five most likely follow-up targets in the New York area. 
(MORE) 
GOODWIN (CONT'D) They are, in no order of importance, the Holland Tunnel, Newark International Airport, the Brooklyn Bridge, Penn Station and the Empire State Building. It could be any of them, it could be none of them. Whatever it is, if you find the bomber and learn his plan, the next one we might be in a position to prevent. Those are your orders. It's too much information to process. Colter's head spins with questions. 
COLTER Wait. If I'm somehow on that train before it blows up, why don't I just dismantle the bomb? 
GOODWIN Those are not your orders. 
COLTER But all those people dying... 
GOODWIN Those are not your orders. You are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission. Military priorities. Defying comprehension. 
COLTER I didn't volunteer for this shit. 
GOODWIN Would you like to see the release form you signed? 
COLTER 
(EXASPERATED) How do I know it's real? How do I know you didn't force me to sign it? And how the hell can I be put on a train over and over again -- a train I never was really on?! He might as well be talking to a wall. 
COLTER I don't believe in time travel, Goodwin. There's no such thing. 
Machinery begins to RUN. Like the WHINE of a JET ENGINE firing up. 
GOODWIN Only one way forward, Captain. Seventeen minutes. Find the truth. 
COLTER Why seventeen? Why me? Why anything? The capsule begins to SHAKE. 
COLTER Let me out! Don't send me back there! SFX: UP ON a HUGE ROAR as -- 
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING 
THE TRAIN hurls down the tracks. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
Landscape flies by. Colter's forehead rests against the glass window. Piercing sunlight. 
COLTER Shit. This is not happening. He leans back in his seat, as if just another beaten down office worker on the train. 
CHRISTINA Ain't life grand? Across from him, Christina sketching. A gentle smirk. He focuses in on her. Not knowing where else to begin. 
COLTER Can you hear me? Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset. 
RUTLEDGE Project designer initiating sequence and drives check. 
COLTER I'm here! I'm okay! Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right. 
RUTLEDGE Is someone there? 
COLTER Yeah. It's me. Colter. Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling. 
RUTLEDGE Wow! It's you. 
COLTER The capsule lost power. It's still pretty cold in here. 
RUTLEDGE We've been working towards you from the other side. Nice to have you with us again. You feeling all right? 
COLTER I think so. Who are you? 
RUTLEDGE The name's Rutledge. 
COLTER They wouldn't let me talk to you before. 
RUTLEDGE No, I guess not. They're pretty anal around here. (lights his pipe) Don't tell them you saw me smoking in here, okay? His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the military environment. And then it occurs to Colter: 
COLTER You're the inventor of this thing. 
RUTLEDGE 
(SHRUGS) I prefer the term project designer. And sorry for all the secrecy. Goodwin will be thrilled you re- established contact. 
COLTER I don't want to deal with Goodwin anymore. 
RUTLEDGE What? 
COLTER Don't you understand? He's torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't you get me out of here? Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to deal with personnel issues. 
RUTLEDGE Why would Goodwin have it in for you? 
COLTER He's a remote operator. And remote operators are risk averse pussies who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their asses on the line in the field. 
RUTLEDGE He seems pretty devoted to the mission. 
COLTER And just what kind of mission is this? Talk to me, man. Why won't he let me save those people on the train? 
RUTLEDGE Because they can't be saved. 
COLTER Why not? I know what's going to happen. I could take apart the bomb. Stop the train. 
RUTLEDGE Yeah but you'd be doing it in the Source Code, not here. Not in our own past. Mystery upon mystery. 
COLTER What's the difference? 
RUTLEDGE I'm not sure I should be telling you this. 
COLTER Telling me what? Coaxing the scientist in him. 
RUTLEDGE It's quantum physics. Linear algebra. Parabolic calculus. It would take weeks to explain. 
COLTER Is Source Code time travel? 
Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe. 
(THINKING) So... so who benefits from that? What's vulnerable? What's down there in lower Manhattan? 
(BEAT) Wall Street. 
Surprising himself with this insight. And now Goodwin is paying attention again. Waiting for more. 
COLTER Wall Street. That's what they're going to hit next. The financial markets. Goodwin considers this. For the first time, slightly impressed. 
GOODWIN I want to show you something. 
CUT TO: 
DRIVERS LICENSE PHOTOS The video monitor shows CHRISTINA's DMV shot. Her wry, secretive smile. 
COLTER Did she die, too? 
GOODWIN Yes. This drivers license photo was found with her body. We're creating a database of recovered identifications as they come in from the site. A pang of sorrow. Moving among ghosts. 
COLTER You sure she's dead? 
GOODWIN Would you like to see her morgue photos? 
COLTER 
(QUIETLY) She was sitting across from me. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) We know. 
CUT TO: 
THE VIDEO MONITOR 
Playing a GRAINY, HAND-HELD VIDEO of the TRAIN WRECKAGE. Rescue workers in protective gear picking their way carefully through the twisted, charred remains of the two trains. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) This was taken shortly after the rescue crews arrived on scene. The TIME CODE on the image reads 8:26 a.m. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) We noted the location of each corpse when we pulled it out. On screen, rescue workers pull a CHARRED CORPSE out of the wreckage. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Prepare yourself. This is unedited footage. 
COLTER I told you I didn't want to see her! The camera ZOOMS IN on a corpse. Its burned face, like a piece of rotted fruit, fills the screen. Nevertheless, we recognize it. And it's not Christina. It's someone else. 
COLTER That's... 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Sean Fentress. The man in the mirror. Himself, at least on the train. 
COLTER He died on the train. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) As a host identity, Sean Fentress had to have certain basic similarities to you. Gender. Blood type. Approximate age. His head was still intact. We need the head, you see. To link the two of you remotely. They carry the corpse towards a MORGUE TRUCK with a vast array of SATELLITE COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT attached to it. 
The image freezes, then DISSOLVES back to Christina's DMV photo. Silence. Pondering. 
GOODWIN Would you like to see the other passenger photos? Perhaps that would help you. 
COLTER You still have Christina's body? The other things she was carrying? 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Why? 
COLTER I want to know about her. Everything I can. She's not just another victim. She's connected to all this. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
COLTER The thing is, that's not me. 
CHRISTINA Give me a little credit. 
COLTER No. You drew what you saw, but the person you're seeing now is someone else. I'm not Sean Fentress. I'm not really on this train. 
CHRISTINA 
(INCOMPREHENSION) You're not really on this train. 
COLTER I'm taking someone's place. Borrowing it. My name is Colter. I'm a soldier. And I'm being held prisoner. And this is the only way -- the only time and place I have -- to figure out how to escape. She gives him a blank look. 
CHRISTINA After three months of riding the train, this is how you introduce yourself to me? 
COLTER I'm serious. Elements in the American military are using me for an experiment. I'm not sure exactly how it all happened, but I'm at a facility on Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Right now. As we speak. It's a project called Source Code. 
CHRISTINA Source Code. 
COLTER It's a program. It shifts identities. It also performs small amounts of time travel. Or "time engineering." I don't know the jargon. He's not getting through to her. It's too bizarre. 
COLTER I've been put on this train to look for someone. A criminal. And I need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train. Because right here's only place I can figure out what's really happening. But I have very little time. And each time I come back, you won't remember me and I'll have to go through this all over again. 
CHRISTINA You are, I think, deliciously mad. 
COLTER Then how do I know all those things about you if we've never spoken before? She doesn't have an answer. Can't easily dismiss him. 
CHRISTINA Why tell all this to me? There's lots of people around for you to talk to. 
COLTER Because I think you have the answer to this whole thing. 
CHRISTINA Believe me, I don't have the answer for anything. 
COLTER There's a vision. I keep having it. It's very powerful. And you're in it. And there's a bicycle. And this... old stone wall. And it's very peaceful. Does this sound familiar? Like where you live, maybe? 
CHRISTINA Stone walls? My parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an American eagle over the door. The only bike is a Harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning. 
COLTER The vision must mean something. It's the only time when I'm not on the train or in the capsule. Why else would Rutledge be so interested? 
CHRISTINA Who's Rutledge? 
COLTER Someone who was trying to help me understand something. Until they got to him. He lowers his head. A dead end. No answer. The train begins to slow down. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. Colter looks at HIS WATCH. Ten minutes left. 
CHRISTINA I saw a program on TV. It was about psychics. They say psychics have a lot of paranoia. 
COLTER I don't believe in that shit. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Newark Station. Through the window, the Old Man, Derek and the College Kid disembark. Guzman hurries past them to the station house. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) All aboard. Doors are closing. 
CHRISTINA Don't you have people you can go to for help? Friends, family? The train begins to move again. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) This is a New York bound train. Next stop, New York - Penn Station. 
COLTER Most of my friends are in the military. My dad runs a melon farm in Alabama. 
CHRISTINA Maybe now's the time to reach out to him. She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his hand. 
COLTER Me and my dad, we don't see eye to eye. We're just two different people. 
(LAUGHS) Ma'am? How old do you think I am? He gives her a wary look. Considers. 
COLTER Twenty five? She smiles, pleased. 
CHRISTINA No, but thanks. 
(BEAT) What did you mean, there's a criminal on the train? How do you know that? Colter looks away. Careful. 
COLTER I just do. 
CHRISTINA How can I help you if you don't tell me everything about this? 
INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING 
Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to follow him into the bathroom. 
COLTER You said you wanted to know. 
CHRISTINA Can't you just tell me? He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in next to him. 
CHRISTINA Try anything and I'll kill you. 
COLTER Shut the door. As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink. 
CHRISTINA What are you doing? He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside. 
COLTER It's up here. He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest of the way. 
CHRISTINA (startled, feels his hands 
ON HER) What are you -- 
COLTER Just look. Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb. 
CHRISTINA Is that...? 
COLTER Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid explosive. There's fourteen cannisters of it. Simple detonator. Cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom. He lowers her. An incredulous beat. 
CHRISTINA Did you put this here? 
COLTER No. It was someone else. They don't know who. That's why I'm here. To find out. Watching her. Will she believe him? 
CHRISTINA We have to tell someone. We have to stop this. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away. Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her. 
COLTER It won't matter. The train's already... 
CHRISTINA Already what? 
COLTER I've been sent here. It sounds crazy, but it's true. I've been sent from the future -- from five hours in the future. This train's already been blown up. She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be. 
COLTER You wanted to know. Now you know. She turns and hurries for the exit doors. 
CHRISTINA This isn't happening. I've got to get off. Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's stabbing at the door release button. 
CHRISTINA Why won't it open?! Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the number. 
CHRISTINA It's Steph. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Captain...? The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then dissolves. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Captain, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Goodwin. You're with Beleaguered Castle. You are safe. All your needs will be met here. Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking cursor. 
FADE TO BLACK. A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Captain? The sound drives away the image, replacing it with 
THE JACK OF CLUBS 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Captain, just tell me what you see. Just look and speak. Groggy breathing. A ragged voice: 
COLTER (V.O.) I see a card. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Very good. Very, very good. 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
On Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach. Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching there, a nightmare, ruling over him. On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the situation. 
GOODWIN Are you comfortable? Are you warm? Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing entirely from existence. 
GOODWIN Do you need to urinate? Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak. 
GOODWIN Beleaguered Castle is waiting for your report. Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the 1970s, comes on: 
COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.) Hearing Test. First sequence. Left ear. A short SERIES of ELECTRONIC TONES. 
COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.) Hearing Test. First sequence. Right ear. The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert. 
GOODWIN Captain, I know you can hear me. Did you find the bomber? Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting. 
COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.) Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself. She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver." Goodwin stops the audio. 
GOODWIN As you're collecting your thoughts, I should tell you there's been another development. A terrorist group has taken responsibility for bombing the train. 
(MORE) 
GOODWIN (CONT'D) This began broadcasting over the Internet a half hour. We've traced it to central Asia. 
ON THE MONITOR A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far- away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a flickering camp fire and a tea service. The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It begins speaking to the camera. 
MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER (on camera, in accented 
ENGLISH) By now you have suffered a taste of divine vengeance. God willing, you will soon suffer another. Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even listening. 
MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER These attacks will show you that you will never be safe. You can secure your borders. But what can you do against one of your own citizens? One who looks like you, who is blameless, living already among you, who takes eighty million of our dollars, a trifle, and carries out our bidding? You cannot stop this. Time has run out. The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of Goodwin. 
COLTER Let me talk to Rutledge. 
GOODWIN So you've decided to speak. 
COLTER Rutledge. Get him. 
GOODWIN We appreciate your desire for further discussion. Perhaps at a later date. 
COLTER Will you let me out of here? Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations. 
GOODWIN Frankly, Captain, we're disappointed. 
COLTER Find Rutledge! Now! 
POST OPERATOR (V.O.) Yes, sir. How may I direct your call? He takes a deep breath. 
COLTER I'm trying to reach... Captain Colter Stevens. Calling himself. Strange. No idea where this is going. 
POST OPERATOR (V.O.) I have no listing for a Captain Colter Stevens. 
COLTER Then give me the Combined Air and Space Ops Center. 
POST OPERATOR (V.O.) One moment, sir. The call seems to take forever to connect. Then a terse military VOICE comes on the phone. 
VOICE (V.O.) C Deck. 
COLTER Who is this? 
VOICE (V.O.) C Deck. 
COLTER I'm calling for Rutledge. It's urgent. 
VOICE (V.O.) You have the wrong number. 
COLTER This is Captain Colter Stevens. An eerie pause. 
VOICE (V.O.) Would you repeat that? 
COLTER Colter Stevens. Captain Colter Stevens. 
VOICE (V.O.) Hold the line. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The train slows at it pulls into Newark Station. Another voice comes over the phone. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Captain? This is Goodwin. Colter's heart sinks. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Where are you, Captain? 
COLTER Let me talk to Rutledge. 
GOODWIN Where are you? How did you find us? 
COLTER I'm on the train. The train pulls to a stop. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Newark Station. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) What train? 
COLTER 
(REALIZES) You don't know. It hasn't happened yet. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) What hasn't happened? 
COLTER The explosion. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) What explosion? 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) All aboard. Doors are closing. 
COLTER Don't you understand? I'm in it, Goodwin. I'm calling you from inside the mission. Inside the Source Code. A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Next stop New York Penn Station. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) This contact is ill-advised. I must ask you to hang up. 
COLTER How can I get out of this? 
GOODWIN (V.O.) You must realizes the army's made an investment in you. You'll be used again. 
COLTER How? 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Imagine a turntable. With a record spinning on it. All we do is lift up the needle. The music stops. 
COLTER And then what? 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Then we wait. Until another mission. And the needle comes down again. You won't remember any of this. We'll start with the playing cards. Electronic tones. Simple memory exercises. Bit by bit, we'll revive your cerebral capacities once more. The barbarism of it. Digital slavery. 
COLTER How many times have I done this? 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Does it matter? 
COLTER No one knows I'm here. No one can help me. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) In stimulating your cortex, they're prolonging your life. Many soldiers would find that preferable to death. 
COLTER You can't do this. I served my country. I already gave my life. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) The courts. 
COLTER What? 
GOODWIN (V.O.) The courts know you're here. 
COLTER Military court or civilian court? 
GOODWIN (V.O.) Military. Colter finds no comfort in this. 
GOODWIN (V.O.) I'm sorry you found out about all of this. That wasn't our intention. 
COLTER Does that make it any less wrong? No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running out. And there's absolutely nothing he can do. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
COLTER'S FACE Ashen. Almost lifeless. Around him is the darkened steel cocoon of the 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
Its appearance has altered slightly, given Colter's new awareness of what this really is. The capsule is even more claustrophobic. There are fewer controls. Even less light. A shadow world. The monitor is blank. He shouts from the void -- 
COLTER Goodwin?! Rutledge appears. Drops into the seat and puts on the headset. Fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at the camera. 
RUTLEDGE How's it going? Any breakthroughs? 
COLTER I finally get it, Rutledge. You're the good guy, Goodwin's the bad guy. Working together, you get what you want out of me. Why didn't I see it before? 
RUTLEDGE Believe me, Captain, I'm on your side. 
COLTER Drop it. I know about the helicopter crash. I know what they've done with me. 
RUTLEDGE 
(STRUGGLING) Look, it's been a long day. For all of us. But now we've got to bring this home and catch a killer. 
COLTER What's in it for me? 
RUTLEDGE Come on. These guys are serious. Help me out. My ass is on the line, too, you know. 
COLTER I was unable examine the phone without separating it from the detonator -- which I was instructed not to do. His delivery is different now. Impersonal. Distant. 
RUTLEDGE Did you make any other progress? What in heck's name did you do for those seventeen minutes? Colter does not answer. The machinery again STARTS UP. Colter tenses, bewildered. Eyes dart accusingly to the screen. 
COLTER Wait. What are you -- 
THUNK. Again, he convulses and goes limp. Click. Darkness. Everything POWERS DOWN... ... And BACK UP again -- controls, monitor, machinery. Colter GROANS and opens his eyes. Gripped by another terror. Returning from yet another trip on the train. Another bomb blast. Death and resurrection. Rutledge looks in on him with impatience. 
RUTLEDGE We can do this all day. Until you get it right. 
COLTER Please... I don't feel good... 
RUTLEDGE I don't doubt it. Who's the bomber? 
COLTER I don't know... I honestly... I can't keep... The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin. Colter tears at his restraints, ready to bash his brains out against the controls. He SCREAMS... 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
... and, in sudden freedom, surges up out of his seat with a cry. Around him startled passengers look over in confusion. 
CHRISTINA Hey! 
Colter, back in his navy jacket, slacks and shirt, has pitched forward into Christina. 
CHRISTINA You want to get off me? The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger poised to open his can of soda. 
COLTER Go ahead! Open your fucking soda! CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man complies. Some half-muttered reproaches, then most people go back to what they were doing. 
CHRISTINA What's wrong with you, anyway? She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond. Despair surges through him. He stumbles off down the aisle. But where can he go? There is no freedom. No escape. Imprisoned in both worlds. From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment in him. 
EXIT AREA Colter is slumped in a corner. Christina appears. Taps him on the shoulder. 
CHRISTINA You okay? He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen another human being before. 
CHRISTINA You're not okay. He's ghastly pale. He's sweating profusely. 
COLTER Ma'am, please... return to your seat. Footsteps. The sound of jangling KEYS. 
CONDUCTOR Ticket. 
The conductor takes up position in front of him. As implacable as Rutledge, in his way. 
CONDUCTOR Ticket, please. 
CHRISTINA He's not feeling well. 
CONDUCTOR He still needs a ticket. Colter makes no move to respond. No more concern for anything. 
CONDUCTOR Have it your way, pal. He takes out his book to write Colter up. 
CHRISTINA Wait. I'll pay it. 
CONDUCTOR I have no idea where he got on. Full fare's $22.50. 
CHRISTINA All right, all right. Getting out her wallet, she pays the conductor. He eyes her with disapproval, then shambles off. 
CHRISTINA I see customer service is alive and well on New Jersey Transit. 
COLTER Why did you just do that? 
CHRISTINA The ticket? I don't know. You looked a little lost. The gratitude in his look makes her self conscious. She turns to go. 
COLTER You see this? Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face. 
COLTER Now you can't blow it up. 
DEREK What is this? Get away from me! The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him. 
COLTER Believe me, I'm very accurate with one of these things. 
DEREK Jesus. Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a decent man, terrorized. It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy? A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him. 
COLTER Stay there, my man. 
DEREK Don't hurt me. 
COLTER Stop acting, for Chrissakes. 
DEREK Keep my wallet. Take my watch. Take anything you want. Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble. 
GUZMAN There. Now you have two wallets. Take them and go. 
COLTER Shut up! Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this. 
DEREK Please. I have a family. 
COLTER What about those other passengers? Don't you think they had families? 
GUZMAN Just what is this about? 
COLTER This man's a terrorist. He planted a bomb on the train. 
DEREK 
(HALF LAUGHS) What? Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek. 
COLTER What's the next attack? Who else are you going to kill today, huh? 
DEREK 
(IN TEARS) Oh God... Oh God... Guzman takes a step towards Colter. 
COLTER One more step, asshole. 
GUZMAN Don't treat him like this. He's not an animal. Neither are you. 
DEREK Listen to him. For God's sake I'm not a terrorist...! A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down, ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him. 
COLTER Piss all you want. You took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today. 
DEREK Eighty million dollars? I swear to you... 
COLTER Then what about the wallet, huh? Why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board? 
DEREK 
I... I... 
COLTER Time's up! What is it?! What is the next attack! So help me, I'll put this bullet through your brain. 
DEREK I don't know what you're talking about! 
COLTER I'm going to do it. Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk. 
DEREK SHOOTS COLTER TWICE IN THE CHEST. Colter staggers back -- slumps to his knees. Guzman cries out -- makes a run at Derek -- who spins and -- 
BLAM! 
SHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD. Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A terrible silence. 
CHRISTINA (V.O.) What's happening? Are you okay? Are you there? Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly walks out. As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on his beeping WATCH -- Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world 
BLEACHES WHITE... In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in: THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL. CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT. We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She continues towards the light... and we do not follow. 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
The monitor is dark. Everything is still. Colter in his seat. For long seconds we watch his face. 
INT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
A jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V. and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code operations center. Military and civilian personnel work amid mysterious scientific equipment. 
Rutledge talks on a wall phone. Like a team player serving his country. 
RUTLEDGE 
(INTO PHONE) Yes... We appreciate that... I just hope the information has come in time to clear the bridges... Thank you, sir. When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him. 
RUTLEDGE Whether or not they can stop the bridge attack, we came up with the intelligence. And that virtually assures all of our futures. This is just the beginning, guys. 
(TO GOODWIN) You did a great job, Goodwin. You operated our captain with skill and professionalism. What's that you have? Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION. 
GOODWIN The Army investigated Colter's helicopter crash in Iraq. Apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel. 
RUTLEDGE What's this, then? Some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying? 
GOODWIN No. It's the Silver Star. Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's breezy good humor. 
RUTLEDGE Send it on to his father. It'll ease the pain of his son's death. 
GOODWIN I thought I might inform the captain of the citation. 
RUTLEDGE Better not. We can't risk acquainting him with the citation in case the memory wipe isn't entirely clean. 
GOODWIN The memory wipe? 
TECHNICIAN I thought we were going to let him die. 
RUTLEDGE I know, I know. But now the Director of National Intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program, and until we train up another candidate, we'll need to keep Colter around to demonstrate it. 
TECHNICIAN Oh. 
RUTLEDGE This thing is much bigger than any one of us. Goodwin, please clear Colter's memories and re-initialize Source Code. Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the envelope. 
INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY 
Mission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up and goes to flip a switch. Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the envelope with the citation in it. 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
Inside the capsule, the silence continues. Colter thinks to himself. The MONITOR then comes on. 
GOODWIN Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission. 
INT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
COLTER Man. Just when I think I understand this... 
GOODWIN 
(NERVOUS) There's not much time. They think I'm re-initializing the system. One last look at her. That's all I can give you. If that. 
COLTER They'll nail your ass for this. 
GOODWIN If I had any feelings, I'd worry about that. But, as you've maintained, I do not. The strange path of their relationship. Ending at last at simple, grudging respect. 
COLTER Roger that. 
MACHINERY BEGINS TO HUM. 
GOODWIN This is Beleaguered Castle signing off. Acknowledge final transmission. 
COLTER Final transmission acknowledged. 
(BEAT) Thank you, Goodwin. Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter. The noise gets louder. The capsule begins to shake. Colter touches the monitor. His fingers imparting to the last image of his world a quiet benediction. 
INT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
Sipping a cup of coffee, Rutledge lingers at a window, contemplating his future. 
INTERCOM (V.O.) Dr. Rutledge, extension 16. Blinking out of reverie, he goes over to a wall phone and punches an extension. 
RUTLEDGE This is Rutledge. He listens. His face darkens. 
RUTLEDGE Shit. He SLAMS down the phone and starts RUNNING. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
Colter is back on the train. It is morning again, seventeen minutes before the destruction. He's back in the navy blazer. The slacks. The commuters, caught up in their individual concerns, ignore Colter. But he looks on them with an appreciation approaching joy. For a moment he just sits there. Simply being alive in this world. Attuned to the motion of the train. The sun on his face. And across from him, oblivious, working away on her sketch pad, is Christina. The best sight of all. 
INT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
Banks of MACHINERY are RUNNING. Rutledge comes charging in. Flustered. Barking questions. 
RUTLEDGE What is this? Who authorized this? 
TECHNICIAN We don't know, sir. But Source Code is up and running again. 
RUTLEDGE Where's Goodwin? The chair at the console is EMPTY. 
TECHNICIAN No idea, sir. A DIGITAL CLOCK ticks down from 17 minutes: 15:28... 15:27... 
RUTLEDGE What the hell is he doing? 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
Colter drinks in the sight of Christina. Finally he gets up and walks off down the aisle. As soon as he's gone, Christina looks up. She's observed his interest in her. Doesn't quite know what to make of it. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
Colter is by himself in the exit door area. From his jacket he takes out a CELL PHONE. 
CLOSE ON -- THE CELL PHONE SCREEN As he dials 9-1-1. The call connecting... 
OPERATOR (V.O.) 9-1-1. What is the nature of your emergency? 
INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY 
DEREK Of course. What's this about? Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE and is DIALING IT as he turns around. The police approach, cautiously. 
POLICE COMMANDER Place your hands in the air. 
DEREK My pleasure. Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone. On board the train there's a RINGING. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
The DETONATOR PHONE has been removed from the bomb and now rings harmlessly in the hand of the train's SECURITY OFFICER. The restroom door is open and swarming with conductors examining the bomb. On the platform, the officers tackle Derek, subduing him. Passengers watch at the windows, mesmerized. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Once again, please return to your seats, ladies and gentlemen. No way. No one's moving from the windows. Except for Colter, who stands off by himself. The first look of satisfaction we've ever seen on his face. 
INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
An ALARM is going off. At a locked door, an Air Force LOCKSMITH is in the process of disabling the key pad. Rutledge paces, livid. 
RUTLEDGE I want to know who reprogrammed this lock. And if you don't get this open in ten seconds I'll see that you're busted back down to private. 
LOCKSMITH I'm already a private, sir. 
RUTLEDGE Just open it! A man's life is at stake. The key pad goes GREEN and the pressure lock releases. Rutledge tears open the door. 
INT. STAIRWELL - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
Armed MILITARY POLICE clatter down the steps. 
INT. BUNKER MEDICAL FACILITY - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY 
Goodwin enters. He locks another door behind him. He is shaken but nevertheless going forward. In the chamber, three MEDICS monitor gauges and screens. One of them stands up to block his way. 
MEDIC #1 Sorry, I can't let you pass. Goodwin removes the patch on his uniform to reveal the insignia of a major. 
GOODWIN Step aside. That's an order. 
MEDIC #1 We all know your rank, Goodwin, but I have explicit orders from Rutledge not to -- BAM! Goodwin drops the Medic with a splintering HEADBUTT. 
GOODWIN I'm glad you know my rank. Were you also aware I'm in the Special Forces? 
EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING 
The train has been evacuated as police investigators search the rest of the cars. Hoards of passengers fill the platform as conductors try to herd them towards the station. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, rail service has been cancelled. Please clear the platform and proceed into the station. New Jersey Transit apologizes for the inconvenience. 
EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Police cars parked everywhere. Two DETECTIVES are questioning the Computer Engineer. 
DETECTIVE So you have no idea how your cell phone was used to call in the tip? 
COMPUTER ENGINEER No! People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and complaining. Christina accosts a passing transit employee. 
CHRISTINA What now? How do we get to work? You guys have some busses or something? The transit employee ignores her and walks away. 
CHRISTINA Hey! I'm talking to you! She stands there in exasperation. This whole thing has been designed to thwart her. Nearby, Colter sits on a bench. 
COLTER Ain't life grand? Looking over, she notices him. 
CHRISTINA Yeah. Now I'm going get fired for being late. 
COLTER Maybe that's a good thing. She gives him a sharp look.

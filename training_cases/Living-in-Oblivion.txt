"LIVING IN OBLIVION" 
Screenplay by 
Tom DiCillo 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, glass full moon. Fade to BLACK. 
Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White. 
EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT 
A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness of night. 
In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie- talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts. 
BERT What time is it? 
CYBIL Four. Why? 
BERT This milk is bad. 
CYBIL (sniffs) When did you buy it? 
BERT Tuesday? I don't know. What's today? 
CYBIL Monday. (pause) There's a deli on Broadway. 
BERT Nothing closer? 
CYBIL Nothing that's open. 
BERT (sniffs the milk) Is it that bad? 
CYBIL I don't know. You're the one who said it was bad. 
At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice. 
EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT. B/W 
Amid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black leather half-fingered gloves. 
WOLF This is the worst fucking coffee I've had in my life. 
CYBIL Then don't drink it. 
GAFFER What're we doing today? 
WOLF (pulls out a wrinkled callsheet) "Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks to Mom." 
AC Any nudity? 
CYBIL Yeah, you have to take your fucking pants off. 
AC I'll do it. I like Ellen. 
GAFFER Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse in that Richard Gere movie. 
BERT I worked on that. 
AC The shower scene. 
WOLF Start with the 5K in the window. Run feeders for three blonds into the living room. 
GAFFER Two people. Sitting? Standing? 
WOLF Who fuckin' knows? 
NICK I know that but I'd like to try it anyway. 
WOLF Handheld. 
NICK No, dolly. We go from Close-up to Wide-shot and back to Close-up in the same shot. 
WOLF I'll use the 35, minimize distortion; I'll light it all from the ceiling. It could be kind of great. 
WANDA Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf? 
WOLF I'll need to see a couple run- throughs. 
NICK Not too many. It's a tough scene for the actors. I want them to feel relaxed, fresh... 
WANDA We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an hour, 45? 
WOLF I don't know how you drink that shit black, Nick. I got to dump in the milk. It's the only way I can cut the taste. 
Suddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with harsh, blinding light. 
NICK Jesus! 
WOLF What the fuck?! 
WANDA Flame on, asshole!! 
The screen goes completely WHITE. 
INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W 
Screen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting; it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely registers it. 
WS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. Two flats have been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner. A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the rather scrawny looking set. 
Most of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through the camera. 
WANDA OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the work. Lock it up. Going for picture. 
Nick approaches Nicole and Cora. 
NICK OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing fine. Remember, really listen and really answer. (smiles at Nicole) I've got nothing to say to you. Just let it happen. It's all there. 
WANDA Ready, Nick? 
WOLF Look at this a second, Nick. 
Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually and emotionally breathtaking. 
WOLF I pushed in a foot. She's incredible. It's coming right through the lens. 
Nick grips Wolf's shoulder in gratitude. 
NICK That's great, man. Beautiful. 
WANDA Ready, Nick? 
NICK Let's go. Right away. 
WANDA And, roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA And, roll camera! 
AC Rolling!

WANDA Roll Camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take three. (hits the sticks) 
NICK And, action. 
INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 3. COLOR 
The scene begins once again. Remarkably, Nicole's enormous commitment is just as full and sharp. Nick is in ecstasy. 
NICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny. 
CORA Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. 
Suddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap song blasting out of its trunk-mounted speakers. 
INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W 
SOUND Street noise! 
WANDA That's a cut! (into her walkie) What the fuck's going on down there!? You call that a lock-up!? Get that car out of there! 
NICK Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy just get a flatbed trailer with about 600 speakers on it and tow it behind his car. 
Everyone nods in annoyed agreement; everyone except the Boom man who appears to be following the music with the mike, bopping to it through the headphones. Slowly, interminably, the music fades off into the distance. 
SOUND And... it's clear. 
WANDA (into her walkie) Do I have a lock-up? 
WALKIE (V.O.) kkkkkssst... sttttss yes. 
WANDA Is that a real lock-up? 
WALKIE (V.O.) ssssssssssssppppkkss. 
WANDA OK, right away. Picture's up. Roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA And, roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take four. (hits the sticks) 
NICK Action. 
INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 4. COLOR 
NICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny. 
CORA Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. 
NICOLE You were just standing there looking at me. Then you pulled -- 
Suddenly the BOOM drops into frame again. 
INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W 
WOLF Boom's in. 
NICK Jesus Christ. 
BOOM Where? 
WANDA Wolf! 
WOLF Two seconds, Wanda. 
WANDA No. No more tweaking. Picture's up. (into her walkie) Lock it up! 
Wolf quickly motions Gaffer to hand-hold the scrim in front of the 5K. 
WANDA And, roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take five. (hits the sticks) 
NICK Action. 
INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 5. COLOR 
Once again the scene begins. Nicole shows the first signs of losing her concentration. 
NICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny. 
CORA Ellen, I have no memory -- 
Suddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION sending bits of glass flying through the frame. Cora jumps, clutching her chest. 
CORA Oh, God! 
INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W 
CU the light the Gaffer had been holding the scrim before. It is smoking and shattered. 
NICK Jesus fucking Christ! 
WOLF (to the Gaffer) Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug. Right there by your foot. 
WANDA That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora, are you alright? 
Cora nods wordlessly, gasping for breath. 
WANDA Props. Props! Let's get a broom up here right away. Clear the set! 
INT. APT. HALLWAY. DAY. B/W 
Nick, Cora, and Nicole stand in a corner of the landing. Nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood. 
NICK Well, let's see. What do you think is going to happen next, Cora? 
CORA I'm going to have a heart attack! 
NICK No, you're not. You're going in there in two minutes and we are really going to nail this scene. I know it. I have no doubt about it. Nicole... 
Nick turns to Nicole and stops in midsentence. He looks at her for a long moment. Nicole returns his gaze then suddenly looks away. 
WANDA (V.O.) Nick! Nick! 
NICK One second! 
Nick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set. 
CORA I'll tell you this much right now; I am never, ever doing another fucking low-budget movie. 
INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W 
Nick joins Wanda and Wolf on the set couch and chair. 
WOMAN Chad; hold it. This was a one-time deal. You know it, I know it. There is no need for melodrama. 
PALOMINO I just thought you might... 
WOMAN Look, all I ask is that you don't mention this to anyone. 
PALOMINO Hey, that's not my style. 
WOMAN Good. 
PALOMINO So, I'll see you on the set. 
Palomino slips out the door. The woman falls back onto the bed, turning her face toward the camera. We see it is NICOLE. 
NICOLE God damn it. 
She lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower. The bedside clock reads 4:30 A.M. 
INT. CAR. DAWN 
The car pulls up outside a NYC apt building. Jeff, Nick, and Palomino sit inside. 
PALOMINO I got two films coming up right after yours, Nick. One I play a rapist that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with. The other I'm kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder. 
NICK That's great, man. 
PALOMINO Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess twinkie shit, Nick. 
NICK Hostess twinkie? 
PALOMINO That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff, man. These are the kind of movies I want to do, right here. 
NICK I'm glad you feel that way, Chad. And I just want to tell you, I'm really happy we can work together. 
PALOMINO Hey, me too! You're a great director, man. Your films are wacked! And I'm gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick. I'm gonna pick your brain. 
NICK Good. Then you can pick my nose. 
PALOMINO (big laugh) See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey, what are we sitting here for? 
NICK We're waiting for Nicole. 
PALOMINO Nicole? She's takin' a tax -- (he stops) 
NICK What? 
PALOMINO Probably taking a shower or something. Hey, how was her shower scene in that Richard Gere movie? 
NICK Good. 
JEFF Really great. 
The three men sit in silence. WS, showing the car parked outside Nicole's apt, the men inside waiting. 
INT. THE SET. MORNING 
A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks for a long moment. 
GAFFER I think we got nudity today. 
AC (reads from his callsheet) It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and Damian kiss." 
GAFFER Could be a kiss with nudity. 
AC I like Ellen. She's my type. 
GAFFER Why is that? 
AC She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky. 
WANDA Hold it down, hold it down, people. Actors working. 
PALOMINO Great shirt, Wanda. 
WANDA (big smile) Why, thank you, Chad. 
NICK OK, let's work out the rest of this blocking. Wolf -- (notices Wolf's eyepatch) What happened to your eye? 
WOLF A little accident. 
NICK You going to be alright? 
WOLF I think so. 
PALOMINO It looks good on you, man. 
NICK Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're there by the chair. Camera is close on Ellen: her first line. 
NICOLE I've always admired you from afar. 
PALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. 
NICK Good! "Professional," that's the cue; Damian steps up to the bed. Camera pulls back. The scene continues. 
NICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? 
PALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. 
NICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. 
PALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? 
NICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere. 
PALOMINO God. And all this time I thought... 
NICK Then the kiss. How's that feel? 
PALOMINO Great. 
NICK Nicole? 
NICOLE Good. 
NICK Wolf, any thoughts? 
WOLF Nope. 
PALOMINO I've got a thought. What about Damian having an eyepatch like Wolf's? 
NICK Let me think about that one, Chad. 
PALOMINO OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve, Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take One. Let's shoot it! 
NICK One second, Chad. You ready for one, Wolf? 
WOLF Hell, I been ready. 
PALOMINO Alright, Wolfman. 
NICK Good. Call it, Wanda. 
WANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
NICK Nicole? 
NICOLE I understand, Chief. 
NICK Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda. 
WANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take two! 
NICK And, action. 
INT. THE SCENE. TAKE TWO. DAY 
NICOLE I've always admired you from afar. 
Palomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking and causing the camera crew and Nicole considerable confusion. 
PALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. 
NICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? 
PALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. 
NICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. 
PALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? 
NICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere. 
PALOMINO God. And all this time I thought... 
The scene once again is awful. Nick gives their listless kiss a few moments then calls CUT. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
NICK And, cut. Very good. Wolf? 
WOLF Chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable. 
NICK Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought you were going to hold back till "me"? 
PALOMINO The more I thought about it the more it didn't seem right. And I'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if I just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down? 
NICK I don't know, that seems a little... 
PALOMINO Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas here. Trying to get the juices flowing. 
NICK Nicole, how does that feel to you? 
NICOLE Well, I can turn to look at him. But won't you be shooting the back of my head? 
WOLF Plus Chad is completely out of the light down there. 
PALOMINO Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my face, man. It's about the acting; that's all I care about. 
WOLF It's your call, Nick. His acting or his face. 
NICK For some reason I was hoping we could get both. (laughs) I thought that's what we were trying to do here. 
WOLF I'll have to set another light. 
WANDA We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for Mr. Palomino. 
NICK Yeah, I think the lying on the bed is not quite working, Chad. Let's try one with the original blocking. 
PALOMINO Which one was that? There's been so many damn changes. Could somebody help me out please? 
SCRIPT The cue for the original blocking is "professional." 
PALOMINO (intimate) Thank you. Thank you very much. 
NICK OK, right away. Call it, Wanda. 
NICOLE Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is that alright? 
NICK Of course, Nicole; are you kidding? Hold the roll, Wanda. 
WANDA Holding the roll! 
Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence. 
INT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY 
Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh. 
PALOMINO (whispers) Someone over here smells very, very nice. 
Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, blushing furiously. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
Palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some real emotion in herself. 
NICK (with quiet intensity) Call it, Wanda. 
WANDA And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take four! 
PALOMINO (suddenly) Nick, I just had a great idea! 
WANDA Hold the roll! 
NICK What is it, Chad? 
PALOMINO Just stop me if I'm out of line here, but she says "admired from afar," right? Doesn't it make sense to see Damian up close and her "afar?" You start on a Close-up of Damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two-shot that you and the Wolfmeister have set up here. 
NICK What do you think, Wolf? 
WOLF I don't like it. This is Ellen's scene. 
NICK I don't know; it sort of makes sense. 
PALOMINO Hey, you did it, man. It's all there in the writing. 
WOLF I'd have to relight. 
Nick pauses, thinking hard. 
WANDA We're still ahead of schedule, Nick; if that means anything to you. 
NICK Let's do it. 
WOLF (to the Gaffer) Get me a tweenie right here, with diffusion. 
WANDA OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing briefly to set one little light, then we're going again, right away. Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino. 
PALOMINO Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking crew guys, really. 
The Gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and begins leafing through it. 
GAFFER Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a script. 
PALOMINO Oh, yeah? 
Palomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the room. He points to the light. 
PALOMINO Hey, Bill. See that light over there? 
GAFFER Uh, yeah. 
PALOMINO Lower it about three feet. 
Palomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off. The Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment. 
INT. BATHROOM. DAY 
Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself. 
NICK Would you care to have a drink tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you say you and I have a drink tonight? 
Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in. 
NICOLE Oh, Nick! I'm sorry! 
NICK That's OK, no problem. I'm just slapping a little water on my face. 
The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out. 
NICK So, it's going pretty good, huh? 
NICOLE Is it? Something feels off. 
NICK Yeah, you seem a little tense. 
NICOLE Do I? 
NICK But don't worry about it. Just take your attention off yourself and put it on Chad. Work off him a little more. 
NICOLE OK, I'll try that. 
NICK And listen, I know he's no Olivier. But he's got something, don't you think? Kind of a natural presence. 
NICOLE Oh yes, he's very natural. 
Nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the question. 
NICK So Nicole... anything else I can help you with? 
NICOLE Actually there is. Could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth? 
NICK Oh, sure. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
Wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the camera. Wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away. 
WOLF My eye is killing me. 
WANDA Put your eyepatch on. 
WOLF I lost it. 
WANDA Is that little light set yet? 
WOLF That little light was set ten minutes ago. 
WANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take four! 
NICK And, action. 
INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FOUR 
The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all it's worth. 
NICOLE I've always admired you from afar. 
PALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. 
NICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? 
Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with extreme care and concentration. 
PALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. 
NICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. 
PALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? 
NICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere -- God! 
Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and begins pacing at the rear of the set. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
NICK Cut! 
WANDA That's a cut. Hold the work, going again, right away. 
NICOLE I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. 
Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a curtness that is a little startling. 
PALOMINO Nick, could I talk to you a second? 
Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head indicating his wish for Nick to follow him. 
WANDA A momentary delay. Everyone stand by. We're going again, right away. 
SOUND Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low on that take. 
NICOLE Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually could I listen to the take before? 
The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last take are heard through the headphones. 
INT. OFF THE SET. DAY 
Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers fiercely. 
PALOMINO I'm out of here, man! 
NICK What's the matter?! 
PALOMINO I like you, but I made a big mistake taking this part. Have someone call me a cab. 
NICK Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to me. What's going on!? 
PALOMINO I can't act with this woman. I know she's a friend of yours but I got to tell you: she cannot act worth a shit! I'm giving her everything! The whole thing I just did with the hair; did you see that? I came up with that on my own because I thought it would help her. But no, she's giving me nothing! I'm out of here. 
Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a great show of loosening up. 
NICOLE I've always admired you from afar. 
PALOMINO Have you? That's, wow; that's incredible. But that sounds kind of professional doesn't it? Admired? 
NICOLE You're right. How does despised sound? 
PALOMINO Great! (laughs) What's it mean? 
NICOLE (laughs) It's sort of like I think you're a piece of shit. 
Palomino is somewhat startled by this. He looks to Nick in confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going. 
PALOMINO (another laugh) That sounds like the champagne talking. 
NICOLE It's not. I really do think you are a piece of shit. 
PALOMINO No, you don't. You love me. 
NICOLE The fuck I do. I can't stand looking at you! 
PALOMINO Then I guess I have nothing else to say. 
NICOLE No, I think you have a lot more to say, Damian. 
PALOMINO Well, I am surprised you feel this way, Ellen. I always thought you admired -- 
NICOLE That's not what I meant. You should tell everyone what you just told Nick behind the set. 
PALOMINO Hey, this isn't part of the scene. 
NICOLE Say it anyway: The reason this scene isn't working is because you and I slept together last night. Did everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad last night! 
Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement. 
PALOMINO See, Nick! I told you this was about rejection! 
NICOLE You fucking scumbag! You think I give a rat's ass about you?! I was there to get laid and even that was a joke! 
PALOMINO You know, you are really starting to piss me off! 
NICOLE Oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit! 
Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other side of the bed. 
NICOLE Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come on! 
Nick steps between Nicole and Palomino. 
NICK OK, guys, I think we can stop there. 
PALOMINO You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda, call me a cab! 
NICK Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to calm down. 
PALOMINO Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This movie is bullshit. 
NICK Now wait a second, Chad. There's no reason for hostility. 
PALOMINO Shut up, you fucking loser. The only reason I took this part was because someone said you knew Quentin Tarantino! You're nowhere, man. 
NICK Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of your shit, you hostess twinkie motherfucker! 
PALOMINO What'd you call me? 
NICK You heard me. 
PALOMINO Say it again. 
NICOLE Why didn't you tell me? 
NICK I didn't want anything to get in the way of us working together. 
NICOLE God, and all this time I thought... 
Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN 
Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running in the bathroom. 
NICOLE Oh, God. 
Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS. 
The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent. 
WANDA Don't go out that door! 
Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
AC Why not? 
WANDA It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now go around. 
AC Next time. This is an emergency. 
The AC rushes past and a moment later the camera DOLLIES slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the set camera. 
WANDA (into her walkie) Has Ellen showed up yet? 
WALKIE ssss... kkkkkrrk. 
WANDA Get her into wardrobe right away. 
WALKIE ssskk... ssssrrrk? 
WANDA No! Scene six; Scene five has been postponed. I'm not going to say it again; Mr. Palomino is not working today. Now where is that smoke machine! 
INT. SET BUILDING, HALLWAY. DAY 
The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short. 
AC Oh. Sorry. 
Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed. 
TITO What do you want?! 
AC I need to use the bathroom. Kind of an emergency. 
TITO Well, fucking knock!! 
Tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the AC staring after him in astonishment. 
TITO (muttering) I swear to Christ, one of these days I'm going to punch somebody in the balls! 
INT. WARDROBE ROOM. DAY 
Camera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin white veil is placed on her head. Camera pulls back to reveal SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white wedding gown. Nick stands nearby, smoking. 
NICK Just as we pull up to your apartment Palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today. 
NICOLE God. Was it something he ate? 
SACHIKO Stand up, please. 
BOOM I think so. 
GAFFER You're right. It's coming back now. 
WOLF I'm going to let you handle this one, Bob. This is your baby. And Les, if he needs help you give him a hand. OK, guys? We're all working together today. 
Wolf walks off. The Gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine closer. 
GAFFER Yup, all coming back now. Like riding a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160. 
AC Way to go, Bob. 
INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA 
Wanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops in battle. Nick approaches her. 
NICK How are we doing, Wanda? 
WANDA Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not good. We need to finish this scene and do Scene thirty-one today. 
NICK Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't know we were -- 
WANDA Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to your apartment to pick them up. Now, relax. 
NICK Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment to pick them up; it's the red notebook, under the bed. 
WANDA It's taken care of, Nick. 
NICK Good. Great. Good. 
Nick walks off quickly, muttering to himself. A moment later Wolf strolls up to Wanda. 
WOLF We're all lit, the smoke machine is under control; we're ready to go. 
WANDA (hard) What about the dolly? 
WOLF Just need to see a run-through and we're all set. I'm going to make your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful. (he slips his arm around her) Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume. And don't worry about Palomino; I'll take you to a jazz club tonight. 
WANDA Oh, I can't make it. I have to go see Chad; he's extremely ill. 
WOLF Oh, by the way my eye's much better. 
WANDA Listen, Wolf, this may not be the best time to say this but our relationship is going nowhere. 
WOLF What do you mean? 
WANDA Please, don't take it personally. Because I care for you, Wolf, I really do. But I've had this feeling for quite a while and I think it's time we ended it. OK? 
WOLF (pause) OK. 
WANDA I think it's better. 
WOLF So do I. 
WANDA Well, good. Still friends? 
WOLF Sure. 
WANDA Great, cause we still have to work together and there's no reason it has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug. 
Wanda and Wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace. 
WANDA You're a real special guy, Wolf. 
WOLF Thanks. 
Wanda slips Wolf a tender smile then walks away. 
WANDA (into her walkie) OK, let's get the A Team in please! Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito! 
NICK And, action. 
INT. THE DREAM. TAKE ONE. DAY 
Nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. Her white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red walls. A sad shred of smoke drifts by her head. 
NICOLE I am so hungry. 
Tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole. His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. He walks around her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her reach. He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a CU of him. He doesn't laugh. Nick watches this for a moment in intense concentration. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
NICK And... cut. 
WANDA That's a cut. Nick; comments? 
NICK Yeah, just a couple. I thought that was uh... good. Tito, that was very good, man, really. You didn't feel like laughing? 
TITO I laughed. 
NICK Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You could make it bigger if you want. And Ellen, maybe just a little more tension when you see him. 
NICOLE I thought I didn't see him. 
NICK Right, maybe you see him a little bit. 
NICOLE Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him or not? 
NICK You see him. 
NICOLE OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto? 
TITO (hard) It's Tito. 
NICOLE (alarmed) What did I say? 
TITO Toto. 
NICOLE Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't know why I'm doing that. I'm really sorry. 
NICK Ellen, come on now; concentrate. Remember; you're marrying Damian tomorrow. You're a little anxious. You have this dream. Let's call it an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents the anxiety. 
CU Tito looking none too happy about this representation. 
NICK OK? It seems pretty simple. 
NICOLE Let's just try it. 
NICK Good. And Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one. 
GAFFER OK, more smoke. 
WOLF I still think it should be hand-held. 
NICK Yeah, well, I don't want it hand- held. I want it on the dolly. Where's my notebook, Wanda? 
WANDA On it's way, Nick. 
NICK Good. Call it, Wanda. 
WANDA Lock it up. Going for picture. And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take two! 
GAFFER We'll see some smoke now. 
AC Way to go, Bob. 
INT. A CORNER. DAY 
As soon as Wolf and Nick reach the darkened corner, Wolf whirls to face Nick. 
WOLF I really don't like being spoken to like that, Nick! 
NICK Yeah, well I don't like your attitude! 
WOLF I don't have an attitude! 
NICK The hell you don't! Every time I ask you to do something all I get is No, No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired you to do a job; if you're not going to do it you better let me know right now! 
Wolf is about to yell back at Nick when suddenly he stops and lets out a deep, painful sigh. 
WOLF I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through some heavy shit. 
NICK What do you mean? 
WOLF I can't really go into it. It's pretty heavy. 
NICK Personal? 
Wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward Wanda who is standing some distance away watching them. Seeing the two men looking at her Wanda shoots them a hard glare which prompts Wolf and Nick to turn away quickly. 
WOLF Personal, professional, emotional. It's doing a number on me. And now you're telling me you're going to fire me. 
NICK I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on, I'm not going to fire you. You're doing a great job here. 
WOLF Am I? 
NICK Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without you, man. You've got a great eye. I just hope it's not the one under that eyepatch. 
Nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but Wolf's only response is to stare back at him sadly. 
NICK Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one thing I've learned; sometimes you just have to roll with things. You know? 
WOLF You're right. 
NICK Roll with it, man. You'll be OK. 
Wolf lets out another deep sigh. 
WOLF Thanks, bro. 
INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY 
The Gaffer, Boom man, and AC kneel around the smoke machine. A can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them. 
BOOM That's where the oil goes. 
GAFFER No, that's where the gas goes. 
BOOM I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where the oil goes. 
SOUND Lester, don't you think Bob knows where the oil goes?! 
GAFFER I don't remember using oil in '85. 
AC Maybe both the oil and gas go in there? 
The Gaffer and Boom man turn and look at the AC for a long moment. 
BOOM I think he's right. 
GAFFER I think he is too. OK, three parts gas, one part oil. 
WANDA Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat, blue slippers. How do I know? Because she's sitting ten feet away from me. Well sweetheart, that's going to be a real fucking problem. 
Nicole turns away and walks past Jeff to the Craft Service table. 
JEFF She was waiting outside Nick's apartment when I went to pick up his notebook. She said she was looking for him so I figured I should just bring her up here. You look really pretty in that dress. 
Nicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother. 
INT. MAKEUP CORNER 
NICK How did you get here? 
CORA I took a bus in; went right to your apartment. 
NICK How did you get out of your room? 
CORA Oh, I just went right through the door. 
NICK It was unlocked!? 
CORA No, it was locked. I just went through it. It's something I've learned to do, Nicky. I can walk through just about anything; like air. 
NICK Mom, you've got to stop doing this. I'm serious. I'm a little upset with you. You could have gotten lost, or hurt. 
CORA I wanted to see you. I've missed you. 
NICK I know, Mom; I've missed you too. But it's not really a good time. 
Nicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown. There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick. 
NICOLE They're sending a car. It should be here in a couple of hours. They didn't even know she was gone. 
NICK Jesus, I don't believe this. 
CORA I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was going to be a wedding I would have worn my fucking hat. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
The camera holds on Tito pacing slowly, alone on the set. He is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand. Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow. 
INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY 
Nick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down. Nicole joins Tito on the set and talks quietly to him. 
NICK There. How's that, Mom? Can you see? 
CORA Is the little fellow going to do gymnastics? 
Tito glances up at her quickly. 
NICK Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet. OK? 
CORA (whispers) OK. 
INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY 
Wanda and Wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward silence for a long moment. 
WANDA How are you doing? 
WOLF Good; real good. 
Wolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as Nick walks up. 
NICK How's the smoke machine? 
WANDA It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out to every Effects house in the city but I just can't seem to locate -- 
NICK Forget it. We'll shoot without it. 
CORA Oh, I thought this was the TV room. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
NICK Cut! 
WANDA That's a cut. Going again, right away. 
INT. OFF THE SET. DAY 
Nick escorts his mother back to her chair. 
NICK Mom, listen to me. I don't want you to move from this chair. Do you understand? 
CORA Oh Jesus, you sound just like your father... 
NICK Mom, I'm serious. 
CORA OK, OK. I won't move. 
NICK Thank you. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
Nick walks back on the set and addresses Nicole and Tito. 
NICK OK, good. Very good. (laughs) Tito, I think we're having a little communication problem here. All I want you to do is laugh. OK? 
TITO Why? 
NICK I told you why. 
TITO Tell me again. 
INT. OFF THE SET. DAY 
Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her. 
Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares even more intently into his eye. 
Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees this. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
Nick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito. 
NICK Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal. It's a dream, alright. Strange things happen in a dream. All you have to do is laugh. Why is that such a problem? 
TITO Why does it have to be a dwarf? 
NICK What? 
TITO Why does my character have to be a dwarf? 
NICK He doesn't have to be a dwarf. 
TITO Then why is he?! Is that the only way you can make this a dream; put a dwarf in it? 
NICK No, Tito; that's not -- 
TITO Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? NO! I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them! The only place I've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! Make it weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a dream, there's a fucking dwarf in it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can take this Dream Sequence and shove it up your ass! 
Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence. Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly. 
WANDA Nick? (no response) I can get right on the phone. We'll try to get another... small person here as soon as possible. 
NICK No. He's absolutely right. 
Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.

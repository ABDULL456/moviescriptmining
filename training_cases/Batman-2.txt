EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK 
It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over. 
Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham. Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue: "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till Christmas." 
The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven- year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously wants more. 
Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this winter, Batmania is everywhere... 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME... 
...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather, they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to the few passersby. 
They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time of year. 
A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then -- 
-- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM. 
EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT. 
CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does... 
The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES. 
SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing into a drift. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the Salvation Army SANTA... 
...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already burdened with LOOT. 
EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks. 
EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT 
SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out, another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches. 
The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are obviously going to get away clean -- unless... 
The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT... 
INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief. 
Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park. Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS. 
COP What the hell -- ? 
EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the snowmobiles vanish into the trees. 
The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio mike: 
COP WITH MIKE Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles! (pause) So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot?? 
ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of stopping... 
THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second later... 
...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the ice and snow on the paths before it into water! 
The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded: 
COP I ...That was Batman. 
COP II NO SHIT!! 
COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared a path, they might as well join in the chase... 
EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT 
TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the horizon... 
T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk.  TWO GUARDS arrive.  As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: 
MR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. 
EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY 
It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes.  He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. 
A STRETCH LIMO pulls up.  Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him.  These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and "business managers." 
FRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. 
PENGUIN Mr. Frick.  Mr. Frack.  Our years of planning are about to pay off. 
INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY 
Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show.  His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. 
PENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? 
FRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. 
PENGUIN How much have we got left? 
FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. 
FRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- 
PENGUIN Fine, fine.  How much? 
FRICK Seventy-nine million.  -- Excluding the sum we buried. 
THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK.  He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. 
PENGUIN Speaking of burials... 
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY 
T-BONE on work detail.  He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat.  He winces, and removes the headphones... 
The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE.  He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. 
T-BONE HEY -- ! 
He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head.  Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. 
He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy.  DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him.  He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... 
By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible.  There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely.  Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. 
All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard.  A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen.  Bird bird bird, bird is the word... 
EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING 
An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison.  It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 
ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy.  She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. 
VICKI Guess what, Alfred.  I think I found a present for Bruce. 
She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall.  At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside.  The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... 
VICKI (cont.) Skis.  -- Don't let on, okay? 
ALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. 
VICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for.  -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? 
ALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment.  Let me put this under the tree... 
VICKI Not so fast. 
She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift.  ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. 
ALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! 
VOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? 
ALFRED and VICKI turn.  It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall.  VICKI waves frantically. 
VICKI Don't look.  It's your present. 
VICKI rushes over to embrace him.  He gapes at the long skinny box -- 
BRUCE What'd you get me?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? 
VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss.  She nestles up against him.  WHISPERS in his ear: 
VICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. 
Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED.  Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box.  He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... 
COP II You.  SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? 
JOGGER A kid.  Thirteen or fourteen tops.  He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. 
Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug.  Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. 
An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: 
RED BERET I Dumb shit.  Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you.  It's fulla bums. 
BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. 
BRUCE Nice outfit. 
RED BERET I Piss off, geek. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT 
Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. 
INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT 
A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo.  A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: 
ANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... 
The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett.  None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. 
Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features.  She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. 
She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir.  A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt.  Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. 
The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops.  The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: 
RICKY Yo.  Ricky here.  What's the haps? 
In mid-conversation he notices SELINA.  She smiles invitingly -- right at him.  Mildly startled, he smiles back. 
RICKY (cont.) Midnight.  No sweat.  See you then. 
He hangs up eagerly.  Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. 
SELINA Well.  "Ricky," is it? 
RICKY How'd you know that? 
SELINA I heard you on the phone.  Talking to your girlfriend. 
RICKY Girlfriend?  No, no.  That was business. 
SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. 
SELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. 
She clasps his hand.  His EYES BUG OUT.  Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone.  RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. 
RICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. 
SELINA Why wouldn't they be? 
RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident.  He swallows hard and tries not to stare. 
RICKY You'd have to be crazy.  Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. 
SELINA Oh, they're real, all right.  So are these. 
She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes.  With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. 
SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock.  He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip.  Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. 
SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? 
He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily.  She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood.  RICKY is hypnotized. 
She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing.  He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT 
Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost.  A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. 
A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below.  The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank.  Something major is about to happen... 
The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG.  Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. 
Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies.  One of them turns to a colleague: 
DOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? 
DOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid.  And here we are freezin' our balls off... 
EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT 
FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage.  CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. 
FRICK opens a door and ushers her into... 
INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT 
Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter.  The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. 
She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold.  He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. 
PENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle!  At last we meet. 
SELINA At last we meet.  -- Pigeons? 
PENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads.  May I? 
She extends a SHOPPING BAG.  The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE.  He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. 
PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. 
SELINA I've located the others.  All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! 
With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. 
PENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees.  Germs find me inhospitable. 
SELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. 
PENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once.  Champagne? 
She nods.  He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. 
PENGUIN (cont.) My dear.  Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. 
BULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs.  Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. 
They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: 
JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio.  El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! 
GORDON What's that he keeps saying? 
BULLOCK "Murcielago."  -- Bat. 
GORDON Nonsense.  That dock looked like a slaughter-house.  Batman's never committed murder. 
BULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. 
BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD.  It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. 
While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: 
POLICEMAN Commissioner?  We've got Barrett. 
INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT 
A cubicle down the hall.  The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. 
BARRETT Fine welcome.  These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- 
GORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. 
BARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. 
GORDON weighs the threat.  He nods to the COPS in attendance... 
GORDON Book the son of a bitch. 
GORDON storms out.  BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him.  Outraged, he bats their hands away... 
BARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY 
VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps.  She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE.  SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble.  The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. 
A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC.  Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: 
SHAW Come on!  Let's move it!  We're an hour behind as it is!! 
A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building.  VICKI watches angrily... 
HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS 
A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave.  Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street.  Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... 
CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim.  This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! 
As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.  We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES." 
INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE 
as he LISTENS through his concealed bug. 
CITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning.  It would sure help if we could get that mask off... 
BRUCE shuts the recorder off.  He turns to face ALFRED and VICKI -- 
BRUCE Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT 
The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky.  After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT 
TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street.  The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... 
COP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat 
VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37.  Backup on the way. 
EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE 
BARRELING TOWARD US on the street.  The SQUAD CAR gains behind it.  A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... 
The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. 
OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS 
As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit.  All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... 
EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock.  ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... 
ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT 
The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car.  It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. 
EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK 
A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES.  The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk.  The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. 
As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- 
EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT 
-- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. 
His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground.  He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: 
BATMAN Evasive. 
SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone.  We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate.  There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. 
At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows.  An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... 
WOMAN It's a fake. 
SHAW Hmm.  It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? 
WOMAN Absolutely.  You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. 
The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed.  He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind.  CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. 
SHAW I guess you'd know.  I have some "friends" in the art world.  They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. 
WOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. 
SHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. 
WOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw.  Do you believe everything you hear? 
SHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge.  I admire people who take what they want.  I'm just curious how you do it. 
SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face.  It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... 
SELINA I find that the old methods work best. 
Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss.  Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. 
INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
She hears a noise.  Stops.  Makes a big show of looking left and right.  Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows.  She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. 
Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- 
EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast.  Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD.  He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... 
LOOKING FOR LOVE? 
He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment.  He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park.  He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. 
EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops.  Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. 
COP Hey.  You see what I saw...? 
This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios.  Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up.  LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. 
BULLOCK It's Randall Shaw.  Torn to ribbons.  -- We just made Batman up on the roof. 
GORDON Oh God. 
EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park.  A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... 
We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: 
EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT 
The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers.  MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. 
VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand.  She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. 
VICKI Please, just one.  It's important for people to see what's happening. 
HOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady.  They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better.  It always does. 
VICKI TURNS.  In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing.  A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. 
Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run.  Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence.  A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. 
VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come.  She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. 
A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... 
...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes.  VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow.  She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... 
...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS.  The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. 
The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. 
In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- 
-- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. 
The FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with astonishment. 
It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.  She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... 
She can't believe what she's seeing.  The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism.  It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... 
Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns.  The invasion is being repelled.  Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. 
Triumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. 
But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... 
CLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE.  The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. 
He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor.  He's about to light out again when -- 
VICKI WAIT!  Don't be afraid.  I wanted to thank you.  I -- 
KID (cautiously) Twenty. 
VICKI What? 
KID Twenty bucks. 
VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same.  She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands.  They stare at each other for a long moment -- 
VICKI ...Who are you? 
KID Dick. 
-- and then he's bounding off like a shot.  VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches.  VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up.  Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... 
HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS 
Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. 
BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16.  I was in black; you were too." 
VICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? 
BRUCE It's her.  That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..." 
VICKI What does she want -- a date? 
BRUCE She's trying to contact me.  Says she's gonna leave me another ad... 
The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity.  BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... 
INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY 
VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down.  She spots a message in the "in" file.  She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE.  She storms out in a fury... 
INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY 
Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail.  He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: 
VICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? 
PROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news.  With Shaw dead -- 
VICKI But the project's still going ahead!  If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- 
PROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens!  That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life.  His family is in mourning.  And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. 
VICKI FUMES.  She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. 
VICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? 
PROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark.  For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. 
VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail.  He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink.  He tears it open -- 
-- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... 
THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY 
WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse.  BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. 
REPORTER I Mr. Barrett!  Any comment on the arraignment? 
REPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? 
ATTORNEY Stand back!  My client has nothing to say at this time! 
The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face.  REPORTERS cluster around it... 
As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. 
OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR 
PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. 
INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT 
The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change.  BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. 
BARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society.  Get back to me... 
Looking troubled, he hangs up.  A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield.  Seconds later -- another SPLAT. 
BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. 
DRIVER Just washed it, too. 
The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch.  They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. 
BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look.  A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... 
OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR 
Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATCAVE - DAY 
TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car.  BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. 
ALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir.  They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. 
BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. 
BRUCE Cancel. 
ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. 
SELINA Our absentee board member!  I've been wanting to meet you forever. 
TIPTREE Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block -- 
SELINA You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? 
Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off.  A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY.  His tongue is practically hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check.  SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: 
SELINA (cont.) Major contributor.  -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising... 
BRUCE I can't imagine why. 
SELINA Tax year's almost over, you know.  I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads. 
BRUCE They're proccupied.  This string of murders -- 
SELINA I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused... 
ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT 
She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and their overdressed WIVES.  She glances across the room at the statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE.  A frown crosses her face... 
ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT 
She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue. 
SELINA -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess. 
BRUCE I think we've already met.  -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. 
SELINA I'm glad you think so.  I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. 
BRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. 
SELINA Oh, it's not that.  Not at all.  It's just that I'd always heard you were... 
BRUCE What? 
SELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... 
BRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No.  Come on.  What? 
BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm.  The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. 
BRUCE Oh.  Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. 
SELINA The photographer.  I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. 
VICKI The Globe. 
SELINA Oh, that's right.  The tabloid one.  -- What an original dress! 
VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE.  He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. 
BRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple.  Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. 
VICKI Really.  She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? 
SELINA It was easy.  I slept with the Pharoah. 
She laughs at her own joke.  VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own.  SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. 
SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart?  We have some boring museum business to talk about. 
VICKI fumes.  BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. 
SELINA (cont.) I.  Short leash. 
BRUCE Pull in the claws, okay?  She's really terrific. 
SELINA I'm sorry, Bruce.  Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you.  Come by sometime.  I'll give you the private tour. 
BRUCE Wait.  Let me explain about Vicki -- 
SELINA (shushing him) I understand.  Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. 
She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy.  Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder.  BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. 
VICKI How's "business"? 
BRUCE Relax, okay?  I like you better. 
He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE.  No luck. 
VICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
The roof of the Gotham Globe.  A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. 
INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT 
TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER." 
BRUCE How? 
SELINA Maybe by...coming here today. 
She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips.  She's letting him have it with both barrels. 
SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. 
BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible.  He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... 
...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE.  She backs off in shock as he covers his face.  His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- 
SELINA Are you okay? 
BRUCE Is there a cat in here? 
Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg.  He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms.  BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. 
BRUCE (cont.) Get it away! 
She drops the cat, which scampers off.  BRUCE rubs his eyes. 
SELINA Poor thing.  You're allergic! 
BRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... 
He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him.  He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor.  She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. 
EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY 
BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. 
He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: 
TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? 
This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. 
The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham.  BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT 
SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree.  The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. 
A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen."  The Square is rocking with good will toward men.  When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- 
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
-- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch.  He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. 
He glances at the building directly across the square from him.  On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning.  His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... 
EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT 
At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices.  THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist.  Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. 
The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident.  As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: 
BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! 
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN 
He watches with some curiosity.  An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme?  But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving.  He settles back to wait. 
INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT 
The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building.  FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. 
They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS.  Just part of the fleet... 
INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER 
The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway.  The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. 
Satisfied, he slams it shut.  He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. 
PROVOST Open this in an hour.  Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? 
LEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost.  We came straight from the bank vault. 
GUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN 
"Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets.  BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER 
PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank.  The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. 
GUARD II We'll check the stairs.  See you on the roof. 
The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: 
NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless.  FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed.  The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. 
PENGUIN Mr. Provost?  If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. 
As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD.  A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL.  They're trapped on the other side.  BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... 
PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT 
PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. 
PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- 
PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. 
PROVOST lets the phone drop.  He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey.  As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic.  Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. 
PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. 
Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. 
PROVOST Who are you??  Why are you doing this?? 
INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN 
Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear.  FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. 
PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader.  And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. 
Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT 
A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver.  All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. 
PROVOST is screaming like a madman.  The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere.  He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... 
All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD.  It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. 
INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN 
PENGUIN Going down! 
He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT 
The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward.  A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... 
INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT 
The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof.  She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... 
...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above.  She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. 
She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy.  It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two.  An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... 
She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. 
EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN 
He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square.  Something weird is definitely going on.  He's about to abandon his post -- 
-- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING.  The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: 
CROWD Ten!  Nine!... 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND 
A ramshackle kiosk at street level.  The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE 
EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: 
CROWD ...Three!  Two!  One! 
The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS.  The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND 
The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... 
NEWS VENDOR Hey!  No!  I aleady got a -- 
He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS.  They shove a BODY out the door -- 
The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING 
The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- 
-- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! 
EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT 
The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS.  The second car CRASHES INTO IT.  And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. 
INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT 
The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. 
PENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues.  COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry.  PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... 
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT 
BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow.  The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on.  Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down.  She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- 
CATWOMAN Ooh.  Where have you been all my life? 
He edges closer.  Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. 
BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING.  He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. 
BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT 
Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below.  The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. 
EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT 
She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down.  A sudden CRACK -- 
The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment.  Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN.  He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg.  She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. 
EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN 
He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING.  The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight.  He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. 
He manages to brace his left foot against the wall.  It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving.  The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... 
EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT 
She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place.  With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. 
EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT 
BATMAN hanging immobile.  Craning his neck, he can just see the 
RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore.  Nevermore! 
Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. 
CATWOMAN Cute, huh!  I think it'll look nice over the fireplace.  Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. 
She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn.  BATMAN grimaces.  She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr.  Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. 
CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days.  Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships.  Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know?  Really I'm not.  Really I'm just playful... 
BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip.  She frowns and YANKS on it.  His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. 
CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh!  I'm trying to open up to you! 
Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. 
ANGLE ON BATMAN 
He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position.  He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... 
CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. 
ANGLE ON CATWOMAN 
She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. 
CATWOMAN Mice, really.  It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it.  Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different.  I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining.  I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? 
BATMAN is sweating profusely.  He can't hold his position much longer.  And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... 
CATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live.  Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel.  I'll be thinking about you. 
And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle.  He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot.  He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. 
The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof.  BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- 
-- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! 
CATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. 
A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED.  BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN.  He DROPS eight or ten feet... 
EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN 
Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash.  The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends.  The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. 
A TRAIN rumbles past underneath.  BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park.  A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect.  As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- 
It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition.  He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him.  Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle.  He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... 
The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE.  Someone's in the tunnel with him.  He lowers the costume abruptly -- 
-- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away.  The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: 
DICK It's MINE! 
He lunges furiously at BRUCE.  The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- 
EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.  DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... 
Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent.  The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... 
As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge.  Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. 
The kid sizes up the situation immediately.  He nods his head up and down.  Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. 
BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. 
DICK NO.  WAIT! 
BRUCE turns, uncertainly.  DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. 
The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.  Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping.  As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- 
-- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.  BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. 
EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER 
BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
TWO COPS scanning the park.  The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights.  From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. 
The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.  A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. 
A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless.  A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: 
COP Dumb son of a bitch!! 
The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN 
A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.  ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. 
ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called.  He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. 
BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair.  His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. 
BRUCE Great.  What'd you tell him? 
ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. 
BRUCE makes a face: how droll.  ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. 
BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! 
ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. 
BRUCE It's just a few bruises. 
ALFRED One bruise, sir.  Which covers your entire body. 
BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. 
BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- 
ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch.  I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. 
BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. 
ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. 
INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY 
In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet.  HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. 
They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... 
HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT 
A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone.  He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT 
TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man.  He was an honorable man.  That's why they had him killed. 
CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace.  THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him.  The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk.  A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- 
-- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- 
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE 
-- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later.  Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. 
TIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due.  Now the bill's come due. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK 
The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun.  A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT 
BRUCE lies motionless on his bed.  Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents.  Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... 
He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down.  Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS.  He makes no move to answer it. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK 
VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee.  ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. 
ALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine.  I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. 
VICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred.  There must be something we can do. 
ALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate --  or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale.  But in certain ways he will always be alone. 
BRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. 
ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him.  He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI.  She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. 
BRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.'  I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. 
ALFRED I see, sir.  When shall we expect you back? 
BRUCE Get your cap.  You're driving. 
INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE.  The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. 
INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT 
CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness.  TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages.  He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA." 
With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES.  He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... 
INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV.  One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... 
STAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! 
The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. 
COP Mr. Tiptree!  What the hell are you -- 
HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit.  At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT 
A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs.  The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- 
-- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. 
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER 
TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN.  The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. 
COP We've gotta get back to the radio. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING 
TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing.  Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... 
An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car.  It's a DEAFMUTE.  He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS.  One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: 
DEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 
TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on.  A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup.  He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- 
Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. 
VICKI It's "Dick", isn't it?  Or do you prefer "Richard"? 
He stares at her as if she's nuts.  VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the breast. 
VICKI "R" -- for Richard, right?  See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? 
DICK It's none of your business.  What is this, some kind of home? 
VICKI No, not that kind.  There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. 
DICK Tennis court?!  -- Lady, you're rich.  How the hell would you know what I want? 
VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder.  He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- 
DICK I'm not staying.  You can't make me -- 
-- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. 
BRUCE I can make you. 
DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him.  The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh.  I'm in Batman's house. 
BRUCE (cont.) Come on.  Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. 
ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table.  DICK edges toward it and sits down.  He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. 
BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? 
VICKI nods yes.  BRUCE backs out of the room. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY 
BRUCE pulls the door shut.  ALFRED follows him down the hall. 
ALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? 
BRUCE I don't know, Alfred.  I've got other stuff to worry about. 
ALFRED The child is hurt, sir.  At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. 
BRUCE He hasn't got any parents. 
ALFRED How do you know that, sir? 
BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. 
BRUCE ...I know. 
The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension.  He covers the mouthpiece: 
ALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. 
BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. 
INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY 
ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room.  A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. 
SELINA Well!  Tall, dark and handsome.  Are we still on for tonight? 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE 
He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED.  On his look we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT 
Christmas carols playing.  VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. 
INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. 
ALFRED Is this necessary, sir?  After all...it is Christmas eve. 
BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT.  He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES.  He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. 
BRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. 
ALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. 
BRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred.  I've got to take her out tonight. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) 
DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs.  The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. 
VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away.  This is one weird household he's landed in... 
INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT 
SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection.  She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown.  She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better.  She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. 
FRICK Look at this.  He's a pillhead. 
Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive.  The gates magically part.  There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS.  Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER 
VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival.  She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. 
She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. 
VICKI Ohh.  Am I glad to -- 
To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board.  VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. 
PENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! 
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch.  He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again.  As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. 
He races over to peer around the corner.  He sees the two cars out front.  He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. 
His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders.  One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT 
VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. 
VICKI What did you do to him?? 
SELINA gives her a catty little smile. 
SELINA First-time jitters, I guess.  Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY 
Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him.  He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. 
PENGUIN You'd be the butler.  Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? 
ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him.  He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. 
ALFRED Mr. Wayne.  Is he -- ? 
PENGUIN You know how it is.  Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. 
INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER 
The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled.  FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. 
PENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit.  There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it.  Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? 
VICKI I don't know what you're talking about. 
PENGUIN The cave.  Under the house.  How do I get there? 
The PENGUIN gestures.  FRICK holds the gun to her head. 
VICKI (cont.) I don't know!  I swear, I would tell you -- 
PENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. 
ALFRED You're no more than a common thief. 
PENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot.  I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? 
FRICK cocks the gun.  VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options.  Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- 
ALFRED I...don't...know... 
PENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. 
FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger.  VICKI winces.  ALFRED starts to blurt something out.  But a split-second before he can speak -- 
SELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. 
The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off.  ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief.  He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. 
SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself.  So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. 
The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor.  He turns to FRICK and FRACK. 
PENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? 
ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises.  FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. 
INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT 
They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. 
INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE 
Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. 
PENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. 
BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. 
DICK turns.  To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. 
INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT 
We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm.  VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. 
PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. 
VICKI SHUT UP.  Help me with him. 
The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him.  They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa.  VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. 
PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on.  Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? 
FRICK Yes sir. 
PENGUIN Oh, good.  That does relieve my mind -- 
He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat.  The blood drains out of his face. 
PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? 
INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT 
DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement.  BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. 
Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches.  They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. 
INSERT - MONITOR 
The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. 
PENGUIN Check the grounds!  The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. 
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE 
He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. 
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds.  They turn suddenly -- 
-- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! 
INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT 
The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside.  It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... 
INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER 
DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor.  BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. 
BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal.  You know what to do. 
DICK nods yes and bolts off. 
INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER 
VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.  With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. 
Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME."  FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- 
-- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. 
BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI!  RUN!  NOW! 
She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- 
-- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face!  The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... 
INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT 
VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.  HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her.  The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! 
INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT 
DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.  Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. 
He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. 
DICK Here.  You might need it. 
ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick.  And...bravo. 
INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT 
VICKI has made it to the wall phone.  She can't seem to get a dial tone -- 
VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? 
VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. 
SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! 
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction.  There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. 
WIPE TO: 
INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER 
At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED.  They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: 
PENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. 
He's holding a gun on the two of them.  He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. 
PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman.  It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move.  I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. 
He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern.  It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. 
PENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury.  It's about to be stolen twice. 
ALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. 
PENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow.  You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we?  You go first. 
He shoves her.  She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT 
SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway.  She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. 
He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in.  She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. 
SELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. 
BATMAN It's over.  I don't want to hurt you any more. 
SELINA Tell me something -- one thing.  If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? 
He just looks at her.  He doesn't have an especially good answer.  She sighs. 
SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. 
She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- 
-- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt.  He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. 
The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall.  On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. 
BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs.  Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat.  He stands over her; she glares up at him. 
BATMAN Nine lives. 
CATWOMAN I can't move.  I can't move. 
Her face is cut and bleeding.  She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it.  He crouches down beside her, still cautious... 
CATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want.  Please? 
BATMAN looks up.  DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. 
BATMAN No. 
BATMAN slowly rises to his feet.  She lets out another gruesome WHINE. 
CATWOMAN COME ON.  Don't stop now.  FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch.  You're all alike... 
Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place.  With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist.  She's trying to slit her own throat. 
He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb.  He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face.  A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. 
BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. 
DICK You should've done it, man.  You should've killed her. 
BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. 
BATMAN There's a radio in the cave.  We'll send for help. 
INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER 
The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION.  A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT.  Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. 
They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. 
PENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.  Look at you now.  Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. 
The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto.  BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view.  He takes a cautious step backward. 
CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND 
His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. 
ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI 
They've pulled almost even with the rock formation.  A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.

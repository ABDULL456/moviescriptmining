1. A dusty deserted street - saloon, livery stable, sunset. Only there is something unsettling about it all. The colors are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective. Pulling slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden picture frame ... 
6.C0NT.              BOY'S VOICE                              6.CONT, When will he be well? After a moment -- WOMAN'S VOICE I don't know. -- and the sound of a door closing. A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds revealing the snow-patched street below. Leonard's friend, crossing it, glances back . . . then disappears around a corner. And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down, extinguishing the single ray of light. 
FADE TO BLACK 
6A.   EXT. BAINBRIDGE -HOSPITAL - THE. BRONX - DAY - 1970 .        6A Tight on the face of a man (SAYER), late thirties, glasses, staring up at the face of a building, imposing in its institutional dullness. 
6B.    INT. LOBBY - BAINBRIDGE - DAY                               6B. A dim, sleepy cavern of a lobby. No one but a switchboard operator thumbing through a magazine. Echoing footsteps reach her station and she glances up and at the man from outside. i OPERATOR Yes? 
7.    INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY He seems uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the suit. Or the place. Or the situation. Or the hard straight-backed chair he's in. When he does finally speak, it's with great sincerity -- SAYER When you say people ... you mean living people,                 . Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems to wonder, As opposed to what? DIRECTOR Living people, yes.   Patients.

7.C0NT.                                                    7. There's some mistake. And Sayer's chair begins to feel more * uncomfortable. He tries to clear up the confusion - SAYER I ' m here for the research                                 * position . . . in your neurology                            * lab. DIRECTOR Neurology lab? He doesn't laugh at Sayer, just at the thought of it. DIRECTOR We have an x-ray room. Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- * natured smile, but doesn't really understand it. Kaufman seems * to have less time for this, and in plain English, unadorned -  * KAUFMAN - The-position-ds-Staff-^Neurologist.            . Sayer looks like a man who's just learned that everything he * knows about the world is wrong.         f DIRECTOR (pause) A doctor ... doctor. The Director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands, Sayer's resume. DIRECTOR The Camel Institute. Tell me                                * about that, anything with patients                          * there? Or . . .                                             * SAYER (burying it) Earthworms. The Director isn't sure he heard right. DIRECTOR Sorry?                               , SAYER It was an immense project. " I was trying to extract a decigram of myelin from four tons of earthworms.

(calling to someone down the hall) Dr. Sullivan. Staying on the old patient, he eventually manages, too late - OLD PATIENT Fn ... ie Down the hall in an alcove, Dr. Sullivan glances up long sufferingly from-a.patient~with'.an .Ouij a-board who !.s mumbling,          * complaining, unintelligibly. Anthony and Sayer arrrive. ANTHONY Dr. Sullivan, this is Dr. Sayer; There's a kind a "deadness" in Sullivan's eyes and voice; he's been here too long. SULLIVAN Not the neurologist, that'd be asking too much. You're not the neurologist. SAYER I think I am. Sayer extends his hand. Instead of shaking it - SULLIVAN Well, come on, Anthony, get him a coat for Christ's sake. - Sullivan thrusts his clipboard into Sayer's hand. 9.

Screaming louder at the sight of it, she tries to protect her face with her hands like a boxer being beaten senseless. 
v 11.   INT. DAYROOM (B) - DAY                                  11. A man in his sixties confronts Sayer with an announcement in a loud commanding voice - MALE PATIENT 1 X was born in I911f in Kinasbridae, New York. I came here in July of 1955. Prior to July of 1955. I resided a£ the Brooklyn Psychiatric Centerf Brooklyn. New York. Prior to thatP I was a person. And you. sir.- i Who the* hell >are.*v.ou?       . 
12.   INT. DAYROOM (C) - DAY                                     12. Stepping around a wheelchair, Sayer finds in it an elderly woman, nicely dressed, her hair done-up, a ribbon in it. Glancing at the chart in his hand - SAYER Mrs. Cohen? MRS. COHEN He·s here? She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she means. SAYER I 'm here. (pause) To examine you. MRS. COHEN Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My son's coming to take me home. 
(6   Confused, Sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers on the clipboard. Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her and crosses the room to a nurse. SAYER Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son. He's coming today? NURSE 1 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years. The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair. 13.    OMITTED                                    . v

REV. 10/13/89   p. 17 He glances around. Sees an orderly reading a newspaper. (P\   Borrows a section, returns with it, slides it under the pen and waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move. Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket, hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go. The man, lightning quick, catches it. 
25.   INT. ANOT HE R DAYRO OM ( B) - L ATE R - DAY                           2 5. 
Another man rigid as stone (FRANK). This one peering up at a television set with a horizontal hold problem. Sayer drags a chair over, stands       on it, adjusts the set, corrects it, gets a picture . . .      but the man's "attention" slowly drifts away. Sayer "read       justs" it, gets the jumping horizontal lines again, and the       man's vacant eyes return. 
26.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY                                . 26. Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs. It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness. Sayer considers her from all      angles as    one considers an abstract art piece that baff     les but in   trigues. Unlike the others, she's on her feet. A      nd unlike    the others, she seems, to Sayer, to have been headed      somewhere    before turning to stone again. He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that has arrested her progress. He moves the table. In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And another. And another before encountering and being "blocked" by an empty wheelchair. She stops. Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before mysteriously stopping again. Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her. Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost" (LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive. "At" Sayer.

Fingers on the keys of a baby grand piano that seems out of scale with Sayer's small living room. Wrapped in a robe, he plays a melody. fcuJ   All around him lay packing boxes, some empty, many not. The *^^    books are out at least - many of a medical nature, many others on nature itself,, botany, many first editions - two and three deep on shelves, on the floor, on tables, stacked on the couch - and chairs almost like figures of people.t

36.     INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - BAINBRIDGE - LATER - NIGHT                                              36.

REV.,12/5/89 (BLUE)       Pg.2 36'.CONT.                                                         36. Glancing up from files strewn across the table, Sayer shares a discovery with the janitor - SAYER They all survived encephalitis years before they came here. In the 1920' s . He taps a finger at the files - the patients' medical histories prior to admission - forms listing childhood diseases and ailments. The janitor, having no idea of course what he means, retreats with his pail and mop, closing the door. 36A. EXT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - ESTABLISH - DAY            36A. 37.   INT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - DAY                         37. Sayer displays what he has written on the back of his hand to an assistant librarian: NEJM 4-6-35. SAYER The New England Journal of Medicine, April 6th, 1935.                                    * 
38.   INT. MEDICAL LIBRARY - LATER - DAY    .                      38. A microfilm machine. Sayer manipulating its levers and eventually finding what he's after, an article titled: ENCEPHALITIS LETHARGICA, TEN YEARS LATER. Accompanying the text are grainy black and white photographs taken in an old operating theatre. An anatomical skeleton, a doctor in a white coat, subjects-- men, women and children with haunting eyes. 
Sayer waits for the old doctor to tell him the reasons, the data, to support the merciful truth. But he doesn't seem to possess it any more than Sayer does. Long silence before: OLD DOCTOR Because the alternative is unthinkable. 
40A. INT. DAYROOM (C) - DAY                     '                 40A. The hand of a stone-like woman catches the tennis ball while the rest of her remains absolutely still. Sayer gestures to Anthony, Okay, and the orderly wheels her out of the crowded room. 
4OB. INT. WARD 5 DAYROOM - DAY                   ·                4OB The hand of an otherwise still-life man snaps to catch the ball. Sayer nods to an orderly who wheels him out past younger patients, Ward 5's residents. i 
40C. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY                                          40C The ball glances off the face of a nan who turns in his wheelchair and glares at Sayer. SAYER Sorry.                                      . 
41.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY Sayer has assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has decided are post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a naturalist in a garden of stone. He lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient.   It remains suspended, doll-like. He tries to follow the trajectory of another's gaze.   It leads only to blank space. He considers another who appears "deeply involved" in some minute and curious activity with his twisted hands, a kind of tearing, shredding motion. .                       v Across the room, paying no attention to Sayer, are Sidney and Lolly. He's gently brushing her hair. Sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she "draws" a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on itself until it reaches a "vanishing point" in the center. 
42.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY                         42. The results of standard perception tests scotch-taped to a wall of the examination room. Sayer and Miss Costello, like visitors to a museum, consider each for a moment before moving onto the next. Printed in the left column of each are a circle, square, triangle and daisy. In the right are the post-encephalitics' failed "attempts" to copy them. 
REV. 10/13/83   p.26 Sayer keeps coming back to one in particular. Unlike the others which, if you use your imagination, vaguely correspond somewhat positionally to the pre-printed shapes, this one bears no resemblance. This patient has instead scrawled over the shapes, seemingly violently. Miss Costello joins Sayer and ponders it along with him. Eventually, as if to excuse it and its maker-- MISS COSTELLO It's different. SAYER Quite.   It's quite bad. Sayer keeps studying it. SAYER (more to himself) Did he fail to understand? Or was he unwilling to fail? He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses. SAYER Could he be saying, "I can't draw a triangle, don't make me"? (before she can respond:) Could it be willfully bad? She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading far too much into the "badness" of the patient's scrawl. To himself - SAYER Which one is this? He leans closer to see the typed name . . . 
MRS. LOWE 0.8. Something was wrong, they said, with his hands. He couldn't write anymore, he couldn't do the work, I should take him out of school, they said. He was eleven. They're in Leonard's old bedroom, Sayer and Mrs. Lowe. Except for the Western painting that's missing, nothing has changed in it in thirty years. 
CONTINUED: 
REV. 10/13/89   p.28A MRS. LOWE He slowly got worse. He'd be talking, suddenly he'd come to a stop. After a few seconds he'd finish what he was saying like nothing happened, but these standstills got longer. Sometimes he'd call to me and I'd come in and find him at his desk in a trance. An hour, two hours. Then he'd be okay again. 
CONTINUED: 
Sayer glances around the room.    It's been preserved, like a shrine. MRS. LOWE One day I came hone from work and found him in his bed, his arm like this, reaching. (pause) "What do you want, Leonard?" She pictures the moment in her mind, and waits, it seems, for the young Leonard to speak, to tell her what it is he wants. Finally she lowers her arm and shrugs. MR.S LOWE He never spoke again. It was like he'd disappeared. I took him to Bainbridge later that year. November fourteenth, 1937. He was twenty. Sayer glances away from her to the room itself again. SAYER What'd he do with himself, Mrs. Lowe, those nine years he stayed in this room? She smiles to herself, proudly it seems. MRS. LOWE He read.                        y 
45.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - BAINBRIDGE - DAY                   45 Leonard's face in shadow. Wires emerging from his scalp. A sluggish EEG pattern. A blinding flash from a strobe.suddenly lights up the room. The pupils of Leonard's eyes shrink, but his EEG remains stuporously slow. 
45A. EXT. RESEARCH LAB, NEW YORK - ESTABLISH - DAY              45A. 
50.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                                   50. Sayer alone in the examination room, tired, at its window staring blankly out. His perspective: The empty lot below littered with abandoned couches, refrigerators, rusting automobile carcasses. And beyond the lot, the elementary school playground. Laughing children on swings and slides. Jumping rope. Batting tether balls. Playing hopscotch. Moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games. On a girl tossing a bean bag into a square. Jumping over it and into the next square. Turning and jumping back. Balancing on one foot. Retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down again. Into the next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt. 
51.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY                                  51. From above, patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white checkerboard linoleum-tile floor like chess pieces. The pattern is regular to a point but then breaks up -- is interrupted by an area of solid white, where a wall once stood -- before being restored. It forms a kind of narrow "sea," the white area, on either side of which lies "land." 
At floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and knees, are "blacking in" the missing tiles with shoe polish, "bridging" the gap between the two checkerboards. The retarded patients around them ignore them. The ward nurses pretend to. ' Completing the pattern Sayer glances across the room to Leonard. He seems to be "watching." His mother, nearby, idly thumbing through a magazine as she brings Leonard up to date on neighborhood news, isn't. ·t,   . 
Sayer crosses to Lucy. Lifts her gently out of her chair. Points her in the direction of the drinking fountain. She begins to move. To step slowly over each tile. She reaches the "bridge" and hesitates. Then crosses it. 
REV. 10/13/89   p.34 Sayer doesn't know whether to applaud or cry. He does neither, burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead, and watches as Lucy, "delivered" to the other side, free now, lets the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain. She nears it. She is almost there. Then she is. there. But doesn't drink. Doesn't stop. She continues past it . . . To a window, the window bevond the drinking fountain which Sayer hadn't noticed before, had no reason to notice, had no need to notice, with a broken pane allowing a view to the outside. She stares out at the traffic below, in hopes no doubt of figuring out where she is. And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up, shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer. These people are alive inside. 
52.   INT. DAYROOM (B) - DAY A soap opera on a portable black and white TV in a narrow passageway of a nurses' station. Beyond.it, beyond a glass partition, a crowded idle dayroom. Miss Costello crosses into and out of view and reappears moments later next to the TV. She switches it off and turns to face the three RNs who were watching it. In their defense -- V NURSE The patients have all been given their morning medication. MISS COSTELLO Good. Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd have some free time. She hands a book to the nurse who spoke (MARGARET), a first edition worn /rom many readings. Margaret glances from it to the other nurses and back to Miss Costello.

Your Parkies - if that's what they are - haven't moved for decades. You know better than to make a leap like that, you want to believe there's a connection, that doesn't mean there is one. SAYER What I believe, what I know, is that these people are alive inside. KAUFMAN How do you know? Because they catch tennis balls? SAYER I know it. Sayer doesn't elaborate, but his tone is resolute. And it has the intended effect on Kaufman, causing him to consider the possibility that Sayer could, somehow, know it as a fact. KAUFMAN r..iiJi!                And what if this drug were to kill them? SAYER - (right back)              > And what if this drug were to cure them? Somewhere behind Kaufman's eyes Sayer can see, he thinks, a change, or reminiscence, long ago, long buried, of things he once believed or wanted to believe.

A standard consent form and pen on a kitchenette table. Two coffee cups. One used tea bag. SAYER People with ordinary Parkinson's Disease sometimes complain that they've "lost their grace . . . " (he picks up a cup with a shaking hand) They have to think about the things we just do . . . (with great "trouble" he sets it down) It has to do with a chemical in the midbrain, or rather the lack of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa replenishes this dopamine, making it possible for these patients to move more naturally. He picks up the cup again, gracefully, and sets it down. MRS. LOWE Leonard has Parkinson's Disease?

84.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY                                   84. Another empty milk glass. Leonard, stoic, or     so it seems, in his wheelchair. His mother and Sayer and Miss     Costello waiting for a movement, a change of expression, a sign    of any kind that something is happening inside him. But there's   nothing . . . 
85.   INT. BAINBRIDGE - NIGHT                                        85. A corridor. Mrs. Lowe is leaving.    Sayer is with her, seeing * her to the door. SAYER I'll call if there's any change. MRS. LOWE Yes. Neither really knows what else to say except for good night. She leaves. 
86.   INT. LEONARD'S WARD - NIGHT                                    86. Sayer and Miss Costello lift Leonard out of his wheelchair and into his bed. MISS COSTELLO I'm going home too. If you need me . · * SAYER Yes, I'll call. They nod "good night" atT each other and Miss Costello leaves. Sayer slumps into Leonard's wheelchair. lAnd waits. 
87.   INT. THE PHARMACY - NIGHT                                      87. Ray has gonejhome, too. Sayer, alone in the pharmacy, measures out 1000 milligrams, ten times the original dose. 
88.   INT. LEONARD'S WARD - NIGHT                                    88. Sayer at Leonard's bedside, holding the glass to Leonard's lips, draining the liquid into him, all of it.

STAFF CAFETERIA - LATER - DAY                            9 A tray of truly awful cafeteria food. The group, minus Sayer and Miss Costello, watches Leonard dip a fork into some mush- like concoction and manipulate it, with difficulty, to and into his mouth. He seems amazed by its flavor. LEONARD It's delicious. FERNANDO I wouldn't go that far, Len. Sayer and Miss Costello, at another table, glance over to the others who are all laughing. Sayer smiles. MISS COSTELLO I don't think I could deal with losing 3D years of my life. I can't even imagine it. 
REV. 10/13/89 p.53 Sayer's smile fades. The possibility that Leonard might not have realized the extent of the passage of time had not, until this moment, occurred to him. He stares blankly at Miss Costello. MISS COSTELLO He does realize it, doesn't he? Sayer nods uncertainly. SAYER He must. 
97.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY (NOTE: CONSULT SACKS ON THIS SCENE:) Sayer demonstrates a clapping motion. Leonard repeats it more slowly but with decent motor control. 
SAYER Splendid. Sayer makes a note. They are alone in the examination room which, like most of the hospital, has little in it to indicate that it is not the 1930's. SAYER Can I see you walk the length of the room?                        * Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there. Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended. He's not younjg anymore. 98.   OMITTED 99.   INT. LEONARD'S WARD - NIGHT                                 99. Sayer and Mrs. Lowe at Leonard's bedside.

SAYER . . . you'll sleep. And when you wake up in the morning, it will be the next morning. I promise. Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs. Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby. 
100.   INT. ROOM ADJACENT TO EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING                             100. Sayer comes in with some books, sets them on Miss Costello's desk and crosses to a closet. SAYER I didn't sleep, did you? MISS COSTELLO Does it look like it?                   . Sayer hangs up his jacket and slips into a lab coat. SAYER Do you know if Leonard's awake? v She smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room. 
101.   INT. THE EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING                                              101. Showered and shaved and groomed and bright-eyed, Leonard sits listening to his own heartbeat with Sayer's stethoscope. Coming in -- i      SAYER Good morning. LEONARD Good morning.     . His speech is still rather flat, halting., SAYER Been waiting for me long? LEONARD Yes. 
105.   INT/EXT. NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY                   105 A rose.       , Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance. He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly astonished by the tactile sensation. Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with, the purity or intensity Leonard can. Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of countless thousands of roses. 
106.   INT. SAYER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY                            106 Leonard turns the radio dial from the classical station to another playing a very different kind of music, and listens to it bemused but intrigued. It's John Lennon singing "A DAY IN THE LIFE" and it CONTINUES OVER: 
107.   EXT. PARK - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY                        107 Children playing flag-football on an expanse of grass. Dogs running around, nannies with prams, lovers. A disk, a frisbee, falls at Leonard's feet. He retrieves it but has no idea what it is or what to do with it. Sayer demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one. Leonard doesn't get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it pathetically not halfway back to its owners. The music CONTINUES OVER: 
108.   EXT. STREET CORNER JOINT - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY        108. Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine. He and Sayer are handed cones and Leonard's attention moves to a girl wearing an unbelievably short skirt. Her boyfriend stares at Leonard. Sayer tries to pull his charge's attention elsewhere. Leonard, finally, glances away, up, to a sound overhead. The music CONTINUES OVER: 
109.   EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY A 747 roaring down a runway. At the edge of it, it lifts off and thunders over Sayer and Leonard and the parked Toyota. Exhilerated, Leonard waves. The music CONTINUES OVER: 110.   OMITTED                                                    110 111.   EXT. THE BRONX / CITY ISLAND - DAY                         111 An expressway. The Toyota traveling at "astounding" speed, passing a sign that reads CITY ISLAND. 
R!V. 10/13/89   p.58 Boats and fish markets and lush vegetation. Paradise compared to the Bronx. The Toyota turns down a side road near the water         t and into the driveway of Sayer's small wooden house. w   '.·.                     .         ' And the mus ic ends. 
112.   INT. SAYER'S KITCHEN / DINING ROOM - DAY                       112. Tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter. Sayer, exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing boxes on the floor for crackers, cookies, something he can offer his guest. He keeps glancing in at Leonard, who's wandering around the dining room, navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the spines of books. Noticing Sayer watching - LEONARD You just moved here. SAYER Yeah. Well, five years ago.                                 , Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before            ; peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small             i framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a photography studio prop. LEONARD Your son? SAYER Me, actually. '      ,,"                     t LEONARD (looking closely at                              ' the photograph) You seem uncomfortable. SAYER I probably was. Sayer disappears into the kitchen again. And a moment later glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are neatly arranged.                   · SAYER Each has a specific purpose. 
He hadn't intended as impudent a tone as that which came out. More calmly ~ SAYER Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe. KAUFMAN I think you overestimate the effect Mr. Lowe has on people. We're talking about money here. Kaufman sips at his coffee and slowly becomes aware   of the silence around them. No one is talking. He glances    up as Miss Costello walks by setting something on the table in   front of him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word. 
CD   Kaufman glances down. She has left a Bainbridge payroll check )\cz> made out in her name. Kaufman turns it over. She has endorsed it back to Bainbridge Hospital. Fernando walks by and    out, leaving his salary check on the table. Then Ray, the    pharmacist, leaving his. Then the nurse who reluctantly read    "Moby Dick" to the patients. Then a cafeteria worker. A     secretary. A clerk. A janitor. The cafeteria is soon empty, except for Sayer and Kaufman. Long silence. 
116.   INT. BOARD ROOM - NIGHT                                    116 8mm film of Leonard before L-Dopa -- a wide shot of him absolutely motionless in his wheelchair. SAYER O.S. There was extreme rigidity of the axial musculature . . . only vague available motion in the neck . . . no voluntary movement in the limbs . . . A tight shot of Leonard's entranced face appears on the screen. SAYER O.S. Perhaps most striking was the profound facial masking -- which we now know should not have been confused with apathy.         * Tight on Sayer, the light from the projector flickering on his face. SAYER Virtually aphonic, Mr. Lowe could articulate no words, but rather only, with considerable effort, an occasional noise, a kind of, "h .. . " A                                      · In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note. "Less scientific" it reads. 
SAYER Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two. Sayer glances to Miss Costello.   She nods, "Good, that's better." SAYER The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death. Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one. SAYER This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the last 30 years. The "before picture" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the "after" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone. He glances up and off at something. LEONARD (FILM) Now? SAYER'S VOICE Whenever you're ready. LEONARD (FILM) My name is Leonard Lowe. It has been explained to me that I have been away for . . . quite some time . . . He seems to withdraw, to wrestle with the thought, to try to somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it. He nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera. LEONARD (FILM) I'm back. 
117.   INT. BOARD ROOM, LATER - NIGHT                            117 The lights are on, the screen rolled up, the board members and patrons visibly moved, almost shaken, and silent. Eventually one of the patrons, an old woman, reaches into her purse for her checkbook and a pen. Another patron, an elderly man, pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket pocket. Another already has hers out in front of her ... Sayer and Miss Costello exchange a glance. The room is absolutely silent, except for the muted scratch of pens on paper. 
118.   INT. THE PHARMACY - DAY The raw L-Dopa powder, 20,000 dollars worth, has arrived. It sits on a pharmacy counter in large clear bags. Sayer and Ray peer between racks of medicine at two teenage girls and two very old men chatting in a corner of the pharmacy. RAY They're volunteers from the   : neighborhood.

Though it's doubtful the man is even aware of her presence, she reads to him as if her were, and in the process, draws Leonard into the sound of her words until there are no sounds but her words: PAULA "Released from bondage and ridicule after seven destitute seasons, they raised the roof of Shea Stadium - while their fans attempted to dismantle it - in one of the loudest, wildest victory celebrations in baseball     : history - "         ._ The reverie is suddenly shattered, the real sounds of the hospital rising back up, as Sidney, wild with excitement, bangs through the far doors of the corridor.

He spots Sayer, seated with a woman, her back to him and the door. She slowly turns to look over her shoulder and, seeing Sidney, smiles. LOLLY Hi, Sidney. There's a kind of hush.

Something troubling has occurred to him. He looks to Sayer and whispers -- SIDNEY Is it real ... or . . . SAYER As real as real can be.

They're all wearing suits and dresses and walk with purpose past wheelchair-bound patients with "uninteresting" diseases.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST 
A battered sneaker tattooed with doodles of speeding cars and checkered flags and the words "Start Your Engines!" Beats up and down, a sewing machine needle of anxious, restless, adolescent energy. A pencil fills in the oval of a standardized test form, then hesitates, twitching with the speed of a humming bird wing caught between two fingers, then is quickly erased as a different answer is chosen. The form sheet is filled with smudges of uncertainty. A ten year old boy stares at the next question. 
TEST QUESTION 
Grace buys a bag of 240 jellybeans. There are 35 yellow ones, 52 red ones, 63 green ones, 26 white ones, 41 blue ones and 40 black ones. If Grace wants to eat one of each while keeping her eyes closed, what is the minimum number she will have to eat? 
His mouth tries to makes sense of the question but it's not working. 
He looks around at the other students quietly, diligently filling in their ovals while he fidgets, his leg beating, his pencil fluttering, a pot jiggling its lid, about to boil over. 
He reads the question again. Greek. Chinese. Meaningless. He looks up at the clock. The second hand sweeps towards the 12. Then back at the test. 
Something suddenly clicks. 
He stares at the clock, pencil poised, waiting until the second hand hits the 12 and he's off- Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could possibly be reading the questions. 
INT. TEACHER'S OFFICE - DAY - PAST 
Mrs. Racer sits across the desk from Speed's teacher. 
MOM 
DISTRACTED 
CONTINUED: 
TEACHER No, that's not exactly right. Your son seems to be interested in only one thing. Mom knows what's coming. 
TEACHER (CONT'D) All he talks about, all he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing. 
MOM Well you know, his father designs racing cars. 
TEACHER And where is your husband? 
MOM He's-working. He couldn't make it. 
TEACHER Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree. Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher glances back to her records. 
TEACHER (CONT'D) Is your husband's name Rex? 
MOM No, Rex is his older brother. Why? 
TEACHER This is the test he turned in last week. She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on. The bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out: 
"GO REX GO!" 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST 
Speed has finished filling in the test and is now drawing pictures in the corner of the test booklet. He is drawing little race cars,. He flips a few of the pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two cars collide. 
CONTINUED: He continues to draw as the background of the classroom fades to white behind him, becoming the black corner that he is drawing on. We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars battle each other heading for a photo-finish. Speed makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound as two cars try to block the Mach 5, smashing into one another as -- The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash, crossing the finish line still in the air. Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry, making the sound of the roaring crowd. The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees him lost in his fantasy world. A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning to watch him, a smile creeping across her face; there is no one in the entire school like him. The teacher is about to say something when the bell rings. Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up, in motion before anyone else. 
TEACHER Alright, pencils down, bring your 
TESTS-- Thwack! Speed slaps his down and is already heading for the door. 
TEACHER (CONT'D) --to my desk. Ham! The door slams open and Speed shoots out. 
TEACHER (CONT'D) Speed Racer, slow down! 
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Speed slides down the railing on his butt, a perpetual motion machine as he scans the street, smiling as he sees- Across the street, leaning against his hot rod, his big brother, Rex Racer. 
CONTINUED: He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool cars pass by. Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer. In this world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car collector show; vintage and concept cars are as ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world. Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc around the car, his little head sticking up like a shark fin circling until-- The car door pops open and snaps shut. The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a chance to move. He leans over and looks in the window. Speed smiles. 
REX .I take it you're ready to go? Speed nods. Rex climbs in beside him. 
REX (CONT'D) So, who was school? 
YOUNG SPEED Fine. Are you going to the track? Mom said you were. You don't have to drop me off, I could just go with you. 
REX No way. He starts the car and roadster growls to life. 
YOUNG SPEED Oh, come on, take me with you. Come on, please. 
REX I can't, Speed. Pops would kill me. 
YOUNG SPEED He doesn't have to know. I won't say anything. Nobody will know. Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease pleasepleasepleeeease. Rex sighs, knowing there's no way he can with this. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
EXT. TECH PIT 
Sparky smiles. 
SPARKY Great move, Speed. Careful on the butterfly coming up. You may wanna ease up-- 
SPEED Not this time, Sparky. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT 
Speed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a slot-guide in the track causing another crowd roar. They can feel that something special might be happening. 
EXT. TECH PIT 
Sparky checks his stop watch. 
SPARKY Holy canoli, Speed, You know who you're racing? 
CONTINUED: He can see him. 
SPEED Yeah... Just ahead, the ghost of his brother's car launches up the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the past. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST 
Rex drives the older model T-180, a man on a mission, dominating the race exactly like Speed. 
EXT. GRANDSTANDS 
Pops stands watching the race through binoculars Young Spped is beside him. 
YOUNG SPEED Rex's gonna win, ain't he, Pops? Pops checks his watch but almost can't believe it. He goes back to his binoculars. 
YOUNG SPEED (CONT'D) He's gonna win it. He's gonna set the course record. Nobody's gonna catch him. 
POPS Quiet, Speed! There's a lotta race to run. 
YOUNG SPPED No way. It's over. My brother's the best racer in the world. Everybody else is running for second. The cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel. 
EXT. CREW PIT 
Blackjack Benelli grabs one of the crew chief, knotting his fists in the fabric of the path-covered cover alts. 
BLACKJACK BENELLI I told you to take him out! 
CONTINUED: 
CREW CHIEF #1 We're trying, sir. He's just too fast. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY 
Rex blazes by, the track rattling like a metal roller- coaster, opening an even bigger lead. As we move around Rex's car, we see suddenly there is someone right behind him, a ghost car-- Speed. As Speed makes his move, he pulls us back into the present. 
INT. MEDIA ROW - PRESENT 
The buzz is palpable. 
LOCAL ANNOUNCER --it's unbelievable folks, no one's seen moves like this, since that remarkable night eight years 
AGO-- 
HAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER --there's no doubt in my mind, he's gunning for it-- 
AUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER --driving like a man possessed, a man haunted by his past--- 
CHINESE ANNOUNCER --a record that has stood for eight years set by.his,older-- 
FRENCH ANNOUNCER --he is not alone out there, he is chasing someone, he is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer-- 
EXT. GRANDSTANDS 
in the glass of Pop's binos we can see the dim reflection of the two brothers racing. 
CONTINUED: Pops stands beside Mom. He is still watching the race with his trusty binos though he is now a little older, plumper and balder.. He clicks his stopwatch, checking it at the same time that Sprittle checks his. Sprittle stands on the chair next to him. 
SPRITTLE Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He could really do it, couldn't he? Pops goes back to his binos. 
SPRITTLE (CONT'D) What if he does? What if he does it, Pops? 
POPS Sssh! 
SPRITTLE I don't know if I can watch this... He holds the binos as though afraid to look when-- A hairy hand comes in and takes them away. Chim-chim, sitting on the chair next to Sprittle, puts the binos to his eyes. Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing another cheer. Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young woman, standing on the other side of Pops, lowers her. Trixie chews at her lip, feeling a knot twist into her gut. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET- DAY - PAST 
The little girl wearing the pink barrette is walking with a pack of girls, their little mouths as sharp as razors. In the distance we hear a high-pitched motorized whine. 
BLONDE PACK LEADER My Daddy told me he used to work for the Mishida Motorwerks but he quit. 
(MORE) 
CONTINUED: 
BLONDE PACK LEADER (CONT'D) My daddy said that was a completely crazy thing to do. He says the whole family is crazy. 
SPEED I won't. He hugs his little brother, knowing it might be for the last time. 
INT. RACER LIVING ROOM 
Rex heads for the door but Pops is waiting for him. 
POPS So, you're quitting? 
REX I have to. 
POPS No you don't. This is a choice. You're selling out, walking away from everything we've built here. 
REX I'm done arguing with you Pops. He turns back towards the door. 
POPS Don't you walk away from me! 
REX You can't tell me what to do. It's my life to live. He takes hold of the doorknob. 
POPS If you walk out that door, you better not ever come back! The door slams in response. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT PRESENT 
Speed and the ghost of his brother cross, switching positions as the memories come faster and faster. 
INT. RACER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PAST 
Speed sits on the floor, glued to the television, 
ON watching a big race that Rex is in. Mom and Pops are the couch behind him. All of them sit in.a suspended state, a fist of tension squeezing the breath out of them. One the screen, is a cloud of smoke billowing from a tangle of metal. 
CONTINUED: 
RALLY ANNOUNCER (V.0.) Rex Racer riving the black and red Uniron car, got in a tangle with Richenhbach, who had been favored to win-- 
COLOR ANNOUNCER (V.O.) That was no tangle, he took Richenbach out-- 
RALLY ANNOUNCER We don't know that but I imagine the WRL will be reviewing this crash. 
COLOR ANNOUNCER That's the third DNF crash Racer's been involved in! Review it? Heck, the oughta just suspend him. 
POPS Turn it off, Speed! I don't want you watching this anymore. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT 
Speed tightens his grip on the wheel. 
INT. YOUNG SPEED'S BEDROOM 
Speed is hidden beneath the blankets, the sound of a small portable television barely audible. 
RACE ANNOUNCER Rex Racer almost took Yokima's head off wit that jump! 
RACE COMMENTATOR There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that Rex Racer is the dirtiest driver in the world. Lit by the soft glow of the small tv, Speed blinks and the first tears slip silently down his cheeks. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT 
His jaw locks, as he remains trapped between two different forces. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY - PAST 
Young Speed is clobbering a kid who is twice his size. A teacher finally pulls them apart. 
BIG MOUTH I just told him the truth! His crum-bum brother doesn't belong on a racetrack-- he belongs in jail! Speed tears free and torpedoes Big Mouth again. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT 
The two cars continue to dance around each other. 
INT. MEDIA ROW 
LOCAL ANNOUNCER --the trial of Rex Racer shook the World Racing League to tis very 
FOUNDATION--- 
HAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER --once a rat, always a rat and in my book Rex Racer's nuthin' but a 
RAT-- 
AUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER --the indictment brought down perennial racing powerhouse 
UNIROYAL-- 
CHINESE ANNOUNCER --Uniroyal was linked to the notorious fixer Blackjack Benelli-- 
FRENCH ANNOUNCER --still in prison to this day, Benelli was rumored to be behind the Casa Cristo tragedy-- The two cars swerve, heading for a collision as we cut-- 
INT. RACER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PAST 
Mom, Pops, Sparky, Trixie and Speed are all watching the race on the television. 
CONTINUED: Something happens and Mom drops her glass. It shatters but no one seems to notice. Young Speed is transfixed by the horror of what is playing out, the images of fire and flashing lights, reflecting in his eyes. 
CASA CRISTO ANNOUNCER This has to be one of the worst crashes I have ever seen-- 
INT. PARENTS BEDROOM 
Pops is doing his exercises in his gray sweats. 
INT. SPEED'S ROOM 
BEN Speed now sleeps in Rex's old room. The poster of Burns is still tacked to the wall above the bed. Mom opens the door. 
MOM Come on, Champ. Rise and shine. Breakfast's ready. to the Speed's hair.seems to remain asleep, still molded pillow as he tries to push himself up. 
SPEED .I'm up, I'm up. 
INT. KITCHEN 
THE Mom spatulas another short stack of pancakes from griddle and shovels them like coal into the blazing maw of a locomotive, dumping them onto the plates of Sprittle and Chim-chim. 
CONTINUED: They eat ravenously, trying to secretly steal food from each other's plates while Pops reads from the Racing News. 
POPS "It was a virtuoso display of talent, the likes of which has not been seen at Thunderhead since Racer the elder dropped jaws eight. years ago. Now, as we once again, pull our collective jaws up from the floor, we have to ask, will it be different this time, or will 
TRAGEDY-- 
MOM That's enough of that, Hon. Pops puts down the paper and Sparky picks it up. 
SPARKY I just can't believe there wasn't one mention of Racer motors in there. 
POPS That's because the Sponsors run the media, Sparky. Trixie enters through the back door. 
TRIXIE Mornin' everyone. Is Speed up yet? Speed stumbles in the door. 
SPEED .in spirit anyway. 
TRIXIE Hey superstar, did you see the papers? They're all in love with you. 
SPEED Really? He sits, grabbing the paper. 
SPARKY Yeah, but there sure is a lot of speculation about which team's going to pick him up 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SPEED .really? Speed starts to read and suddenly the room begins to rumble, glasses shaking, plates rattling. 
POPS What the--? 
SPRITTLE Earthquake! He and Chim-chim begin wailing in panic. 
SPRITTLE (CONT'D) Quick, under the table! Into the door-frame! 
POPS Sprittle calm down! 
SPEEED Pops the kitchen's the most dangerous room in a house during an earthquake! The whole table shivers and it seems the hanging ceiling light might shake free when the tremor begins to subside. Sprittle and Chim-chim, wearing a pot and a metal colander for protection, look around, expecting something bad to happen. The house becomes pin-prick quiet when-- The doorbell rings. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Pops opens the door to a face full of turbine exhaust from the private K-Harrier jet parked on their front lawn. On their doorstep is an extremely well dressed older man carrying a bouquet of flowers and box of cigars. His smile is as bright and shiny as a surgeon's scalpel. He says, "Good morning, Mr. And Mrs. Racer" but no once can hear him over the howl of the turbines. He gestures, asking permission to come in. Pops lets him by and closes the door, immediately reducing the noise. 
CONTINUED: 
WELL DRESSED MAN Mr. And Mrs. Racer, I hope you will forgive this imposition. He hands her the beautiful bouquet of flowers. 
WELL DRESSED MAN (CONT'D) These are Blue-belles from EDEN Inc. I'm told the will bloom at least three times, each time a different color. .Mom "ohhhs" her appreciation, while he hands over the box of cigars. 
WELL DRESSED MAN (CONT'D) And Mr. Racer these are for you, straight form the Isle of Kamut. Hand-rolled. Premium blend. They glance at each other, a bit takenaback. 
POPS Uh, thanks but... who are you? He seems to rise up an inch taller as he introduces himself. 
WELL DRESSED MAN I am E.P. Arnold Remmingtonton Esquire, President and Chairman of Remmington Industries and it is my honor to meet you both. He reaches for Pops' free hand. 
REMMINGTON Mr. Racer, I have been an ardent admirer of your work for years. I remember the first time I saw the prototype for the Mach-1, I told everyone that it didn't belong on a race track, it belonged in an art museum. Pops chuckles. 
POPS Yeah, she was a beaut. 
REMMINGTON No, sir. She was a revelation. He suddenly smells the pancakes. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) Oh, dear. I interrupted your breakfast. Is that pancakes, I smell? 
MOM Are you hungry, Mr. Remmington? 
REMMINGTON A figure like mine requires constant attention, Mrs. Racer. 
MOM Do you like pancakes? 
REMMINGTON When I was a child we used to say, "pankuken zin liesben." Neither of them speak German. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) Pancakes are love. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Remmington stuff another forkful into his mouth and moans his appreciation. Sprittle and Chim--chim sit on either side of him, their gunsel eyes train on his every move. 
REMMINGTON Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer. Superb density. Hints of vanilla. Cinnamon. Absolutely gorgeous. 
GENNIE Hi, Speed. Welcome to Remmington. He shakes her hand while she signals to another man who immediately begins scanning speed with an electronic measuring device. 
SPEED What's this? 
REMMINGTON To make an informed decision you'll need to understand how we take care of our drivers. The tailor finishes quickly as an electric cart, the kind designed for a group tour pulls up. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) All abroad. 
SPRITTLE Cool!. They climb on and the driver pulls into the tramway. 
INT. TRAMWAY 
These well lit hallways are extra wide with lots of colored guide lines on the floor like. in a hospital. 
CONTINUED: There are a lot of signs, directional and advertisements hawking the widely varied Remmington products. The red lines lead to doors emblazoned with "Restricted Access." There is a fair bit of hustle and bustle, like a busy street as golf carts, seg-ways and motorized scooter zip to and fro. No one walks. 
REMMINGTON Remmington Tower is the crown jewel among the properties that I control. It functions as the corporate headquarters for he top twelve divisions of our parent corp. One big industries family. The turn a corner heading for a large set of doors with the double "R" logo of Remmington Racecars. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) Of all the 143 companies that I control, none of them is as dear to my heart as the T-180 division. The door opens as they enter--- 
INT. REMMINGTON CAR MUSEUM 
Cars from the golden Age through to the present surround the pathway, dangling in midair or mounted in situ- dioramas, each carefully lit with spotlights like works of art or precious gems. 
REMMINGTON I've always felt that it is impossible to peer into the window of Tomorrow without a clear view of the Past. 
SPRITTLE That's the Crystal Horse with the Apache Super--Charger! 
REMINGTON Winner of the Grand Prix in '69, ' 70 and '73. 
CONTINUED: 
SPRITTLE No. Wrong. '72. '71 was the Vundervopper with the K-2 twin turbine and '73 was the Kenobe Motorstar re-built with a VC ;triple chamber. Remmington considers arguing. 
SPEED Don't bother. He's never wrong. They pass out of the museum. 
INT. TRAMWAY 
The hall widens allowing a special lane that leads out onto an observation deck that over looks the main T-180 factory. The bank of windows overlooks the enormous facility. It is a state of the art assembly line that rises vertically, instead of horizontally. The chassis arrives at the bottom and is born up by a mechanical arm, rotating as each platform assembles the next piece. The far wall is nothing but glass providing a sun- drappled_vista of Cosmopolis. 
REMINGTON Our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world. From initial carbon bond to finished car in 36 hours. How long does it take at Racer Motors? 
SPARKY Several weeks at least. Remmington turns to Pops. 
REMINGTON This kind of production facility could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer. The cart motor hums and slides back onto the tramway. 
INT. ENERGY-CELL THEATRE 
The next viewing stage is a window into the vacuumed- sealed laboratory where they construct the "engine" that powers the T-180's turbine. It looks like an operating theatre with several robotic arms and a cluster of auto-surgeons operating inside sealed perspec chambers. 
REMMINGTON This is our operating theater where our patented Refusion Energy Distributor Network is installed in the turbine drive. Sparky's eye light up. 
SPARKY Is that an inner-positive transponder? 
REMMINGTON It is indeed. Sparky shoots a look at Pops. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) We control the only transponder foundry in the world outside of Mushi Motors in Taiobi. The window suddenly turns into a mirror. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) Oops. Sorry. Trade Secrets. 
INT. TRAMWAY 
The cart arrives at an elevator station, and the driver presses a signal control the doors opening immediately. 
INT. ELEVATOR 
The driver punches in a floor and door direction code (north, south, east, west) and the elevator begins to rise while the dais in the floor begins to spin aligning them with a different door. 
CONTINUED: 
REMMINGTON Now, I'll take you up to the Team Remmington training facility. The west door opens and the cart glides out into a new tramway which is not as industrial feeling as the first one, decorated with a vinyl wainscotting and slightly up- graded lights. The higher you go in the Remmington Tower, the nicer the halls are decorated. 
INT. TRAINING AQUARIUM 
The cart glides by a series of windows that reveal the rigorous training systems invented to test the drivers. The first is a multi-level, state-of-the-art fitness facility in which the far wall again looks out into Cosmopolis. Beyond the standard health club fare, there is a Martial Arts gymnastics group in a standing pyramid. There is also a range of strange devices ranging from the retro steamer boxes, medicine balls and vibrating belts to the hyper-modern triple axis gyro harness. 
REMMINGTON As you know, a T-180 driver's got to be in peak physical condition. Across from the gym is a smaller window where the typical anaerobic test is being conducted on a female driver. She is running on a treadmill with lost of wires hooked up to her while several doctors not their approval at the read- outs. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) No expense is spared to make sure that when our driver's suit up they are as perfectly tuned as the machines they are controlling. The next window is a massive centrifuge; a huge mechanical arm whipping around a small capsule that blasts past the window. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) The best driver must be able to withstand over 4-Gs of force in a typical race. 
CONTINUED: On the opposite wall is the vibration chamber. A man is strapped to a chair that is vibrating so hard you expect his eyeballs to rattle out. The next window is an underwater tank where a man is driving in a mock up cockpit, executing peddle maneuvers and gear shifts. 
REMINGTON (CONT'D) The will to win is nothing without the will to prepare and at Team Remmington we prepare our drivers for any eventuality and every possible condition. The final window is the weather chamber where a driver is again in a mock cockpit, blue-lipped and shivering while snow and wind buffet him. 
INT. ELEVATOR 
The doors open and the craft glides in. 
REMMINGTON I hope I didn't care you, Speed with how hard we push our team. I just wanted you to see how serious we are committed to winning. 
SPEED I get that. 
SPRITTLE .it doesn't seem fair that I get in trouble, when they always start it. 
SPEED It's not fair. But that's what bullies do. They make the world unfair. 
SPRITTLE That sucks. 
SPEED Yes, it does. 
SPRITTLE What can I do about it? 
SPEED You ignore 'em when you can, fight 'em when you can't. 
SPRITTLE Those choices suck too. 
SPEED Yeah, but just try to keep one thing in mind. 
SPRITTLE What? 
SPEED Bullies come and go but a family can torture you forever. Chim-chim gives Sprittle a wet-willy. 
SPRITTLE Heeeeeey! Speed laughs as Chim-chim howls and then puts his arm around Sprittle. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SPEED But no joke, you just say the word, little brother and we got your back, right Chim-chim? Chim-chim grunts. 
SPRITTLE Thanks guys. 
INT. REMMINGTON INDUSTRIES T-180 FACTORY 
Remmington watches a GRX rolling off the assembly line. With him is Mr. Mushi, a businessman with eyes as sharp as broken glass. 
REMMINGTON The new GRX has a super charged inner-positive transporter and will be capable of speeds in excess off 800 kilometers an hour. Mushi nods. 
MUSHI If such a car were to win the Grand Prix this year, one would expect the demand for transponders to increase dramatically. 
REMMINGTON One would expect. 
MUSHI And if a single company gained control of all the transponder foundries in the world, one might expect that company to do very well for itself. 
REMMINGTON You know what I want and I know that for the last few years you have been trying to buy out your main rival Tetsua Okamoto. The question is, can we make a deal? The car rotates, rising up on its mechanical arm, a cybernetic giant, exercising its might. 
CONTINUED: 
MUSHI Deliver Okamoto at that price and the Taiobi Transponder foundry is yours. 
REMMINGTON Done. Remington smiles as they shake hands. 
INT. MACH 5 
Speed and Trixie lie with seats all the way back, 
CAR- watching the sinking sun tye-dye the sky behind the scape of freeways. 
TRIXIE You're really considering signing with Remmington. 
SPEED I just said it was tempting. 
TRIXIE Why? 
SPEED Well, they got a really good team.. Cannonball Taylor, Markie Manifold. They win a lot of Majors. 
TRIXIE Since when did winning become so important? 
SPEED It is important. You gotta win if you want to keep driving and that's what I want to do. It's the only thing I really know how to do. When I'm driving, I feel like that's the only time my life makes sense. She moves closer to him. 
TRIXIE You mean, this doesn't make sense to you? 
SPEED Okay, besides being with you. 
CONTINUED: 
TRIXIE So you like being with me? 
SPEED You know I do. 
TRIXIE Sometimes I do, sometimes I'm not so sure. 
SPEED What? 
TRIXIE Sometimes around your family, you seem distant, not like this and I wonder why. 
SPEED Come on, you know how I've felt about you since I was ten years old. 
TRIXIE I guess so, I just wish you weren't so shy about it. 
SPEED What do you want me to do? Kiss you in front of everyone at the end of a big race? 
TRIXIE Would that be so terrible? 
SPEED I don't know. Maybe we should practice first. 
TRIXIE Maybe we should. They start to kiss when they hear a muted voice. 
Candy wrappers are scattered everywhere as they lay motionless in an overdose coma. When they hear someone coming Sprittle manages to lift his head and crawl to the window. 
CONTINUED: A cleaning man is rising up on a cherry picker with a cart full of cleaning supplies. 
SPRITTLE Uh-oh. He looks back at their mess. 
SPRITTLE (CONT'D) jig's up. A moment later the door opens and the cleaning man enters.. 
CLEANING MAN Holy cooly: He grabs for his radio. 
CLEANING MAN (CONT'D) Hey, this is Marvin down at the landing pad. I think we got mice again. As he talks, two shadows slip quietly out the door behind him. 
INT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE 
Speed realizes that this is the threshold. 
SPEED This isn't an easy decision for me, Mr. Remmington. For my family, racing is everything. We eat, drink, think and breathe racing. There is nothing more perfect than a picnic at Thunderhead. I mean, I was taught to drive before I could walk. But when my brother died, all that went away. I can't tell you how painful that was. It nearly killed all of us. Especially Pops. He didn't set foot in his shop for over a year. As the memory comes to life, we see the images in flashback. 
CONTINUED: 
SPEED (CONT'D) But one night when I was still pretty young. I couldn't sleep and I went into the living room and there was Pops, in his beat up robe, watching some old race recordings. The blue tv light of Speed's memory fills his eyes. 
SPEED (CONT'D) So I sat with him watching of Ben Burns coming round the last turn of he '43 Prix and all of a sudden Pops started screaming, and then I started screaming, and as Burns and Dugazi duked it out, heading for the finish, we were cheering our heads off and the second the black and white came down, we looked at each other and right there we realized the naked truth; racing is in our blood. Flashback ends. 
SPEED (CONT'D) But for Pops, it isn't just a sport. It's way more important than that. It's like a religion and in our house, the Major Sponsors are kinda like the devil. The coldness in Remmington's eyes belies his smile. 
SPEED (CONT'D) I don't mean to offend you sir and I do appreciate your offer, it's just, I guess I understand his -point of view and after all we've been through, I don't think this kind of deal is for me. Remmington chuckles. 
REMMINGTON You poor, naive, chump. He chuckles again. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that load of sickening schmaltz and I am going to give you a bit of an education. At the end of it if you're smart, you'll thank me and hen you'll sign that contract. 
INT. TRAMWAY 
Sprittle and Chim-chim are joy riding in the maintenance cart, weaving back an forth, wiping people out. Chim-chim screams with glee. 
INT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE 
They stand before an enlarged black and white photograph of five tycoons, smoking cigars, dressed in turn of the century tycoon finery, their well-fed faces bright with fatuous, self-satisfied smiles. 
REMMINGTON Look. There is the true spirit of the golden age of racing. Benjamin Braddack, Diamond Dave Tweksbury, Reginald White, Oliver Potter, and George Wheeler. The five most powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century. As he talks we flash back to jittery old footage and photographs of the golden era. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) For all intensive purposes they created the modern automotive industry. But the true stroke of their genius was the invention of the WRL, the world's first racing league. Remmington leads Speed past several personal mementos including the first motor of his first car, the first milk bottle from victory lane,.a black and white from an important race. In front of an enlarged picture of Ben Burns from the infamous '43 Prix is a twisted and scorched piece of metal set on a pedestal like a gorgeous piece of art.

REMMINGTON (CONT'D) Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the '43 Prix. One of the great finishes in the history of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Dugazi slugging it out, but who remembers Carl Potts? Driving a rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne . Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF. A forgettable and pathetic finish. So bad, that afterwards Iodyne stock dropped six points. Again we see the history told in flashback. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling cold fresh milk in victory lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a twelve point gain which immediately block Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a complete take-over. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of Iodyne Inc. in the exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that immediately sent Iodyne into the gains record book-- the only record book that matters. Look out that window, there isn't a single plane or helicopter or K- Harrier that isn't powered by Iodyne fuel cells. That's what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars, or drivers. All that matters is power and the unassailable might of money. His greed is as tangible as any drug. 
INT. TRAMWAY 
A security guard glides out of one of the red secured area doors on a segway. 
CONTINUED: His radio buzzes "perps last seen tramway four, driving a maintenance cart." The doors start to close when Sprittle and Chim-chim jump out and sneak inside. 
INT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE 
Speed doesn't want to hear any more of this, but, Remmington is far from done. 
REMMINGTON Do you understand? Burns knew he was going to win. It was already decided. A week before the Prix, Goldman and Sirrus met with several other major players at the Carlyle Hotel. They met there as they had for years, just as their fathers had met, and as their sons and heirs will still meet. They met to negotiate the finish order of the Grand Prix. No race is more important and no race is more controlled. That year Goldman was supposed to win, but he knew if he sold his win to Sirrus, whatever that win might be worth, was nothing compared to what could be gained. He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) That's why I paid three million dollars for this burnt and twisted piece of metal. Because it reminds me of what really matters. This is the true heart of racing boy! This is my religion! Speed is aghast. 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) You don't know how many times I have seen that same cow-eyed "say it isn't so" look of disbelief. Every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly like you do now. I won't bother proving it to you. 
CONTINUED: 
REMMINGTON (CONT'D) If you walk away from me, if you walk out of.this deal, you'll know how true it is soon enough. So, last chance. What's it going to be, Speed? Your father's little fantasy bubble? Or are you going to join the rest of us adults, here in reality? 
INT. TRAMWAY 
Several technician carts and trollies carrying auto parts pass by a single lab technician who staggers, drunkenly up to a red restricted area window. Sprittle peaks out of the lower half of the lab coat, Chim-chim wearing the helmet, balances on his shoulder. In the window they see a lab where they are testing a "spear---hook;" a secret attacking device that shoots out from one car and grabs hold of the undercarriage of another car. As they realize what they are looking at, a security goon comes gliding up behind them on his seg-way. 
INT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE 
Speed hands him the brown paper bag. 
REMMINGTON What's this? He looks and sees the shoes and suit. 
SPEED If that's your idea of racing, you can keep it. 
REMMINGTON Listen to me and listen good kid, because I'm going to give you one more history lesson. You're going to go to Fuji-- In quick, collage cuts we see -- 
EXT. FUJI HELEXICON 
A gorgeous blimp shot of the race track which takes up an entire island of Hawaii-like archipelago. The track weaves in and out of the lush tropical landscape set against the ocean shimmering with sequins of sunlight. 
EXT. STARTING LINE 
Speed grips the steering wheel, revving the engine which rattles the car like thunder shaking the sky as-- The countdown finishes and as the cars explode forward, we cut back-- 
MIND-- He starts to take out his card. 
POPS Keep your card, Chief Inspector. 
CONTINUED: (3) Speed looks at Pops, then realizes that Racer X is staring straight at him. 
EXT. INSPIRATION POINT - NIGHT 
It is raining, the cockpit bubble smeared with the distant traffic lights. 
SPEED And the way he was looking at me, I don't know...I just gotta do something. 
TRIXIE But Pops will never let you go. 
SPEED He won't if I ask him. 
TRIXIE Speed Racer what are you thinking? 
SPEED You weren't in Remmington's office, Trix. You don't know what it was like. It felt as though he had his hand inside my chest and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to me. 
TRIXIE I hate him. I'm picturing his heart clogging with cholesterol right now. 
SPEED No joke, Trix. If you could have been in that room, you'd want to do anything you could to take this guy down. She looks straight into his eyes and he doesn't have to say anything else. 
TRIXIE All right. Let's do it. You're going to need an alibi. We'll say we're going skiing. 
SPEED What? No way! 
CONTINUED: 
TRIXIE You're going to need my help. Casa Cristo is a rally. I can spot from a 'copter. 
SPEED Trixie, this isn't a game. These people play rough. 
TRIXIE I know. That's why I'm coming with you. And if you even try to argue with me, I'll tell Pops right now and he won't let you out of his sight. 
SPEED You would, wouldn't you? He looks into her eyes and knows the answer. 
SPEED (CONT'D) Well...I guess we're going skiing. She smiles. 
INT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE 
Remmington sits surrounded by the legal equivalent of knights, bishops and rooks while Mr. Mushi sits across from him supported by his own retinue. Behind them, Cannonball Taylor blasts through the test course fast enough to coax a low rumble from the sound barrier. 
REMMINGTON As I'm sure you're aware, the Okamoto stock fell another four points yesterday. In the next few days it will hit bottom and they will have to sell. The car roars through its elliptical path like a circling electron binding the two tycoons together. 
MUSHI This could be a most profitable year for Remmington. Remmington can't hide the glow. 
CONTINUED: 
REMMINGTON Mushi won't do too badly either. Mushi nods. Cannonball circles, everything in apparent harmony until Gennie leans in and whispers. 
GENNIE. I know this is terrible timing sir, but I've just received confirmation of several last minute entries to the Casa Cristo 
REMMINGTON Who? 
GENNIE You're not going to like it.

JOHNNY Most of the T-180 drivers wouldn't come near it. 
ANNOUNCER But you look today, we've got some major names like Millie "the mouse" Manno, Snake Oiler and Katsu Okamoto as well as the young rising star Speed Racer. Not to mention, the shadow that seems to hang over every major race these days, the masked racer that some fans call the Harbinger of Boom. What's your take on Racer X? 
CONTINUED: 
JOHNNY Obviously he is an extremely talented and disciplined driver. 
INT. RACER DEN 
Sprittle and Chim-chim are settling in on the couch; a big bag of potato chips and ice filled glasses of coke. The Casa Cristo is about to begin. 
POPS Sprittle! Faster than a blink Sprittle grabs the remote and changes the channel to "Unser Charly," a German sitcom starring a monkey. 
POPS (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
SPRITTLE Just watching a little TV, Pops. Pops looks at the TV suspiciously, then back at his son. 
SPRITTLE (CONT'D) It's his favorite show. 
POPS It's in German!

CRUNCHER Enough! I can't stand the whining! 
VINNY Like a baby needing its diaper changed. Snake works his jaw looking for the right comeback. 
CRUNCHER It's simple. We have a team of wild cards. The problem is these wild cards are better drivers than you. 
SNAKE Like hell they are! 
CRUNCHER Prove it. Take out Katsu. The other two will quit. 
CONTINUED: Snake seethes. 
SNAKE You just watch me. Come on! He and his boys storm out, slamming the door behind them.

TRIXIE Speed! Wham! Billy slams up against him-- Throwing a lever, a grappler locks on to the Mach 5. 
SPEED He's got me! I'm locked up! Another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved blade begins stabbing at Speed's tires. Racer X watches unable to leave Katsu unprotected. Speed hits the D button and the zircon saw blades start gliding through the grappler. 
RACER X Get out of there! - 
SPEED I'm trying! The knife slashes the tire which explodes just as the grappler is cut-- Speed flips away free, hitting the "C" button causing a new tire to inflate while he's upside down-- Landing on a new tire, without missing a beat. Tyrus rushes into the opening, but this time it's Katsue who works a hidden lever and-- A Katana-like blade flashes, a samurai slash across the front tire-- Bowing it out, flipping the entire car, which tumbles back straight at Speed, forcing him to try a split-jack

CASS JONES This year marks a new record as the Grand Prix will be broadcast in eighty-four different languages. The camera pans. over the multitude of ethnic broadcasters. 
CASS JONES (CONT'D) Just gets bigger every year, doesn't it Ben? 
BEN BURNS Seems like it. 
INT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE 
The elite hobnob, champagne flutes flashing between feathered hats and waxy smiles. The Okamotos raise their glasses to Mushi. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES We've got an incredible lineup this year. Some major competition. We got a few fan favorites like the Gray Ghost, Sonic "Boom-boom" Renaldi and Prince Kabala. We got perenial powerhouses like Nitro Venderhoss, Gary "Gearbox" Kalinkov, and Mori Minimoto. 
BEN BURNS Not to mention C ball. 
CONTINUED: 
FUJI ANNOUNCER Cannonball Taylor, fastest Grand Prix seed in history, driving the new ORX from Remmington Racecars. 
BEN BURNS She looks mighty tight. 
FUJI ANNOUNCER. There is an odd numbered field today, nineteen, one shy of a full boat as Katsu Okamoto declined his automatic invitation after winning the Casa Cristo. 
BEN BURNS Hey there's something going on down there. 
CASS JONES We're seeing some kind of commotion down at the trailer entrance. 
EXT. TRAILER ENTRANCE 
A large group of security officials are gathered, staring at the invitation in Speed's hand. One of them starts to shake his head when he hears-- 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR Is there a problem here, officer? 
TNT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE Remmington is in his element, everything seeming to go exactly as planned until Gennie comes up behind him and whispers in his ear. 
GENNIE Sir, we have a problem. 
INT. RACE OFFICIAL'S ROOM 
The doors burst open as Remmington charges in. His eyes flash as though seeing ghosts when confronted by the entire Racer clan. 
REMMINGTON What madness is going on here? 
CONTINUED: 
SENIOR RACE OFFICIAL Mr. Remmington, this is a legitimate invitation. We have verified it. 
REMMINGTON Where did you get that? 
SPEED I was on the Okamoto team remember? I won it fair and square. 
REMMINGTON This is preposterous! He can't be allowed to race. It's too late. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR The ruling on this is quite clear. Try to stop it and you'll be in blatant violation of the WRL charter, leaving me no option but to shut this years Prix down until a full investigation can be completed. 
REMMINGTON What?! Do you have any idea what that would cost? Are you insane? 
PLAYBOY/RACER X Can I help? Speed suddenly notices the red trim of his tuxedo and his red tie. He looks down and heaves a sigh of relief. Red socks. 
INT. PLAYER'S TUNNEL 
Speed rushes out of the darkness of the tunnel into the brightly colored, awe-inspiring venue that is the Grand Priz Coliseum. There is a dizzying onslaught of giant advertisements and jumbotrons while the enormous crowd roars in lapping waves like the surrounding ocean. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES There he is now, Speed Racer, perhaps the biggest wild card in Grand Prix history. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX STARTING LINE 
Floating camera blimps seem to hover everywhere including right next to Speed-- Catching him unawares with a gaper's mouth. The image of Speed looking overwhelmed is immediately broadcast onto the jumbotrons eliciting a laugh from the crowds. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX GRANDSTANDS 
Trixie sees Speed on the big screens. 
TRIXIE Look! There's Speed! 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES Speed Racer gets his first eyeful of the Coliseum. 
CONTINUED: 
BEN This ain't Kansas baby! 
EXT. STARTING LINE 
The gorgeous Prince Kabala struts for the crowd while a team of beautiful female mechanics push his jewel encrusted car into place. He sees Speed helping Sparky push the Mach 5 into place. 
PRINCE Hey, mouth-breather, get used to 
THIS-- He shows Speed his ass. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) 'Cause that's what you're going to be looking at all day! Speed tries to ignore him and the other driver's staring at him like a fox staring at a chicken. 
SPARKY Howya feelin'? Speed takes a breath as he dares to look around again. 
SPEED .it's big. 
SPARKY Hey, this cockpit is the exact same size it was at Thunderhead. 
SPEED Right. 
SPARKY Just wanted to say, thanks, for what could be the most exciting moment of my life. 
SPEED Couldn't have gotten here without you. He hugs him. 
CONTINUED: 
SPARKY I'm looking forward to that cold milk. 
SPEED Me too. Speed climbs in as the speaker system blares-- 
FEMALE ANNOUNCER VOICE Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. The engines erupt, crashing against the waves of the roaring crowd but-- Inside the Mach 5 everything goes completely silent. Nothing exists now for Speed except the track as he loses all separation between himself and his car. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes as the countdown begins. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES The final countdown has begun and a stillness has fallen over this stadium as all eyes turn to one car. 
BEN BURNS This ain't a race. It's a showdown. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX 
Again we cut to the many varied expressions of anticipation: Trixie, Mushi, Okamoto, Sprittle, and Chim- chim, Katsu and Horuko, Mom and Pops, Remmington and Racer X who no longer has any socks, until-- The gun sounds-- The cars become bullets hurdled forward, except for the car in front of Speed which barely moves blocking his 
PATH-- He tries to avoid it but can't, rear-ending him while the car behind him slams into the back of the Mach 5. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES Trouble at the start, a misfire traps Speed Racer, causing a 
COLLISION-- 
BEN BURNS Uh-oh. Look out! 
EXT. GRAND PRIX STARTING LINE 
A car to the side swerves aiming straight at Speed who manages at the last second a slip-jack jump-- Flipping over the car as it slams into the pile-up while-- Speed guns his engine in the air so that when he hits the track there is a scream of burning rubber and the Mach 5 rockets out of the start to the cheering crowd. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES I don't know how he got out of that one-- 
BEN BURNS That-kid's wiley. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK 
The first lap of the Grand Prix is Ben Hur brutal as car after car takes a shot at Speed but-- He uses their aggressiveness throwing them into each other-- Littering the track with flaming debris and bouncing cocoons. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
INT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE 
Remmington relaxes as Speed falls further off the leader pace. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX GRANDSTANDS 
Sprittle understands immediately what is going on. 
SPRITTLE That cheater! He's using a spear hook! SPEAR HOOK! SPEAR HOOK! The surrounding crowd becomes uncomfortable. 
POPS Sprittle, we don't know that. 
SPRITTLE I do! Cannonball Taylor is nothing but a big cheater! 
EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK 
They exit the butterfly turn and head into the slalom, both drivers fighting hard to force the other into the onrushing concrete pylons. The paint is scraped first from the outside of the Mach 5 and then the GRX as they barely avoid one pylon and then another, neither car gaining an advantage until-- The Mach 5 begins to rattle, the stronger GRX taking advantage as they head for the final pylon--- Where the camera that is broadcasting the two cars onto the jumbo-tron is positioned. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
BEN BURNS This is going to be ugly. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK 
At the last second, Speed hits the two outside jacks causing both cars to rise up onto the two outside wheels of the GRX-- Revealing the undercarriage and the hidden spear hook to the camera. The crowd gasps. 
SPRITTLE Told you so! Chim-chim high fives him. 
SPRITTLE (CONT'D) Cheaters never prosper! 
EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK 
The Mach 5 flips down, pancaking the GRX, while the Mach 5 crashes free, leaving the exposed spear hook to hang limply from the front of the GRX. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES Cannonball clearly using a spear hook. 
BEN BURNS That could cost him the Hall of Fame. 
CASS JONES Not to mention what it might do to Remmington Industries. 
BEN BURNS Shame on them. 
INT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE 
People begin drifting away from Remmington as he feels the walls close in around him. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK 
switch but Speed tries to start the Mach 5. He hits the the starter only grinds. 
EXT. PIT STOP 
SPARKY Oh no, come on, don't do this. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX GRANDSTANDS 
Pops watches through his binoculars. 
POPS Don't quit on us now baby. 
INT. GRAND PRIX LUXURY BOXES 
Racer X is watching with Minx. 
RACER X Careful. Listen to it. Don't kill the starter. 
EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK 
Speed takes a deep breath and it seems the entire stadium takes it with him. He closes his eyes and tries to listen to the car. 
SPEED What do you need? Something makes him put the car in second gear. He steps on the accelerator, then hits the starter and--- And the Mach 5 roars to life. The crowd screams to the wail of burning rubber. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES He's back in it, but less than a lap and a half, I don't know what kind of chance he has. 
BEN BURNS Come on kid! Move it! 
EXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK 
The red socks flash as Speed stomps on it, jamming the accelerator to the floor. He's a half-lap behind the entire field but every eye in the stadium is on the white and red streak of lightening as it-- Thunders by, rattling the elaborate lace work of concrete and steel-- Gaining, inch by inch, foot by foot. 
INT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE 
People abandon the televised images, wanting to watch this miracle, to see it with their own eyes. 
INT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH 
CASS JONES Look at the split! He's shattering the lap record. 
BEN BURNS Don't mean a thing without those checkers.

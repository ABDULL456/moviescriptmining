Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice. 
YOUNG KRISTOFF Faster, Sven! 
EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT 
Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They hide behind a rock and peek out. 
Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds the still unconscious Anna. 
KING Please, help. My daughter! 
Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them. It looks as though they'll be crushed! 
But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then unfold, revealing bright faces. 
YOUNG KRISTOFF Trolls...? 
The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA. 
BULDA Shush. I'm trying to listen. 
She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both. 
BULDA (CONT'D) Cuties. I'm gonna keep you. 
Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth. They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but determined. He nods respectfully to the king. 
GRAND PABBIE Your Majesty. (referring to Elsa) Born with the powers or cursed? 
KING Born. And they're getting stronger. 
Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She does. He examines her. FROZEN - J. Lee 
GRAND PABBIE (about Anna) You are lucky it wasn't her heart. The heart is not so easily changed, but the head can be persuaded. 
KING Do what you must. 
GRAND PABBIE I recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe.... But don't worry, I'll leave the fun. 
Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in her head. 
GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D) She will be okay. 
YOUNG ELSA But she won't remember I have powers? 
KING It's for the best. 
PABBIE Listen to me, Elsa, your power will only grow. 
As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes. 
PABBIE (CONT'D) There is beauty in your magic.... But also great danger. 
The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes. 
PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) You must learn to control it. 
In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack Elsa. 
PABBIE (CONT'D) Fear will be your enemy. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively. 
KING No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure. 
Over the King's words we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
-The Arendelle castle gates shutting. 
KING (O.S.) (CONT'D) Until then, we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff. We will limit her contact with people and keep her powers hidden from everyone... including Anna. 
-The castle shutters close. 
-Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears. 
-Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new room. Anna watches, confused and sad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY 
We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes down the hall. 
INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY 
Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW, SO IT HAS TO BE TODAY!! `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER. . . FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER! NOTHING'S IN MY WAY!!! 
-Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE! 
She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it. 
ANNA (CONT'D) (frustrated) Hey! 
HANS I'm so sorry. Are you hurt? 
The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal. 
ANNA (gentler) Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay. 
HANS Are you sure? 
ANNA Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going. But I'm okay. 
He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I'm great, actually. FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS Oh, thank goodness. 
He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps her to her feet. 
HANS (CONT'D) (bowing) Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. 
ANNA (curtseying) Princess Anna of Arendelle. 
HANS Princess...? My Lady. 
He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too, curling his hoof up and out of the boat. 
The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward. 
ANNA Hi...again. 
The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it. Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him. 
HANS Oh boy. 
ANNA Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward, but just because we're-- I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. (did she just say that?) Wait, what? 
Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again. 
HANS I'd like to formally apologize for hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...and for every moment after. 
ANNA No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash! `Cuz, you know... (patting the horse) Hello. (MORE) FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA (CONT'D) (to Hans) But, lucky you, it's-it's just me. 
HANS Just you? 
Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's handsomeness. 
ANNA ...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I better go. I have to...I better go. 
She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Bye! 
As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat. 
HANS Oh no. 
The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY 
Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She peeks out to the audience. 
Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes. 
The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them. 
BISHOP (a whisper) Your Majesty, the gloves. 
Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves, places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb and scepter, then turns to the people. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) (formal, in Old Norse) Sehm hon HELL-drr IN-um HELL-gum AYG-num ok krund ee THES-um HELL- gah STAHTH, ehk teh frahm FUR-ear U- thear... FROZEN - J. Lee 
The scepter and orb start to freeze over. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle. 
CROWD Queen Elsa of Arendelle. 
DUKE Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't call me the little dipper for nothing. 
He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks. 
DUKE (CONT'D) (groove fully on) Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey...I fly. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
MOMENTS LATER... 
Anna limps back to Elsa. 
DUKE (O.S.) Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady. 
ELSA Well, he was sprightly. 
ANNA (rubbing her sore feet) Especially for a man in heels. 
ELSA Are you okay? 
ANNA (loving Elsa's attention) I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time. 
ELSA (sincere) Me too.... 
But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away. 
ELSA (CONT'D) But it can't. 
ANNA Why not? If-- 
ELSA It just can't. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional. 
ANNA Excuse me for a minute. 
She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened. 
Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches her. He smiles perfectly. 
HANS Glad I caught you. 
ANNA Hans. 
He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts her up and leads her in a romantic dance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LATER: Anna and Hans drink and chat. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry. 
She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
-THE CASTLE DOORS: Anna and Hans stroll out of the castle. 
ANNA (CONT'D) ...Your physique helps I'm sure. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
-THE ROSE GARDEN... Hans notices her white streak. 
HANS (about her white streak) What's this? 
ANNA I was born with it, although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll. 
HANS I like it. 
DISSOLVE TO: FROZEN - J. Lee 
EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT 
Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake. 
ANNA Yeah, the whole thing! You got it. 
They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face. 
ANNA(CONT'D) Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers? 
HANS Twelve older brothers. Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally...for two years. 
ANNA That's horrible. 
HANS It's what brothers do. 
ANNA ...And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day she just shut me out, and I never knew why. 
BOTH (CONT'D) DOOR! LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR! 
They climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom. 
Anna raises up her hands to frame the moon. Hans puts his hands on top of hers. Together their hands form a heart. 
BOTH (CONT'D) LIFE CAN BE SO MUCH MORE- 
ANNA WITH YOU! 
HANS WITH YOU! 
ANNA WITH YOU! 
HANS WITH YOU! 
BOTH LOVE IS AN OPEN 
HANS DOOR. 
ANNA DOOR. 
HANS Can I say something crazy...? Will you marry me? 
ANNA Can I just say something even crazier? Yes. 
CUT TO: FROZEN - J. Lee 
INT. BALL -- NIGHT 
Anna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow. 
ANNA Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there? Thank you. Oh, there she is. Elsa! 
Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um. May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. 
HANS (bowing) Your Majesty. 
Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey. 
ANNA We would like-- 
HANS --your blessing-- 
ANNA --of-- 
ANNA/HANS --our marriage! 
ELSA Marriage...? 
ANNA Yes! 
ELSA I'm sorry, I'm confused. 
ANNA Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then-- Wait. Would we live here? 
ELSA Here? FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS Absolutely! 
ELSA Anna-- 
ANNA Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us-- 
ELSA What? No, no, no, no, no. 
ANNA Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must-- 
ELSA Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married. 
ANNA Wait, what? 
ELSA May I talk to you, please. Alone. 
Anna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him. 
ANNA No. Whatever you have to say, you- you can say to both of us. 
ELSA Fine. You can't marry a man you just met. 
ANNA You can if it's true love. 
ELSA Anna, what do you know about true love? 
ANNA More than you. All you know is how to shut people out. 
ELSA You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me. FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS Anna! 
Hans rushes to Anna's side. 
Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just scrambles into the mountains. 
ANNA No. 
HANS (shocked) Look.... The fjord. 
The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking the ships in place. 
INT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- NIGHT 
Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd. 
CROWD WALLAH Snow? It's...snow...in July. FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS ...Are you all right? 
ANNA (in shock) No. 
HANS Did you know? 
ANNA No. 
Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright. 
DUKE Look! It's snowing! It's snowing! The Queen has cursed this land! She must be stopped! (to his thugs) You have to go after her. 
Anna rushes up to the Duke. 
ANNA Wait, no! 
The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna. 
DUKE You! Is there sorcery in you, too? Are you a monster, too? 
ANNA No. No. I'm completely ordinary. 
HANS That's right she is... (realizing how that sounds) ...in the best way. 
ANNA ...And my sister's not a monster. 
DUKE She nearly killed me. 
HANS You slipped on ice. 
DUKE Her ice! FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.... Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one that needs to go after her. 
DUKE Yes. Fine. Do. 
HANS What? 
ANNA (to the Royal Handler) Bring me my horse, please. 
HANS Anna, no. It's too dangerous. 
ANNA Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right. 
The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak. 
HANS I'm coming with you. 
ANNA No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle. 
He sees the desperation in her eyes. 
HANS ...On my honor. 
She throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse, coronation dress and all. 
ANNA (to the crowd) I leave Prince Hans in charge! 
HANS (before letting her go) Are you sure you can trust her? I don't want you getting hurt. 
ANNA She's my sister; she would never hurt me. FROZEN - J. Lee 
She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her. 
The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves... 
EXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT 
Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches her breath and sings... 
"Let It Go" 
Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. She looks around, sees only summer supplies. 
OAKEN (O.S.) Hoo hoo. 
Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip. 
OAKEN (CONT'D) Big summer blow out. Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah? 
ANNA Oh, great. For now, how about boots. Winter boots...and dresses? FROZEN - J. Lee 
OAKEN (slight disappointment) That would be in our winter department. 
The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a lonely pair of boots. 
ANNA Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has another young woman, the Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here? 
She brings the clothes and boots to the counter. 
OAKEN Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear? 
The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF. 
OAKEN (CONT'D) You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo. Big summer blow out. 
Kristoff walks right up to Anna. 
KRISTOFF (in her face) Carrots. 
ANNA Huh? 
KRISTOFF Behind you. 
ANNA Oh, right. Excuse me. 
Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the place, gathering other supplies. 
OAKEN (to Kristoff) A real howler in July, yah? Where ever could it be coming from? 
KRISTOFF The North Mountain. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA (to herself) North Mountain. 
Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on his fingertips. 
OAKEN That'll be forty. 
KRISTOFF Forty? No, ten. 
OAKEN (sweet as pie) Oh dear, that's no good. See these are from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem. 
KRISTOFF You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living. 
Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of ice on his sled, covered in snow. 
ANNA Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really... (he shoots her a look) Ahem. That's unfortunate. 
OAKEN Still forty. But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo! Hi, family. 
Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through the window of the steaming sauna. 
NAKED FAMILY Hoo hoo! 
KRISTOFF ...Ten's all I got. Help me out. 
OAKEN (isolating the carrots) Ten will get you this and no more. 
Kristoff seethes. Stalemate. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA Okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical? 
Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer. 
KRISTOFF Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook here. 
Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature. 
OAKEN What did you call me? 
EXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT 
Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm. 
KRISTOFF Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa! 
Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow. 
OAKEN Bye bye. 
Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven, canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly. 
KRISTOFF So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy? 
ANNA ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage-- 
KRISTOFF Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met? 
ANNA Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove-- 
KRISTOFF Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?! FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt. 
KRISTOFF Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers? 
Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him. 
ANNA Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger. 
KRISTOFF Oh yeah? What's his last name? 
ANNA ...Of-the-Southern-Isles? 
KRISTOFF What's his favorite food? 
ANNA ...Sandwiches. 
KRISTOFF Best friend's name? 
ANNA Probably John. 
KRISTOFF Eye color. 
ANNA Dreamy. 
KRISTOFF Foot size...? 
ANNA Foot size doesn't matter. 
KRISTOFF Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose? 
ANNA Picks his nose? FROZEN - J. Lee 
KRISTOFF And eats it. 
ANNA Excuse me, sir. He's a prince. 
KRISTOFF All men do it. 
ANNA Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love. 
KRISTOFF Doesn't sound like true love. 
ANNA Are you some sort of love expert? 
KRISTOFF No. But I have friends who are. 
ANNA You have friends who are love experts.... I'm not buying it. 
Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm. 
KRISTOFF (to Anna) Stop talking. 
ANNA No, no, no. I'd like to meet these-- 
Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth. 
KRISTOFF I mean it. SHHH. 
Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them. Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its light reflects off...EYES. Several. 
KRISTOFF(CONT'D) Sven, go. Go! 
Sven takes off. 
ANNA What are they? 
KRISTOFF Wolves. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it. 
ANNA Wolves. What do we do? 
KRISTOFF I've got this. You just...don't fall off and don't get eaten. 
ANNA But I wanna help. 
KRISTOFF No. 
ANNA Why not? 
Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff. 
KRISTOFF Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again. 
KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) But she'll die on her own. 
KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D) I can live with that. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip... 
KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) But you won't get your new sled if she's dead. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) (knowing he's got a point) ...You know sometimes I really don't like you. 
Sven licks Kristoff happily. 
KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D) (to Anna) Hold up. We're coming?! 
ANNA (excited) You are?! (catching herself) I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SHARP MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- DAWN 
Kristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST CLEARING -- DAY 
As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of something far below. 
ANNA Arendelle. 
KRISTOFF It's completely frozen. 
ANNA ...But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it. 
KRISTOFF Will she? FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA (uncertain) ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to the North Mountain? 
She points straight ahead. 
KRISTOFF More like this way. 
He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY 
Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes. 
ANNA I never knew winter could be so beautiful. 
Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that voice OLAF. 
OLAF (O.S.) YEAH...It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? Must we bleach the joy out of it all? I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse... 
While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in branches, just as baffled as they are. 
In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind them. 
OLAF (CONT'D) How `bout yellow--no, not yellow. Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go. 
He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him. How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna. 
OLAF (CONT'D) Am I right? FROZEN - J. Lee 
Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head, sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms. 
OLAF (CONT'D) (cheery, to Kristoff) Hi! 
KRISTOFF You're creepy. 
Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a game of hot potato. 
ANNA I don't want it! 
KRISTOFF Backatchya! 
OLAF Please don't drop me. 
ANNA Don't! 
KRISTOFF Come on, it's just a head. 
ANNA No! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
OLAF'S FANTASY WORLD -- PERFECT SUMMER DAY 
Olaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining behind him. He SINGS. 
"In Summer" 
OLAF BEES'LL BUZZ / KIDS'LL BLOW DANDELION FUZZ / AND I'LL BE DOING WHATEVER SNOW DOES IN SUMMER. FROZEN - J. Lee 
-Olaf now lies in the sand on a beach. 
OLAF (CONT'D) A DRINK IN MY HAND / MY SNOW UP AGAINST THE BURNING SAND / PROB'LY GETTING GORGEOUSLY TANNED IN SUMMER. 
-Olaf sails in a boat. 
OLAF (CONT'D) I'LL FINALLY SEE A SUMMER BREEZE / BLOW AWAY A WINTER STORM / 
-Olaf floats in the water. All his pieces begin to separate. 
OLAF (CONT'D) AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLID WATER / WHEN IT GETS WARM. 
-Olaf tumbles on a sandy beach with sand-snowmen. 
OLAF (CONT'D) AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE / WHAT MY BUDDIES ALL THINK OF ME / JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH COOLER I'LL BE IN SUMMER . . ! 
-Olaf and the seagull break out into a tap-dance. 
OLAF (CONT'D) DA DA . . . DA DOO / AH BAH BAH BAH BAH BAH BOO. 
-Olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub. 
OLAF (CONT'D) THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO INTENSE / PUT `EM TOGETHER, IT JUST MAKES SENSE! 
-Olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls. 
OLAF (CONT'D) RATDADAT DAD DADA DOO . . . 
-Olaf bounds down a grassy hill. 
OLAF (CONT'D) WINTER'S A GOOD TIME TO STAY IN AND CUDDLE / BUT PUT ME IN SUMMER AND I'LL BE A... 
He stops at a puddle, looks down at it. Smiles. Hops over it. FROZEN - J. Lee 
OLAF (CONT'D) HAPPY SNOWMAN! 
-Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out. He relaxes and stares at the blue sky. 
OLAF (CONT'D) WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD ON TO MY DREAM / OF RELAXING IN THE SUMMER SUN JUST LETTING OFF STEAM! 
Sven, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf have a picnic. 
OLAF (CONT'D) OH THE SKY WILL BE BLUE / AND YOU GUYS'LL BE THERE TOO / WHEN I FINALLY DO WHAT FROZEN THINGS DO IN SUMMER! 
KRISTOFF I'm gonna tell him. 
ANNA Don't you dare. 
OLAF IN SUMMER! 
Olaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to: 
REALITY. He then straightens up and smiles. 
OLAF (CONT'D) So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's go bring back summer! 
Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain. 
ANNA (laughing) I'm coming! 
Sven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all of them like they're nuts. 
KRISTOFF Somebody's got to tell him. 
DISSOLVE TO: FROZEN - J. Lee 
EXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE -- DAY 
A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile. 
CITIZEN ONE No. No. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be face-up. 
CITIZEN TWO Bark down is drier. 
CITIZEN ONE Bark up. 
CITIZEN TWO Bark down. 
CITIZEN ONE Bark up. 
Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) I wouldn't put my foot there. 
ANNA (O.S.) You're distracting me. 
KRISTOFF Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you? 
ANNA (O.S.) I'm just blocking you out cause I gotta concentrate here. 
KRISTOFF You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone. 
ANNA (O.S.) Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you-- 
KRISTOFF I'm not alone.... I have friends, remember? 
Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA You mean the love experts? 
KRISTOFF Yes, the love experts! 
Anna realizes she's stuck. 
ANNA ...Please tell me I'm almost there. 
REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake. 
ANNA (CONT'D) ...Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? 
Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her. 
KRISTOFF Hang on. 
He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from behind a rock and waves to Kristoff. 
OLAF Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go. 
ANNA Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch! 
Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise. 
She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off. Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck. 
EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY 
Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace. 
ANNA Whoa. 
KRISTOFF (in awe) Now that's ice. I might cry. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA Go ahead. I won't judge. 
Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction. Kristoff runs to his aide. 
KRISTOFF All right, take it easy. I gotcha. 
Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) You stay right here, buddy. 
Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) ...Flawless. 
Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates. 
OLAF ...Knock.... (she doesn't) Just knock.... (she doesn't. To Kristoff) Why isn't she knocking...? Do you think she knows how to knock? 
Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors slide open. 
ANNA Ha. It opened. That's a first. 
Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought, stops him. 
ANNA (CONT'D) You should probably wait out here. 
KRISTOFF What? 
ANNA Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything. 
KRISTOFF But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life. FROZEN - J. Lee 
OLAF Bye, Sven. 
Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him. 
Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps. 
ELSA (CONT'D) Goodbye, Anna. 
ANNA Elsa, wait-- 
ELSA (calling back) I'm just trying to protect you. 
Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues. 
ANNA You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Anna SINGS. 
"First Time in Forever, Reprise" 
ANNA (CONT'D) PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE ANYMORE. 
`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I FINALLY UNDERSTAND. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND. WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN TOGETHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR. `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I WILL BE RIGHT HERE. 
They arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space. Elsa turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined. 
ELSA Anna, PLEASE GO BACK HOME. YOUR LIFE AWAITS. GO ENJOY THE SUN AND OPEN UP THE GATES. 
ANNA Yeah, but-- 
ELSA I know! YOU MEAN WELL, BUT LEAVE ME BE. YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND FREE. 
Elsa opens up the balcony doors. 
ELSA (CONT'D) JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE FROM ME. 
ANNA ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT. 
ELSA WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT? FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW? 
ELSA WHAT DO I NOT KNOW? 
ANNA ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP SNOW. 
ELSA What? 
Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains. 
ANNA You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere. 
ELSA Everywhere? 
ANNA It's okay, you can just unfreeze it. 
ELSA No, I can't. I don't know how. 
ANNA Sure you can. I know you can. 
Snow starts to swirl around the room. 
ANNA (CONT'D) CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, 
ELSA (panicking) I'M SUCH A FOOL! I CAN'T BE FREE! 
ANNA YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID. 
ELSA NO ESCAPE FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME! 
The snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it. 
ANNA WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ELSA I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE! 
ANNA WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE MADE. 
ELSA ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE! 
ANNA DON'T PANIC. 
ELSA THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR! 
ANNA WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT. 
ELSA YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE! 
ANNA WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER... 
But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening blizzard taking over the room. 
ELSA NO! 
Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) (impressed) Ho-ho-ho! 
ANNA I got him! 
Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge. 
KRISTOFF Whoa, stop! 
ANNA It's a hundred foot drop. 
KRISTOFF It's two hundred. 
Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight. 
ANNA Ow. 
He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the snow with a pick axe. 
ANNA (CONT'D) What's that for? 
KRISTOFF I'm digging a snow anchor. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA (not trusting) Okay. What if we fall? 
KRISTOFF There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... Hopefully. 
They hear an angry ROAR coming closer. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) Okay, Anna. On three. 
Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight. 
ANNA Okay. You tell me when... 
KRISTOFF One... 
ANNA ...I'm ready to go.... 
KRISTOFF Two... 
ANNA (pumped up) ...I was BORN ready! Yes! 
KRISTOFF Calm down. 
A huge tree flies through the air toward them. 
ANNA (O.S.) TREE! 
Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches their fall. 
KRISTOFF Whoa! That happened. 
Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs and puffs, struggling to run. 
OLAF Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape. FROZEN - J. Lee 
He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order. 
OLAF (CONT'D) There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there! 
Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him. 
OLAF (CONT'D) (happily) Hey. We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things. 
Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor. 
OLAF (CONT'D) NO! 
Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not making much of a difference. 
OLAF (CONT'D) This is not making much of a difference! 
Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff. 
OLAF (CONT'D) WHOA! 
Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff. 
ANNA Olaf! 
OLAF Hang in there, guys! 
Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up. 
ANNA Wait, what? 
Kristoff's head hits the cliff. 
KRISTOFF It's because she struck you; isn't it? 
ANNA Does it look bad? 
KRISTOFF (thinking) ...No. 
Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to join the conversation. 
OLAF You hesitated. 
KRISTOFF No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Now, come on. FROZEN - J. Lee 
He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow. 
OLAF Okay! Where are we going? 
KRISTOFF To see my friends. 
ANNA (catching up) The love experts? 
OLAF Love experts?! 
KRISTOFF Yes. And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this. 
ANNA How do you know? 
He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child. 
KRISTOFF ...Because I've seen them do it before. 
As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven. 
OLAF I like to consider myself a love expert. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY 
Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself. 
ELSA (mantra-style) Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL! 
She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow up the wall, taking over the castle. 
DISSOLVE TO: FROZEN - J. Lee 
EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT 
The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as he rides on Sven's back. 
OLAF Look, Sven. The sky's awake. 
Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers. 
KRISTOFF Are you cold? 
ANNA ...A little. 
He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do, then gets a thought. 
KRISTOFF Wait. Come here. 
He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock- lined pass. 
Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path. He holds her hands over one of them. 
ANNA Oooh.... That's nice. 
They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent. 
KRISTOFF (taking a deep breath) So, about my friends...well, I say friends, they're more like family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in. 
ANNA (moved) They did? 
KRISTOFF (nervous ramble) Yeah. I don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate...and loud...very loud...they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. (MORE) FROZEN - J. Lee 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) But they're fine.. You'll get it. They mean well. 
Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly. 
ANNA Kristoff, they sound wonderful. 
Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity. 
KRISTOFF Okay then.... 
Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave of the arms announces-- 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) Meet my family. 
TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D) SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, SO HE'S GOT A FEW FLAWS- HIS PECULIAR BRAIN, DEAR. HIS THING FOR THE REINDEER THAT OUTSIDE A FEW OF NATURE'S LAWS. SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT THIS WE'RE CERTAIN OF- YOU CAN FIX THIS FIXER UPPER UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE. 
KRISTOFF Can we just stop talking about this?! We've got a real, actual problem here. 
BULDA I'll say-- (To Anna) IS IT THE WAY THAT HE RUNS SCARED? 
TROLLS (VARIOUS) OR THAT HE'S SOCIALLY IMPAIRED? 
KID TROLL OR THAT HE ONLY LIKES TO TINKLE IN THE WOODS? 
TROLLS (VARIOUS) ARE YOU HOLDING BACK YOUR FONDNESS DUE TO HIS UNMANLY BLONDENESS? OR THE WAY HE COVERS UP THAT HE'S THE HONEST GOODS? FROZEN - J. Lee 
TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D) HE'S JUST A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER- HE'S GOT A COUPLE A' BUGS. 
KRISTOFF No, I don't. 
TROLLS HIS ISOLATION IS CONFIRMATION OF HIS DESPERATION FOR HEALING HUGS. SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE WAY TO FIX UP THIS FIXER UPPER IS TO FIX HIM UP WITH YOU. 
The girl trolls sweep Anna away. The boys take Kristoff. 
KRISTOFF (to the male trolls) Enough! She's engaged to someone else. Okay?! 
TROLLS beat. Blink. Blink. The boy trolls turn, huddle... 
TROLLS (VARIOUS) SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, THAT'S A MINOR THING. THIS QUOTE "ENGAGEMENT" IS A FLEX ARRANGEMENT. 
KID TROLL AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE NO RING. 
TROLLS (VARIOUS) SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, HER BRAIN'S A BIT BETWIXT. GET THE FIANCE OUT OF THE WAY AND THE WHOLE THING WILL BE FIXED! 
GIRL TROLLS WE AREN'T SAYING YOU CAN CHANGE HIM 
TROLLS (VARIOUS) 'CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CHANGE. WE'RE ONLY SAYING THAT LOVE'S A FORCE THAT'S POWERFUL AND STRANGE. PEOPLE MAKE BAD CHOICES IF THEY'RE MAD OR SCARED OR STRESSED. (MORE) FROZEN - J. Lee 
TROLLS (VARIOUS) (CONT'D) BUT THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY (THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY) AND YOU'LL BRING OUT THEIR BEST! TRUE LOVE BRINGS OUT THE BEST! 
Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals. 
ALL TROLLS EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT FATHER, SISTER, BROTHER WE NEED EACH OTHER TO RAISE US UP AND ROUND US OUT 
By this time Kristoff and Anna are being ushered into a pit by the sheer force of numbers. 
TROLLS EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE- THE ONLY FIXER UPPER FIXER THAT CAN FIX A FIXER UPPER IS TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE LOVE 
During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each other differently. Hmmm. Maybe those trolls are right? Sparks! Chemistry! 
TROLL PRIEST Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded-- 
ANNA Wait, what?! 
TROLL PRIEST You're getting married. 
TROLLS LOVE! 
Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's shivering something fierce. 
KRISTOFF Anna? 
He pulls off her cape and hat. FROZEN - J. Lee 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) She's as cold as ice. 
Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd. Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the pit. 
GRAND PABBIE There's strange magic here! 
KRISTOFF Grand Pabbie! 
GRAND PABBIE Bring her to me, Kristoff. 
Kristoff helps Anna over. Pabbie looks into her weak eyes. 
GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D) Anna, your life is in danger. There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister. If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever. 
ANNA What...? No. 
KRISTOFF So remove it, Grand Pabbie. 
GRAND PABBIE I can't. If it was her head, that would be easy. But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart. 
ANNA An act of true love? 
BULDA (googley, to her hubby) A true love's kiss, perhaps? 
A bunch of trolls give each other kisses. 
Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of her hair turns white. 
KRISTOFF Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans. 
Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open. 
She sits up. She's surrounded by stone. 
INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY 
Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves. She's chained to the wall. 
Elsa strains to looks out a window... 
INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting further buried under the ice and snow that is falling. 
ELSA No....What have I done? 
Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door. 
ELSA (CONT'D) Why did you bring me here? 
HANS I couldn't just let them kill you. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ELSA But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna. 
HANS Anna has not returned.... 
Elsa looks to the storm with worry. 
HANS (CONT'D) If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer...please. 
Elsa meets his eyes, desperate. 
ELSA Don't you see...I can't. 
Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes. 
ELSA (CONT'D) You have to tell them to let me go. 
Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch. 
HANS I will do what I can. 
He opens the door and leaves. 
Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE FJORDS -- DAY 
Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style. 
Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff takes off his hat and puts it on her head. 
KRISTOFF Just hang in there. (to Sven) Come on, buddy, faster! 
They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them, out of control. 
OLAF I'll meet you guys at the castle! FROZEN - J. Lee 
KRISTOFF Stay out of sight, Olaf! 
OLAF I will! 
He disappears into the village streets. 
OLAF (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hello! 
TOWNSWOMAN (O.S.) Ah! It's alive! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY 
Guards see Kristoff and Anna approaching. 
GUARD It's Princess Anna! 
Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off, holding Anna, and carries her to the gate. 
KRISTOFF I've got you. 
Anna looks up at him, gratefully. 
ANNA ...Are you g-gonna be okay? 
KRISTOFF (touched, reassuring) Don't worry about me. 
Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid rush to help Anna. 
GERDA Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick. 
HANS (putting out the candles) As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you- 
ANNA Hans? 
HANS You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that. 
Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace. 
HANS (CONT'D) I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa. 
Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire. Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak. 
ANNA Hans. No, stop. FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her. 
ANNA Please. 
HANS (chuckles) All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer. 
Hans approaches Anna. 
ANNA ...You're no match for Elsa. 
He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time not so gently. 
HANS No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction. 
She wrenches her face out of his hands. 
ANNA (anger) You won't get away with this. 
Hans rises and crosses to the door. 
HANS Oh, I already have. 
Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle. 
ANNA (hoarse and weak) Please, somebody help. 
The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the floor. 
CUT TO: FROZEN - J. Lee 
INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- NIGHT 
The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He rubs his arms and shivers. 
DUKE It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death. 
Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face. 
SPANISH DIGNITARY Prince Hans. 
HANS Princess Anna is...dead. 
VARIOUS DIGNITARIES What...? No.... Mon dieu. 
Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair. 
DUKE What happened to her? 
HANS She was killed by Queen Elsa. 
DUKE Her own sister. 
HANS (really putting it on) At least we got to say our marriage vows...before she died in my arms. 
He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief. 
DUKE There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger. 
SPANISH DIGNITARY Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you. 
Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas. FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death. 
INT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY 
The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching. 
GUARD (O.S.) She's dangerous. Move quickly and with resolve. 
Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men duck out of the way. 
Hans pushes his way into the room...sees... 
The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the floor. Elsa is gone. 
Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads. 
All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence. 
But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw. 
Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up. 
Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa. 
ELSA Wha-? Anna? 
Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved. 
ANNA Oh, Elsa. 
They embrace. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ELSA ...You sacrificed yourself for me? 
ANNA (weak) ...I love you. 
Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he lifts his head right off his body and exclaims-- 
OLAF An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart. 
ELSA (processing) Love...will thaw... (realizing) Love.... Of course. 
Elsa looks at Anna with confidence. 
ANNA Elsa? 
ELSA Love. 
Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air. 
Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws. 
The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves. 
The villagers come out to see the warmth returning. 
In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm summer day. 
ANNA I knew you could do it. 
OLAF (melting, good-naturedly) Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last. 
ELSA Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little, perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it. 
OLAF Hey, my own personal flurry. 
Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and stops him. 
ANNA Uh. Uh. Uh. 
She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans. 
HANS (confused) Anna? But she froze your heart. 
ANNA The only frozen heart around here is yours. 
She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face. 
HANS Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
He falls overboard. 
Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder, Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY 
It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been repaired and are sailing away. 
On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig. 
FRENCH DIGNITARY (to Kai) I will return this scoundrel to his country. We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior. 
KAI Arendelle thanks you, my Lord. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two thugs to their ship. 
DUKE This is unacceptable. I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear. I've been traumatized. (bad acting) Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor I could...No? And I demand to see the Queen! 
Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

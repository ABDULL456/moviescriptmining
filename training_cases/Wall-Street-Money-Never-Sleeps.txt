WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS 
Written by 
Allan Loeb 
A BLACK SCREEN Onto which is written in white letters... 
"When business in the United States underwent a contraction... the Federal Reserve created more paper reserves. 
The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a fantastic speculative boom... " 
EXT. CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY 
It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement. A cab waits in the lot. 
The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's group of newly released emerge. 
They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002. Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel. And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko. 
But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a very different version of the man we remember... because now there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read anyway. 
And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting with the people who waited for them... the people who love them. 
The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot... waiting for his people... but they don't come. 
And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat... completely disappointed... and completely alone. And we... 
SLAM BACK INTO As the white letters reappear on the screen... "As a result... the American economy collapsed... Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929... ... written by Alan Greenspan." 
JACOB (V.O.) It's funny, the more we find ourselves slaves of chance... the more superstitious we become. 
SLAM INTO: A MANHATTAN MORNING A gorgeous June Friday. 
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) And that would make Andrew Zabel one superstitious motherfucker. 
Find ANDREW ZABEL, mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape. 
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) He started every day the same exact way. He would walk his dogs then leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven am on the dot. 
As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive building made of white stone. Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella. 
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) And he would take an umbrella with him even when there was no chance of rain... 
As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a familiar nod. And without saying a word, the clerk knows exactly what to give him. 
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland Springs water. 
23RD ST SUBWAY STATION As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate... 
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) He had timed it out so he wouldn't have to wait more than three minutes for the uptown five train. 
As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight from the 5 train coming down the tunnel. 
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) I guess you could say that day was like every other... 
And as the train approaches... holding that Wall Street Journal... the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids... 
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) Except for one thing... 
... Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the track. 
And as the train SLAMS into US... 
DARKNESS Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then... "Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen... and we move down below the letters to find... 
A CHART Now filling the screen. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the right... not good. A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out... CARD: JUNE 6th 2008... 8 DAYS EARLIER... 
MIDTOWN Opening titles... the workplace throng... listening to their iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their Starbucks. 
Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers building... with that giant ticker that rounds the building posting Dow 12,579.76 -- +119.86 
And keep moving... all is normal in the financial center of the universe. 
Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel then climb up it to the top... to the penthouse office suites. 
And push in through the window to be in... 
AUDRY (to Jacob, re Willy) Where's his hat? Willy glares at her. 
WILLY Mind your own business, Audry. 
AUDRY I had to wear Pfizer on my forehead for a full week... so post it up, bitch. Willy pleads with Jacob... 
WILLY C'mon Jake, it's embarrassing. Jacob just shrugs... 
JACOB The stock goes down, you wear the crown... them's the rules. Audry grins in victory. Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something down on a post-it then places it on his forehead. It reads "I bought Toll Brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all week. And Jacob laughs... now looking up at the electronic ticker... KZI $60.21... -$2.25... 
INT. ONE OAK - NIGHT 
An ultra exclusive club reserved for Wall Street money-men, Hollywood players, gangstas and supermodels. TI's "Whatever You Like" blares. The dance floor is packed with New York's privileged draped in Prada and dripped in sweat. Jacob heads a table of five men who are all in suits. They are all in various areas of finance... a HEDGE FUND Portfolio Manager, a DERIVATIVES TRADER, a PRIVATE EQUITY CFO and a 
QUANT ANALYST. The quant stares at a HIGH CLASS CALL GIRL working the room across the way. He then turns back to the guys with... 
QUANT ANALYST Girl like that cost a thousand bucks last year... now it's up to five. 
JACOB Getting priced out of the hooker bubble? Confirming in frustration... 
QUANT ANALYST Goddamn bull market's killing my sex life. They all laugh. 
HEDGE FUND PM Don't worry... it's not such a bull market anymore. She'll be trading at five hundred soon enough. The laughter dies down. 
DERIVATIVES TRADER (turning to Jacob) It's true. I'm actually shocked KZI gave you a bonus of that size. 
JACOB Why? Private Equity CFO nudges Hedge Fund PM in reference to the woman who just took the seat at the next table... 
HEDGE FUND PM 
(DISMISSIVE) Yeah, I'm going long Boeing. 
PRIVATE EQUITY CFO Oh, I didn't notice. Confused... 
QUANT ANALYST Really? The 787 is having problems. As Hedge Fund PM opens a bottle of Krug, Clos du Mesnil 1995 and pours it into the flutes. 
JACOB (to Derivatives Trader) Why? Why are you so shocked? Offering Jacob a flute... 
HEDGE FUND PM Because they're in serious trouble. Declining the champagne... 
JACOB We're not in serious trouble. It's a rumor. A woman takes the table next to them and this makes Derivatives Trader perk up and say. 
DERIVATIVES TRADER I think Goodyear Tire is definitely a buy. Hedge Fund PM checks out the woman. 
HEDGE FUND PM Totally. And those tires are real. Even more confused... 
QUANT ANALYST Goodyear? The chart is horrible. 
PRIVATE EQUITY CFO Somebody color the quant in here. Hedge Fund PM leans into Quant and explains... 
HEDGE FUND PM Boeing, ticker BA... Big Ass. Goodyear, ticker GT... Great Tits. 
QUANT ANALYST (realizing...) Oh, it's like a code. And Private Equity CFO turns to Jacob with... 
QUANT ANALYST (CONT'D) You guys were down three points in an up market today. 
JACOB Whatever, somebody was adding to their short. As a supermodel now joins the next table. 
HEDGE FUND PM DERIVATIVES TRADER Going long Starwood. Starwood's a buy! 
QUANT ANALYST (figuring it out) Starwood, ticker HOT. Yeah but... I'm more a buyer of... (thinks for a minute) 
GDFS. 
PRIVATE EQUITY CFO What the fuck is that? 
QUANT ANALYST It's an exchange traded fund that tracks the Guinian Franc. 
HEDGE FUND PM Okay, whatever -- what's it code for? And Quant looks over to the model then back proudly with... 
QUANT ANALYST Gold Digger Freak Show. The guys just shake their heads... 
EXT. LOWER BROADWAY - NIGHT 
Jacob and Derivatives Trader enjoy the summer night. Out of all the guys, he's closest to Jacob. His name is Robby. 
JACOB Can I ask you something, Robby? Robby nods. 
DIEGO Jet fuel. Diego cracks up. Jacob just shakes his head and moves on. And Jacob walks uptown... deep in thought. It's a gorgeous June Friday. Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a long moment... coming to a decision. And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way... 
INT. 36 GRAMERCY PARK EAST/LOBBY - MORNING 
Jacob smiles to the doorman. 
JACOB I'm here to see Andrew Zabel. 
DOORMAN Is he expecting you? 
JACOB No. 
INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 
The elevator opens and Andrew Zabel appears with two adorable Bichon Frise puppies. Jacob stands. 
ZABEL Jacob... 
JACOB Andy. I'm sorry to come by like this but the rumors are now hitting a fever pitch and I wanted to make sure everything was okay. Zabel nods and heads for the door. 
ZABEL Come on... 
EXT. GRAMERCY PARK - MORNING 
As they enter through the gates of the park and walk... 
JACOB Is everything okay? And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there... introspective and blank. 
ZABEL I remember when the starter gave me this bushy hair twelve year old kid and I said; "Donny, what the fuck -- give me a real caddy." And he said; "This kid's the best." 
JACOB 
ANDY-- 
ZABEL And you were. You had the wind down, the grade of every green. 
JACOB What's going on? 
ZABEL But you wouldn't shut up about stocks. Twelve years old and you blabbed on and on about companies and sectors and earnings. 
JACOB Andy, are we going under? 
ZABEL What was that piece of shit you loved? That airline equipment supplier who was branching out into car airbags-- 
JACOB Flour Controls. Are you okay? Zabel laughs. 
ZABEL Flour Controls... what a dog. 
JACOB Why did you give me that bonus? Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with... 
ZABEL Because I know you, Jacob. And I know you've been holding off because you didn't think you had enough. We all do that... postpone life until we believe we have what it takes to actually live it. 
JACOB There isn't a better money-runner on the street... we'll get through this. 
ZABEL Marry her, Jacob. And have children with her and spend as much time as you can with them... and never forget that that's what's important. And Jacob L. Moore... looking his boss head on... 
JACOB Andrew, if there's anyway I can help -- give back the bonus -- whatever... all you have to do is say the word. And Zabel just looks away... 
ZABEL There's just so much you don't know, Jacob. 
INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - DAY 
The normally very loud and frenetic place is very quiet and sober today. They all watch Alexis Glick report... 
ALEXIS GLICK (ON THE TVS) Rumors of insolvency have hit the street concerning KZI's books and they're shooting first then asking questions later. The stock is now trading just a bit over thirty one dollars a share, down almost forty four percent on the session. And standing in the center of the floor, watching this... 
JACOB Stunned... horrified... his universe becoming unglued. And he turns to Audry... helpless and in shock. 
JACOB Who did this to us? She can only shrug... tears in her eyes. Jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floor's electronic ticker on the wall... KZI $26.34... -$29.57. And he moves for the elevator banks... unable to take it anymore. 
EXT. MIDTOWN -DAY 
Furious, Jacob walks down 6th ave with his phone to his ear. 
JACOB Andrew, call me back. I'm going to find out who did this to us. I swear to God... if it's the last thing I do. 
(BEAT) We're going to bounce back from this. And we're going to find out who spread the rumor... and then we're going to destroy them. He disconnects the call and keeps walking. After a beat, with his anger brewing... Jacob SLAMS his phone down on the ground and it shatters. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) And if I know our central bank -- which I do -- I predict it's going to throw gasoline on this fire with more cheap money and federal bailouts and 
HEAD-IN-THE-SAND MANIPULATED statistics on productivity and inflation. And Gordon stops pacing... takes a moment for effect. 
Then sums it all up with... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) So no good deed goes unpunished and all fires start with a well-meaning spark and when you take free money and no lending standards then add it with unaccountable risk and ungodly leverage and unbridled greed... what you end up with is cancer. And Gordon takes in a deep breath... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Systemic, malignant and global. Now the room is completely silent. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Do they still have the V&T restaurant on Amsterdam? Is that still there? A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) (with a smile) God, I loved their pizza. 
INT. URIS HALLWAY - DAY 
Jacob looks on as Gordon is surrounded by professors and students alike... 
GORDON GEKKO (announcing to the throng) I'll give you six minutes then I really have to go. 
EXT. URIS HALL - EXACTLY 6 MINUTES LATER 
Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER, a woman in her 40s and heads into the quad. Jacob immediately matches their stride. 
JACOB Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a moment? As he keeps walking... 
GORDON GEKKO You're too late, Sport... Q&A's over. 
JACOB My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating your daughter. 
(AND THEN) I'm going to ask her to marry me. And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with... 
GORDON GEKKO I'll give you nine minutes. 
EXT. 112TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street. 
GORDON GEKKO Keller, Zabel? Then you have my apologies. 
JACOB Yeah... 
GORDON GEKKO Stock's in a free fall. My guess is that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah... Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and checks to see Gordon's right... KZI... $12.54. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) By the end of the day it might not even be potty trained. And Jacob looks at him. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) I might not be allowed to trade, Jake, but I still love to watch from home. 
JACOB Andrew Zabel took me under his wing when I was in high school. He basically got me my scholarship to Yale then hired me right out of business school. 
GORDON GEKKO Andrew's smart, he beats the benchmarks consistently. He'll land on his feet. 
JACOB He's dead. And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob. Who confirms... 
JACOB (CONT'D) He killed himself this morning. As that registers... 
GORDON GEKKO I'm sorry to hear that. 
JACOB He was a father to me. 
And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath and looks into Gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty... 
JACOB (CONT'D) I love your daughter very much and I would be honored if... And realizing what this is... Gordon starts to laugh... which throws Jacob off. 
JACOB (CONT'D) ... you would bless-- I really don't understand what you find so funny. 
GORDON GEKKO My daughter hasn't spoken to me for eleven years and you know it. She blames me for her brother's overdose and every other disaster that's fallen upon the world since the mid-nineties. 
(BEAT) And by the way, isn't it strange that Winnie would date a guy from the street? 
JACOB What? 
GORDON GEKKO She hates me. And she hates Wall Street and everything it represents... so don't you find it curious that she would fall in love with you? And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat. Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) So you want my blessing? 
JACOB Yes. 
GORDON GEKKO Like I said -- I still love to watch from home. And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) So don't insult me by pretending to ask for Winnifred's hand when what you really want to know is who to bring down to their knees and how to do it. And Jacob swallows that back... doesn't argue it. 
JACOB I know who. 
GORDON GEKKO Really? 
JACOB It was either Nassim Tariq from the Frontier Fund, Bretton Woods from Locust or Karen Molina from ESL. 
GORDON GEKKO Does Winnie even know you came to see me? 
JACOB Well, not exactly. 
(THEN) But I'm going to tell her. 
GORDON GEKKO Not such a grand idea, Pal. Off Jacob's confusion... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) See, I have a feeling you're going to want to see me again. And if you tell her we had this little pow-wow... she's not going to let that happen. As Jacob considers that... the train slows to a stop. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Look, you seem like a smart kid. 
(BEAT) Walk away, dust off your resume and get another job... As he steals one last glance at that Guardian Mortgage ad... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) ... but do it quick. And with that, Gordon moves for the doors. But Jacob steps in front of him. 
JACOB I'm going to bring them down. Whoever floated the rumor for a quick buck. 
GORDON GEKKO It's not worth it. It's a waste of energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody gets it... they never did. As the subway doors open... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) If there's one thing I learned in prison it's that money is not the prime commodity in our lives... time is. 
(BEAT) And your nine minutes are up. And Gordon Gekko gets off the subway... leaving Jacob on the train. But right before the doors close, Gordon stops and turns with... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) There are worse ways to go than jumping in front of a train. For instance, could you imagine taking something for your diabetes... As the doors close... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) .. and end up having it cause you to die of acute pancreatitis? And as the subway pulls out of the station, Jacob Moore just stands there... holding the pole and wondering what the hell that was supposed to mean. 
EXT. ANDREW ZABEL'S MATINECOCK, LONG ISLAND HOME - DAY 
A Victorian Estate on a bluff. Zabel's funeral in progress. Hundreds of people made it out from the city. All types. 
PRIEST Andrew didn't have children, so he made all you -- all of us -- his children. 
(BEAT) And to list Andrew Zabel's many accomplishments would take me far too long to enumerate, but if you just look around you, you'll see those accomplishments in the faces of the many people gathered here today. And we pan the procession of mourners... past... 
PRIEST (CONT'D) The alumni of the Morris High School class of 1997... who -- through the adopt a grade program -- Andrew pledged to pay the college educations of every member who graduated and got accepted into a University. ... past... 
PRIEST (CONT'D) The members of the Saint Helena Symphony, who Andrew provided emergency funding for when they were facing extinction. 
(BEAT) And the many, many, other recipients of Andrew Zabel's generosity. ... and past... 
PRIEST (CONT'D) Those who were left behind... those who were overlooked... those who otherwise would never have stood a chance. 
And we land on Jacob L. Moore... 
PRIEST (CONT'D)(O.S) Above being just a great financial mind... or a great husband... He wears a dark suit... and a blank expression... 
PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.) ... or a great father... or a great neighbor... or a great friend... ... with nothing but cold retribution in his eyes. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.) ... Andrew Zabel was a great man. 
INT. POOL HOUSE - DAY 
Most of the guests across the pool eat and quietly mill about. We're with Jacob, Willy, Audry and another trader named 
DANIEL. 
AUDRY Two dollars a share? 
WILLY The Fed didn't give us a choice. Jacob walks around the room... taking in the pictures of Andrew Zabel's life... 
AUDRY Does that include the building? 
DANIEL What about the Zabel's institutional managed fund? How much is in that? 
WILLY Eight billion. 
Midtown, corporate, high-floor. Find the private client portfolio manager we remember from the wine tasting. 
He sits at his computer in a big corner office with a beautiful western view to the river behind him and types in an IM window "AMLN short -- FDA to deny Byetta" then hits send. As he receives the digital receipt... "1209 instant messages sent." 
INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT/WASHINGTON DC - MORNING 
As Jacob munches toast and watches Fox Business in his underwear... 
JENNA LEE (ON TV) ... another stock that's getting beaten before the bell is Amlyn Pharmaceuticals. The stock's down nine percent in premarket trading on no news. Jacob smiles. 
JENNA LEE (ON TV) (CONT'D) When we come back we have Blue star Airlines' CEO Bud Fox discussing how he turned his once small regional airline into the country's third largest carrier. 
INT. AMLYN PHARMACEUTICALS/PRESS ROOM - DAY 
A select group of Financial JOURNALISTS sit in small metal chairs in front of a podium with the Amlyn name and logo behind it. As the INVESTOR RELATIONS OFFICER heads up the podium and opens his prepared statement... 
INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jacob watches "Happy Hour" on Fox Business as Winnie opens a bottle of wine in the kitchen. She pours a glass of wine and another of water. 
WINNIE If he wins... she has a real chance for a cabinet position and I'm pretty sure she'll take me with her if she can. 
JACOB He's going to win. As she hands him the glass of water... 
WINNIE Don't jinx it. And Jacob sees Amlyn Pharmaceuticals graphic on the screen and turns up the tv. 
ERIC BOLLING (ON THE TV) Big drop in Amlyn as negative rumors on the street forced the company to admit there are still internal concerns about Byetta and pancreatitis. They now may be forced to pull the phase three drug from FDA review and retool. 
(BEAT) The stock takes a twenty-eight percent haircut. 
WINNIE Can we watch something else? Jacob brings her in and kisses her... 
JACOB Whatever you want. Her phone rings. As she goes to answer it... 
WINNIE 
(KIDDING) Project Runway. 
JACOB Not Project Runway. Picking up the phone... 
WINNIE Hello... who is this? Hold on. As she pulls the phone away from her ear and looks over to Jacob... 
WINNIE (CONT'D) It's for you... someone named Bretton Woods? 
EXT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - NIGHT 
Jacob rounds West 62nd street and stares down the hottest new address in Manhattan. A little nervous, he sucks in a deep breath then heads into the building. 
INT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST/ PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
A BUTLER lets Jacob in. Jacob takes in the massive space with an insane view of Central Park. He can hear a beautiful sonata playing in the next room. 
JACOB I'm here to see Bretton Woods. The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit and into the... 
PARLOR 
A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. A fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass featuring that park view on the other. And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a recital of some sort. About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very unique looking silver grand piano. The girl can't be a day over thirteen. She's playing Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"... her fingers gliding across the keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's as spectacular as it is moving. Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All ethnicities and types... The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON. And BRETTON WOODS... Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape, refined, composed and masculine. He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at Jacob. Jacob looks away. And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata to applause. The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton heads over to Jacob. 
BRETTON WOODS As you can see, I'm having a little dinner party here but I thought it was important we speak right away. He speaks with a British accent.. Jacob nods. Bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests then back at Jacob... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Please... if you don't mind waiting in my office, I'll be in a minute. And the butler is already at Jacob's side, motioning him to follow him. 
INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Jacob waits for Bretton. He looks over the place. The view of the park. The classic furniture. 
AND THE HUGE PAINTING ON THE WALL 
Of a giant man-like monster eating a much smaller naked human. The smaller man's head's been bitten off and blood drips down the body. Jacob holds on the painting. 
BRETTON WOODS (O.S.) Saturno devorando a sus hijos. As Jacob turns to see Bretton standing in the doorway. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Saturn devouring his son. Francisco Goya. Bretton heads in and closes the door behind him. 
JACOB Do you collect? 
BRETTON WOODS No. Sitting behind his desk... 
(BEAT) Everybody has one -- it's an exact number -- what's yours? And Bretton takes a moment to think about that, then simply says... 
BRETTON WOODS More. ... and disappears into his penthouse. 
EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING 
Jacob heads out of his building to be greeted by... 
DIEGO You know what I overheard a guy say yesterday? 
JACOB I know you're going to tell me... Diego smiles... 
DIEGO "This market's just like a divorce. I've lost half my money... only I still have my wife!" As he goes into the hot summer day... 
JACOB Not bad... 
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE/ATLANTIC GRILL - DAY 
Jacob heads up to the restaurant to find Gordon Gekko waiting outside. 
GORDON GEKKO There's a wait. 
JACOB Oh... 
GORDON GEKKO Fifteen minutes she said. 
JACOB Okay. 
GORDON GEKKO No, that's not okay. Because it means they're crowded so every tier in the service chain will be extended. The sixteen minutes we would normally wait to order will now be twenty six, the standard twenty four minutes waiting for our food to arrive will turn into thirty nine, the eight minutes to get the check will become seventeen and the four minutes to process the credit card will take nine. 
(BEAT) I told you I'd have lunch with you... not give you a hundred and six minutes of my time. Jacob just stands there. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Let's go to Whole Foods. 
INT. WHOLE FOODS - DAY 
Gordon and Jacob share a little table out front of the market. Gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while Jacob doesn't eat. 
GORDON GEKKO Did you eat before? 
JACOB Just not hungry. 
GORDON GEKKO Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too. Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The picture of Winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger. Gordon looks at it and laughs. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Fitting. As he places it in his pocket... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) That'll make it a round trade for us. 
JACOB I actually owe you one now. Off Gordon's look... 
JACOB (CONT'D) I crushed him. 
GORDON GEKKO Did you? 
JACOB His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be surprised if the redemptions finish the job. 
GORDON GEKKO Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud of yourself. 
JACOB How'd you know about Amlyn? Gordon shrugs. 
GORDON GEKKO It's amazing what information you can find out when people know you're not going to trade on it. 
JACOB So, you didn't use me to make a little money? And never to look up from his lunch... 
GORDON GEKKO Naw. I prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it. 
JACOB Why'd you give it to me? 
GORDON GEKKO You're out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter... I figured you could use the money. 
JACOB I didn't make any money off of it. 
GORDON GEKKO You didn't trade it? With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence. 
JACOB That would've been insider trading, Mr. Gekko. Gordon just shakes his head. 
JACOB (CONT'D) And not "most likely." 
GORDON GEKKO That's right. And then... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) And I've got some news for you... he ain't bleeding. He's not even cut. 
JACOB What are you talking about? 
GORDON GEKKO What I'm talking about, Jake... is that I'd bet dollars to donuts that Bretton Woods unwound most of his position in Amlyn last week. That he knew about the pancreatitis. Off of Jacob's confusion... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) The only reason you think you hurt him is because he wanted you to think that. 
JACOB How do you know that? 
GORDON GEKKO I don't. But it's not Bretton's first rodeo... and my instincts for this sort of thing don't often disappoint. Jacob can't believe it. And with each passing moment of realization... shock turns into rage. 
JACOB I can't believe it. 
GORDON GEKKO Believe it, Princess... he's beating your ass all over the court. As Jacob tries to calm himself. 
JACOB And you think I should take the job -- bring him down from the inside? Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and... 
GORDON GEKKO I don't know, Jake... what you kids think is pay-back these days is really incredible. When I was coming up, we slaughtered men. 
(BEAT) There are guys still working at penny ante brokerages in the Poughkeepsie's of this country because they crossed me. While Jacob processes that... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) So I'll make you another trade, Jake. I'll help you bring him down, if you help me get her back. As Jacob just looks away... non committal. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) ... then you both can have a father. 
EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT 
As Jacob walks... on the phone with... 
ROBBY Jacob, I could lose my job. ... who holds his sleeping infant in his hands. 
JACOB Robby, I need to know. Now nobody moves size in this town without using your desk. 
(BEAT) We'll play twenty questions only it'll be two questions and all you have to do is say "yes or no." Capitulating with a sigh... 
ROBBY Fire away... 
JACOB Bretton Woods... The Locust Fund... did they make any major moves in the last few weeks? 
ROBBY Yes. 
JACOB Was it unloading Amlyn pharmaceuticals? 
ROBBY 
(NERVOUS) Jacob... 
JACOB Robby, I got you the fucking the job! And after a long moment. 
ROBBY Yes. Jacob stops walking... sucks in a deep breath... 
JACOB I'm sorry to make you do that. With that, he disconnects and shakes his head in frustration. And after a moment, Jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes another call. 
JACOB (CONT'D) (into the phone) Okay Gordon... you've got yourself a trade. 
AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART As a circle forms on June 19th then travels down the trend line to early July and stops. And as a circle is formed around July 4th, we... 
CUT TO: 
FIREWORKS Exploding over the Capitol building. 
EXT. SENATOR LEHIGH'S GEORGETOWN HOME - NIGHT 
A BBQ for the political set and their families. Paper plates and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks. Jacob holds Winnie as they look up at the sky... 
WINNIE My parents would always throw this huge party in the Hamptons on the fourth. The city of South Hampton would have its firework show at 8pm then my father would wait until it was over then put on his... which, of course, was always twice as spectacular. She leans up, sips her wine, then... 
WINNIE (CONT'D) Then one year the city passed an ordinance that their firework show had to be the last of the night... they were sick of getting shown up by Gordon Gekko. Jacob laughs... 
JACOB What'd he do? 
WINNIE He rented a barge and shot the fireworks off of it a mile off the coast... out of jurisdiction. (then... almost to herself) The show was even more amazing over the water. And Jacob looks at her. 
JACOB I think he should be invited to the wedding. 
JACOB (CONT'D) Cute dogs. 
BRETTON WOODS Dogue de Bordeaux... bred to kill. But Contango and Backwardation here are socialized since birth so they're harmless. Jacob laughs... 
JACOB You named your dogs after technical futures market terms? And Bretton stands... 
BRETTON WOODS Of course not... (with a wink) My children did. As he heads into... 
THE LIVING ROOM A fire burning in the fireplace. Jacob follows Bretton in... 
JACOB And where are your children? Bretton moves toward a table with a classic phonograph player on it. 
BRETTON WOODS Greece with my wife. My boys are studying The Iliad now. While Bretton looks through the various sleeves of records, Contango and Backwardation slowly find their way into the room and sit by the fire. Bretton finds what he's looking for... removing the record from its sleeve. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Here it is... one of the most beautiful pieces of music you'll ever hear. Bretton places the record on the phonograph and The Rolling Stones "Let It Loose" rings out... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) "Exile On Main Street," without a doubt The Stones greatest album. Jacob laughs. He was expecting Beethoven. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) It was all outtakes. Throwaway tracks. And the critics hated it. And it didn't sell well at first. 
(BEAT) But now it's universally known as their best release. I asked Mick once how he thought that happened. How something could go from so worthless to so valuable. He just looked at me and said... "it never went from worthless to valuable... just the opinions of it did." Taking a seat... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) And that was the greatest lesson I ever learned about investing. 
JACOB An asset's value can only be priced at its perception. 
BRETTON WOODS 
(IMPRESSED) Exactly. There is no intrinsic. Then... simply... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) You'll work out of the New York office. I wouldn't want to pull you away from your fiancee in Washington. 
JACOB Thank you. 
BRETTON WOODS She's Gordon Gekko's daughter. 
JACOB That's right. 
BRETTON WOODS He was a legend at one time. It's quite sad how he publicly cries out wolf now. Bretton stands and stretches. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) You see, for a legend... 
Inside of a tired sigh... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) ... the only thing worse than death is becoming irrelevant. And Bretton just sits there... enjoying his scotch while taking in the Stones tune... 
INT. LONDON/SAVOY HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
Jacob stands at the window of his suite... looking out onto the Victoria embankment and on the phone with... 
GORDON GEKKO Good work, kid -- you're on the inside now. 
JACOB He's going to Dubai to raise some money then meeting me in New York to set me up. Gordon sits at the dining room table at his apartment. Papers scattered about and his EDITOR waiting patiently. 
GORDON GEKKO No. 
JACOB What? 
GORDON GEKKO He's not meeting you in New York. 
JACOB Why not? 
GORDON GEKKO Because you need to go to Dubai with him. 
JACOB I don't understand. 
EXT. LONDON - DAY 
As the 727 takes off ... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) You need to do something that will earn his trust... you need to make yourself a hero... 
INT. 727 - DAY 
Jacob sits across from Bretton who enjoys a slice of Pizza and a Coke. 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) Jacob... you need to help him get this money. And Jacob glares at Bretton like he might kill him. 
INT. JACOB'S SUITE/BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Now dressed in a tightly-fitting suit over a white shirt with wing collars and stove-pipe skinny trousers, Jacob stands in front of the mirror. As Jacob throws on a top hat and admires the 1928 version of himself.... 
INT. THE LEFT BANK - NIGHT 
A Roaring 20's party is taking place... it's full-on speakeasy vibe. It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans, Russians and Middle-Easterners. Smoke fills the room. A jazz band roars. Drinks flow. As Jacob and Bretton head in... 
BRETTON WOODS If he offers you a drink -- take it. And with that, Bretton points across the room where OLEG BAKUNIN sits. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) If he offers you a line of coke -- snort it. He's in his mid-40s, overweight, sweaty, draped in tight black Prada and smoking a cigarette. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) If he offers you a child -- raise it. And it seems A MODEL BOMB has recently exploded at Oleg's table... leaving the skinny shards everywhere. Oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms. 
OLEG Bretton Woods has arrived. Bretton smiles. They head over. Oleg turns to one of the MODEL GIRLS next to him. 
OLEG (CONT'D) I want you to meet one of the only men in the world who might be as rich as I am. Wait a minute... Bretton what did oil close at today? 
BRETTON WOODS A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a barrel. 
OLEG (to Model Girl) Forget what I said -- I'm much richer than him. Oleg then looks at Jacob. 
OLEG (CONT'D) Who the fuck is this? 
JACOB Oleg, I'm Jacob Moore. It's nice to meet you. Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks again... 
OLEG Who the fuck is this? Bretton smiles... 
BRETTON WOODS Jacob has recently come over from KZI to work with me. And now Oleg turns to Jacob. 
OLEG KZI? You worked with Andrew Zabel? Jacob takes a beat. Then... 
JACOB That's right. 
OLEG He was a legend. Jacob just nods, not showing any emotion. Oleg motions for the girls to make room and they all sit... 
OLEG (CONT'D) It was that mortgage shit. He should've just focused on managing money and not fuck around with that crazy mortgage shit. Bretton just looks away. Jacob stays cool. 
OLEG (CONT'D) It was a shame his fund was only for institutions... I would've liked to have invested. Oleg motions to a WAITRESS who immediately pours vintage champagne. 
OLEG (CONT'D) In honor of the theme tonight, have a glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne... Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline. 
OLEG (CONT'D) This is one of two hundred bottles discovered on a shipwreck off the coast of Finland... thirty grand a bottle. And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the champagne out of Jacob's flute. 
EXT. DUBAI HARBOR - NIGHT 
Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded mooring. Fishing boats bob violently in the water -- and next to them is Oleg's Phoenix 1000, his personal, 65-meter SUBMARINE. As a boatman helps them all climb aboard: 
OLEG Phoenix 1000. 
INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT 
As they walk through the ornate deck saloon: Oleg beckons Jasper toward a huge panoramic window looking out at the city of Dubai. 
And then the view starts to MOVE. The surface of the water RISES before them, Dubai recedes and the submarine descends spectacularly into the depths. 
OLEG 5000 square feet, 30 days of oxygen capacity. 
INT. THE DECK SALOON - NIGHT 
Lights illuminate the dark waters as curious fish flit past. Jacob, Bretton and Oleg are on divans, the girls undulating around them. 
OLEG Bretton, I have... what?... two hundred million with you. 
BRETTON WOODS And hopefully that's just a start. Oleg, there are so many opportunities out there right now I feel like a kid in the candy store. Oleg waves him off. 
OLEG You know I like to spread it around... I'm like my own fund of funds. I don't like to have too much with one manager. As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope... 
OLEG (CONT'D) You never really know who to trust in this world. Jacob takes a beat, swallows nervously, then... 
JACOB I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one of the first things that Andrew Zabel taught me. I worked very closely with him. It's why Bretton hired me. To get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain. Bretton flashes Jacob a look... "What the hell are you doing?" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues... 
JACOB (CONT'D) You said before that you always wanted to invest with Zabel but couldn't because he only handled institutional money. Well here's your chance. Zabel taught me everything he knew. Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest. 
OLEG Such as... ? 
JACOB Well, I'm not going to give you the whole cake, Oleg... He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob... 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I love you because you're compassionate and you care so deeply about what you do and you have like no ego, it's crazy. She reaches to him... turning his face to meet hers. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) And you're the smartest person I've ever met... and there's nobody I trust more in the world. Jacob looks away... almost ashamed. And Winnie can sense something's not right. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) What's wrong? 
JACOB Nothing... As Jacob draws in a deep breath, collects himself and finally turns back to her with... 
JACOB (CONT'D) I just wish you would master that relationship from childhood so you can move forward with this one. 
AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART As a circle forms on July 20th then travels down the trend and stops. And as a circle is formed around August 11th, we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY- DAY 
And Manhattan... as it sweats through the heart of summer. Two jetvans ride uptown... 
INT. JETVAN - DAY 
As Jacob rides with Bretton... 
JACOB Bretton... I found something I like. Bretton looks over to him. 
BRETTON WOODS I've been wondering when my new portfolio manager was going to come to me with something special. 
JACOB I just wanted to make sure I would be bringing you the smartest idea possible. I know you don't go light. Confirming... 
BRETTON WOODS That's right. If I commit to this... we go large and we don't back down. 
JACOB It might be better to do this in the office. I have color and support to 
PRESENT-- Waving him off... 
BRETTON WOODS C'mon Jacob, you know that's not how we do. 
EXT. ADIRONDACK FOREST PRESERVE - DAY 
2.7 million acres of State protected majestic land. All nature... rivers and lakes... cypresses and maples. Clean air. And trails. Many trails that go on for miles. As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a STATE RANGER opens the gate and allows them to drive through then park. Jacob and Bretton emerge from the jetvan. 
BRETTON WOODS This is how we do. And with a nod, the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to reveal two motorcycles inside. Bretton's MTT Turbine Superbike and an Agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of art as much as they are demons of speed. Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement. 
JACOB And we're allowed to ride these through here? Sucking in the fresh summer air... 
BRETTON WOODS No. 
AND JACOB AND BRETTON Now decked out in leather riding gear... on the bikes... at the mouth of the trail... revving the engines... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Follow me... And with that, shoots into the forest. Jacob quickly follows. 
AND THEY RIDE Winding through the trees... along the side of a river... Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up. Bretton reaches a clearing and waits for Jacob to catch up. Once he does... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) You're going to have to keep up. 
JACOB Okay. I'm just getting used to it. 
BRETTON WOODS Tell me your idea. 
JACOB Here? 
BRETTON WOODS Where else? 
JACOB Right. Okay. 
(COLLECTING HIMSELF) Are you still short any of the financials? 
BRETTON WOODS No. After KZI, I took profits. 
JACOB I think it's time to go the other way. 
BRETTON WOODS Banks? 
JACOB Insurance companies. I'm talking the old school insurers that have become the babies thrown out with the bath water. Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton. But all he gets is... 
BRETTON WOODS Keep up! And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing. Jacob rides just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a race. Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up. As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton as they approach the trail. If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton, he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't. Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed, narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling ahead of Bretton and taking the lead. 
A TRANQUIL LAKE As it sits still in the setting sun. Untouched by man. Bretton and Jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore. As they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) Let me guess... the ginger garlic lobster. 
WINNIE 
(TO JACOB) I used to order that every time. She closes her menu. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I'm not really hungry. 
GORDON GEKKO I've been following your career, Winnie. Senator Lehigh said some very nice things about you in The American Prospect interview. 
WINNIE Yeah. She's really been... very... supportive of my... And it trails off... as she just glares at Gordon. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I can't do this. She exhales, stands and looks down to Jacob. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I can't do this. And she quickly walks off. Jacob frozen. Until Gordon looks over to him with... 
GORDON GEKKO It's okay. This is a long term investment. 
(BEAT) Go after her. She needs you. And Jacob does. As Gordon looks down... disappointed. 
INT. WEST 65TH - NIGHT 
Pouring rain. Jacob runs after her. 
JACOB Winnie... Winnie... He turns her around. 
WINNIE You don't understand. Her tears being washed away by the rain. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) My mother couldn't handle Rudy. He was so out of control. I couldn't help him. Jacob takes her into his hold... 
WINNIE (CONT'D) 
(RE GEKKO) If he wasn't in prison... if he had been there. I know it would've been different. 
JACOB Your brother's dead, Winnie. 
Squeezing her tight... 
JACOB (CONT'D) Your father isn't. 
WINNIE He's not the person people think he is. 
JACOB It was a long time ago. She pulls out of his embrace... 
WINNIE He'll hurt us. Can't we just go home? Please... Jacob. It's raining. And he just looks at her for a long moment... soaking wet and shivering... crying and exposed. 
JACOB (what am I doing?) I love you. You don't have to do this. 
(AND THEN) Let's just go home. 
INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Darkness. The phone rings. Jacob answers it. 
JACOB Yes. 
INTERCUT WITH... 
BRETTON WOODS Your insurance companies are down. He's working a coffee in the master suite of The Black Swan Home... 
JACOB Bretton. 
BRETTON WOODS I want to increase our size. Glancing at the LCD, 12:23am... 
JACOB Okay. Good. It's just a matter of time before they turn. I'll call the 
DESKS TOMORROW-- 
BRETTON WOODS Jacob, I want you to triple our positions on all three. 
Jacob takes a beat. 
JACOB Okay. 
BRETTON WOODS And they better fucking go up. Click. And as Jacob just looks at the phone... 
GORDON GEKKO (PRELAP) The instant you know you're in trouble is the exact moment when a sound investment thesis turns into blind hope. 
NEXT FRAME Under the caption "A few weeks later at the bank..." Banker Man now stands over a pile of steaming shit. 
BANKER MAN Wow, these mortgages are really beginning to smell. I better sell them to smart people. 
NEXT FRAME Under the caption of "Smart People Investment Bank" Smart Man stands over the same steaming pile of shit. 
SMART MAN Wow, these mortgages we just bought really smell. I better sell them to foreigners. 
NEXT FRAME Under the caption of "The CDO Factory" our smart man oversees an assembly line of stick figure workers. 
SMART MAN (CONT'D) Mix those crappy mortgages in real good with the clean ones so the rating agencies won't smell them. 
NEXT FRAME Under the caption of "Rich Man Hedge Fund" a stick figure named Rich Man sits behind his desk and holds a phone to his ear. 
RICH MAN Good news, Smart Man, not only did foreigners buy those traunches, but so did school boards and charities and big pensions. 
(BEAT) Why did they buy them you ask? Well, they were looking for a really secure risk-free investment and they were all triple A, so... 
NEXT FRAME Under the caption "Norwegian Village Pension Fund" a Norwegian Man sits behind his desk and shouts into his phone. 
NORWEGIAN MAN Hey man! What the fuck? We're not receiving our monthly payments! 
NEXT FRAME Under the caption "Rich Man Hedge Fund," Rich Man at his desk on the phone. 
RICH MAN Yeah, we fucked up. 
And it now shuffles between the last two frames... the Norwegian Man and Rich Man. 
NORWEGIAN MAN What about the rating agencies? 
RICH MAN Yeah, they fucked up too. 
NORWEGIAN MAN What about the investment bank that put these CDO's together? 
RICH MAN Fucked up. 
NORWEGIAN MAN What about the bank that made the original loan? 
RICH MAN Totally fucked up. 
NORWEGIAN MAN What am I supposed to tell my villagers? 
RICH MAN That you fucked up. The final frame Just the rendering of that steaming pile of shit under the caption... "The End." And the lights go on to a some subdued laughter and a smattering of applause. 
BILL MAHER What a year -- enjoy the night! 
INT. FINANCIAL FOLLIES - LATER 
Desert is served. Jackets are off, cigars are lit, Bretton's wife has gone home. The group at the table is a little drunk and having a good time. 
BRETTON WOODS It's a good question... what do you think, George? GEORGE, an investment banker at the table, thinks about it. 
GEORGE The definition of rich... flying private. The table reacts... some agree, other don't. George turns to Jacob. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Jacob... ? What do you think? 
JACOB To be rich... is to have the love of a good woman. They all boo... 
JACOB (CONT'D) (with a smile) For real... I truly believe that. And Jacob turns to Bretton... 
JACOB (CONT'D) Bretton... what's your definition of rich? An approaching voice answers it for him. 
VOICE (O.S.) To have twice as much money as you currently do. As he takes a seat... 
GORDON GEKKO Isn't that what you always say, Bretton? Then... announcing to the table... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) He brings up the question, runs it round the table then finishes with that. It's an old bit. Also announcing to the table... 
BRETTON WOODS Be careful Gordon... (looking at Jacob) ... your daughter's financial health is in my hands now. Jacob loses his smile... suddenly becoming uncomfortable. 
GORDON GEKKO That's right. 
(BEAT) And the way The Locust Fund has been buying up the insurance companies lately makes me worried about my future grandchildren's college educations. 
JACOB 
(TO BRETTON) I didn't tell him. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Leverage is sexy. 
AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART As a circle forms on Sept 16th then travels down the trend line and stops. And as a circle is formed around the Sept 24th, we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
LCD reads 4:43 am. Jacob lays awake... staring at the ceiling. 
WINNIE (O.S.) I would hear him in the kitchen. Jacob turns to see she's awake. 
JACOB I'm sorry, you have an early train. I'm going to just go to the office now. She leans up. 
WINNIE He didn't want to keep my mother awake so he'd go into the kitchen and sit there. I could hear him because my room was right up the back stairs. I'd go and sit with him sometimes. We'd eat ice cream. Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I was only eight but I could tell he was worried about something and that made me worried. (softly, almost to herself) Then the market would go back up and he would sleep through the night again. 
JACOB It's not the market, Winnie. As he sits on the edge of the bed... 
JACOB (CONT'D) It's just that I haven't been able to sleep through the night since... The thought trails off... she leans up and kisses him. 
WINNIE I wish I could tell you something was going to come along that would make it better but I can't. It's just going to take time, Jacob. A lot of time. And she looks into his eyes... 
WINNIE (CONT'D) Have you been counting Fridays? He slowly nods. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I still count Tuesdays. 
(BEAT) All seven hundred and twenty eight of them. He leans over and kisses her forehead. 
JACOB Go back to sleep. And he goes... After a beat, she sees Jacob's wallet. 
WINNIE (calling out after him) Jacob, you forgot... She jumps out of bed, grabs the wallet and goes after him, but... it opens up and Winnie notices the picture inside. And she stops, staring at that picture. Her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago. A picture she knows she never gave to Jacob. 
INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Jacob heads in and turns on Fox Business... 
BRIAN SULLIVAN (ON TV) It's a complete unmitigated bloodbath out there. The S&P tried to rally at about 10am but it was met with yet another brutal wave of selling and people... we're now at our lows for the day, the week, the month and the year. Jacob looks up at ticker on the wall. 
MCC $15.13 -3.40, ACN $10.10 -1.96, ISS $5.14 -1.89. 
And he stares at that ticker... at the The Locust Fund's methodical death. Suddenly... 
BRETTON WOODS (O.S.) Are you happy? He stands in the doorway holding a drink. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) We're done. And Bretton CHUCKS the drink against the wall and the glass shatters. Jacob takes a step back. Bretton's in a complete state as he walks over to Jacob's desk and SWIPES it clean... papers flying about. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Finished... Now he picks up the chair... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Bank notices... ... throws it against the window... which cracks. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Margin calls... As he punches the monitor of Jacob's Bloomberg... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Redemptions... And Jacob just stands there... wide-eyed. Just looking at... 
BRETTON WOODS Face full of sweat... blood all over his hand... hair strewn about... completely out of breath... bloodshot red eyes... a beaten down mess of a man. 
JACOB What happened to composure, Bretton? 
BRETTON WOODS Well, I suppose it went to hell with your fucking insurance stocks. And Bretton calms down, walks to the window. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) It's not making sense to me anymore. The market always made sense to me and for the most part... I was better than it... quicker than it. 
(MORE) 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) But it's moving too fast now and it looks like the world is going to shit anyway. And he faces Jacob Moore. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) If I unwind the fund now I'll still walk with six hundred million or so. And Jacob's face falls... this is news to him. 
JACOB What? 
BRETTON WOODS It's time to call it a day. Spend more time with my family. I suppose this moment comes for all of us. 
JACOB You still have six hundred million? Bretton vacantly nods. And Jacob Moore... trying his best to hide his disappointment... 
(BEAT) So you need get Bretton back in the game... play him off of what he really wants. And off Jacob's reaction... 
INT. 15TH STREET DINER - NIGHT 
Jacob shares a table with our Morgan Stanley Portfolio Manager. 
MORGAN PORTFOLIO MANAGER It's ugly out there dude. I wake up everyday wondering if today's the day we're going under. 
JACOB I know. But I do have something for you... And as Morgan Portfolio Manager leans forward in anticipation... 
INT. TOYOTA DEALERSHIP - DAY 
As Jacob and Hedge Fund PM walk the floor... checking out the new 2009 Prius. 
HEDGE FUND PM I was going to get the new Maserati, but... you know... Jacob slowly nods. Then... 
JACOB So I heard something earlier today... 
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY 
As Jacob jogs with our blogger from Streetaccount.com. 
BLOGGER It's so much better working out outdoors... that gym was so stuffy. 
JACOB Not to mention expensive. 
BLOGGER Right. 
JACOB So, you've obviously heard the rumor? And Blogger looks over to Jacob... he hasn't. 
INT. STREETACCOUNT.COM OFFICES - MORNING 
As our blogger from the gym sips his coffee, fires up his computer and starts to type... 
INT. THE CAPITAL FUND/NEW YORK OFFICES - MORNING 
As Hedge Fund PM stands up to present to the team with a confident smile... 
INT. MORGAN STANLEY/PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP OFFICES - MORNING 
As Morgan Portfolio receives the digital receipt... "1209 instant messages sent." 
EXT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - NIGHT 
As the cab stops outside of the building... 
INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
As the thunder claps outside. Jacob stares at the Goya painting... Saturno Devorando a sus hijos Saturn. The man being eaten alive. 
BRETTON WOODS (O.S.) I don't like unannounced visits. 
JACOB United Bancorp is going under. Wells Fargo has stepped up but the offer is insanely low. 
BRETTON WOODS I know all this. 
JACOB You still have the fund and you still have the leverage that comes with it. You want out of the game... buy a bank. Bretton skeptically regards Jacob. 
BRETTON WOODS Why are you doing this? 
JACOB Because I got you into those insurance companies... because I let you down... And Bretton... biting his lip in thought... 
BRETTON WOODS I don't like the mortgage toxic waste. It can't be quantified... and it spreads... 
JACOB I worked it out already. You wouldn't have to take it. 
BRETTON WOODS How'd you do that? 
JACOB Well, Wells won't insure the Zabel institutional money. It's against their policy. And then... 
JACOB (CONT'D) I told them you would. 
BRETTON WOODS Then who would take on the mortgage securities? 
JACOB Uncle Sam. Bretton slowly nods... taking all this in... 
BRETTON WOODS So, I'd get the bank, the KZI assets including the institutional fund yet none of the mortgage securities. As Jacob leans forward... going in for the kill... 
JACOB And how could Winnie get it now? Hadley stops walking and thinks about it. 
HADLEY Well, she'd have to sign a reversion of trust document. That way the funds would revert back to their pre-trust posture and regulations. 
JACOB So all she has to do is sign a piece of paper? 
HADLEY Basically. As that registers... 
JACOB How much is in there? 
HADLEY It's complicated. There's private equity ownership, real estate, a very large position in a bank... all sorts of investment vehicles. 
JACOB Ballpark it for me. 
HADLEY I don't know. Assuming immediate liquidity... over three hundred million. And with that, Jacob sets to go. But... 
HADLEY (CONT'D) Of course... Gordon would have to sign the document as well. 
AND GORDON GEKKO In the make-up chair of the Fox Business channel green room, speaks into his phone. 
GORDON GEKKO You also would need the trust's executor to sign it. 
INTERCUT WITH... Jacob as he walks down 5th avenue... 
JACOB Who is that? 
GORDON GEKKO Sammy Redding. He's a lifelong friend. It won't be a problem. 
JACOB What about you? 
GORDON GEKKO I would love to sign it, Jacob. Consider it done. Walking down 5th avenue... 
JACOB Thank you. Thank you, Gordon. 
GORDON GEKKO Just after you agree to two things. 
JACOB Anything. 
GORDON GEKKO Before Bretton buys the bank, he must use all of Winnie's money and all the Locust Fund's leverage to go against the market. They're about to pass this bailout and I want to be on the other side of it. 
(BEAT) This thing's going to hell in a bucket and I'm sick of being on sidelines, Pal. 
JACOB But what about-- 
GORDON GEKKO It's just for a few weeks then it's right back to our plan. 
Accepting that... 
JACOB Okay. 
(AND THEN) What's the second thing... ? And as that hangs... 
WINNIE GEKKO As she starts to sign the forms... we're in... 
INT. MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & MCCLOY/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Silence. A clock ticks. A large table. Three LAWYERS sit on one side. Winnie and Jacob on the other and Gordon at the head. Winnie finishes signing the forms then slides them back to Hadley who hands them to Gordon. Jacob takes her hand but she pulls it away. And after Gordon signs the papers, they all stand. Gordon just looks at Winnie, who's now looking back at him. Tears beginning to well. And he slowly opens his arms... 
GORDON GEKKO Winnie... come here... you're all I have left now. And she slowly walks over to him... to his embrace... 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) He was my only son. And I messed that up. I messed it all up, I know that. She's now crying. 
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) But please... forgive me... And confirming through her tears... 
WINNIE You always get what you want, Dad. And Jacob Moore... witnessing this strange reunion... realizing how right she is... 
INT. JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jacob's on the phone in his office, watching coverage of a vote on the Senate floor... 
JACOB (into his phone) Okay, it looks like this bailout's going to pass... 
SPLIT THE SCREEN Robby, with a phone to his ear... 
JACOB (CONT'D) (into his phone) ... there's going to be an initial bounce... 
SPLIT THE SCREEN AGAIN... AND AGAIN... AND AGAIN... Each time to another broker with a phone to their ear... our six brokers from before... 
WINNIE I knew. 
JACOB You knew? 
WINNIE I saw the picture in your wallet. 
JACOB Then why didn't you say anything? 
WINNIE Because I wanted to give you a chance to say something first. 
(BEAT) Because I love you, I really do. She takes off the "fuck you" ring... 
WINNIE (CONT'D) And because I desperately wanted to find something in you to believe in. (shaking her head in 
DISAPPOINTMENT) But Jacob... you've become that exact thing I've been trying to master... ... and places it into his palm. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) ... you've become him. 
INT. MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & MCCLOY OFFICES - MORNING 
Hadley sits behind his desk. 
HADLEY It's completely legal, Jacob. The funds reverted back to the pre-trust posture... that means the money was technically Gordon's again. Hadley just shrugs... 
JACOB But he's not allowed to trade. 
HADLEY He didn't trade. 
JACOB He put the money into the hedge fund, that's considered capital investment. 
HADLEY Jacob, Gordon never put the money into a hedge fund. He simply took control of the bank. 
JACOB Bank? What bank? 
HADLEY Hudson River. I told you about the position in the bank. Jacob's stunned... 
JACOB Hudson River... ? I don't understand. 
SLAM INTO/BUCHANAN NEW YORK A sleepy town... 
HADLEY (V.O.) Well, Gordon had placed his Hudson River shares into the trust before he was convicted. You do know he started out there? A rental car parks out front of a small bank. Jacob emerges and heads for the bank... 
HADLEY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Okay, then the trust aggressively acquired more shares about two years ago... enough to have a controlling position in the bank. And Jacob stops walking when he sees... a group of angry depositors forming outside and a sign hanging in the doorway... "Closed." 
AND RIGHT BACK TO Jacob and Hadley... 
JACOB But how? Gordon wasn't allowed to control the trust. 
HADLEY That's right. All of the trust's moves were made by its executor. 
JACOB Sammy Redding? Confused... 
HADLEY Sammy Redding? Who the hell is Sammy Redding? 
(BEAT) Jacob, the executor of Winnie's trust has always been Bretton Woods. And as that slams into Jacob Moore... 
INT. BOEING 767 - NIGHT 
As Jacob takes his seat and settles in for the long flight. He's flying commercial... and in coach. 
EXT. LONDON - DAY 
It's raining and gray. 
INT. REDMAYNE AND BENTLEY BROKERAGE - DAY 
As Jacob walks the hallowed halls of this old school stock brokerage with the MANAGER... 
JACOB So we're throwing Bretton's birthday party at Balmoral. 
MANAGER Well, we're very proud to have such a resounding success hail from these hallowed halls I assure you. 
(BEAT) We've been trying to get Bretton to come back and speak to our younger brokers, but... he's a hard man to reach. 
JACOB That's funny because he often speaks about his days here at Redmayne and Bentley... anyway, what I'm hoping you can help me with were records of his early trades. Years ago. 
(BEAT) We think it'll be fun to bring up some of Bretton's real losers from when he was starting out... you know we all have dogs.

FADE IN: 
EXT. THE PLANET - MORNING 
Huge mountains, destroyed STRUCTURES. Buildings enveloped by flows of earth. Awe-inspiring beauty. 
JACK (V.O.) They arrived almost half a century ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you want to call them. Their idea of how-do-you-do was to blow up our moon. 
Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and concrete. Telephone polls half-buried in sand. 
JACK (V.O.) Without her moon, the earth went insane. Most were killed in the floods, as the cities came down, as everything caught fire. A year later their ground troops landed, to exterminate whoever was left. A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A child's plastic flip-flops on the dash. 
JACK (V.0.) They were probably surprised, what we were willing to do, to survive. We used the nukes. 
(BEAT) We won the war, but lost the planet. 
Low on the HORIZON, the TET rises with the sun. It's a WHITE TETRAHEDRON (SIX-SIDED) SPACE STATION that circles the earth once a day, like an artificial moon. 
JACK (V.0.) Humanity had to flee the Earth. We had to unlearn what it meant, to call something our home. Now we live on the Tet, our man-made moon. A temporary home before the next step. Everyone's there now. 
(BEAT) Well, almost everyone. 
INT. BEDROOOM - MORNING 
An ALARM chirps. A man's hand reaches out of bed, silences it. The MAN swings his feet onto the floor. He sits with his face in his hands, waking up. We hear a SHOWER RUNNING. He looks up. A WOMAN showers near him, only steamed glass walls between them. She sees him, smiles at him, without modesty. He looks back at her. OVER TITLES. We watch a familiar morning routine: 
INT. A HOME - MORNING 
BATHROOM. The man flicks on a light, stares at himself in the mirror. This is JACK. Early 40's, a good face that enjoys rugged living. Tan and weathered skin. His eyes are curious, kind, almost child-like. The woman squeezes in next to him, VICTORIA. 30s, a tom- boy shock of red hair, towel around her neck. She brushes her teeth. 
KITCHEN. Victoria watches the coffee drip, bites toast. SHOWER. Jack lets warm water blast him in the face. READY ROOM. Jack pulls a worn high-tech workman's suit from a locker, revealing a photo taped to the door: It's of him and Victoria, younger, in a white-walled high-tech corridor, smiling eager at the camera. He stares at it for a moment, closes the locker door. KITCHEN. Victoria hands Jack his coffee. He kisses the top of her head, heads out to work. 
EXT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS 
He walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched 1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds. As our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass- walled home towards his BUBBLESHIP, a futuristic-cross between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we CRANE UP UP UP... INCREDIBLE VERTIGO until we're looking down at this impossible structure. Jack, climbing into his ship. 
TITLE CARD: "OBLIVION" 
EXT. THE SKY - DAY 
The SKY stretches to infinity above roiling planetary cloud-cover. The BUBBLESHIP streaks through our frame, dropping faster than free fall. 
INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS 
VICTORIA Would you like to set a course to reserve fuel? 
JACK 
(SMALL SMILE) Absolutely not. Bar gaucre hits top. Jack punches it. JACK vibrates in his seat, pinned back. The ship SCREAMS over the surface, following the signal. Now A HUGE CRATER opens up in front of him which he DROPS INTO, barely missing an edge... which seems to have architecture to it. The ship skims close along the walls which are revealed to be rows and rows of stadium seats, half buried in sand. We're in Giants Stadium, New Jersey. Old news to Jack. He surveys below... 
JACK (CONT'D) I see it, looks like full mid- flight impact. What was its last destination? BELOW, through blowing dust, we see a DRONE, a spherical mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand. 
VICTORIA Yo no se. No data. It's not transmitting. (checking the map) Tet coverage will go live in 11 minutes. Jack stares forward at a huge broken sign: "Home of the 2015 World Champions..." 
JACK You know, I actually read about this game. Giants are literally on their own seven with 25 seconds on the clock... 
VICTORIA Please do not reminisce on my Comm, thank you very much. He puts the Bubbleship into a soft descent. Victoria observes it on her console. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Negative, technician. I have no eyes in the sky for another ten minutes. Do not land. SEEN FROM INSIDE A STADIUM TUNNEL: The bubbleship lands thirty yards from the Drone, moors itself by setting spikes from its skids. Blowing sand whips around both. 
INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS 
JACK grabs an old YANKEES CAP from between the seats and slides it on backwards. He hoists a WEAPON, a carbine- sized gun on a sling, and checks its charge as he slides the door open. He's BLASTED with sand and wind which now suddenly still, like a freight train that's passed. 
JACK Anyway... QB lets off this mile- high bomb... The weather's fast and erratic like this. As Jack starts moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding it in grey. There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on earth... 
JACK (CONT'D) The thing just sails the length of the field. Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's "vision" still not covering Jack's location. 
VICTORIA Jack I have no scope. The Tet is still offline. He pauses. A faint sound on the wind... like a whine. 
JACK And at the one yard line... interception. Devastation. It's all over. 
EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS 
LIGHTS connected to the ship's two AUTOMATIC GUNS reach from the hull of the BUBBLESHIP, backlighting JACK as he reaches the downed drone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: THE DRONE, a spectacular piece of technology, has landed hard, half-buried in the sand. The basic electronics are still humming, cycling. 
JACK But the guy's too eager. He starts running it back. Everyone's yelling "Fall down, just fall down!" Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone. 
JACK (CONT'D) Huh... The fuel-cell has been taken. 
VICTORIA What do you mean taken? Was it a malfunction? Jack looks at the casing... beaten, pried open? He glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels. REVERSE ANGLE. From inside a caved-in tunnel entrance, Jack looks small, vulnerable. Something watches Jack... 
JACK No... It's a master drone, too. 166. Looks like it was hit mid flight, managed to limp its way here. Watch my back, I'm starting field repair. INTERCUT: VICTORIA AT SKY TOWER. Glances at the arc of the Tet's vision - still six minutes away. 
JACK (CONT'D) Bob, I'm going to need a cell. AT THE BUBBLESHIP. An exterior compartment opens revealing spare parts, etc... At the same time, a small ROVER, an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from the ship, sprouting wheels... 
VICTORIA Jack, you need to get out of there. Bring it home to the shop. Jack has a panel open. He pulls a lead from the sleeve of his suit, connects it to a board. We see FLIGHT DATA transfer to the Bubbleship. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
JACK So the guy keeps running. 30, 40, 50 yards and BAM! He gets pasted. Ball goes loose... 
VICTORIA Jack, you know they can weaponize a fuel cell. Now a DRIVER shoots out of the tool cuff of his suit. 
Jack starts to hang up his workman's suit, pauses to stare at the photo of a younger him and Victoria on the Tet. They look so eager, so innocent. He shifts slightly to where he can see out to the Tet itself, sinking below the horizon. 
INT. SKY TOWER 2, WORK AREA - DUSK 
The area is devoted to DRONE REPAIR. Lifts, parts, shelves, odds and ends of gear and weaponry, tables of tools, a written-off DRONE at the back. Jack comes in, glances at his newest arrival, the self- beached DRONE 166. Even deactivated, it looks like trouble, like pure evil. He opens a drawer, slips THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS into the drawer, shuts it. 
INT. SKY TOWER, LIVING AREA - DUSK 
We finally see the whole thing. It couldn't be more comfortable, although it continually vibrates in the wind: VICTORIA is sitting, reading her own work notes. In the background, Chaplin's "Modern Times" plays silently on a large screen. JACK goes up behind her and kisses her on the head. 
VICTORIA (not looking at him) You're not supposed to bring up surface items. JACK sips water, then waits even longer before... 
JACK No. I'm not supposed to bring them in the house. He's right. He exchanges his water for a glass of something stronger, and goes and sits down. 
VICTORIA I tried to reach you earlier... If we're going to be an effective 
TEAM -- 
JACK You're right. 
VICTORIA Then you can't just -- Jack leaps up, only to return a second later with a small bundle held together by an old rag. He hands it to her, pleased, watching her reaction. She opens it to reveal a small GREEN SEEDLING in a pocket of fresh, rich soil. Her eyes play over it... 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Where did you find this? 
JACK Ah-ha. So it's okay when I bring you something. But if I -- She MOVES suddenly, opening one of the glass doors of the Sky Tower and heading outside where she holds the seedling away from her body, off the edge, lets it drop. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She comes back in, washes her hands in the sink, upset. 
JACK (CONT'D) Was that really necessary? 
VICTORIA I know you think I'm a stickler for the rules, but you have no idea what sort of toxins could be in something like that. He chuckles... 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I don't think it's funny. 
JACK It was just a plant, Victoria. 
VICTORIA That's not the point. We have two more months and the last thing we need is you putting it all at risk. He shakes his head, grimaces as he limps away. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) 
(CONCERNED) You're hurt. What happened? He admits it with a glance, offers no explanation. She comes over to him, examines the wound professionally. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Come on. 
TNT. INFIRMARY BAY - DUSK It is tiny, but state of the art. VICTORIA seriously examines his wound, cleaning it out. It's no small wound but they're less concerned than we would be. Victoria pulls on gloves, opens cabinet and removes a watery substance as well as a small electronic wand. She smears the substance onto his wound, a HEALANT. 
VICTORIA This is gonna pinch a little... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK Hit me. She activates the wand, shines ultra violet light onto the substance. A beat, then he BENDS OVER in pain. Through the healant we see the FLESH begin to knit and repair. Skin and sinew literally regenerating... to new. 
VICTORIA 
(AFFECTIONATE) Serves you right. She kisses him on the forehead, turns away. 
JACK It's awful. Just thinking about it, I get afraid... She LAUGHS, reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower. They watch it disappear into the darkness below. 
JACK (CONT'D) Ocops. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
VICTORIA 
(SUDDENLY) I've been happy here. With you. (watches water fall from her hand) I can't remember zero gravity. Physically. Can you? 
JACK Here, let me show you... He reaches up PULLS her into the pool. She screams, laughing as she goes in. She surfaces, pulling her soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side. 
VICTORIA I should have seen that coming. Jack smiles, then takes a breath and goes under. He floats face-down, staring through the bottom of the pool into the lightening-stung clouds below... .and then Victoria's form glides underneath him, looking up at him, smiling. She stops moving and her body rises towards his. He opens his arms, and she floats up and against him. They embrace, kiss... Two bodies, intertwined underwater, a thousand feet above a roiling thunderstorm. Their lips part, he pulls back to look at her ... But it's the BRUNETTE WOMAN who stares back at him!! 
INT. SKY TOWER, BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT 
Jack wakes, breathless, troubled. He doesn't know this woman who invades his dreams... Next to him, Victoria lies asleep, curled in the sheets. Shaken, he quietly gets up, grabs clothes... and goes where he goes when Victoria is asleep... 
INT. SKY TOWER, WORKSHOP AREA - NIGHT 
Jack moves to a BENCH where he keeps his finds... a few coins, a watch, a pistol, a snow globe showing the Nativity. A book: THE LAYS OF ANCIENT ROME. JACK produces his newest find from the library: THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS. He opens it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: . He was three years old when he took this earliest step in education; a lesson of color. The second followed soon; a lesson of taste... ON HIS EYES as he reads: . he remembered quite clearly his aunt entering the sick room bearing in her hand a saucer with a baked apple. He puts the book down, strangely troubled. 
TNT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - LATE NIGHT The console sits inert, unattended. Suddenly, a BLIP radiates on the MAP, its origin elsewhere. A signal. 
EXT. DEEP SPACE - NO TIME 
A NASA SHUTTLE floats in deep space, a recognizable design from our time. 
INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - NO TIME 
Empty, dark. Frozen crystalline dust hangs in the air. The ship is dead. Suddenly a panel "blips" on. Other systems go active. The ship is waking up. There's a VISIBLE RUMBLE as the engines prime... FURTHER BACK, in the hold. ROWS OF DELTA SLEEP PODS. We close on one... 
AND THE SHUTTLE'S GIANT ENGINES ERUPT IN FIRE. 
INT. SKY TOWER, BEDROOM - MORNING 
Jack's eyes blink open, waking from another dream. He sits up, troubled. 
EXT. SKY TOWER - DAWN 
Victoria works in her GARDEN. She grows perfect, blemishless ROSES. The roof is open to the sky. Victoria makes a small depression in the earth, taps three seeds out of a labeled envelope. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JACK comes through, kisses her. Then moves off towards his work. 
VICTORIA Don't go out today until we get a signal. Jack looks back. She's never said this before. She's genuinely worried. 
JACK .Then what would you say in your report? Victoria looks away, stuck. 
JACK (CONT'D) I can't get to a site fast enough unless I'm already out there. You know that. He turns, disappears through the glass mechanical doors. 
EXT. SKY TOWER - MOMENTS LATER 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He notices an old PAY TELESCOPE next to him, bent and rusted. He puts his eyes to the lenses. Nothing. Black. He STARES at the 25-cent slot on top, lost in a deep sense of Deja-Vu... 
VICTORIA Jack, you're right on top of it. What do you see? Jack starts a circuit of the deck. A pile of old deck chairs in his way, he pushes at them with his foot... finds a WIRE, running below them, linked to two CAR BATTERIES, hidden under the rubbish. He traces the path of the wire... up. 
EXT. TOP OF THE ESB ANTENAE - LATER 
JACK has made an arduous climb to discover a TRANSMITTER, hooked to an old MILITARY REPEATER, and both hooked to... we look up as Jack does... the RUSTED, DAMAGED, ESB Antenna atop the building. 
JACK Bob, give me audible on this signal. Almost immediately from the Bubbleship comes the intermittent electronic SQUACK of the signal. 
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER 
At the bubbleship, Jack watches the frequency analysis of the signal play on his heads-up. He touches the screen and the signal goes quiet. 
VICTORIA What did you find? 
JACK It's an old radio system. It's been reactivated. 
VICTORIA Define reactivated. Jack looks at the batteries, the wire... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Jack, that signal's going out over the whole territory. You need to blow the structure. 
JACK It's the Empire State -- 
VICTORIA It's ancient history, Jack. You know the procedure. Blow it. He pulls several CHARGES from the Bubbleship's storage, starts to set them... He pauses, staring at the railing, the old telescope. Change of plans. He walks towards the batteries, a blade sliding out of the cuff of his suit. He reaches them and SEVERS the lines. The signal dies. 
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER 
The Bubbleship lifts off. Jack can't help staring down at the Observation Deck as the ship lifts into the air. 
TNT. BUBBLESHIP - DAY Jack is in the air, troubled. Up ahead in the distance we see a LARGE NATURAL RIDGE. Some instruments light up. 
VICTORIA Check your course, you're headed right at the border. 
JACK Yeah, I may have seen another drone trap... 
INTERCUT VICTORIA She checks her map. Jack's Bubbleship is headed straight at a large red swath of territory marked out, toxic radiation levels constantly monitored. A small ALARM goes off in the Bubbleship cabin. 
VICTORIA You're at the edge of range, Jack. You're starting to break up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK It's okay -- 
VICTORIA 
(SERIOUS) No, it's not okay. You get in too close that radiation -- 
JACK -- will cook me from the inside before I know it. Don't worry, I'm still more than five clicks from the beacons... IN THE BUBBLESHIP. A BIGGER ALARM goes off, Red skull- and-crossbones flash across the heads-up. Jack DIVES the ship, down over huge rocky outcroppings. Jack, intent on piloting. Static. Some GARBLED SOUNDS. Victoria's voice barely coming through. 
VICTORIA What are -- you ---- out there Jack? The signal goes to pure static as Jack steers into a steep canyon, rock on all sides. Barely room to squeeze, but Jack's not worried. This is all familiar. 
ON VICTORIA... 
EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY 
Jack folds the page of his book, stuffs it in his cargo pocket and walks down to the water sparkling over stones. Motion catches his attention. It's the ROVER, approaching with the basketball. 
JACK So, um... Victoria. The ROVER shifts, confused. 
JACK (CONT'D) I was thinking, when our tour is up, maybe we'd stay. We could put in for another -- Wait, wait. Stop yelling. Hear me out. No, don't throw that, that's a... The ROVER turns around. Jack smiles at the poor machine's confusion. The smile dying... this is serious. 
JACK (CONT'D) Maybe you should go, and I should stay... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The ROVER leaves, obedient. Jack watches it go, sad. He's spoken the words. He lies back on the bank, looks at the clouds rolling overhead. 
JACK (CONT'D) I should stay... His eyes... close. 
INT. JACK'S DREAMS - VARIOUS 
---- AN ELEVATOR. It climbs a gantry towards a SHUTTLE. POV looks over, sees a YOUNGER VICTORIA, who smiles back, nervous... -- A GLASS CARAPACE. A WOMAN'S FACE inside. The same Brunette woman. Her eyes open, she SMILES WITH LOVE... .then SCREAMING! JACK'S POV SPINS as A SCAV looms through ORANGE LIGHT and DUST, snarling with its electronic squeal... 
WOMAN'S VOICE 
JACK!!! JACK's eyes snap open. It is much later in the day. He scrambles to his feet, breathing hard, remembering SOMETHING... something desperate... 
BOOM! What appears to be A METEOR streaks across the sky, leaving a trail of flame and white smoke. Jack grabs his binocs and traces the meteor path... resolves it just barely as the shuttle, crashing down. It disappears over a rise, a beat, then a FIERY 
EXPLOSION. 
JACK Bob! Let's get going! The Bubbleship is already powering up by the time Jack piles in. He touches a control and the ship shoots up into the air. 
INT. BUBBLESHIP - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack sets a course towards the smoke on the horizon. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK Vika? Vika, did you get that? An object hit near here. A ship. 
VICTORIA Where the hell have you been? Jack's silent, not wanting to lie. INTERCUT VICTORIA, looking at streaming info from TET. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) (tense, professional) It's an external. An alien ship. It's a God damn Scav vessel in the Western Valley. 
JACK I saw it through optics in the last minute. I'm not sure it was alien. 
VICTORIA Turn around, Jack. The Drones will handle the situation. 
JACK The Drones'll kill anything that moves. 
VICTORIA Just for once wait for your orders on this one, Jack. This is serious. Jack is silent, unsure. The crash site growing closer... 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Technician. This is your Control. Turn around. 
JACK Vika... 
VICTORIA You heard me. Another hard beat. Jack hating this but... 
CONTINUED: A high-tech, high-powered RIFLE rests in two alien- armored hands. Like a metal-coated insect tarsus (barbed feet of a fly). The alien begins to depress the trigger... Then another tarsus presses the barrel down. Don't. Don't fire. SHIFTING OVER: Close on an ALIEN. Our first real look, still too close to truly comprehend. Thick stubbled hair armored with metal, bones; A head-dress of authority. Behind layers of dusted cracked goggles, the older alien eye... blinks. 
EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS 
JACK reaches the Bubbleship, heaves the Delta Pod onto the carrier which immediately secures it with armatures designed to carry damaged drones. JACK steals another look at the sleeping face of the WOMAN. He touches the glass, wiping away soot and dust. 
JACK It's you... 
SEEN FROM FAR AWAY The Bubbleship flies up and up, The DELTA SLEEP POD securely hanging from its belly, carrying Jack and this mysterious woman away into the evening sky. 
EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - SUNSET 
The WIND is wild and brutal. As the Bubbleship touches down, CLAMPS snap on the landing skids. Jack is in motion, bursting out of the ship. He glances up. Victoria stands behind the glass of the Sky Tower living room, staring at him. THUNK. He releases the armature. HAULS the Pod with him towards the house. HAMMERS ON THE GLASS. 
JACK Open it! Victoria obeys, opens the glass doors. WIND fills the living room as Jack hauls the Pod in. Then Victoria touches a control and the walls SEAL. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK (CONT'D) The drones tried to kill her. They destroyed the other survivors. 
VICTORIA 
(RATIONALIZING) Well it didn't recognize her. It's machinery. It's programmed 
MACHINERY -- 
JACK She came off a NASA shuttle. The drones were specifically targeting the pods -- 
VICTORIA I don't know what the machinery did or didn't do. There's protocol... 
JACK Protocol? Protocol?! Who's the machinery now, Victoria? VICTORIA stares at him. Then retreats from the question into the task at hand. She kneels by the Pod. 
VICTORIA Go get the cutter, and a breather, and my big bag. Now. The Pod's been damaged, she's not doing well, let's get her out of there. Jack moves. Victoria, almost holds back, but... 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) .This has to be reported. HE SPINS. Stares at her. Really angry. 
JACK I know it does. And when we report it, we'll also report that drones slaughtered the other human survivors from one of our ships. See what they make of that. He goes for the equipment. Victoria stares at the woman's face, deeply unsettled... Jack returns with Victoria's bag, and firing up a CUTTER. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
VICTORIA Right there, be careful... Jack directs the blue arc towards a seal. The Pod depressurizes with a sudden exhale of dead air. Jack pulls back the pod door. Inside, the woman lies in a gauzy sleep suit. Her hair is matted. Her body looks frail, her skin translucent, veins dark, lips blue, like a drowning victim. Vika pulls her feeding tube, takes her pulse, checks her eyes, lifting the lids. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Lift her up, we have to get some air into her. JACK gets his arms around the woman, pulling her upwards. FLUID seeps from her mouth... And suddenly she's ALIVE, COUGHING, spewing fluid across Jack and the floor. He sets her down as she painfully wretches, then SUCKS IN AIR. Her eyes flutter open. She's suddenly violently ill again. Instinctively, Jack goes to hold her -- 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) 
(PROFESSIONAL) No. Don't. Let her get the fluid out. The woman stops heaving. Looks up at both of them... She tries to stand, disoriented by the glass walls, the infinite vertigo that surrounds them. She falls to her knees and stares with amazement down into the clouds. Jack kneels beside her, puts a hand on her shoulder. 
JACK You're safe. You're in a skytower, on Earth. 
WOMAN .Jack. Victoria gives a sharp look at Jack. He's stunned. Now completely exhausted, the woman SLUMPS into unconsciousness. Jack catches her. Victoria comes close, slides an oxygen breather mask over her face. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
JACK It's a Greek funeral vase. Which I want my ashes in, incidentally. Victoria collects the dishes, heads for the kitchen. 
JACK (CONT'D) I just think we need to know why. 
VICTORIA Jack, please. This isn't why we're here. This is just what we have to do before our real lives begin. We've given them five years and now we get to go home. 
(BEAT) So just leave this alone. It's not our job. 
JACK And what if I can't? They stare at each other, each obscurely frightened. 
EXT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT 
Julia sleeps, a mask taped to her face, oxygen hissing. Jack watches her. Now cleaned and dry, there's a natural, earthy, freckled beauty to her. Air passing peacefully through her lips, now returned to color. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jack reaches out to brushes hair from her face. He notices the outline of a necklace with a pendant under her nightgown. 
INT. SKY TOWER, KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Victoria sets dishes in a dishwasher. She stops. She can see Jack in the Infirmary, staring at Julia. 
INT. WORKSHOP AREA - NIGHT 
DRONE 166 sits in its hub, repaired. Jack replaces a panel, moves to a laptop and activates the drone. It POWERS UP, rising fast, bringing its canons around. We should be afraid, very afraid, that something is wrong with it. It SCANS Jack, as menacing as ever. But something's changed in Jack. He just stares back at it. Beat. Then the DRONE FIRES itself off into the black clouds, disappearing towards the earth below. Jack stares after it; then he turns, looks across empty space to the underside of the glass pool. Victoria has just dived in. She swims laps, kicking hard, bubblestreams peeling across her body. Exercise, not pleasure. 
EXT. SKY TOWER, POOLSIDE - NIGHT 
Jack stands at the end of the pool, watches Victoria stoke powerfully towards him. She sees him as she reaches the edge, stops, looking up at him. This is important, something Jack's been wanting to say for a long time: 
JACK I read these books, of what it was like down here, before... He sits, his legs dangling into the water. She pulls up close, her arms on the side. 
JACK (CONT'D) In this one book I was reading, a man describes being a child. He remembers a yellow kitchen, a baked apple. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VICTORIA I know. That was the world before. Your little obsession... 
JACK What was so wonderful about life on the Tet? She looks away... 
JACK (CONT'D) When our time is up next month. I want to put in for one more tour. Victoria pushes off from the side, drifts back... 
JACK (CONT'D) It's almost all gone, Victoria. I want to be here for the end. She turns, resumes swimming laps. Hard, driving through the water. He watches her for a moment, then turns away. 
INT. SKY TOWER - NIGHT 
Victoria comes in from the pool. She can see Jack in the bedroom, sitting on the bed, his back to her. She moves into the Infirmary, moves to Julia and checks her IV drip. She starts to adjust it, stops. She stares down at Julia. 
INT. SKY TOWER, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Victoria comes in from the infirmary. She opens a closet, changes into a night shirt. 
JACK 
VIKA -- She turns and grabs him, desperate. 
VICTORIA Please. Please. Don't you understand? We have a chance to be on the first boats out, to be the first to settle Mars, raise a family. Five years. Proof that we are an effective team. 
JACK Funnily enough, you've found your man. 
JULIA 
(SMILING) Have I? An awkward beat, then: 
JACK How did you know my name? 
JULIA .You look like someone I once knew. (extending her hand) I understand I owe you my life. Thank you, Jack. They shake. A weird moment. She breaks away, looks back at the Tet which now glows a pale orange on the horizon. 
JULIA (CONT'D) What happens now? 
JACK In a few hours, the Tet will come online. Victoria will report your rescue and I imagine they'll send someone down for you. 
JULIA From... the `Pet? 
JACK Yes. She gestures out to the Bubbleship on its pad. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 3) 
JULIA You fly that thing? 
JACK .You could say that. She SMILES, pleased. A twinkle in her eye... 
JULIA Alright then. Don't you want to know? 
EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - EARLY MORNING 
JACK and JULIA are suited up, ready to go. The Tetis still low and far on the dark horizon, silhouetted bythe first signs of sunlight growing in the East... The Bubbleship's ENGINES start up with their distinctive whine. As they head towards the ship, Victoria comes out from the house, a robe pulled on... 
VICTORIA Jack! What are you doing? 
JACK I'll bring her back before Tet- Rise. We just want to try to find the flight recorder. You can't know everything watching from a mile up. 
VICTORIA She shouldn't be -- Julia turns on Victoria, quickly. 
JULIA Thank you. I feel very well. Then, coldly, she boards the ship. 
JACK She's the flight officer, she wants. to see the wreck of her ship and secure items there. You'd want to do the same thing. 
VICTORIA Jack, please. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK Don't worry, we'll be back before you have to make your report. 
VICTORIA That's not it. I can't protect you with the Tet offline and I just have a very bad... 
JACK I'll be fine. He turns and boards. Julia is staring at her through the bubble-canopy. The bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side, plummeting towards earth. 
INT. BUBBLE SHIP - EARLY DAWN 
Jack pulls the ship out of its dive, sets course across the altered earth. Julia is STARING down, a little afraid, but darkly fascinated... Victoria's voice cuts through on the Comm. 
VICTORIA Jack... This isn't just about protocol. I'm trying to understand. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She backs off, upset, breathing hard. 
JACK Look, it doesn't matter -- 
JULIA It matters, okay!? You don't... you can't understand... I need that flight recorder. I need to know what happened. 
(BEAT) You need to know what happened. 
JACK We should stay close to... She ignores him, moves on. Deeper in the wreckage, she locates the empty moorings that held the Steel Cylinder Jack saw. It's also gone. 
JACK (CONT'D) What was it? She STARES at him, wanting to say something. Deciding not to. She leans back against a wall of the shuttle. 
INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
Victoria has tried to ignore the cam feeds, working on other things. She glances over, then away just as a FORM passes by one of the cam feeds! Victoria checks another readout, glances back as TWO MORE FORMS pass by the camera. Glimpses of metal and fur... 
VICTORIA (hitting the Comm) Jack! Jack! There's something coming your way. JACK!!" 
TNT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS Jack's Bubbleship sits silent. The COMM still switched off. Suddenly ANOTHER FORM moves through our line of sight, something's there, and CLOSE. WITH JACK and JULIA. The air still, damp. Almost no sound. She picks through the remains of the ship. He's staring at her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JULIA (without looking up) You're staring at me. 
JACK I'm sorry. INTERCUT: Victoria watches as MORE AND MORE Alien figures pass the camera feed. Moving towards Jack and Julia's position. Victoria, HELPLESS. Julia looks up at Jack, directly for the first time. He stares at her... 
JACK (CONT'D) How do I know you... ON JULIA'S FACE. Suddenly her vision racks... JACK SPINS, sees emerging out of the mist, SCAVS. A dozen of them. Alien tribesmen, bristling with weapons, war-like high-tech headdresses. Mandibles and claws. Terrifying and close. Jack reaches for his weapon, bringing it around and -- SLAM! He's hit from the side by a SCAV. Its armored body bringing him to the ground. He tries to CRAWL AWAY, sees Julia grabbed. He twists, sees Scavs crawling over the Bubbleship. 
JACK (CONT'D) Bob! HOME! In the background, the Bubbleship BLASTS OFF, Scavs falling off as Jack KICKS BACKWARDS, breaking the Scavs hold. He rolls away towards his weapon- - straight into the legs of a GIANT SCAV holding an improvised club which now comes down, IMPACTING JACK... 
INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS 
VICTORIA stares at image of the wreck growing SMALLER as the Bubbleship rises. 
VICTORIA 
JACK! JACK...! 
EXT. OPEN LAND - DAWN 
Darkness. LOUD SOUNDS. ANIMAL PANTING. Small, glimpses of earth moving by, then darkness again. Jack and Julia are tied to a huge SCAV SLED pulled by twelve FERAL DOGS. A combination of old scavenged military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world without engine-power. Giant treads roll forward as the dogs STRAIN against metallic harnesses. Jack's head lolls to the side. He blinks, looks over to see Julia next to him, unconscious. He tracks up. At the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize: The LEADER. He holds a long whip, cracks it over the dogs who haul the sled forward. We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark as we travel BACK, towards where we came from, reveal... The Bubbleship's ROVER has been following. A machine meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain. 
INT. SKY TOWER - MORNING 
Victoria hears the SOUND OF THE BUBBLESHIP, arriving. She rushes to the glass of the Sky Tower, sees the Bubbleship, docking itself. Auto pilot. No one inside. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN CANYONS - MORNING 
From far away, we see the sled wind up this rocky canyon which opens onto a massive wall of old concrete and steel. Something giant and industrial in its time. The sled approaches, seems to disappear as it moves under a shadowy outcropping of rock. In the dark underneath, huge metal doors... close. 
INT. A DARK SPACE -- NO TIME 
Almost complete blackness, just the SOUND of a slow drip of water. In the far distance, the howls and chatter of Scavs. Jack's blood-encrusted eyes blink open. Irises dilate trying to orient. He raises his head, can barely see. 
(CONTINUED) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 4) Beech moves on. Jack and Julia follow, cautiously... 
INT. GROW-HALL, RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS 
They pass into a giant area devoted to agriculture. ROWS of wide, two-story glass tubes hold PLANTS bearing fruit. Their roots are held bare, bathed only in moist air... 
BEECH We grow what we can, under the lights. It isn't much; Wheat- grass, some vegetables, what beans and soy we can. The general state of our health proves that human beings are not herbivores, but the alternative is not appetizing to anybody. 
(SARDONIC WINK) Not yet, anyway. 
JACK When we get you up to the Tet, there's plenty - 
BEECH There is? Plenty. Plenty of what? 
JACK Food.Foreveryone. 
(BEAT) Look,it'samazing you've lasted thislong.But the radiation zonesare growing. All of this, willbe gone soon. 
BEECH The zones... the area you don't patrol... 
JACK No one does. You go there --- 
BEECH -- Your organs boil from the inside. I've heard. Beech moves on, turning down another corridor. There are PAINTINGS, stacked against the walls. Picasso, Monet, Kandinsky, Warhol. SCULPTURES in piles. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: A Grand Piano is pushed in a corner, other instruments propped against it. They pass a room filled with BOOKS, another with a SCREEN mounted in front of a projector. For a moment, Jack forgets everything else. It's like his private collection at Crater Lake, but a hundred times bigger, richer... Julia stops in front of a painting of a young girl in a field of golden grass, staring towards a farmhouse on the horizon. She turns to Jack. 
JULIA It reminds me of home... 
INT. SKY TOWER, COMMAND STATION - DAY 
VICTORIA is communicating with the Tet. She has been crying, sick with worry. 
VICTORIA He's disappeared. 
(CORRECTING HERSELF) My Technical Officer, Jack Harper. He's gone. 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Time since last contact? 
VICTORIA .Six hours. 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Protocol states 24 hours before reporting a loss of contact. 
VICTORIA The Scavs took him. I witnessed it. He has a... A beat. Victoria experiencing jealousy she didn't fully understand before... 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) There's a woman with him. The survivor of the crashed shuttle, Julia Sommerville. Silence. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Prep the survivor for immediate evac. 
VICTORIA I told you, she's with the Technical Officer. I'm requesting permission to re-task the Drones for search and rescue. 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Permission granted. Victoria gets to work on the console, re-tasking Drones. Another TONE makes her look over. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BEECH It attacked us. First it destroyed our moon. Then it unleashed its primary weapon, a brilliant weapon... 
JACK I was born there! 
BEECH I was born in Chicago, Jack. I used to go to baseball games with my father. I used to get two big hot dogs, fill 'em up with relish, and mustard. Just go to town. Me and my pops, watching the sox. (quick, pressing) You have any memories like that Jack? 
JACK No, my father was a -- 
BEECH Was what? Tall? Fat? He yell at your mom? Ever go to a baseball game, Jack? 
JACK 
(GETTING ANGRY) I already told you -- 
BEECH Right, sorry. Tell me how your mother smelled. 
JACK What? 
BEECH My mother, smelled like warm fruit. Like oranges, sitting in the sun. Jack starts to speak... Stops. Beech moves to one of the scavenged DELTA SLEEP PODS, runs his hand over the embossed name-plate... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
BEECH (CONT'D) If you had looked more carefully at the wreckage of the odyssey, you would have noticed there were two empty sleep pods. The Pilot, and the Co-pilot... Jack stares at the name plate on the POD: "J. Harper." 
JULIA It was you, Jack. 
JACK What? 
JULIA You and Victoria. We were all on the Odyssey. We were supposed to make contact... 
JACK No. 
BEECH The Tet is an alien vessel, Commander Jack Harper. It came and destroyed our moon and most of humanity when it did. And ever since, with your help, it's been trying to finish the job. 
(BEAT) I'm sorry, Jack. It's not good news, I know. You've been turned to the wrong side. Beech goes to the BOMB, stares down at it 
BEECH (CONT'D) But now, with your help, we can finally destroy it. 
JACK You're insane. This is insane. He turns to Julia, but she won't help him. 
JACK (CONT'D) (to both of them) There are people up there - 
BEECH What? People like you? We are the last real people. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 3) 
BEECH (CONT'D) Pockets like this one, hiding out, dying. Probably all over the planet. Beech raises his gaze to Jack. Deadly serious. 
BEECH (CONT'D) We didn't win the war, Jack. We lost. These words hit Jack. He starts to reply, finds he can't. Beech approaches, fatherly, gentle. 
JACK I can fix this. 
BEECH Well, you're the repairman. Jack powers up the bike and gets on. He looks at Julia who hesitates, then she climbs on the back of the bike. 
JACK I'll get to the antenna, send a signal with my location. The Tet will call off the search. .You should be safe, for now. Jack starts to go. 
BEECH Jack... What if I told you that I had been to your radiation zones. And what I found there... Would change everything you think you know about the world. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jack looks at him, hearing this. Then GUNS the bike. Beech stares after them, the rooster-tail of Jack's bike racing away across the ruined landscape. 
SYKES What makes you think he's any different from the others? Beech stares at him a moment, then back out. 
BEECH She does. Beech turns away. 
EXT. THE RUINED EARTH - DAY 
Jack pilots the electric bike across STAGGERING BEAUTIFUL VISTAS... LANDSCAPES OF THE IMAGINATION. On the back of the bike, Julia takes in the incredible beauty around her. Finally, in the shadow of a jagged mountain, the BIKE slows and STOPS. Jack checks the charge: it's dead. They climb off and Jack leaves the bike where it lies, headed off on foot. 
JULIA What happened...? She's staring into the distance where an old WRECK of a RESOURCE GATHERER lies shattered against a cliff-face. 
JACK The Scavs brought it down ten years ago. All. this time, I thought we were at war with the Scavs... but it turns out we were just killing each other. He turns, heads off on foot. After a moment, she follows. 
EXT. CLIFF TOP - DAY 
Jack and Julia reach the top of a high cliff, with what looks like a METAL SPIRE protruding upwards at its edge. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: We PASS OVER them, staring down a familiar 1,200-foot waterfall. Jack has returned to the top of the Empire State, this time approaching from above. Together, they climb DOWN the craggy rock face. Two tiny figures against a massive backdrop, a mortal fall below. 
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY 
Jack is the first to drop onto the cracked cement of the deck. He moves forward, pulling the plastic and camouflage off the transmitter and repeater. He gets to work on the repeater. It's old tech, hard to make it talk to the Bubbleship. Julia stands a ways off. For a moment, their gazes meet, then he continues working. 
INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - DAY 
Victoria is hard at work, processing the sound that caught her attention. She has it playing through the whole sky tower: The SOUNDS are broken, static-like, almost ALIEN. Strange and guttural. Fingers fly over controls, making adjustments. This time the sounds parse into WORDS. A male and a female voice. Almost apprehensive, she pulls an electronic filter, overlays it on the signal, which suddenly drops into perfect clarit : A recording of Jack and Victoria, from a different patrol. 
VICTORIA'S VOICE 
(LAUGHING) .And I want a dishwasher, the kind that you can put -- 
JACK'S VOICE I don't think they'll have those on Mars, Honey. 
VICTORIA'S VOICE Okay, fine. No dishwasher. How about just you. All the time. 
JACK'S VOICE Yes. When we get there. ON VICTORIA. Her face totally still. Strangely frozen in the face of this sweet little exchange... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: And then a SOB breaks from her lips. The kind you can't control. Her fingers SHAKING, BADLY, she plays the recording, puts it on a loop. 
TNT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS The voices BOOM through the Sky Tower, over and over. Frightening that their simplicity contrasts so much with the effect they are having on Victoria who moves into the main room, white as a sheet. She looks up as.. The Bubbleship lifts off from its platform and sails into the sky. She watches it go, then rushes back towards her station. 
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY 
Jack stares at the ESB Antenna, down at the repeater and the line of code he hopes he's transmitting. 
YOUNGER JACK (CONT'D) The tall billboard, with the girl on it. 
YOUNGER JULIA Oh, okay. I don't understand. YOUNGER JACK nervously produces an ENGAGEMENT RING from his pocket. 
YOUNGER JACK Now, pan to the right, slowly... 
YOUNGER JULIA'S POV - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE PANNING over as he directed, to a billboard, half-covered by a large canvas. The words "JULIA, WILL YOU MARRY ME?" clear on the canvas. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
YOUNGER JACK (CONT'D) Julia... She GASPS, looks over. There he is, holding the ring -- 
VRROOOOOM! THE SOUND OF A BUBBLE SHIP... 
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY (PRESENT) 
VROOOOMMMM! The Bubbleship RISES INTO VIEW directly in front of them. Jack, kissing Julia, tries to break away, confused, guilty. Julia holds on. She reaches to her collar, pulls free a necklace, a familiar ring dangles from it... 
JULIA There are a few pages missing, but it's the same book. 
INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Victoria stares at the screen, the image of Jack kissing Julia, then breaking away. She's strangely cold, like there's simply nothing left to feel... 
INT. BUBBLESHIP - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack pilots the ship, a tense silence between he and Julia. He checks a few readouts, then hits the Comm. 
JACK Vika, it's me. I'm... all right. I'm coming in. Don't report in to Mission, not until I get back. No response. Dead air. Julia is pressed far back in her seat, watching Jack. 
INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Victoria is still motionless. She hears Jack's calls on the Comm, does nothing. 
JACK'S VOICE .I'm 20 minutes out. A TONE makes Victoria look over. The Tet, checking in. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Mission requests status of survivor. 
VICTORIA Go to hell. Beat. Beat. 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Did not copy. 
(LONG BEAT) Have you located your partner? Vika is silent. The Tet waits for a response. It doesn't get one. Finally: 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) Are you still an effective team? 
VICTORIA 
(LIPS TREMBLING) No. A long painful silence. Tears flow without sobs. Tet Comm Status: "COMMUNICATION ENDED." Victoria. pushes away from the console, numb. As she leaves the room, we STAY on the console... which suddenly comes alive. Readouts go active, data history starts to play. The Tet is accessing everything. Visual and Voice recordings blaze by. Images, everything the Bubbleship has seen. We see the image of Raven Rock sent from the ROVER. 
INT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS 
Victoria enters the Sky Tower, staring at it as if it was all alien to her. As she moves through, she unzips her jumpsuit, steps out of it, moves on. Her shirt, then bra, land on the floor. She moves on... 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Prep the survivor for immediate evac. 
JACK Did you hear what I said? She's dead! 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) Prep the survivor for immediate evac. You will be reassigned. 
JACK I want to talk to somebody. Beat. 
THE TET (TEXT ON SCREEN) It'll be good to have you back. 
JACK DAMN YOU! I want to hear your voice! Beat. Beat. Tet Comm Status: "Communication Ended." He stares at this last transmission. Then looks up to the big map. From all over the sector, DRONES are closing on the Sky Tower. Closing on him. 
EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack comes back out, heading towards the ship. Julia puts out a hand to him. 
JACK We have to go. 
TNT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS 
Jack and Julia streak across the sky in the Bubbleship. On the heads-up display, they can clearly see the radiation border marked RED in front of them, and the two DRONES closing behind them. 
JULIA Where are we going? 
JACK Beech said to look in the radiation zones. I have to go there. 
JULIA And if he's just a crazy old man? Jack looks at her. It'd be a funny moment, but it's not. 
JACK I've been wrong about everything else. He dives the ship towards the clouds below. 
EXT. CANYON - MORNING 
Drones shoot down a canyon towards RAVEN ROCK. 
INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS 
The Bubbleship BURSTS through clouds. Up ahead, the familiar RIDGELINE is approaching... 
AND THREE DRONES WATTTNG. Jack HAULS the ship over as the Drones bear down on them OPENING UP. We recognize one: Drone 166. Canon fire ROCKS the Bubbleship, pieces blowing off. Jack REVOLVES THE CANOPY to return fire. A Drone EXPLODES but Drone 166 and another blast through the smoke, firing. 
INT. RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS 
Everything has been packed, loaded, ready to leave. Beech watches Sykes supervise the final lashing of the BOMB onto a sled. Beech gives a command and the great steel door groans OPEN, revealing... SIX DRONES, waiting. Their weapons POWERING UP. ON BEECH, a final realization washing over him. 
EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS 
Jack SPINS the ship, evading pursuit, even as he checks his heads-up, tracks the two Sky Tower Drones closing from behind. He hauls over, pursuing Drones turning with him, firing as the two Drones burst out of cloud cover FAST, MID-AIR COLLISION, two more Drones go down! Jack hits the brakes. Another Drone overshoots him, pulls up. Jack sites the Drone, starts to fire... The Bubbleship is raked with fire! Drone 166 is right on them and firing. The canopy is hit! CRACKS spider-web across it. A canon is blown clean off. Jack tries his remaining weapon. It's dead. 
WITH DRONE 166 It pulls out of an arc, ACCELERATES, closing on the Bubbleship as the Bubbleship tears away into a cloud bank, goes in. Drone 166 follows, seconds behind. Drone 166 EMERGES from the cloud bank into open air, its cannon lining on... nothing. Empty sky. It REVOLVES quickly, sensing for ... SMASH! Jack's Bubbleship IMPACTS the Drone from above, the ship's manacles designed for transporting broken Drones CLAMPING ON. Suddenly the two vessels are LOCKED. And the Drone goes wild. It's engines THRUSTING, fighting against the counter-force of the Bubbleship's engines. The Drones GUNS BLASTING in every direction, but unable to elevate to hit the Bubbleship. INSIDE THE BUBBLESHIP. Julia screams as the ship tumbles end over end. Jack stays on the controls, tracking the last Drone closing from above. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jack FORCES Drone and ship to turn, turning Drone 166's canon on the last Drone which EXPLODES. 
JACK There... He punches the throttle. The Bubbleship with Drone 166 attached blasts in the direction of A CLIFF FACE. DRONE 166 gets free of one restraint, rotates so its cannon come to bear on part of the undercarriage. OPENS UP, blasting the storage to bits... And Jack PULLS UP, just clearing the ridge, Drone 166 IMPACTING ROCK. The Drone blasts clear through, CRASHES 
ONTO VOLCANIC ROCK. 
INT. THE BUBBLESHIPP - CONTINUOUS 
JACK (CONT'D) STOP! You have to understand! You have to understand... Jack 2 throws Jack, leaps on top of him, trying to throttle him, in a full panic. Jack drives up into his gut, rolls away. 
JACK (CONT'D) We're just Drones! We're just Drones, man! You and me! Don't you get it? Don't you know? Jack 2 comes at Jack wildly, emotion over-amping technique. Jack DUCKS the blow, wraps Jack 2 up in a choke-hold. SQUEEZING... 
JACK (CONT'D) It's okay. It's going to be okay... Jack 2 goes limp, unconscious. Jack lets him go, staggers back. Everything finally processing. Then: 
JACK (CONT'D) Julia... He turns towards Julia, sees her kneeling there, holding her side. The blood seeping between her fingers... JACK runs to her as she begins to fall. She is conscious, but just barely. But still, she PULLS BACK from him. 
JULIA 
(HORRIFIED) Don't touch me. Don't She lurches away from him, body running on fear and adrenaline. Jack nods, accepting her terror of him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 3) He moves forward, lifts her up against her willand carries her to shelter among the rocky terrain closeby. 
EXT. SMALL ROCKY ENCLAVE - CONTINUOUS 
Jack sets her down. There's blood frosting her lips and her skin has gone pale. He looks back, sees the Bubbleship and Jack 2's form lying next to it. He realizes something. 
JACK I'll be back for you. 
INT. BUBBLE SHIP 2 - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack climbs in, looks around at the interior of the ship, at the similarities. He stares out at the unconscious Jack 2 in front of the ship. 
JACK 
(EMPTY WORDS) One, Two, Three. Jack Harper. A moment... then lights sparkle across the board. 
JACK (CONT'D) Okay... Let's go home. The Bubbleship 2 lifts off. 
INT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY (LATER) 
ON JACK. Making the approach. And then he sees it: Another Sky Tower, just like his. It had to be there. The Bubbleship closes on this new Sky Tower. 
EXT. SKY TOWER 2, GARDEN - DAY 
A woman we know but do not know is starting her new garden. VICTORIA 2. She looks happier, a little younger and more radiant than the Victoria we knew. It's earlier in their tour. Victoria 2 looks up as the Bubbleship lands. SMILES as Jack gets out and crosses the bridge towards her. 
VICTORIA 2 You're early... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: As he approaches she notices his damaged environmental suit. 
VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D) What happened out there? I lost contact. JACK stares at her, heartbroken. 
JACK .Just a bit of a dust up. 
VICTORIA 2 Are you all right? He nods. She comes over to him. He marvels at her beauty, the simplicity of life here... 
VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D) 
(SELF-CONSCIOUS) .What? She comes close, brushes his hair away from his forehead. 
VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D) You dreamed a lot last night. I was thinking, you have to start writing them down. 
JACK I cut myself, I just came by for... 
Our Jack sits at the controls, the Tet now similarly massive in front of him, blotting out all other sight. He glances at the Bobblehead, which trembles from the ship's engines. 
JACK It's okay Bob, I'm scared too. In front of him, a SLOT opens in the Tet wall. 
THE TET Enter at headway speed only. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK Entering at headway speed. He flies into the Tet, carrying the POD. 
INT. THE TET, OUTTER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 
The TET is obviously of alien manufacture. In this huge bay, other BUBBLESHIPS are being constructed, welded together, by Drones. JACK drifts above all of this. 
THE TET Leave the survivor and return to your duties. Breathable atmosphere has been provided. A PAD is illuminated for Jack to land. 
JACK 
(SMALL SMILE) Understood. Jack continues on, towards a huge DOOR. 
THE TET Leave the survivor and return to your duties. 
JACK (touching a control) You know, you made a mistake, Tet. You left me curious. 
THE TET Reverse course. Leave the -- 
JACK And right now, I want to see what you're made of... Jack GUNS his ship at the large doors, OPENING UP with canons as he does. In front of him, the door IMPLODES just as Jack's ship reaches it, passing into... 
INT. THE TET, INTERNAL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
A VAST space, miles in every direction. Jack's ships STREAKS along walls that pulse with energy... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK Do you like books, Tet!? I like books. Can I tell you something that I read? BEHIND THE BUBBLESHIP. DRONES detach from the walls of the Tet, beginning pursuit. 
JACK (CONT'D) It's a story from Rome, a very great city, that you destroyed. The Bubbleship hauls over, headed deeper into the Tet. 
EXT. RADIATION ZONE - CONTINUOUS 
Drone 166 sits inert in the sand where we last saw it. Now it RISES UP with a familiar and evil sound. It moves off, searching... 
INT. THE TET, INTERNAL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
JACK's flies as never before. Drone fire reaching him! Blasts IMPACT the Bubbleship. 
JACK There was a guy named Horatius... and he held a bridge, alone. And when they told him to run, to give up, he said -- BOOM! A drone blast EXPLODES A whole engine of the ship. The Bubbleship goes into an uncontrollable SPIN, headed straight at a WALL... 
JACK (CONT'D) He said everybody dies. The thing is, to die well... SMASH! Jack's ship IMPACTS the wall, goes halfway through. The Canopy SHATTERS. Glass and debris tear at him. 
INT. THE TET, INCUBATION CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
Jack STUMBLES OUT, badly wounded. He drags the pod off the carrier. He looks around himself, sees:

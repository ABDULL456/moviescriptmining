I swear by God this sacred oath: 
That I shall render unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich, and that I shall at all times be prepared, as a brave soldier, to give my life for this oath. 
1   BLACK                                                   1 
And from out of the blackness a voice. A man speaking in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio. Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler. 
HITLER (V.O.) My comrades. Once again - I don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life. I speak to you tonight for two reasons. First, so that you can hear my voice and know that I am unhurt. And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history... 
2   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                     2 
TITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT. 13 MARCH 1943. 
A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight. 
TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER. 
Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only movement in the frame. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie. Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp. 
Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200 Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109 fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors come to rest and, needing no introduction: 
ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS. 
(Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.) 
Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler, but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Führer marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or their waiting limo. 
To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive. Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off. 
VOICE (O.S.) It's not so much your car he doesn't trust... It's your driver. 
Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is: 
TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION. 
The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops into the limo they brought for Hitler. 
Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car. 
3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3 
Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge. 
4   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY                  4 
Long tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards. ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent. 
HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the Führer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite. We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly, deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die. When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of the room relaxes slightly and digs in. 
ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt, eating like a pig, still making notes in his book. Tresckow stares. 
TRESCKOW Managing the Führer's security must be quite an undertaking. 
BRANDT (in between mouthfuls) Irregularity is the Führer's precaution of choice. 
TRESCKOW I can assure you he's safe here. Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal. 
Brandt's look says, "Don't be ridiculous." He cleans his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth, takes out his datebook and starts writing - once again the precise man we saw on the airfield. 
TRESCKOW (CONT'D) I understand you're returning to Berlin this afternoon... 
Brandt nods. 
TRESCKOW (CONT'D) Could I trouble you to deliver a package to Colonel Stieff? 
Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide... 
Tresckow halts and faces Olbricht, expressionless. 
TRESCKOW What makes you think- 
OLBRICHT Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo came for him last night. 
Tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking. Olbricht hurries after him. 
OLBRICHT (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said? 
TRESCKOW The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything. Find a replacement. 
OLBRICHT There's no one we can trust. Not in Berlin. 
TRESCKOW Then stop looking in Berlin. 
Just then, they approach the final threshold, a SENTRY guards an office marked: 
COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT. 
Olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to enter when: 
SENTRY Your pistol please. 
Oh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol from its holster and handing it over. 
And with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his shoulders and enters Brandt's office. 
11   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    11 
Brandt is at his desk, writing as always. Tresckow notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. A clock ticks loudly. Imagine it. Then wait. Finally: 
Brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the gesture is almost casual. Pure formality. 
BRANDT You'll forgive me, General. This little round-up has had me writing reports all day. 
TRESKOW Round-up? 
BRANDT Dissenters. A plot against the Führer. 
Tresckow makes a good show of laughing that off. 
TRESKOW Who would even have the balls? 
BRANDT You'd be surprised, the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the Reich. 
TRESKOW Only if the Führer were dead, of course. 
BRANDT Of course. It's one thing to think you know what's right. What matters is having the strength to do it. 
Clunk. Brandt produces the package, putting it on the desk in front of him. 
BRANDT (CONT'D) Is this what you've come for? 
Pause. Staying cool, Tresckow reaches for it: 
BRANDT (CONT'D) Perhaps we should open it. 
Tresckow freezes, studies Brandt's cold smile. 
TRESCKOW I beg your pardon. 
Brandt sits back, smiles. Does he know? 
BRANDT You've come a long way. You must be thirsty. 
TRESCKOW I wonder how the Führer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty... Colonel Brandt. 
Brandt's smile fades. We can't decide why. He picks up the package carelessly. Tresckow stays cool despite the armed explosive just a few feet away. 
BRANDT I took you for another sort, General. 
And we realize he really did just want a drink. He knows nothing about what the package hides. 
TRESCKOW And I you. 
Tresckow reaches out, grabbing the package and: 
DOCTOR Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and- 
NINA I will see my husband now. 
The Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him down. He opens the door and they enter to find: 
16   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                         16 
A mass of mummy-like bandages with only small openings around the mouth and one eye. The arms and hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. No movement but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest. 
Berthold cannot look. Holding back her anguish, Nina bravely turns to the Doctor. "Well?" 
DOCTOR He's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers. The right hand has been amputated above the wrist. He's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. We... couldn't save the left eye. 
Berthold covers his face. Nina is a rock. 
NINA His ring. 
DOCTOR I don't- 
NINA He had a ring on his right hand. Where is it? 
DOCTOR I'm sorry... His hand was amputated in the field... I'm afraid- 
NINA Thank you. 
As in: "That will be all." The Doctor leaves. Nina sits beside her husband. She shows him a photo of FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN - three boys and a girl. 
Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins to tear. 
Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa. 
CLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis- initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and turns away, not wanting her husband to see. 
Berthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question, even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then: 
BERTHOLD We've lost North Africa. 
CLOSE ON: That one eye staring at us closes. 
17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER                          17 
Stauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch covering what had been his left eye. The chain with the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck. 
ANOTHER PATIENT lies motionless in the next bed. 
A man's belongings tell you more about him than he ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well worn. Beside them are his own writings - the print meticulous and flowing. Up to a certain date. After that a new, child-like hand has taken over. 
A family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa. 
Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he tries to do the buttons with the use of only three fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to watch. 
He is about to give up when he notices a figure looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities. 
STAUFFENBERG I don't know what I ever did with ten. 
Olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but Stauffenberg beats him to it. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) I'm wanted in Berlin. 
Olbricht nods. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Are you asking as a member of the High Command? 
Olbricht contemplates his answer. He carefully closes the door behind him, nervously glancing at the patient in the next bed. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) You can speak openly, General. He died just before you came in. 
Awkward moment. Finally: 
OLBRICHT We could use your help. 
STAUFFENBERG I'm a field officer. 
Olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now. 
OLBRICHT This war can't be won in the field. 
The city sleeps. An unsettling image knowing that, in war, quiet can turn to chaos in the blink of an eye. 
21   INT. TOWNHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT                            21 
Soft knocking at the front door is further muffled by heavy black-out curtains. A YOUNG OFFICER enters the frame, dousing the lights, parting the curtains and opening the door to reveal a SHADOWY FIGURE on the stoop. 
The figure steps into the half light to reveal his fresh scars and eye-patch. And from the dark quiet of the foyer we CUT TO: 
22   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 22 
Chaos. The air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh words. A DOZEN MEN - some officers, some civilians - are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once. Stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the YOUNG OFFICER who immediately ducks out again. 
Stauffenberg scans the faces in the room. We recognize Olbricht and Tresckow. With them we find... 
A distinguished gentleman in his early sixties: 
TITLES: ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN - FORMER FIELD MARSHAL OF THE MILITARY DISTRICT. FORCED OUT BY HITLER, 1938. 
Beside him is a rough-hewn, charismatic man despite his 59 years. A face millions might follow. He is: 
TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - FORMER MAYOR OF LEIPZIG. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1937. 
And finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly kind eyes, sitting outside the fight - tired and saddened by it. 
TITLES: LUDWIG BECK - FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE GERMAN ARMY. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1938. 
WITZLEBEN ...He is not a man, he's a lunatic. He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck. He has no weakness to exploit, no vice to manipulate. His only passion is complete control. How can you expect to reason with him? 
GOERDELER After this most recent failure I'd say we've no other choice. 
WITZLEBEN Confront Hitler now and you'll end up with piano wire for a neck-tie. Our only option is the central solution. 
GOERDELER He's a man like any other. Flesh and blood. Take him head on and- 
TRESCKOW I'll say this for you, Doctor... You're certainly delusional enough to take Hitler's place. 
GOERDELER (eyes narrowing) When that day comes, I'll be sure to remember you. 
TRESCKOW I doubt you'll remember much of anything. 
GOERDELER Dammit, Tresckow- 
And the shouting resumes. It is Beck who finally sees Stauffenberg. He touches Tresckow's arm. He, in turn, nudges Olbricht and so on. A moment later, the room is silent, all eyes on the Colonel. Everyone is a little embarrassed. Olbricht clears his throat: 
OLBRICHT Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry. (to Stauffenberg) Colonel, may I introduce- 
STAUFFENBERG These men need no introduction. 
Beck stands, shaking Stauffenberg's hand. 
BECK I apologize for this unfortunate... spectacle. On behalf of everyone, welc- 
But before he can finish, Beck is seized with a gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill through the room. He is very ill. 
GOERDELER (to the others) I haven't welcomed him. Not yet. Where does he stand? 
TRESCKOW For God's sake- 
GOERDELER (re: Stauffenberg) He's a field officer. He knows the army better than any of us. I want to hear his opinion. 
TRESCKOW (to Stauffenberg) All right. What do you think, Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him to resign? Or the central solution? 
But before Stauffenberg can answer: 
GOERDELER "Central Solution." You soldiers are all the same. Say what you mean. 
WITZLEBEN That's a laugh coming from a politician. 
GOERDELER The army will follow diplomats before they follow assassins. 
TRESCKOW They follow a butcher now. What difference does it- 
STAUFFENBERG What makes you think the army will follow you at all? 
The room quiets down. Beck hides a slight smile. He likes Stauffenberg already. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Oust him, kill him. That isn't what matters. How do you plan to take control of the government when Hitler is gone? 
STAUFFENBERG What are you trying to say? 
BERTHOLD I seem to remember you telling me about reports from the Ukraine - the SS forcing Jews to dig their own graves. You said then that Hitler should be removed. An officer's duty, you said. What's changed? 
STAUFFENBERG I said senior officers. The only men that can get to him. 
BERTHOLD Perhaps it doesn't matter that you succeed. 
Stauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but: 
BERTHOLD (CONT'D) Perhaps it only matters that you try. Don't you see? Someone has to stand up and show the world that not all of us were like him. 
STAUFFENBERG Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power. For God's sake, they have no plan. 
BERTHOLD Then give them one. Find a way. 
He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's arm. 
BERTHOLD (CONT'D) Evil happens when good men do nothing. 
Before Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes blasting from the phonograph O.S. The unmistakable sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. 
STAUFFENBERG Children, that is far too- 
He is cut off by the appearance of his four children, all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. They charge into the room, singing loudly and attacking their father. He does his best to defend himself with one hand. Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip. 
And you'd think that's where it ends. We even pull back, creating that effect. It takes a moment to notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is not on the phonograph. Nina hears it first, then Stauffenberg and Berthold. Finally the children freeze and the phonograph skips without their help. The glasses on the table rattle. 
Now we hear the wailing quite clearly. A siren. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Air-raid. 
The adults herd the children out of the room. Muffled concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently, turning Wagner's masterpiece into a stutter. 
28   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BASEMENT - NIGHT               28 
The family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a corner - adults holding shivering children. The bombs are closer, louder. The Wagner, the siren, the explosions fray the nerves. 
Stauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness, finding her belly. Her hand clamps around his - around their unborn child. 
BOOM. So close the children scream. Dust and debris fall from the ceiling. The needle rakes the phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning. 
CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG - on his eye. His thoughts as the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of profound realization... 
29   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            29 
Move across the room to the phonograph, looking down at the 78 spinning on the turntable. The camera begins to turn until all the world around us is spinning and only the record is still. We read one word of the title of the 78 quite clearly: 
STAUFFENBERG (V.O.) Valkyrie. 
30   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 30 
Stauffenberg faces the top members of the Resistance. 
OLBRICHT We've already considered Valkyrie. It isn't suitable. 
STAUFFENBERG Not as it's currently written. 
GOERDELER Excuse me. What is Valkyrie? 
TRESCKOW Operation Valkyrie. 
Tresckow explains even as he studies Stauffenberg, curious. What does he have in mind? 
TRESCKOW (CONT'D) The Reserve Army has thousands of men all over the city - most of them not even in uniform. Valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency. 
STAUFFENBERG Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed. 
GOERDELER And what use is that to us? 
STAUFFENBERG The orders could be rewritten. A few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command. 
OLBRICHT Yes, of course, but- 
STAUFFENBERG Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup? 
OLBRICHT They would declare a military state of emergency. 
TRESCKOW I'm appointing you military leader of the Resistance. Beck agrees. 
STAUFFENBERG But Olbricht- 
TRESCKOW We both know Olbricht hasn't the wit or the spine. No. It's you. 
A million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's mind. Fear. Anxiety. But he knows what he must do. 
TRESCKOW (CONT'D) One more thing. You were right what you said that first night. It's not enough to kill Hitler. We need to isolate his chain of command. The slightest confusion could crush us. We need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash. 
Stauffenberg considers this for a moment. 
STAUFFENBERG That greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move, but it's the only way. 
TRESCKOW How will you do it? 
STAUFFENBERG Perhaps it's better I don't say. 
Pause. A sad smile and nod from Tresckow, a moment ago he was in charge. Now he has no clearance. 
TRESCKOW God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men. 
He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's shoulder. 
TRESCKOW (CONT'D) I have a feeling that for Germany it may come down to one. 
39   INT. OFFICERS' CLUB - BERLIN - NIGHT                    39 
A wild party - a small band, German officers, plenty of women. 
In stark contrast, two GESTAPO MEN sip coffee at a corner table, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd. 
A WAITER carries a tray of drinks to a rowdy group in the corner who are immersed in the denial common to Berlin these days. The Waiter serves carefully, making sure one particular drink goes to: 
TITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - CHIEF OF THE ARMY SIGNAL CORPS. 
The group toasts and downs their booze. 
CLOSE ON: Fellgiebel's smile suddenly fades. He looks into his glass, his good mood vanishing. He politely excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and heads for the bathroom. He looks ill. 
40   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     40 
Fellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left of his drink in the basin. 
CLOSE ON: Mingling among the melting chunks of ice is a GLASS EYE staring back at him. 
He scowls in the mirror at Stauffenberg, waiting. 
FELLGIEBEL You realize how close I am to Hitler. With one word I could have the Gestapo make you disappear. 
STAUFFENBERG Why haven't you then? 
Fellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are empty. Stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) None of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of. 
FELLGIEBEL But you know. And when the SS catch you, they'll pull you apart like warm bread. It'll be a crime just to have known you then. I warn you. If it means protecting myself, I will expose you. Do not try to contact me again. 
Fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on: 
STAUFFENBERG You can't report me. Maybe if you had when I first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. But now you're just as guilty as- 
FELLGIEBEL So you think that makes me a sympathizer, eh? You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his Führer and assume his actions will show you his heart. It's not that simple. 
STAUFFENBERG It is to me. 
FELLGIEBEL For the last time, don't push me to make a decision. 
STAUFFENBERG I have no choice. It's clear now that without you we have no hope of success. 
Pause. Fellgiebel's silence speaks volumes. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) You want us to succeed. Don't you? 
FELLGIEBEL And what if you do, eh? What then? Will you be any different from Hitler? What of his Reich, his people, the very momentum of history? Will all of that let you be something he isn't? 
STAUFFENBERG No. 
Thrown, Haeften sits. Stauffenberg continues writing, ignoring him. Haeften looks up at the portrait of Hitler, startled when Stauffenberg finally speaks: 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Do you know how this war will end, Haeften? The portrait will be un- hung... And the man will be hung. 
Stauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to such frank and treasonous talk. He gets none. He sighs, too tired to play games. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Bottom line. I'm engaged in high treason with all means available to me. Can I count you in? 
And the strangest thing - a reaction no one would suspect - Haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone who has at long last found a home. 
HAEFTEN For anything, sir. Anything at all. 
STAUFFENBERG Anything is a very dangerous word. 
42   EXT. NORMANDY - VARIOUS - DAY/NIGHT                     42 
TITLES: 6 JUNE 1944. 
NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF D-DAY. Allied forces invade Normandy. The liberation of Europe has begun. 
But this is not the D-Day you learned about in history class. This is a German newsreel. Nazi spin. In it, Hitler's forces have nothing to fear. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (subtitles) The Allied Forces have blundered into the trap awaiting them on the beaches of Normandy - heroically repelled by the combined might of the German Army. It is a glorious day for the Reich. At long last the craven enemy has come to Europe to face their inevitable defeat at the hands of- 
43   INT. MILITARY SEDAN - NIGHT                             43 
HAEFTEN Five thousand ships, one-hundred thousand men from the combined Allied forces. 
Haeften and Stauffenberg ride in a sedan. Stauffenberg is in profile the entire time. 
STAUFFENBERG What about the Panzer divisions in- 
HAEFTEN They were never dispatched. Word is Hitler took a sleeping pill. His staff was afraid to wake him. 
STAUFFENBERG First Africa, now France. 
HAEFTEN The Russians bearing down from the East. 
STAUFFENBERG Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe. 
Stauffenberg rubs his forehead. The car stops. SOLDIERS are waiting outside. 
Stauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate dress uniform and carrying a leather valise. He has arrived at a meeting of great importance. 
He turns to face Haeften directly and we are surprised to see both of his eyes - for an instant the young lion he once was. But a closer look is unsettling - we see the faint scarring, one eye glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead. 
His glass eye. Stauffenberg only wore it on special occasions. This is one. 
HAEFTEN Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe he'll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still can. 
STAUFFENBERG We'll see if I can't convince him. 
44   EXT. THE BERGHOF - NIGHT                                 44 
Est. Hitler's forboding southern headquarters. 
TITLES: THE BERGHOF. 7 JUNE 1944. 
Stauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs - at the top he sees a group of WAITING ADJUTANTS quietly smoking cigarettes - a clique of devoted Nazis. In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy officer we saw outside Fromm's office. He watches Stauffenberg pass, aloof. We hate him. 
Just then Stauffenberg is greeted by TWO SS OFFICERS who move to physically search him - one his body, the other his valise. 
VOICE (O.S.) You don't need to search him. 
ANGLE ON: Fromm's adjutant, Lt. Herber approaches, waving off the SS. 
HERBER Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest. The hero of Africa. 
The SS officers stand down. Herber and Stauffenberg share a friendly smile, about to speak when Fromm walks up on them: 
FROMM For God's sake, Stauffenberg, you're- 
He pauses, clearly caught off guard when he sees Stauffenberg with two eyes. 
FROMM (CONT'D) ... they're waiting for you. 
45   INT. THE BERGHOF - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT                45 
OLBRICHT (CONT'D) This is General Olbricht. Order the Guard Battalion and all Army Schools near Berlin to take up march readiness. Stand by for Operation Valkyrie. 
CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... 
52   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY             52 
A small, bunker-like room serves as the hub of all military communications. The walls are lined with chattering teletype machines and their OPERATORS. 
CLOSE ON: One teletype in particular. The words are clicking by quickly but we clearly make out: 
STAND BY FOR OPERATION VALKYRIE... 
One SERGEANT HELM leans in, reading it, curious. He tears the sheet out of the teletype and takes it to: 
The officious LIEUTENANT HAANS - officer in charge. He likes his job and how well he does it. 
HELM (handing over the order) Lieutenant. 
HAANS What about it? 
HELM This order is calling the Reserve Army for some sort of stand-by action... in Berlin. 
HAANS (shrugs) Looks like a drill of some kind. 
HELM Valkyrie? I've never heard of that. 
HAANS Send the order through, Sergeant. 
A SHRILL WHISTLE and a WAILING SIREN take us to... 
EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY 
Shots of scattered elements of the Reserve Army coming together, taking shape: 
RESERVISTS and CADETS, from all walks of life, rush to their homes, hastily trading their civilian clothes for uniforms. 
54   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                         54 
TITLES: 15 JULY 1944. 
Stauffenberg and Haeften board a waiting courier plane, preparing for departure. Both are clutching their briefcases, faces like stone. Stauffenberg is dressed once again in his ornate, formal attire - his patch gone, glass eye in place. 
EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY 
AIR SIRENS wail. A SCULPTED EAGLE AND SWASTIKA loom over a large pillared stronghold. 
From out of the surrounding barracks, RESERVE SOLDIERS scramble to march readiness, assembling on the center parade grounds, awaiting orders. 
Vehicles move into place along the perimeter. All in all, a well-oiled machine. 
CLOSE ON THE BERLIN COMMANDANT - GENERAL PAUL VON HASE - issuing the alert signal. AIR SIRENS wail. 
RESERVE SOLDIERS scramble into readiness. Vehicles move into place - a well-oiled machine. 
We focus on two officers in particular: MAJOR OTTO ERNST REMER, Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion, and SECOND LIEUTENANT DR. HANS HAGEN. Loyal Nazis both. 
REMER What do you suppose this is all about? 
HAGEN Probably just a drill. 
But Remer doesn't seem convinced. Remember him. 
56   INT./EXT. VARIOUS - DAY                                   56 
Shots of Stauffenberg and Haeften deplaning/getting into a waiting car/slowly making their way to their destination. Finally, they arrive at: 
57   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    57 
Est. A 625 acre compound hidden deep in the mosquito infested forests of Wilhelmsdorf. Security is tight - barbed wire fencing, checkpoints, flak towers, machine gun nests, trenches, land mines. 
TITLES: WOLFSCHANZE - "THE WOLF'S LAIR". HITLER'S BAVARIAN HEADQUARTERS. 
58   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - MAIN GATE - DAY                      58 
The car carrying Stauffenberg and Haeften arrives at the first security checkpoint. 
TWO GUARDS check identity papers and confiscate pistols from Haeften and The Driver. Stauffenberg boldly extends his valise to one of the Guards, but rather than reach for it, the young soldier snaps to attention and raises his hand in a Nazi salute, eyes straight ahead, stone-like. A drone. 
OLBRICHT I can't issue Valkyrie again unless we follow through. If he fails to- 
STAUFFENBERG I'll do my job. You just take Berlin. 
INT. STAUFFENBERG'S BERLIN FLAT - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: A telephone. Stauffenberg's three fingered hand picks up the receiver and lifts it out of frame. 
STAUFFENBERG (V.O.) I'd like to place a call to Bamberg, please. 
INT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BAMBERG - NIGHT 
Nina and her children eat supper around a single candle, Bamberg is experiencing a blackout. Though Nina manages a tranquil facade she is anything but. 
ANGLE ON: The silent telephone in the foreground. We wait for it to ring, but it never does. 
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Beck enters to find Stauffenberg in the front pew, staring at Christ on the cross. 
BECK Have you made your peace with God, then? 
STAUFFENBERG As best I can. 
BECK Then you have nothing to fear. 
Stauffenberg manages a smile as Beck sits. 
STAUFFENBERG I know the soldier inside me is a traitor. I wonder how I'll be judged as a man. 
BECK By history? 
STAUFFENBERG By God. 
BECK In the end, we answer only to ourselves. 
Stauffenberg fingers the cross and ring hanging from the chain around his neck. 
BECK (CONT'D) Did you reach your wife? 
STAUFFENBERG Bombing in Ebingen. I can't get through. 
BECK Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg. They're safe. You've seen to that. (realizing...) To think... You came to us a wounded soldier from Africa. Now... Now you are both the architect and the assassin. I'm still trying to understand how this came to be. 
STAUFFENBERG (more to himself) Like a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head... 
BECK What's that? 
STAUFFENBERG Nothing... 
And the two men look up at the cross in silence. 
71   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAYBREAK                         71 
In these waking hours Berlin appears quite peaceful. Only the distant sound of shelling reminds us that the city is surrounded by war. 
72   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS             72 
A tawny leather briefcase sits on a neatly made bed. 
Stauffenberg, freshly bathed and wrapped in a towel, shaves in front of the mirror. For the first time we see his scars and deformities in full. He looks himself over, finally focusing on the chain around his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring - its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning]. 
Though his face is clean-shaven now, he continues, slowly running the razor down his throat. Then he stops, pressing the blade a little too hard and bringing blood. It almost seems intentional. 
CLOSE ON: The box that holds his glass eye, staring. 
73   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - LATER                  73 
Stauffenberg has since mastered the process of dressing himself. JUMP CUTS take us from a wounded soldier to an officer of the General Staff. 
CLOSE ON: His crisp white collar, picking up a trace of blood from the cut on his throat. 
74   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAY                              74 
TITLES: 20 JULY 1944. 6:00 AM. 
Haeften holds the door for Stauffenberg, stepping into a military sedan. 
MERTZ Put the Reserve Army on standby alert. 
OLBRICHT Not until I hear from Stauffenberg. Not until I'm sure. 
MERTZ But that's not what he- 
OLBRICHT Noted, Colonel. Thank you. 
88   EXT. AIRFIELD - RASTENBURG - DAY                          88 
The plane touches down and taxis to a stop. Stauffenberg and Haeften deplane and immediately step into a waiting courier car driven by a young, dutiful Nazi. SECOND LIEUTENANT KRETZ. Remember him. 
89   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    89 
Even this early, the heat is oppressive. 
We watch from a distance as the courier car is stopped at the outer checkpoint. Once again, the GUARD carefully examines Stauffenberg and Haeften's identification and takes their pistols before allowing the car to pass. We follow. 
90   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                  90 
Est. Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel's office as the courier car arrives. 
Stauffenberg and Haeften are greeted by Freyend who shows them to: 
91   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS          91 
TWO OFFICERS are already waiting. They stand... 
FREYEND Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief Officer of the Reserve Army. 
OFFICER #1 Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an honor. They say you're the man that will defend Berlin from the Red Army single-hand- 
The officer realizes what a faux pas he has made as soon as he says it. Unfazed, Stauffenberg smiles, raising his briefcase with his single hand. 
STAUFFENBERG Indeed. I've got the whole bag of tricks right here. 
The officers laugh nervously, relieved he was not insulted. Idiots. Meanwhile, Freyend steps toward Haeften, reaching for the handle of his briefcase. 
FREYEND Let me take that for you. 
But Haeften snaps the case back. Freyend raises a suspicious eye. Before he can press: 
VOICE (O.S.) Colonel Stauffenberg? 
Everyone turns to find General Fellgiebel standing at the door. Everyone stands at attention. 
FELLGIEBEL At east, Gentlemen. (to Stauffenberg) General Fellgiebel, communications. I just wanted to meet the hero of Africa... And see if there's anything you need. 
STAUFFENBERG Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference with the Führer I'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me. 
Beat. Fellgiebel and Stauffenberg share an instant look of understanding. 
FELLGIEBEL Of course, Colonel. 
Fellgiebel salutes. Stauffenberg and the others return it as Fellgiebel departs. Just then, Keitel bursts from his office, fixing his tie. 
KEITEL Gentlemen. The meeting has been pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and Hitler wants to have lunch with him. 
Stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus. 
STAUFFENBERG Will Mussolini be in the briefing? 
KEITEL I only wish he were. Then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard. 
Keitel makes a beeline for the door and the others follow like good sheep. Stauffenberg holds back, however, attracting Freyend's attention. 
STAUFFENBERG I'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt. 
Stauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat and the tiny blood stain on his shirt. The cut was intentional after all. 
Annoyed, Freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom. 
FREYEND Please, do be quick. You heard the General. 
Stauffenberg nods in appreciation. He motions for Haeften to follow him. Freyend watches, curious. 
92   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                92 
Freyend seems more than just a little peeved. But Stauffenberg doesn't notice. He is focused straight ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left. 
The bunker suddenly seems miles away. 
98   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE BUNKER - DAY                   98 
Security Perimeter I. Keitel and his men file through the heavily guarded entrance. Each man holds up his pass for the GUARDS to inspect. Stauffenberg is last. 
Keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead - AWAY FROM THE BUNKER. Stauffenberg is confused. 
STAUFFENBERG Where are they going? 
FREYEND It's too hot. The briefing has been moved to the conference hut. 
ANGLE ON: The conference hut. The door and many windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open. Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier after all. And no military operation goes according to plan. Making matters worse: 
FREYEND (CONT'D) Sir, your briefcase. I insist. 
Annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion, Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. He watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut. Pause. 
Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to: 
Fellgiebel - standing by the communications building. The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room before the bomb goes off. They share a nod. Then Stauffenberg steps into the hut. 
99    INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS               99 
In the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long table surrounded by RANKING OFFICERS. One by one, they present their individual briefings to the nodding Führer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend. 
STAUFFENBERG My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing. See that you place me as near the Führer as possible. 
Freyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere - wrangling everyone into the meeting. 
Like the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing room. He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the conference hut's young telephone operator. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent call from Berlin... 
100   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                100 
A small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. Stifling heat. We notice again that the windows are open to let in some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long, heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
LIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in the middle of his briefing: 
GENERAL The Eastern Front forces are assured a victory... but they need reinforcements. 
In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as: 
KEITEL Please pardon our tardiness... You remember Colonel Stauffenberg? 
Hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake Stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving moment. Stauffenberg has come to kill this man greeting him. The moment is broken when the General clears his throat, continuing his presentation. 
GENERAL As you can see, Mein Führer, the situation in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical... (and on and on...) 
Freyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table - less than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in between two other officers. We suck in wind when we see who one of them is... 
COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried the bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long ago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook. 
Freyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg - bumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the briefcase - long enough to make us nervous. 
He watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down, sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible, leaning it against the heavy wooden table support immediately to the right of Hitler's foot. 
Stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at his watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the telephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call? 
Around him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear nothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat in his own ears - the only thing betraying his otherwise outward calm. 
He looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under his feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we stay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it. 
Stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm. The annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear. Keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption. Stauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand, indicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased. 
101   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       101 
Freyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the telephone receiver. 
ADAM General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent. 
Stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private call and leave. When they are gone, Stauffenberg simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast. 
A moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building. 
106   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - INNER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         106 
Kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first checkpoint. A barricade is in place. A GUARD approaches. Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes. 
STAUFFENBERG We have to get to the airfield at once. Orders form the Führer. 
The guard signals his men to remove the barricade. 
107   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - MOMENTS LATER                    107 
Fellgiebel waits to be connected to the War Ministry in Berlin. His Communications Officer awaits orders. This makes it hard for Fellgiebel to speak plainly. He plays up his distress for his audience. 
FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE) I am calling from The Wolf's Lair with urgent news for the General. Something terrible has happened... 
Then he turns his back, lowers his voice. 
FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D) (whispering) The Führer is still alive. 
VOICE (ON PHONE) I'm sorry. Please come again. 
But Fellgiebel's officer is watching him, trying to hear. Fellgiebel has no choice but to hang up. 
FELLGIEBEL Sever all communications. 
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Sir? 
FELLGIEBEL DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, DAMMIT. JUST DO IT. 
108   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY                108 
Olbricht anxiously hovers over Mertz who shouts into the phone. 
MERTZ I didn't hear you. Come again. Fellgiebel. FELLGIEBEL. 
But it's no use. Mertz slowly hangs up the phone. 
OLBRICHT Well, what did he say? 
MERTZ I... couldn't be sure. It sounded as though he said... Hitler is still alive. 
Olbricht clinches his teeth and starts sweating. 
OLBRICHT Get him back on the line. 
MERTZ Sir... The bomb did go off. That much was clear. Fellgiebel's next step will be to sever all communications. 
Olbricht is confused. Frozen. 
MERTZ (CONT'D) Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit. We initiate Valkyrie regardless. 
OLBRICHT Only Fromm can initiate. You know that. 
MERTZ Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead. Or arrest him. But do it now. 
But Olbricht is frozen. 
MERTZ (CONT'D) Sir... Did you hear me? You have to give the order to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only- 
OLBRICHT I'm not doing anything until I talk to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the phone. NOW. 
Mertz shakes his head bitterly and dials, but he'll never get through. 
109   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         109 
Stauffenberg's car presses on through the woods toward the last security checkpoint, but numerous new road barriers are in place. This is not good. 
One SERGEANT KOLBE and TWO ARMED SOLDIERS step from the guardhouse, signalling Kretz to stop. 
KOLBE No one gets in or out. 
STAUFFENBERG We're on orders from the Führer. We have to get to the airfield immediately. You will step aside. 
KOLBE I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are- 
Stauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a beeline for the guardroom. Kolbe races after him. 
110   INT. GUARDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                110 
ADAM Yes, sir. Of course. But... 
KEITEL But what? Spit it out, man. 
ADAM Well. The Colonel left his hat. 
Keitel's expression sours. "Is that all you've got for me?" He is about to say so when that prick Freyend barges in, also banged up. With him is Kretz - Stauffenberg's driver. 
FREYEND Pardon the intrusion, sir, but I think you will be most interested to hear what this man has to say. 
116   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               116 
TITLES: 2:00 PM. 
Forty-five precious minutes have slipped away. 
Mertz sits alone at Olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh cigarette with the remains of another. The ashtray says he's been at this for quite a while. He stares at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward. 
His eyes sweep across Olbricht's desk, past his files, his stationery, framed photographs of his family. Then he looks up at a portrait of Hitler. 
Mertz is struck suddenly with a notion. He looks again at Olbricht's desk. His stationery... 
"Fuck it." 
He grabs the stationery and feeds it into a typewriter. 
117   INT. WAR MINISTRY - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY         117 
Mertz approaches a LOWLY TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATOR. Awkward pause. A struggle with the soul. Then he hands over a sheet of paper. 
MERTZ Orders from General Olbricht. 
CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... 
118   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              118 
Again we are inside the nerve center of Nazi communications. Again the teletypes busily chatter away. And again, Sgt. Helm is curious, watching: 
STANDBY FOR OPERATION VALKYRIE... 
The TELETYPE OPERATOR looks up at Helm. "What do I do?" Helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight Lt. Haan - oblivious. Helm shrugs. 
HELM Send it through. But keep me informed. 
A SHRILL WHISTLE takes us to... 
EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY 
Once again RESERVISTS and CADETS rush to their homes and scramble to put on their uniforms. 
119   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  119 
The siren, the sculpted eagle and swastika, the pillared stronghold. Tanks and heavy equipment are once again made ready. 
General Hase issues the alert signal just as he did before, watching the men of the Reserve Army scramble. In the melee we find Lieutenant Hagen. 
HAGEN Here we go again. 
He says this to: 
Major Remer, the man who was so suspicious last time is even more suspicious now. 
121   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY                  121 
A light drizzle. A man jabbering in Italian O.S. 
We get our first good look at the demolished briefing hut. That anyone survived is a miracle. Officers crowd around the smoldering ruins, the Führer himself heading this procession. He wears new clothes, nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian O.S. A slight wince is the only indication that he was damn near blown to bits just hours ago. 
COME AROUND TO REVEAL none other than BENITO MUSSOLINI speaking an incessant stream of Italian. 
HITLER'S P.O.V. Blissful silence. Mussolini's blathering falls literally on deaf ears. 
122   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                          122 
TITLES: 3:15 PM. 
Three hours have passed since the explosion. Stauffenberg and Haeften alight from the plane. The airfield is surprisingly calm. No car to meet them. 
He looks at Mertz. 
OLBRICHT Get Beck and the others. Tell them it's time. 
Relieved, Mertz nods and rushes out. Olbricht picks up the phone and dials. After a beat, he reads from the first page of the Valkyrie order. 
OLBRICHT (CONT'D) This is General Olbricht calling on behalf of General Fromm - Commander of the Home Army. Adolf Hitler, is dead. A group of radicals from the SS are attempting to seize control of the government. Operation Valkyrie is in effect. All military districts, training schools and replacement troops are to take control of essential government offices at once... 
CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... 
127   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              127 
Lt. Haans sits at his desk, sensing someone over his shoulder. He turns to find Sgt. Helm, a sheet of paper in his trembling hands. 
HELM The Führer is dead. 
Skeptical, Haans snatches the paper from Helm. When he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some with tears in their eyes - others perhaps hiding a sense of relief. 
A phone rings. Then another. The chattering teletypes seem to surge into another gear as news of Hitler's death starts to spread. 
Long pause. Haans struggles with the sheer size of the moment. 
HAANS You all know your jobs. Get to work. 
Zombie-like, the Operators go back to their teletypes, passing orders along. 
But one Operator - the one Helm asked to keep him informed - notices something strange about one order in a stack of many he is sifting through. 
OPERATOR Sergeant. This order is signed by Witzleben. 
HELM (taking the paper) That's ridiculous. He`s not even in the army anymore. 
But sure enough, there is Witzleben's name. Strange. Helm looks over at the devastated Haans, wondering how to handle this. Then, like a good little Nazi: 
HELM (CONT'D) Pass the order along. 
128   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  128 
RESERVE SOLDIERS are marched into readiness. Vehicles moved into place. As they await further orders... 
FROMM (V.O.) Who told you the Führer was dead? 
129   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                129 
Mertz and a sheepish Olbricht stand before Fromm. A stunned Lt. Herber hovers by the door. 
OLBRICHT General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair. 
Fromm is at a loss for words. This just can't be so. He picks up the phone. 
FROMM (INTO PHONE) This is Fromm. Put me through to The Wolf's Lair. 
OLBRICHT There's no use calling, all communication lines are- 
FROMM (INTO PHONE) Yes. General Fromm for Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent. 
Mertz and Olbricht are shocked that he got through. 
130   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                 130 
Keitel is still nursing a few wounds. 
FROMM (ON PHONE) What's going on up there? The most incredible rumors are circulating in Berlin. 
Immediately suspicious, Keitel plays dumb, leading... 
KEITEL I don't know what you mean. Everything's in order here. 
Keitel looks out the window at the still smoldering ruins of the conference hut in the distance. 
FROMM There's talk the Führer's been assassinated. 
KEITEL Another failed attempt. The Führer was never in danger. (beat) By the way, where is your man Colonel Stauffenberg? 
131   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                 131 
FROMM Stauffenberg? On his way back to Berlin, I should think. 
HELLDORF There's a lot of talk that Hitler isn't really dead. Is this true? 
Awkward pause. Good question. The men in the room share nervous glances. Then all eyes on Stauffenberg. 
STAUFFENBERG I can't offer you any guarantees. The decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you? 
Long pause. PAN ACROSS the uneasy faces of the men in the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what Helldorf does before making their decisions. Finally: 
HELLDORF I'm with you. 
Stauffenberg can barely hide his relief. There is a palpable shift in the room. One by one, the officers in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup. 
STAUFFENBERG Have your men surround the building. No one gets in or out of here without my permission. (to the others) I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. Dismissed. 
The soldiers move, but Beck's voice stops them - surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man. 
BECK Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated. We represent a different form of government. We represent what is good and just in Germany. 
AN EXPLOSION OF ACTIVITY: 
135   INT. WAR MINISTRY - STAUFFENBERG'S OFFICE - DAY          135 
Stauffenberg stands at his cluttered desk, a flurry of activity surrounding him. He is frantically speaking into the phone and to those present. 
STAUFFENBERG ...Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once... 
136   INT. MILITARY COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - BERLIN - DAY         136 
General Hase, the Berlin Commandant, stands before a giant map of Berlin, addressing a roomful of NAZI OFFICERS. 
HASE ... Completely blockade the government quarters. Everything from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not even generals or ministers, should be allowed to pass. (beat) You have your orders, gentlemen. 
Again, we focus on Major Remer, Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion and always suspicious. 
HASE (CONT'D) Is there a problem, Major? 
REMER It just all seems very... vague, sir. Protocol dictates we should receive orders in writing- 
HASE These are the orders as they were presented to me, Major. Now move. 
Pause. Just before the pause becomes insolent, Remer clicks his heels and salutes, leaving. But the look on his face tells us he's hatching a plan of his own. 
You are right to be nervous. 
137   EXT. GOVERNMENT QUARTERS - BERLIN - VARIOUS - LATER      137 
The city center is abuzz with soldiers and military vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets. 
SOLDIERS come out of various government buildings with SEVERAL NAZI GENERALS in custody, hands bound. They push them into waiting trucks. 
Meanwhile, PASSING CIVILIANS walk quickly by, trying to pretend they don't see anything. Years of Nazi rule have told them to mind their own business. 
ANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back, watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen emerges from the chaos on the streets. 
HAGEN Major Remer. We've just had orders from the War Ministry. The battalion is to blockade the government quarter and place Minister Goebbels under arrest. 
Remer does not move. He just thinks. 
HAGEN (CONT'D) What is it, Major? 
REMER Something just doesn't feel right about this. I would hate to find out I'm being taken advantage of. 
HAGEN (realizing) A coup you think? 
REMER Of that I am certain. What I can't say is which side we're on. Get in. 
As Hagen does, Remer turns to his DRIVER. 
REMER (CONT'D) Take us to the Reichministry. Be quick about it. 
140   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                  140 
Stauffenberg, Beck and Olbricht lead a continued effort to manage the coup. Each man shouts orders into the phone, all the while signing dispatches sent by a steady flow of RUNNERS. 
FRAULEIN VON OVEN (the secretary who worked with Stauffenberg and Tresckow to compile the Valkyrie orders) rushes in, whispering to Stauffenberg. 
STAUFFENBERG Send him in. (Oven hesitates) It's all right. Send him in. 
REMER (CONT'D) Hello? 
VOICE (ON PHONE) Do you recognize my voice? 
Remer is in awe, for a moment unable to speak. Then: 
REMER Of course, Mein Führer. 
HITLER (ON PHONE) Then listen to me very carefully... 
144   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              144 
The communications staff busily connects calls and transmits orders. Sgt. Helm gingerly approaches Lt. Haans with two sheets of paper. 
HAANS What is it now, Sergeant? 
HELM It's just that now we're getting conflicting orders, sir. The Wolf's Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg another. 
Haans sighs, genuinely irritated now. 
HAANS Our job is not to interpret the orders. Our job is to pass them along. Regardless. 
HELM Yes, but sir- 
HAANS Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant? 
Haans thrusts the orders back at Helm who sheepishly walks back to his pool of radio operators. 
145   EXT. REICHMINISTRY - DUSK                               145 
As day turns to night, the soldiers surrounding the government quarters wait for further orders. 
Major Remer comes out a new man - invigorated and focused. He walks over to a truck loaded with RANKING PRISONERS, turning to the soldiers guarding them. 
REMER (re: prisoners) Release these men at once. 
HAGEN But these men are part of a coup. 
REMER I've just been on the phone with Hitler himself. We are the coup, you idiot. We've been duped. 
146   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S QUARTERS - NIGHT            146 
Fromm is a prisoner in his own quarters - staring at a portrait of Hitler with equal parts disdain and reverence. The door suddenly opens. 
Herber enters, leading the handcuffed Fat General. Avoiding Fromm's gaze, he removes the restraints and turns to leave. But the wily Fromm can see the look in Herber's eyes. 
FROMM Well, Lieutenant. What do you make of all of this? 
Herber freezes. Beat. 
HERBER I... I don't know... 
FROMM I won't ask you to make a choice. That's for you and you alone. All I ask is that you observe and think for yourself. In time you'll see things for what they truly are. You know where to find me when you do. 
Herber nods hesitantly, then turns to leave, but: 
FROMM (CONT'D) Lieutenant. (as Herber turns back) Heil Hitler. 
Herber raises his right arm, just managing: 
HERBER Heil Hitler. 
147   INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - NIGHT           147 
Goebbels' office is now the scene of great activity. Soldiers rush in and out carrying orders. Goebbels is on two phones at the same time. 
Through the melee comes none other than Heinrich Himmler - the bespectacled villain whose appearance is unmatched in fiction. His arrival cannot be good. 
GOEBBELS Have you seen the Führer? Is he- 
HIMMLER It seems the conference table shielded him from the blast. He's lucky to be alive. (looking around) Do you want to tell me what's going on? 
GOEBBELS Everything is under control. I've taken charge of the Guard Battalion and given them new orders. We're turning the tables on these cowards. 
HIMMLER I've been sent here personally by the Führer to collect the conspirators. He insists they be taken alive. 
Goebbels and Himmler, two of the most evil men who ever lived, smile coldly. Being taken alive by this mob is obviously a fate worse than death. 
Under Remer's direction the Deutschland Guard Battalion quickly surrounds the War Ministry. 
We see a figure moving behind the windows up above... 
153   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - NIGHT             153 
Olbricht helplessly watches troops surround the building below. It is only a matter of time now. 
He sits at his desk. With a long trembling sigh, he puts pen to paper and writes: 
"My dearest wife..." 
A commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and he drops the pen. A loud, shrill scream follows. 
The door bursts open to reveal Herber and his TWO COHORTS. They are supported by A HALF DOZEN ARMED SOLDIERS, all training their weapons on Olbricht. 
In the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein Oven quietly slipping out into the hallway. 
154   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT                154 
Beck, Stauffenberg and Haeften are still making calls and writing orders - doing all they can to keep the coup alive. They are startled when Fraulein Oven bursts in. It is written on her face. 
155   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       155 
Stauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's office, stopping when they see a MASS OF SOLDIERS surrounding the doorway. A chill runs down our spines when we see Herber talking to none other than Major Remer. Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften. 
REMER YOU THERE. 
Stauffenberg and Haeften turn and run. 
REMER (CONT'D) HALT. 
BANG. A shot is fired. Stauffenberg and Haeften take cover in a nearby doorway. Haeften returns fire. Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers of his left hand. Awkward. Then he aims and fires. 
Stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his good arm. He drops his gun, bleeding badly. 
But MORE SOLDIERS appear at the opposite end of the corridor. The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with his body, aiming to fire. But Stauffenberg stops him, shaking his head. It's over. They toss down their guns. Boot-steps approach loudly O.S. 
As Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring around his neck: 
HAEFTEN Thank you, Colonel. 
Stauffenberg is genuinely confused. "For what?" 
HAEFTEN (CONT'D) Better I die for Germany than for Hitler. 
VOICE (O.S.) Colonel Stauffenberg. 
Stauffenberg turns to find Remer standing there. 
REMER You're under arrest. 
160   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - LATER                160 
Stauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck, Mertz and Haeften, the last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpoint. A smug Fromm enters, followed by Herber, the Fat General, Remer and numerous GUN-TOTING OFFICERS. 
FROMM If you have any last messages, you'd better write them now. 
STAUFFENBERG My actions speak for me. (to his men) I'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together. 
The others bravely nod in agreement. But then: 
BECK I'd like a pistol, please. 
Stauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise. 
BECK (CONT'D) For personal reasons. 
Fromm thinks about it, then matter-of-factly hands Beck a pistol. Remer quickly steps forward. 
REMER General, my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive. 
FROMM Noted, Major. (to Beck) Get on with it then. 
REMER But, sir- 
FROMM THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR.

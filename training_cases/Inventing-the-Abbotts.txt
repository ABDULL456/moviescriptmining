INVENTING THE ABBOTTS 
FADE IN: 
1EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET (HALEY, ILLINOIS) - DAY                 1 (LATE SPRING, 1957) 
OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn, practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form. 
NEW ANGLE - TENT 
-- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade. 
2EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY                                   2 
JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley). 
Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the many parties they throw every year). 
DOUG Didn't get invited, huh? 
JACEY Go to hell. 
DOUG Who cares? I'm not going and I got invited. 
JACEY Who invited you?

DOUG Pam, I guess. I don't know. Didn't open the envelope. I mean, come on, every time an Abbott girl gets her period they have some party. 
JACEY Oh, shut up. 
DOUG Kotex parties, Kotex party hats, pin the Kotex on the... 
JACEY Shut up! 
Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm -- Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed- and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block.

4INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                      4 
ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker. Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down the busy hall. 
JACEY I tried to call you last night but the line was busy. 
ELEANOR No it wasn't.

JACEY It was busy all night. 
ELEANOR Maybe you had the wrong number? 
JACEY Are you mad at me? 
ELEANOR No.   Are you mad at me? 
JACEY No.   Who said I was? 
ELEANOR I did. 
JACEY I just wanted to talk to you last night. 
ELEANOR We can talk tonight at the party. 
JACEY I wasn't invited. 
ELEANOR Yes, you were. 
She points at Doug's chest. 
PAMELA Like your tie.

Doug glances down at his tie and Pam flips her index finger up across the tip of his nose. Doug scowls and points at her bust. 
DOUG Can I borrow a Kleenex? 
PAMELA Greaser. 
DOUG (mouth full of food) Got any smokes around here? 
11   INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                          11 
Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard. The tent can be seen in the b.g. The band is playing "MONA LISA." 
DOUG So, is this Peter guy Alice is gonna marry rich? 
PAMELA Of course. He's one of the Atlas Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh. He's a bully. 
DOUG So how come Alice's marrying him? 
PAMELA Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents. It's practically an arranged marriage. They think Alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that Peter was the one to do it with. 
DOUG Jeez, no one can be that much of a pushover.

PAMELA Look, Alice is the good daughter, Eleanor is the bad one, and I'm the one who sort of gets off the hook. That's just the way it works. Which one are you? 
DOUG You mean, which kind of brother am I? You got me? The little brother, I guess. 
12     INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)             12 
The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little. 
LLOYD Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight -- the engagement of our daughter, Alice, to Mister Peter Vanlaningham. 
He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the applause and AD-LIBBED toasts. 
The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor. 
(CONTINUED) 
12       CONTINUED:                                                    12 
The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters. 
13       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY & TENT - NIGHT                    13 
The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of high society for tonight. 
14       EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT                                 14 
Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb, strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance. 
15       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                          15 
Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache. 
16       EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)                16 
Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb. 
17       EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK & GARAGE - NIGHT                    17 (MINUTES LATER) 
As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand still on the light fixture pull chain. 
DOUG Three out of five? 
JACEY Two out of three. You serve. 
Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce competitors.

18     EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY          18 
Lloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap. 
JACEY 'Morning. 
Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open. 
Jacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over the wake. 
Eleanor leans over to Steve. 
ELEANOR You know you're going too fast? 
STEVE (grins) Yeah, I know. 
The boat zips by the ramp and Jacey's skis contact the slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. He takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water. 
20     INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT                        20 
Jacey is soaking in the bathtub.   Doug enters without knocking. 
DOUG Time to eat. 
Doug washes his hands. Jacey climbs out of the tub and fetches a towel. And Doug reacts to... 
DOUG Jesus Christ! 
Jacey's back and buttocks are severely bruised. Jacey wraps the towel around his waist and turns to his brother. 
JACEY Don't tell Mom. 
DOUG Oh, shit... 
(CONTINUED) 
20     CONTINUED:                                                   20 
JACEY (cutting him off) Just don't tell Mom. All right? 
DOUG Yeah, okay, all right. 
Jacey walks out of the bathroom. 
21     EXT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER 1957)     21 
Lloyd Abbott's 1957 Cadillac pulls up to the pumps. Lloyd is behind the wheel, Joan sits next to him, Eleanor and Pamela are in the back seat. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons... 
22     INT. TEXACO STATION - JACEY                                  22 
-- sticks the mop he's been using into a pail and goes to answer the bell. He hesitates as he sees the Abbotts and lets another attendant wait on them. He retreats into the garage and resumes mopping the floor. 
ELEANOR (O.S.) Hi. 
Jacey finds Eleanor standing in the garage doorway. 
ELEANOR Congratulations. 
JACEY For what? 
ELEANOR I heard you got accepted to Penn. 
JACEY Oh.   Yeah.   Thanks. 
ELEANOR How'd you swing an Ivy League school like that? 
JACEY My grandfather went there.   I had the grades, so... 
ELEANOR It stinks in here. 
JACEY I dropped something. (CONTINUED) 
22     CONTINUED:                                                 22 
ELEANOR Yeah, me. 
JACEY I just thought you and Steve... 
ELEANOR Well, that's what you thought. I think Steve is... I don't even know what I think about Steve, I never think about him. I just do things. And let other people figure them out. That's what parents are for. They're real good at doing all the thinking. Why should I? (slight beat) Alice is going to have a baby. She and Kilroy didn't waste any time. He's already talking about having another, and Alice is up- chucking every hour on the hour. She's got morning-noon-and-night sickness. I've got the feeling she'll be barefoot and puking for years to come. Wallpaper patterns -- that's all she talks about. She and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books. That's another thing I never think about... wallpaper. (another beat) Well, I think this is called the silent treatment. I get enough of that from my father, I don't need it from you. Good luck at Penn. 
She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat. They don't see Pamela enter the garage. Pam studies them for an imperturbable beat, then: 
PAMELA Come on, Eleanor -- Dad's waiting. 
23     EXT. TEXACO STATION - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)                  23 
The Abbotts drive away. Jacey stands in the garage in the b.g. He watches the Cadillac disappear into traffic.

24     EXT. DOWNTOWN HALEY - INSIDE CADILLAC                         24 
-- with Lloyd behind the wheel, Joan in the front passenger seat, and Eleanor and Pam in the back seat. Lloyd says to Eleanor: 
LLOYD Stay away from him. 
ELEANOR Who? 
HELEN And don't forget your sport coat. 
JACEY Yeah, I'll go pick it up. 
HELEN Take Doug with you. 
JACEY I'm just going to the cleaners. (CONTINUED) 
34     CONTINUED:                                                     34 
HELEN Take him along for the ride.   Go have a root beer at the Dog'n'Suds. 
JACEY I gotta finish packing. 
HELEN I'll finish up. Doug's going to miss you. 
JACEY Baloney. 
HELEN I think he will. 
JACEY Not much. 
HELEN Oh, dammit, Jacey, please -- take your brother with you. 
JACEY Yes, ma'am. 
35     EXT. STREETS OF HALEY - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                 35 
Jacey (behind the wheel) and Doug drive into town in the Plymouth coupe. After a long silence: 
JACEY If Mom starts having problems with the car stalling just change the fuel filter. It gets clogged up when she lets the gas tank get too low. 
DOUG Okay. 
JACEY And every-once-in-a-while take her to the movies so she doesn't just sit around the house all the time reading. 
DOUG She likes to read. 
JACEY She reads too much. (CONTINUED)

DOUG Okay, I'll take her to the movies. 
JACEY (slight beat) You want to go have a beer? 
DOUG Root beer? 
JACEY No, a beer. 
DOUG A beer beer? 
JACEY Yeah. 
DOUG Where are we gonna get beer? 
JACEY The bait shop. If you go in alone and nobody else is in the store, Ernie'll sell you a couple of bottles. 
36   EXT. DIRT ROAD (COUNTRYSIDE) - DAY                           36 
The Plymouth is parked on a dirt lane separating two cornfields. Jacey sits on the fender of the car nursing on a bottle of beer. Doug urinates between two rows of corn. 
DOUG Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper? 
Jacey gives Doug a quizzical look. 
DOUG You know, when I was in first grade. At school? In the boys' room? Remember I wouldn't let Mrs. Horton help me, so she went and got Mom out of her classroom, but I wouldn't let Mom help me either. I told her to go get you. Remember? 
JACEY Yeah, I remember. 
(CONTINUED) 
36     CONTINUED:                                                    36 
Doug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car. A semi-trailer drives past with "Midwest Steel Desk, Inc. -- Haley, Illinois" painted on its sides. 
JACEY We should own that company. 
DOUG What do you mean? 
JACEY Midwest Steel Desk. Dad's file cabinet drawer. Lloyd Abbott screwed mom out of Dad's patent after he died. 
DOUG Says who? 
JACEY It's true. 
DOUG Mom's not stupid. 
JACEY I didn't say she was stupid. Lloyd's pretty smooth. That's why he owns the company. 
PETER Will you shut up about the fucking Brylcreme! 
ALICE It comes in a red-and-white tube just like a tube of Pepsodent. 
PETER Do you hear me, Alice?!   Shut up! 
Their BABY begins to CRY (O.S.) and they find Pamela standing at the top of the stairs. 
PAMELA The baby's crying. 
48       INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK STAIRWAY AND KITCHEN - NIGHT             48 (MOMENTS LATER) 
Doug sneaks down the back stairs and enters the kitchen as Lloyd and Joan enter from the garage pulling off their coats. Doug ducks back into the stair landing unseen. 
LLOYD Just stay out of it, Joan. 
JOAN Alice meant no harm, I think... 
(CONTINUED) 
48     CONTINUED:                                                     48 
LLOYD (cutting her off) It doesn't matter what you think, it's their business. Alice is a spoiled brat, but she's Peter's problem now. So just take one of your pills and go watch Jack Paar, see what he's crying about tonight. 
49     INT. ABBOTT HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                49 
Doug sticks his head out of the back stairwell and spots Peter pounding on a locked bedroom door. 
PETER I'm warning you, Alice! Open the damn door! Alice?! Dammit! 
50     INT. ABBOTT HOME - STAIRWELL - DOUG                            50 
Trapped in the stairwell.   He hisses under his breath: 
DOUG Oh, shit!   Let me out of here... 
He notices a small window in the stairwell. 
51     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - WINDOW - NIGHT                              51 
Doug squeezes out of the small window, his legs dangling six feet above a large rose bush directly under him. 
52     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAYS LATER                       52 
Doug makes his way along the crowded corridor showing a few of his wounds from his emergency landing in the rose bush. He slows as he nears Pamela at her locker. She's aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. Doug hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's disappointment is plain to see. 
Doug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction. As they pass him Eleanor smiles brightly and says: 
ELEANOR Hi, Doug!

The girls giggle, "Hi, Doug!" has become a running punchline to them. Doug is so undone by their laughter that he walks into an open door. 
53     EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER, 1958)            53 
Jacey collects his suitcase from the bus driver. He's become very much the Ivy League man. Doug waits for him beside the Plymouth across the street. As Jacey starts across the street a CAR full of young women, including Eleanor and Sandy, HONKS, and stops beside him. Jacey hops into the car and calls out to Doug: 
JACEY Hey, Doug!   Get my suitcase! 
The car pulls away and Doug irritably fetches Jacey's bag. 
54     EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY                                 54 
The hood on the Plymouth is propped open.    Doug assists Jacey as he replaces the fuel filter. 
DOUG How do you know when a girl's... ready? 
JACEY What do you mean, `ready'?     Ready for what... sex? 
DOUG Yeah. 
JACEY They're all ready for sex. 
DOUG They are? 
JACEY They might not be willing but they're ready. Just have to make them think you're the only one around who has what they need. 
DOUG How do you do that? 
(CONTINUED) 
54     CONTINUED:                                                    54 
JACEY Find out what's making them itch and scratch it. If they're scared, be dependable. If they're bored, be exciting. If they're on the rebound, catch them. 
DOUG What if you're not very dependable or exciting, you know? 
JOAN Well, if I were you I would talk to him and tell him... 
HELEN (cutting her off) No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do that. If you have something to say to my son, then you'll have to say it to him yourself. 
JOAN I just thought you would like to know what he's done. 
HELEN And why on earth should I believe anything you say, Joan? 
Joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her station wagon and drives away. 
Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch. 
HELEN I'm going to ask you one question, Doug, and if you have no idea, or don't want to answer, just tell me. 
DOUG Okay. 
HELEN Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has... oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous... corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her astray? 
Doug's mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her.

DOUG Well... jeez... I know that he's... that he's slept with her. But not because he's talked about it. I mean... Eleanor has lots of boyfriends. I think Jacey likes her more than she likes him. 
HELEN (long beat) I see. (another beat) Go finish your homework. 
Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside. Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with the sadness that is at the core of her being. 
65   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - ROAD - DAY (ONE WEEK LATER)                 65 
A drab, four-door Chevrolet sedan with Wisconsin license plates speeds away from town. 
Incongruously, the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by an African-American DRIVER. There are two passengers in the back seat: a conservatively-dressed, middle-aged WOMAN and Eleanor Abbott. There is nothing telling about Eleanor's countenance, neither happiness nor sadness can be found on her face. 
66     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY (WEEKS LATER)                  66 
Doug walks home from summer school. He pauses to watch the workmen erecting the party tent in the Abbott's front yard. 
PAMELA (O.S.) How come you're going to summer school? 
Doug turns to find Pam at the driveway gate. 
DOUG I got an incomplete in U.S. History. 
PAMELA How did you manage to do that? 
(CONTINUED) 
66     CONTINUED:                                                   66 
DOUG Mrs. Bates caught me drawing boobs on a picture of Mamie Eisenhower. 
PAMELA (laughs) Why do you do things like that? 
DOUG I wish I knew. I just can't seem to help it sometimes. 
PAMELA Are you coming to the party? 
Doug shakes his head no. 
PAMELA It's my birthday, you know? 
DOUG Happy birthday. 
PAMELA Everybody's going to be here. 
DOUG I don't know.     Maybe. 
PAMELA Just come, okay? Please. 
67     EXT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - THAT NIGHT            67 
Doug pulls the Plymouth up to the pumps. He's neatly dressed in a jacket and tie. Jacey comes out of the office and leans in the car window. 
DOUG Fill 'er up. 
JACEY (frowns) Nice tie. 
DOUG Oh -- mind if I borrow it? 
Jacey puts the nozzle in the car as Doug climbs out. 
JACEY I thought you didn't like those parties at the Abbott's?

PAMELA You said you weren't sorry and now you say you are. So maybe I'm not sure what you're sorry about? 
DOUG I'm sorry for what I'm supposed to be sorry about. Okay? 
PAMELA You're sorry for feeling me up? 
DOUG (embarrassed) Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit. For crying out loud. Forget it. 
PAMELA I accept your apology.   Let's dance. 
Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles: 
PAMELA Hi. 
DOUG Hi. 
Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause. 
PAMELA Is Jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit? 
The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down Doug's spine.

DOUG Home for the summer. (slight beat) It's cheaper if he stays here for the summer. He can save more money for school, 'cause he doesn't have to pay rent. Money's tight, you know, we're sort of poor. 
PAMELA You're not poor, are you? 
DOUG Hell -- you kidding? Even with Jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn. I don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college. 
Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells. 
DOUG I hear Alice and Peter are getting a divorce. 
PAMELA They're just separated. 
DOUG What's the difference? 
PAMELA I don't know, you'll have to ask them. 
DOUG So, where's Eleanor tonight? 
PAMELA Eleanor's... just not here. 
DOUG Is she pregnant? 
PAMELA No!    Who said that?

DOUG I don't know, everybody in town is saying something different -- she got knocked up, she ran away, your old man kicked her out. So, which is it? 
Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder. 
DOUG Fuck off. 
Ted is taken aback.   Pamela's eyes fill with tears. 
PAMELA Why do you hate me so much? 
TED Excuse me, asshole, but... 
Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at Pamela: 
DOUG I don't hate you. 
70     INT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT            70 
The hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies on his bed (still dressed). Jacey appears in the doorway. 
JACEY You asleep? 
DOUG Nope. 
71     EXT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)            71 
Doug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong in the garage. In the midst of a volley Doug says: 
The commencement exercises are being held in the sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud parents and family members. Doug, hot and uncomfortable in his cap and gown, is seated among his fellow graduates behind the podium. The PRINCIPAL (at the podium) announces the names of the graduates as he calls them forward to receive their diplomas. 
(CONTINUED) 
76     CONTINUED:                                                     76 
PRINCIPAL Pamela Louise Abbott... 
Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma. 
Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan. 
Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes. 
Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym. 
Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes settle on... Alice Abbott. 
Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle. 
Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she passes by with Susan in her arms. 
77     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY                77 
Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings. 
As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on. 
Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between two parked vehicles. They are both caught off-guard -- there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each other. 
LLOYD Congratulations, Helen. 
HELEN Thank you. Congratulations to you, too. Where's Pam going to school? 
LLOYD Hmm... Christ, I forgot. (MORE)

LLOYD (CONT'D) Bryn Mawr. I should be able to remember that. It costs enough. 
HELEN She'll do well there -- a very bright girl. 
LLOYD And Doug -- he's going to...? 
HELEN He got a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania -- scenic design -- theater. 
LLOYD Same school as... 
HELEN (filling in blank) Jacey. 
LLOYD Right.   Well.    Congratulations. 
HELEN Thank you, Lloyd. 
They pass each other and head their separate ways.   Their chance meeting has not gone unobserved: 
Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips behind the wheel. 
And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel. 
Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare) and pulls out of his parking spot. 
78     INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT                     78 
A waitress walks across the busy diner to Helen, Jacey, and Doug at their table. Helen and Doug are eating their desserts -- Jacey is content to brood over his cup of coffee. The waitress puts their bill on the table and steps away. 
(CONTINUED) 
78     CONTINUED:                                                     78 
As Helen starts to open her purse Webb Crosby appears and picks up the bill. 
WEBB It's on the house. 
HELEN Oh, Webb, really -- that's not necessary. 
WEBB How many restaurants got an Ivy League busboy? That's worth a free meal. Charlie'd be real proud of these two highbrows. 
HELEN Yes, he would.     He'd be extremely proud. 
WEBB (to Jacey) You take good care of your little brother in Philadelphia, you hear me? 
JACEY Yes, sir. 
79     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)           79 
The Holt family drives home from the restaurant -- Jacey driving, Helen in front, and Doug in the back seat. 
HELEN Isn't that Pamela Abbott? 
In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible. 
Doug grimaces as he recognizes her. 
HELEN It is Pam.    Pull over. 
Doug reluctantly pulls over beside Pam's car. She's no more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her. 
HELEN Hi, Pam.   Do you need some help? 
PAMELA Hi, Mrs. Holt. It's so darn hot the stupid jack just keeps sinking into the pavement. 
HELEN Well, maybe Doug can give you a hand? 
Doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth. 
DOUG Where's the thing that goes on the bottom of the jack? 
PAMELA What thing? 
DOUG The thing, the base that the jack fits into? (finds it in her open trunk) This. 
PAMELA Oh, I thought that was just the 'spare-tire-holder-on-er.' 
DOUG Read your manual. 
Pamela would slug him if his mother wasn't present.

Doug releases the load on the jack and strains to extract it from the molten pavement. 
HELEN Pam, would you mind running Doug home? I'd like to get to the bank before they close. 
DOUG (protesting) Mom... 
PAMELA Sure, Mrs. Holt, I'll drive him home. Thanks for stopping. 
HELEN Of course.   Bye-bye. 
Helen slides over behind the wheel and drives away. 
Doug fumes silently while he reassembles the jack. 
88     INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - DAY                           88 
Jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches the cash register near the front door. She calls out to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill. 
ALICE Excuse me -- could I get change for a dollar? 
The waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice and Alice herself doesn't notice Jacey as he steps up behind her. 
JACEY Can I help you? 
ALICE Yes, I need change for... (turns to him) Oh... you don't work here, do you? 
JACEY No. I was just thinking about you. I was going to call you tonight.

JACEY There's a picnic out at River Point on Sunday -- I wanted to invite you. 
ALICE I couldn't. 
JACEY Bring Susan, kids love picnics. 
ALICE (re: the dollar bill) I need change for the parking meter. 
JACEY Here. 
Jacey opens his palm and reveals the correct change. Alice nervously exchanges the dollar bill for the coins. 
ALICE Oh, thanks. 
JACEY Do you have time for an ice tea? 
ALICE My mother's waiting by the car so I won't get a ticket. 
JACEY Maybe she'd like an ice tea, too?

PAMELA Like you used to. Like just plain Pam. 
Doug exhales as if he's winding up to apologize. 
PAMELA And you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. You just make me want to scream sometimes. 
Doug stares at her as if he's never seen her before. 
PAMELA What are you looking at? 
DOUG You. 
90     EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - DAY (FOLLOWING SUNDAY)                90 
Jacey lounges on top of a blanket beside a cooler. 
ALICE (O.S.) Where is everyone? 
Jacey sits up and finds Alice standing behind him. She carries a picnic basket. Other than a few children skipping rock into the river they are alone. 
JACEY We are everyone. 
ALICE But you said... 
JACEY (overlapping) No, I didn't. I just said a picnic. I didn't say if anyone else was coming. 
Alice walks away.    Jacey jumps up and runs after her. 
JACEY Where are you going? 
ALICE I'm sorry... I thought...

JACEY (blocking her way) You didn't come here to see everybody else. You came here to see me. Didn't you? That's why you didn't bring Susan along. 
ALICE I'm married. 
JACEY I thought you were getting a divorce? 
ALICE I am, but it's not final yet. Besides, I'm two years older than you. 
JACEY Good, if the cops come around we'll tell 'em you bought the beers in the cooler. 
91     EXT. RIVERPOINT PARK - ANOTHER PART OF PARK -                 91 LATER THAT DAY 
Jacey and Alice wander along a path on the riverbank. 
ALICE I knew he would hit me. Peter's a real hot-head. I knew if he hit me hard enough, hurt me enough, that even my father wouldn't stand for it. Then one night I put too much soap in the washing machine and it overflowed. That did it. He punched me. Broke my front tooth. 
JACEY Bastard. 
ALICE So... what do you hear from Eleanor? 
JACEY I don't.   Do you? 
ALICE No.   Did you love her?

Alice blushes. 
JACEY Did you love Peter? 
ALICE No. 
JACEY Then why did you marry him? 
ALICE Because... 
92     EXT. RIVERPOINT PARK - ROAD - LATER THAT DAY                     92 
Jacey holds open the driver's door as Alice climbs in behind the wheel (of her mother's Town & Country station wagon). He closes the door. 
JACEY Which tooth was it? 
She points to a front tooth.      He leans over to look at it. 
ALICE This one. I had it capped.       You can't really tell, can you? 
DOUG Yeah. Back yard nudity is hypocritical. It's insincere. People should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things. 
PAMELA Okay. 
DOUG Okay. 
Their conversation is stifled by this new standard of absolute honesty.

The sunset provides a convenient excuse for their silence. But then Pam realizes he is staring at her. 
DOUG Hi. 
PAMELA Hi. 
DOUG You look pretty. 
PAMELA Really? 
DOUG Yup. 
Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you." Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for a long time. They will always remember this kiss. 
96     EXT. MOVIE THEATRE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NIGHT                    96 
The marquee reads: "FRANK SINATRA -- EDW. G. ROBINSON -- 'A HOLE IN THE HEAD' -- CINEMASCOPE -- AIR CONDITIONED." Alice Abbott buys a ticket at the box office. 
97     INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)                     97 
The movie has already begun. Alice enters the sparsely peopled theatre and pauses to allow her eyes to adjust to the darkness. A hand reaches out and takes her hand -- it is Jacey. He's seated beside the door. He rises and leads her across the row of empty seats to the exit. 
98     INT. MOVIE THEATRE - BALCONY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)           98 
Jacey guides Alice to two seats deep in the shadows of the otherwise unoccupied balcony. They gaze at the screen for a few moments, then he moves his mouth to her ear and nibbles on her lobe. She turns her lips to his and they kiss passionately. Jacey slides his hand under her skirt. Alice presses herself against his hand and whispers:

The station is closed and locked up for the night. Jacey and Alice are naked in the back seat of a car parked inside the dark service bay. It is a hot and humid night. They are slippery with sweat. 
JACEY Marry me. 
ALICE Impossible... 
JACEY Nothing's impossible...

Helen leans out a bus window and calls to Doug, who is perched on the front fender of the Plymouth, which is parked nearby with Jacey behind the wheel. 
HELEN Don't forget to water my tomatoes! 
DOUG Okay, Mom, okay. 
The bus pulls away. Doug waves as the bus goes down the street -- then he leaps with surprise as an impatient Jacey leans on the CAR HORN. 
102     INT. HOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (WEEKS LATER)            102 
Doug and Pamela lounge on opposite ends of the sofa with his bare feet pressed against hers in a gentle shoving match. They are watching an episode of "Sea Hunt" on the TELEVISION. 
PAMELA How long is your mom gone? 
DOUG Two weeks. She goes up every summer to see this friend she went to college with. 
PAMELA Eleanor lives in Chicago. 
DOUG She does? 
PAMELA Yeah. She's going to stewardess school. 
DOUG What do they teach you at stewardess school? 
PAMELA I don't know.    How to wiggle your bottom. 
DOUG Maybe you should go there instead of Bryn Mawr? 
She pushes harder against his feet and her foot slips off his and clobbers him in the crotch. He moans and sits up. 
DOUG Oww!   Damn! 
PAMELA Yeah.   Shit. 
104     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                   104 
The Plymouth approaches -- Jacey turns off the headlights and KILLS the MOTOR and coasts to a stop in front of the house next door to the Abbotts'. Alice gets out of the car, Jacey hurries after her, following her into her front yard. 
JACEY Alice... wait!

JACEY It's the truth, you know it is. 
ALICE No, no, it's all just... screwing. 
JACEY It's called making love. 
ALICE Don't. 
JACEY Don't what? 
ALICE Don't follow me. 
He grabs her arm and stops her. 
JACEY What's wrong? 
ALICE I spend all day, every day, just waiting and waiting to be with you, waiting to forget everything, you make me forget... but then when I get dressed and I come home, you... just... leak out of me. Leak away. I go into the bathroom and I wash you off of me and I remember everything. 
JACEY Remember what? 
LLOYD (O.S.) Alice?!    Is that you? 
Lloyd's voice paralyzes them.

Pamela rises from a wrought iron bench in another part of the yard -- she strolls over to Alice. 
PAMELA Just girl talk.

Pamela and Alice go inside the house. 
Jacey exhales, he is ashen.

Doug hoses down the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Pamela pulls up in her car and gets out. 
DOUG Hi. 
PAMELA Hi. 
DOUG What's up? 
PAMELA I've been thinking -- maybe we shouldn't see each other right now. 
DOUG Oh, yeah?    Why? 
PAMELA Well... if my father... I don't really care what would happen to me if he found out I was seeing you, but I have to take care of Alice and my mother and Eleanor, and... well, it would be hard for me to do that if I were in the doghouse, too. You know? 
DOUG Christ, why do you have to take care of them? (CONTINUED)

He struggles to hold his anger and frustration in check. 
DOUG Okay.   Sure.   See you around. 
Pam's composure begins to weaken, but she quickly returns to the car before she can lose control. Doug turns the hose back on. He doesn't look up as she drives away.

It is almost two o'clock in the morning. Helen has dozed off in her chair with a book on her lap. She is startled awake by a loud BANGING at the front door. Helen hurries to the door and opens it. Pamela is on the porch. She is out of breath and very distraught. Her CAR is parked in the middle of the street with its lights on and MOTOR RUNNING. 
HELEN Pamela, are you all right? 
PAMELA I need to talk to... 
Jacey comes down the stairs, pulling on his bathrobe. Doug appears on the stairs behind him. 
JACEY What's wrong? 
PAMELA Alice took some pills, some of my mother's pills... 
JACEY Oh, Jesus, no... 
PAMELA She's all right, we took her to the hospital... 
JACEY I'll get dressed... 
PAMELA No! 
JACEY I have to see her.

JACEY Jesus... 
Helen closes the front door and turns to say something to Jacey, but he cuts her off: 
JACEY Leave me alone, just leave me alone. 
Helen climbs the stairs, collects Doug at the top landing, and leads him away. 
Jacey punches his fist through a glass pane of the sheer- curtained sidelight beside the front door.

Pam's convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb before Jacey comes charging out of the house to Pam. Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice Pam and Jacey at first. (Jacey and Pam have to speak over the din of the LAWN MOWER.) 
JACEY How is she? 
PAMELA She's all right. 
JACEY Can I see her? 
PAMELA At the boathouse -- at the lake. 
Jacey turns and dashes up the driveway. 
Doug watches Jacey jump into the Plymouth and speed down the driveway and then up the street. 
Doug SHUTS OFF the LAWN MOWER and walks over to Pam. 
DOUG What's going on? 
She looks at Doug with tears in her eyes. 
PAMELA I had to... for Alice's sake. 
DOUG (puzzled) Had to what? What? 
PAMELA Tell Jacey I'm sorry. 
Pam drives away. 
The traffic light changes and the other pedestrians cross the street. 
PAMELA Just a party I got roped into going. Maybe some other time, okay? I mean it, really. 
DOUG Just call -- I'm at Reed Hall.

PAMELA Okay.   Bye. 
DOUG Bye. 
Doug watches her cross the street. 
133     INT. REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - THAT NIGHT                 133 
Doug is revising a set design -- deeply concentrating on his task. He's startled by a KNOCK on the door. 
MALE STUDENT (O.S.) Hey, Holt! You got a visitor downstairs! 
134     INT. REED HALL - LOBBY - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)                 134 
Doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on his face. He stops at the front desk and the student clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott slumped in a chair. 
DOUG Did you miss the bus? 
Pam laughs and Doug suddenly realizes: 
DOUG Damn, you're drunk. Awww, man... I better get you out of here before the Puritans tar-and-feather you. Can you walk? 
Pam awkwardly rises and Doug guides her to the door. 
DOUG Listen to me -- go out the front door, turn right, go around to the side of the building and wait for me by the fire escape. Okay? Just wait. 
135     EXT. REED HALL - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)           135 
Pamela leans against the side of the building as the fire escape ladder descends to the pavement. Doug climbs down. 
(CONTINUED) 
135     CONTINUED:                                                     135 
DOUG Come on -- up we go.   Pam? 
Pam keels over and vomits. 
136     INT. REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT                      136 
Pam sits on the bed as Doug pulls her stained turtleneck sweater off over her head (she's wearing a bra). 
DOUG What were you drinking, Sterno? 
PAMELA I'm cold... 
DOUG Hold on, we got to get your pants too. Can you stand up. (as she collapses on the bed)) No, you can't stand up. All right. 
He undoes the waist of her pants and tugs on her pant legs, but her panties start to slide off along with her pants. 
DOUG Nope, nope, let's keep the panties on, okay? Pam? Can you hold on to your underpants? (she's out) I'll hold on to your underpants. 
He holds her panties in place while he struggles to get her pants over her hips. 
137     INT. REED HALL - RESTROOM - NIGHT                              137 
Doug rinses out Pam's clothes in a sink. 
138     INT. REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT                      138 
Pam's wet clothes have been draped over the radiator. Pam is passed out, tucked in under the covers. Doug sits on the edge of the bed gently cleaning her face with a damp washcloth. 
139     INT. DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NEXT MORNING                           139 
Doug   stirs from his sleeping spot on the floor (he slept with   his clothes on). He notices that Pam's clothes have been   removed from the radiator. He sits up and finds that   the bed is empty. She's gone. 
140     EXT. BRYN MAWR - DORMITORY - TWO DAYS LATER                    140 
Pamela approaches her dorm carrying an armload of books. She starts up the steps then stops when she sees Doug. 
DOUG You're welcome. 
PAMELA I'm sorry, Doug. 
DOUG Shit.    That's it? You're sorry? 
PAMELA (suddenly alarmed) Oh Jesus... did we? 
DOUG Oh-Jesus-did-we what? 
He escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions her center stage near the footlights. 
DOUG Just stand right there. 
He takes the work light with him as he walks off stage. Then with a METALLIC CLANK everything goes dark. 
PAMELA (alarmed) Doug! 
DOUG (O.S.) It's all right -- don't move! Stay put. 
There's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being lowered from the fly loft. 
DOUG (O.S.) Almost, almost... hold on. 
We hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney. Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick- change routine. 
PAMELA Oh, Doug, it's beautiful. 
DOUG The senior acting class does scenes from different plays, they invite everybody, it's a real big deal. So, there's this competition among all the theater design students to do the sets. And -- anyway -- I'm the one whose design got picked.

PAMELA What scene is it for?     What play? 
DOUG (a tad embarrassed) Umm... Romeo and Juliet. It's something different, I think that's why they picked it. Everybody else was doing castles and stuff. Rooftop Romeo and Juliet by Douglas L. Holt. 
PAMELA You're really good at this. 
DOUG It's like building models when I was a kid. It's fun. It's... make-believe. 
PAMELA You know, they tore that old farmhouse down? 
DOUG Oh, no.     Did they? 
PAMELA Yeah. 
DOUG They always tear down the wrong stuff. 
PAMELA Oh, Jesus, I missed you -- so much. 
DOUG Missed you, too. 
They kiss -- then Pamela pulls away.    Doug studies her, then: 
DOUG You have a boyfriend, right? 
PAMELA No. 
DOUG Well, what? You worried what your old man would think?

PAMELA He doesn't care what I do, as long as I don't do it in Haley. 
DOUG Then what's the problem? 
PAMELA I can't... do this. 
DOUG Why not? I mean... okay. We don't have to go so fast. Shit, I'm sorry. I blew it again, huh? 
PAMELA No, I did. 
DOUG How? 
Pam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle. 
PAMELA I'm on probation. They pulled a bed-check the night I was here. I have to be back in the dorm by ten. Gotta go. 
DOUG What about tomorrow? I could come up in the afternoon and... 
PAMELA No! It's just too late. It's all messed up. I can't seem to make things all right. The more I try the worse everything gets. I'm sorry. 
Pam walks up the aisle and disappears through a door to the lobby. 
DOUG Pam!   It's not too late!

A148     INT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT            A148 
DOUG She didn't betray Alice! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice wouldn't try to kill herself again. Jesus Christ, you shit- head, Alice couldn't marry you! 
JACEY I know.    I mean, I do now. 
DOUG Then what the hell did Pam ever do to deserve your revenge? 
JACEY Nothing. (CONTINUED)

DOUG Just your way of evening the score with Lloyd Abbott, right? 
JACEY Right. 
Doug spins and delivers a wild, roundhouse punch that lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has split open, he is blinded by blood. 
DOUG I don't know   you! I don't know who the fuck   you are! You fuck everything.    You fuck everything up! Why did    you have to fuck Pam, too?! 
Doug walks away, leaving Jacey sitting on the steps, clutching a banister for support. He presses his palm to his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood. 
152     EXT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - DAY                                 152 
Doug approaches Pam's dormitory. 
153     INT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - LOBBY - DAY                         153 
Doug steps up to the female student CLERK (#2) at the front desk. 
DOUG Pamela Abbott, please.     Tell her Doug is here. 
CLERK #2 She's not here. 
DOUG I'll wait. 
CLERK #2 But she left. 
DOUG What do you mean? 
CLERK #2 She left... last night.

DOUG Where did she go? 
CLERK #2 I don't know. 
DOUG Well, did she go home? 
CLERK #2 No one seems to know. She just took some clothes and left. 
DOUG (lost) Oh, God... no... 
His pain is so clear that it spurs the Clerk's sympathy. 
CLERK #2 Look, I'm not supposed to do this, but... well, I can give you her home address. 
DOUG (explodes with irony) Shit! Yeah, right... (slight beat) I mean... thanks. Thanks anyway. I know her home address. 
154     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY (DECEMBER, 1959)                  154 
The Abbott house is decked with snow. Doug sits    behind the wheel of the Plymouth. He's parked down the    street. He smokes a cigarette and stares at the house --   the pavement outside the driver's window is littered   with butts. 
155   EXT. SHOP (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY                               155 
Alice comes out on the street laden with packages and shopping bags. She's startled by Doug when he falls in beside her and follows her down the sidewalk. 
DOUG Where's Pam? 
ALICE I don't know. 
DOUG Is she with Eleanor? (CONTINUED)

DOUG In Chicago? 
ALICE I don't know. 
DOUG I couldn't find Eleanor's name in the Chicago phone book. 
ALICE Maybe it's unlisted. 
DOUG Well, do you know Eleanor's address? 
JACEY About what? 
DOUG I should live my own life. Stop being your shadow. I'm not like you, Jacey -- I don't want to be like you. 
JACEY You going to stay here?   In Haley? 
DOUG No. I was thinking New York. If I'm going to really learn how to design sets, that's the place to do it. 
JACEY (long beat) I'm sorry. 
DOUG I know you are. (slight beat) Did you have to get stitches? 
JACEY Hmmm? 
DOUG Your eyebrow. 
JACEY My eyebrow -- yeah, ten stitches. 
DOUG Sorry. 
Doug takes an envelope out of his coat pocket and puts it on the table. 
DOUG Found this in one of the boxes in the basement. 
JACEY What is it? 
DOUG A letter of agreement between Lloyd Abbott and Dad. Dad sold him the file drawer patent -- not Mom.

Jacey opens the envelope and studies the yellowed document. 
JACEY (re:   document) A car? 
DOUG Yup. 
JACEY Jesus Christ... he sold the patent for a used car? 
DOUG Used cars were the only kind of cars around. The war was on -- everything was mobilized. They stopped making new cars, they were making tanks and bombers in Detroit. And even Midwest Steel wasn't making desks, they were making ammo boxes and mortar shells. 
JACEY How did you get to be such an expert on World War Two? 
DOUG U.S. History -- high school. I should be an expert, I had to take the damn class twice. I guess Dad needed a car and he figured who- the-hell needed a full-suspension file drawer? 
JACEY (reading aloud) '1937 Desoto coupe convertible as is.' 
DOUG Wonder whatever happened to it? 
JACEY He parked it at the bottom of the lake. 
169     EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY                    169 
Doug follows Jacey to the door of the bus. Neither one of them knows how to say good-bye, after an awkward beat: 
(CONTINUED) 
169     CONTINUED:                                                      169 
JACEY (fighting back tears) Do me a favor. Don't stand here and wave good-bye... it makes me think of Mom. 
DOUG Okay.   See you. 
Doug turns and walks away.   Jacey climbs onto the bus. 
170     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY                                 170 
Doug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth. He slows as he sees... the party tent in the Abbotts' front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up). 
Susan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well- dressed children and their parents are in attendance. Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a gift from her grandparents. A new generation of Abbott parties has begun. 
171     EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY                                 171 
A "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard. Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth. He turns OFF the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway. 
172     INT. ABBOTT HOME - TENT - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                172 
Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old, this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with his cronies. Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the guests take notice of him as he works his way across the tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd scrutinizes Doug, then: 
LLOYD What do you want? 
DOUG I want to talk to you. 
173     INT. ABBOTT HOUSE - DEN - DAY                                   173 
Doug follows Lloyd into the dark-paneled room. 
LLOYD Shut the door. 
Doug closes the door.   Lloyd lights a cigarette.

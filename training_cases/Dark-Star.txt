"Dark Star", short film script, by John Carpenter & Dan O'Bannon 
DARK STAR: A SCIENCE FICTION ADVENTURE 
A Screenplay by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon 
OPEN ON BLACK SILENCE. 
The sound of electronic music rises, hollow, metallic. 
FADE IN on a long TRACKING SHOT through the universe.  As the NARRATOR speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within a maze of suns. 
NARRATOR (over) It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind has explored the boundaries of his own solar system, and now he reaches out to the endless interstellar distances of the universe.  He moves away from his own small planetary system in huge hyperdrive starships: computer-driven, self-supporting, closed-system spacecraft that travel at mind-staggering post-light velocities.  Man has begun to spread among the stars.  Enormous ships embark with generations of colonists searching the depths of space for new earths, now homes, new beginnings.  Far in advance of these colony ships goes a new pioneer: the scouts, the pathfinders, a special breed of man who has dedicated his life to blazing the trail through the most distant, unexplored galaxies, opening up the farthest frontiers of space.  These are the men of the Advance Exploration Corps.  The task they face is one of unbelievable isolation and loneliness.  So far from home that Earth is no longer even a point of light in the sky, they must comb the universe for those unstable planets whose existence poses a threat to the peaceful colonists that follow. They must find these rogue planets -- and destroy them.  Among these commandos are the men of the scoutship Dark Star. 
We are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear VOICES, crackling with static. 
DOOLITTLE (over -- radio filter) Ah, what'd you say, Pinback? 
PINBACK (over -- great static) Mafhkin oble groop... 
DOOLITTLE (over -- filter) Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you? 
PINBACK (over -- filter) I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom.  I need a last-minute diameter approximation. 
CAMERA IS NOW FLOATING TOWARD THE OBSERVATION DOME on top of the ship. In the Dome sits TALBY.  He is staring around, wide-eyed, at the planets and stars. 
DOOLITTLE (over -- filter) Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.  Do you read me?  Talby? 
WE MOVE IN CLOSE ON TALBY'S FACE.  The shot stops and holds as he continues to stare, rapt. 
DOOLITTLE Your GHF reading is minus fifteen. 
PINBACK Doolittle... 
DOOLITTLE Yes. 
PINBACK I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark. 
DOOLITTLE In a second. 
PINBACK Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures? 
BOILER Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical. 
PINBACK I read that with a quantum increase of seven. 
DOOLITTLE Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven. 
BOILER Time to start talking. 
PINBACK Bomb bay systems operational. 
Pinback hits a button on his panel. 
INTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
The screen is BLACK for an instant.  Then, two enormous doors begin to open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below.  A huge BOMB, designated with a giant #19 on its side, lowers slowly out of the ship on a rack. 
NARRATOR (over) This is a chain-reaction bomb, otherwise known as an Exponential Thermostellar Device.  Its own destructive power is small, barely enough to vaporize twelve city blocks.  However, when it explodes in contact with an object the size of a planet, it starts a chain-reaction in the very matter of that planet, turning it into a giant reactor which destroys itself in one staggering thermal flash. 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #19 Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
PINBACK All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock. (hits panel) All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years. (beats panel again) Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there? 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #19 Check at six minutes. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
PINBACK Arm yourself, bomb. 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
Several lights blip on along the bomb's side. 
BOMB #19 Armed. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
PINBACK Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds.  Good luck. 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #19 Thanks. 
INSERT - CLOSE SHOT OF A PANEL.  On a small screen we see the exploding planet, and below, a readout says: 
DESTRUCTION SEQUENCE COMPLETE 
RETURN TO SCENE 
Talby touches his intercom. 
TALBY Lieutenant Doolittle, it just exploded. (pause) Ah, sir, the planet just exploded. (pause -- he shakes the microphone) Lieutenant? 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
The men are stretching in their seats. 
DOOLITTLE Unlock fail safe. 
Pinback unlocks the fail-safe unit. 
PINBACK Fail safe unlocked. 
RECORDED VOICE Attention.  Attention.  The hyperdrive sequence is now terminated.  Please observe that the no smoking signs have growrrr... 
The voice runs down. 
DOOLITTLE Well... now what?  What do, you have for us now.  Boiler? 
BOILER (checking his readouts) Not much.  Nothing at all in this sector. 
DOOLITTLE Find me something, I don't care where it is. 
PINBACK (scans the board) Naah.  All stable. 
Doolittle loses interest. 
PINBACK (cont'd) What are you gonna name it? 
DOOLITTLE (not looking up) What? 
PINBACK The new star.  What are you gonna name it? 
DOOLITTLE Who cares.  Don't bother me. 
Pinback's mouth tightens.  A pause. 
PINBACK Commander Powell would have named it. 
DOOLITTLE Commander Powell is dead. 
Involuntarily, Pinback glances at Commander Powell's empty, burned seat.  The panels behind it sputter. 
PINBACK Come on, Doolittle, give it a name. 
DOOLITTLE Fred. 
PINBACK Wha? 
DOOLITTLE I hereby name this star Fred. 
BOILER Hey, Doolittle, here's one.  An unstable planet.  85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star. 
Pinback leans back in and whispers emphatically.  Doolittle looks put- upon. 
DOOLITTLE (cont'd) And because he's sitting next to it, it continues to bother Pinback. (glares at Pinback. Then:) Storage Area 9 self-destructed last week, destroying entire ship's supply of toilet paper.  That's all. 
Beep. 
INTERIOR - OBSERVATION DOME 
Talby is still gazing around at the stars. 
A hatch opens in the floor and Doolittle sticks his head up. 
DOOLITTLE Talby. 
Talby rotates his seat and looks down at Doolittle. 
DOOLITTLE (cont'd) Here's some breakfast. 
Doolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor.  He hands Talby the food package, and watches matter-of-factly as Talby begins to eat. 
DOOLITTLE (cont'd) You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us.  You spend too much time up here. 
TALBY I like it up here. 
DOOLITTLE Must get lonely being up here so much. 
TALBY I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died.  I feel enclosed down there.  If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here... 
DOOLITTLE ... Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship... 
TALBY ... Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits... 
DOOLITTLE I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all. 
Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly. 
TALBY Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is. 
DOOLITTLE (snapped out of his daydream) Don't worry about it.  We'll find out when it goes bad. 
TALBY (chagrined) I really think I should try and locate it immediately.  Might be something important. 
DOOLITTLE I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile. 
EXTERIOR - SPACE 
LONG SHOT of the DARK STAR drifting through space. 
INTERIOR - KITCHEN 
Boiler, Pinback, and Doolittle are descending a ladder into the kitchen. 
BOILER I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels. 
PINBACK What flickering light? 
BOILER The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero. 
PINBACK Oh.  What's wrong now? 
Sorry to hear about all the malfunctions, and real sorry to hear about the death of Commander Powell. There was a week of mourning all over Earth.  The flags were at half mast. 
Now I hate to send bad news when you guys are up there doing such a swell job, but something's come up, and we all felt you ought to know about it. Our systems simulation computer has predicted that by the time this message reaches you -- that is to say, in about ten years -- there will be a failure in one of your vital ship's systems.  The malfunction will occur in -- (rifles papers) -- system number E180246.  You can see what a problem this would be if you didn't catch it on time.  Now what you should do is this: First, do not, repeat, do not attempt to adjust the system manually. Second -- 
INTERIOR - COMPUTER ROOM 
The room is dim and eerie, banks of dimly flickering lights and the hum of air-cooling machinery. 
Talby is seated before a glowing screen.  He punches several buttons, and the screen comes to life.  A schematic cross-section of the ship appears in glowing green lines. 
Talby punches more buttons, and the screen flashes through the levels or the ship.  Finally it shows Level 6.  There is a small red light pulsing in the Emergency Air Lock. 
Talby punches another button.  The Emergency Air Lock is magnified fifteen times until it fills the screen.  The red light is pulsing in a small area labelled COMMUNICATIONS LASER #17. 
Talby picks up a microphone. 
TALBY Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant? 
DOOLITTLE (over -- filter) Yes, Talby, what is it? 
TALBY Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock.  Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it. 
INTERIOR - KITCHEN 
DOOLITTLE Sounds good, Talby.  Let me know if anything important comes up. 
Doolittle hangs up the mike. 
BOILER Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us? 
A GLOWING SCREEN shows a schematic of the planet rotating below. Boiler stares at it, smiling. 
BOILER There she is.  Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and -- 
PINBACK Eventual supernova. 
DOOLITTLE Good stuff.  Let's vaporize it. 
Pinback hits buttons. 
PINBACK Bomb bay systems operational. 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #20 lowers ponderously out of the ship. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
DOOLITTLE Lock fail safe. 
Pinback turns the key. 
PINBACK Fail safe in lock.  Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation.  This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20.  Do you read me, bomb? 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #20 Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback.  Roger, I read you, continue. 
INTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK 
BOMB #20 Energy shielding positive function. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
PINBACK Do you remember the detonation time? 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #2 Detonation in twenty minutes. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
PINBACK Right, that synchronizes here.  Okay, bomb, arm yourself. 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #20 Armed. 
INTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK 
Talby stands in front of the laser shaft, trying to reach Doolittle on his helmet radio. 
TALBY Hello?  Lieutenant Doolittle?  Hello! 
Silence. 
Very carefully, Talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on the laser shaft.  He pushes it, and it drops to the floor of the lock with a CLANG. 
RECORDED VOICE Communications Laser #17, monitoring information relays and bomb bay systems, has now been activated and will switch into a test mode.  If you will look near the Surface Door, you will see that the Parallax Receptor Cell has been engaged. 
POWELL Doolittle, you must tell me one thing. 
DOOLITTLE What's that, sir? 
POWELL Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing? 
DOOLITTLE Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago. 
POWELL Ah... pity, pity... 
DOOLITTLE You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop. 
POWELL Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me?  Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch? 
DOOLITTLE Yes sir.  Negative effect. 
POWELL What was that, Doolittle? 
DOOLITTLE Negative effect. 
POWELL It didn't work? 
DOOLITTLE That's correct, sir. 
POWELL Sorry, Doolittle.  I've forgotten so much since I've been in here.  So much. 
DOOLITTLE What should we do, sir?  The time is running out. 
POWELL Well, what you might try is -- 
PINBACK Look, bomb... 
INTERIOR - FREEZER ROOM 
DOOLITTLE Commander?  Are you still there? 
POWELL Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking. 
DOOLITTLE We're running out of time, sir. 
POWELL Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it. 
DOOLITTLE Sir? 
POWELL Talk to the bomb. 
DOOLITTLE I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now. 
POWELL No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle. 
DOOLITTLE Sir? 
POWELL Phenomenology... 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
PINBACK Doolittle!  Doolittle!  Six minutes to detonation! 
INTERIOR - VENTRAL AIR LOCK 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #20 Well of course I exist. 
DOOLITTLE But how do you know you exist? 
BOMB #20 It is intuitively obvious. 
DOOLITTLE Intuition is no proof.  What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence? 
BOMB #20 Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am. 
DOOLITTLE That's good.  Very good.  Now then, how do you know that anything else exists? 
BOMB #20 My sensory apparatus reveals it to me. 
DOOLITTLE Right! 
BOMB #20 This is fun. 
DOOLITTLE All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct? 
INTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK 
Talby lies unconscious near the burned laser. 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
DOOLITTLE What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data.  And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center. 
PINBACK I don't have it.  I don't know where it is. 
BOILER You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb! 
EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
DOOLITTLE Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully.  What is your one purpose in life? 
BOMB #20 To explode, of course. 
DOOLITTLE And you can only do it once, right? 
BOMB #20 That is correct. 
DOOLITTLE And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you? 
BOMB #20 Of course not. 
DOOLITTLE Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe. 
BOMB #20 Yes, well... 
DOOLITTLE So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate. 
BOMB #20 I recall distinctly the detonation order.  My memory is good on matters like these. 
DOOLITTLE Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality. 
BOMB #20 True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this. 
PINBACK Yeah, Doolittle.  What's up? 
EXTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK 
DOOLITTLE Talby was in the air lock.  You blew him out of the ship.  I'm going after him.  Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
BOILER What was that, I didn't hear... 
PINBACK It's Talby.  He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack. 
EXTERIOR - SPACE 
Doolittle fires his jetpack, moving off into space after Talby. 
DOOLITTLE Talby, Talby, can you read me? 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
BOILER Can you beat that?  I always knew Talby was weird. 
EXTERIOR - SPACE 
DOOLITTLE Talby, can you read me? 
Talby is spinning wildly. 
TALBY Help, Doolittle, help me! 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
PINBACK Snap out of it, bomb. 
INTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #20 In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
BOILER What the hell? 
PINBACK Yoo hoo, bomb... 
INTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #20 And in addition to the darkness there was also me.  And I moved upon the face of the darkness. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
BOILER Bomb, hey bomb. 
PINBACK Hey, bomb... 
INTERIOR - BOMB BAY 
BOMB #20 And I saw that I was alone. 
Pause. 
The planet begins to rise behind Doolittle. 
DOOLITTLE (cont'd) Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby.  Going right toward it. 
TALBY When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you.  They may see you coming down.  What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star... 
DOOLITTLE Guess you're right. 
Talby turns his head and looks behind him. 
TALBY Doolittle, I'm heading right toward something.  It's behind me, in the distance.  Something that glows. 
Far behind Talby, coming nearer, is a shimmering point of light. 
DOOLITTLE Oh yeah? 
TALBY Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids! 
DOOLITTLE Phoenix? 
The point of light is closer now, and it has begun to differentiate into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes. 
TALBY It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said. 
DOOLITTLE No kidding? 
TALBY I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them.  Doolittle... 
DOOLITTLE Yeah?

JEAN-LOUIS Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter -- 
REGGIE -- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay? 
JEAN-LOUIS Okay. 
REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries her cases.  She presses the button that electrically opens the front door. 
DELETED 
INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY 
As the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver. He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door. 
REGGIE (handing him a tip) Merci. 
The driver leaves. She goes to the door and presses the minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the lights come on. Then she rings the doorbell. There is no answer. She rings again. Still nothing. Sighing, she digs out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. At this moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into darkness. 
REGGIE'S VOICE Wonderful. 
She finds the button and the light goes on again. She inserts the key and turns it. 
INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- ENTRANCE HALL -- DAY 
CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR as it opens and REGGIE steps into the CLOSE SHOT. 
She stops, her expression changing. 
REVERSE SHOT 
From REGGIE's p.o.v. as CAMERA PANS the entrance hall. It is bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE 
She stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing. 
INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY 
As REGGIE steps back outside. She looks at the nameplate beside the door. 
INSERT NAMEPLATE 
It reads "MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LAMPERT." 
INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY 
REGGIE looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries back into the apartment. 
INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DAY 
As REGGIE hurries into the entrance hall. 
REGGIE Honorine -- ! 
No answer. 
Now, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still in the wall. 
She rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom, too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain. 
She pulls open the drawers -- nothing! 
REGGIE Charles -- ! 
She turns, and running now, goes through another door to the library, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The rows of shelves are as empty as the rest of the apartment. She begins to turn in a circle, looking for something, anything. In a panic she turns and runs out, colliding suddenly with a MAN whom she (and we) have not noticed until the moment of impact. 
REGGIE screams. 
CLOSE SHOT -- INSPECTOR GRANDPIERRE 
A heavy-set man of no particular age with tobacco-colored hair, and thick glasses. 
GRANDPIERRE Madame Charles Lampert? 
WIDER ANGLE 
Including REGGIE, in a state of near-shock. 
REGGIE Yes. 
GRANDPIERRE I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please? 
INT. MORGUE -- DAY 
We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too- familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin. 
ANOTHER ANGLE -- OVERHEAD 
Looking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer. 
GRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe. 
He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head.  As the sheet starts to lift: 
REVERSE SHOT 
REGGIE as she looks down into the CAMERA. She closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again. 
GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.) Well, Madame -- ? 
She nods. 
GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.) You are positive? 
She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT. 
GRANDPIERRE You loved him? 
REGGIE I'm very cold. 
GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT. 
CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies. 
INT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- DAY 
CLOSE SHOT -- DESK DRAWER (FROM ABOVE) as it is pulled open. 
A photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE 
GRANDPIERRE Have you nothing to say, Madame? 
REGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to GRANDPIERRE. 
REGGIE (hopefully) It's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now. 
INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK 
The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby. 
Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING. 
CLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE 
As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As PETER enters. 
REGGIE (surprised) What are you doing here? 
PETER I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do. 
REGGIE How did you find out? 
PETER It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry. 
REGGIE Thank you. 
A silence. 
PETER I rang the bell but I don't think it's working. 
REGGIE Yes it is -- I heard it this morning. 
He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more times. 
REGGIE They must have turned off the electricity. 
She shakes her head. PETER looks around. 
PETER Where did everything go? 
REGGIE Charles sold it all -- at auction. 
PETER Do you know what you're going to do? 
REGGIE Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose. 
PETER Doing what? 
REGGIE I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him. 
PETER Instant divorce you mean? 
REGGIE Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail. 
PETER (Taking her hand) Come on. You can't stay here. 
REGGIE I don't know where to go. 
PETER We'll find you a hotel. 
REGGIE Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore. 
PETER Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay? 
She nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out. 
REGGIE stops at the door and looks back. 
REGGIE I loved this room -- but Charles never saw it -- only what was in it. All those exquisite things -- (looking around) I think I prefer it like this. 
INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY 
CLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning. 
An instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar. 
INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY 
CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open. 
Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie the remnants of Charles Lampert. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE 
The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row, REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at the empty room. They speak in whispers. 
REGGIE It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out. 
SYLVIE Didn't Charles have any friends? 
REGGIE Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow. (indicating GRANDPIERRE) If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him. 
SYLVIE At least he knows how to behave at funerals. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE 
His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper. 
TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE 
SYLVIE Have you no idea who could have done it? 
REGGIE Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that. 
The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn. 
MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR 
The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE 
As he watches GIDEON. 
EXT. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY 
The fine old building in the Rue Gabriel. 
DELETED 
INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY 
As REGGIE leaves the elevator two young DIPLOMATIC TYPES step in, immersed in conversation. 
1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE I bluffed the Old Man out of the last pot -- with a pair of deuces. 
2ND DIPLOMATIC TYPE What's so depressing about that? 
1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE If I can do it, what are the Russians doing to him? 
The elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door. 
MED. SHOT -- DOOR 
It is marked "307-A  H. BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE checks the letter, then opens the door. 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY 
The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar. 
REGGIE (tentatively) Hello -- ? (there is no answer) Hello? 
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.) (from the private office) Is there anything wrong, Miss Tompkins? 
REGGIE Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here. 
BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion. 
BARTHOLOMEW I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ? 
REGGIE Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert. 
BARTHOLOMEW (looking at his watch) Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late. 
He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so. 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY 
A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it. 
BARTHOLOMEW Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert -- it's a stubborn little devil. 
He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie. 
BARTHOLOMEW Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow. 
REGGIE Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am? 
BARTHOLOMEW (looking up) Charles Lampert's widow -- yes? (going back to the tie) Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back. 
He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie. 
BARTHOLOMEW Voilà! As they say. 
He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket. 
He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups. 
BARTHOLOMEW Have some, please. I've got... (checking) ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst. 
REGGIE No thanks. 
He uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating. 
BARTHOLOMEW Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert? 
REGGIE I don't suppose it's an airline, is it? 
BARTHOLOMEW Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A. 
REGGIE You mean spies and things like that? 
BARTHOLOMEW Only we call them agents. 
REGGIE We? You mean you're --? 
BARTHOLOMEW Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert -- 
REGGIE I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit -- 
BARTHOLOMEW I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs -- 
REGGIE Agent. 
BARTHOLOMEW Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business. 
REGGIE What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew? 
BARTHOLOMEW (his mouth full) Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government. 
REGGIE May I have a sandwich, please? 
He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her. 
BARTHOLOMEW To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency. 
REGGIE (eating) So that was it. 
BARTHOLOMEW Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name. 
REGGIE (almost choking) His -- real -- ? 
BARTHOLOMEW Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss -- (taking a photo from his desk) -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you? (indicating the kids on the desk) Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr. 
REGGIE Very sweet. 
BARTHOLOMEW Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and -- 
REGGIE Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license. 
BARTHOLOMEW Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look. 
He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which he gives her. 
REGGIE (into 'phone) Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew: I've seen one of the (she stops) Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me? 
She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice. 
REGGIE Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Regina Lam... 
Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to look, slamming the receiver down as she does. 
REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT 
TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo), the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified. 
TEX Howdy, Miz Lampert. 
REGGIE Wha -- what do you want? 
TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket. 
TEX You know what I want, Miz Lampert... 
REGGIE No -- no, I'm don't. 
TEX Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob! 
He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the burning match in his hand afterward. 
REGGIE I don't know what -- 
TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically. 
REGGIE What are you doing? 
TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She beats this one out too. 
REGGIE Stop that! 
TEX Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert -- 
He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with it. She shrinks back. 
TEX It could get a whole lot worse. 
Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else. 
TEX It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert? 
REGGIE Please stop -- please! 
TEX You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear? 
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE 
As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her work. 
REGGIE You're insane, absolutely insane! 
She looks up, then blinks her eyes. 
INT. 'PHONE BOOTH OVER REGGIE'S SHOULDER 
There is no one there. REGGIE rises and steps out of the booth. 
INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE looks around. There is no one there. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH 
As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes. 
Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time it is PETER. 
PETER What are you doing in here? 
REGGIE (a sigh of relief) Having a nervous breakdown. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT 
REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby. 
PETER You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there? 
REGGIE I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not. 
PETER I don't think I follow you. 
REGGIE He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me. 
PETER Who said? 
REGGIE That's what I'm not supposed to say. 
PETER Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it. 
REGGIE Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me. 
PETER I wasn't -- 
REGGIE Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime. 
She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT CLERK greets them sleepily. 
NIGHT CLERK Bonsoir. 
REGGIE Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous plait. 
The NIGHT CLERK gets the key off a hook and hands it to REGGIE. 
NIGHT CLERK Bonne nuit. 
REGGIE (to PETER) Would you mind seeing me to the door? 
PETER Of course not. 
They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her. 
INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together. 
REGGIE Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him. 
PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks out. He then turns back. 
PETER Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute. 
REGGIE Be careful, Peter. 
PETER (one leg over the sill) You took the words right out of my mouth. 
He climbs out. 
EXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT 
Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears and looks down over the railing. 
EXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT 
SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump. 
MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY 
He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on one side, but there are two or three on the other. 
PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony. 
CLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND 
As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short of touching it. 
MED. SHOT -- PETER 
As he straightens up and prepares to jump. 
EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT 
From the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony. 
MED. SHOT -- PETER 
As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees a light coming through the window and looks in. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Oh! 
PETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following exchange is heard (in British English). 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) What is it now, Pamela? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) It happened again, Henry -- another strange man peered in the window at me and then went away. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Bad luck, Pamela. 
EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT 
From the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony. 
MED. SHOT -- PETER 
As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in. 
MED. SHOT -- WINDOW -- OVER PETER'S SHOULDER 
Inside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of a heated discussion. 
GIDEON That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move. 
TEX And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy -- 
INT. GIDEON'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 
TEX -- but sneakin' in there on your own that-a-way, why, man, you was bound to get yore tokus kicked. I mean, what'd you think he'd do -- walk up 'n' shake you by that hand o' yores? 
PETER'S VOICE (O.S.) That's right, Herman -- you didn't leave me much choice. 
They all turn toward the window. 
WIDER ANGLE 
As PETER climbs in through the window and joins them. 
PETER (to SCOBIE) I didn't hurt you, did I? 
SCOBIE shakes his head and turns away. 
GIDEON (eagerly) Never mind that -- did you get the money? 
PETER How could I with the three Marx Brothers breathing down my neck? You said you'd let me handle it alone -- ! The girl trusts me. If she's got it, I'll find out about it. But you've got to leave me alone. 
SCOBIE (to GIDEON and TEX) We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him! 
TEX Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor. 
SCOBIE Yeah? What's that? 
TEX He took care of Charlie for us. 
GIDEON (to PETER) We appreciate it, really we do. 
SCOBIE But who asked him? Three shares are enough -- I'd say he's out! 
PETER A third of nothing is nothing, Herman. Make up your minds -- she's waiting for me. 
GIDEON (thoughtfully) I don't see how another twenty-four hours could hurt. 
TEX Shoot no, not after all these years. 
SCOBIE Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine! 
SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it. 
GIDEON begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his pocket and swallows two white tablets. 
GIDEON I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success. 
TEX (chuckling) That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly. 
PETER Who's got the room next to hers? 
TEX Me. How come? 
REGGIE I believe what he said. 
PETER They're only trying to scare you, that's all. 
REGGIE How do you know what they're doing? 
PETER I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it -- 
REGGIE What are you talking about? 
PETER You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words. 
REGGIE (softly) Words can hurt very much. 
PETER (a pause) Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning. 
REGGIE Don't put yourself out. 
PETER Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that. 
REGGIE Yes, I'll remember. Good night. 
PETER Good night. 
He starts out, pausing by the door and examining the hole SCOBIE made in it. 
PETER But if you'll take my advice -- (smiling) You'll undress in the closet. Oh, and if you need me, just bang on the wall. I'll be next door. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT 
As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath. 
INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
As DYLE enters, the thread in his hand. He goes to a nearby table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key, which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE is on the phone. 
REGGIE (excited) -- But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew -- what I called to tell you was there's someone else -- someone who wasn't in that photograph you showed me. He says his name is Peter Joshua -- but it isn't -- it's Dyle. (a pause) Mr. Bartholomew? -- are you still there? 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
BARTHOLOMEW on the phone. He is silent for a moment, his face troubled. 
BARTHOLOMEW I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE (on the phone) You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me! 
DELETED 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
BARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles? 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE (on the phone) Yes, where? (a pause) -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there. 
DELETED 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair in the mirror, then starts for the door. She stops as she notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, DYLE's room. She goes to it, silently slips out the key and bends to peer through the keyhole. 
INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT (THROUGH KEYHOLE) 
DYLE is removing his coat. Before he lays it over a chair, he takes a gun from the inside pocket, checks it, and tucks it into his belt. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE reacts in surprise and fright, jumps quickly away from the door. She hurries to the door leading to the hall and reaches for the knob. 
INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT -- ROOM KEY. The thread attached to it is pulled (by the action of REGGIE's door opening) and the key falls to the floor with a clatter. 
WIDE ANGLE 
Including DYLE as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at the key. Snatching his coat, he runs for the door. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE sneaks past DYLE's door. When she has passed, the door opens and DYLE appears. REGGIE takes off on the run, turning the corner and starting down the stairs. 
DYLE Reggie -- ! 
He starts after her. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT 
It is deserted, except for the sleeping NIGHT PORTER, as REGGIE comes running down the stairs. 
DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.) Reggie... ! 
She turns, looking back towards the sound of his voice, but does not slacken her speed. She runs out the front door. 
EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE runs out. She looks up the street, sees a TAXI and hails it. 
REGGIE Taxi -- ! 
It pulls over to the curb. Looking once more over her shoulder she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver. 
REGGIE N'importe où -- vite! Allez-y! 
She jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the TAXI pulls away. At the same time DYLE runs out of the hotel. Another TAXI is coming down the street. DYLE hails it frantically. 
DYLE Taxi -- ! Taxi -- ! 
It pulls up and DYLE opens the door. 
DYLE (pointing) Follow that taxi. 
DRIVER Comment? 
The WAITER nods and goes. 
REGGIE (anxiously) Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground -- 
BARTHOLOMEW Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money. 
REGGIE Steal it how? 
BARTHOLOMEW By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked. 
REGGIE (fascinated) May I have a cigarette, please? 
BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. He winces. 
REGGIE I hate these things -- it's like drinking coffee through a veil. 
She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it. 
BARTHOLOMEW Everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried -- then, before they could get out, they were ambushed by a German patrol. A machine gun separated Scobie from his right hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach. 
REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth. 
BARTHOLOMEW What's wrong with that one? 
He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray. 
REGGIE Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened then? 
She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first cigarette. 
BARTHOLOMEW Have you any idea what these things cost over here? 
REGGIE Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then? 
BARTHOLOMEW Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they -- 
The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup. 
WAITER La soupe, c'est pour qui? 
REGGIE Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew. 
The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves. 
BARTHOLOMEW Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again. 
REGGIE But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them? 
BARTHOLOMEW We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof. 
REGGIE But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.? 
BARTHOLOMEW C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back. 
REGGIE I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight. 
BARTHOLOMEW I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you. 
REGGIE Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country. 
BARTHOLOMEW That's the spirit. 
REGGIE Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do? 
BARTHOLOMEW We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle. 
REGGIE Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive. 
BARTHOLOMEW No, Mrs. Lampert. 
REGGIE But no one actually saw him die. 
BARTHOLOMEW No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington. 
REGGIE Oh. Then who's this one? 
BARTHOLOMEW I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you? 
REGGIE Me? Why me? 
BARTHOLOMEW You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you. (grinning) Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies. 
REGGIE (resigned) Agents. 
EXT. HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON 
DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding her from view. 
EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON 
First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged TOURIST. 
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST 
The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it. 
He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her. 
REGGIE turns to look at DYLE. 
MED. SHOT -- DYLE 
He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on. 
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST 
The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some money on the table and starts after her. 
EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON 
REGGIE following DYLE. As she passes the GIRL painting, she cannot resist turning to see the work. 
CLOSE SHOT -- PAINTING 
An abstract jumble, nothing recognizable. 
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE 
As she looks from the painting to reality. 
REGGIE Sure. 
DYLE Okay, I'll drive you around there some day. (his back stinging) Ouch! 
REGGIE Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days. 
DYLE Alexander. 
REGGIE Is there a Mrs. Dyle? 
DYLE Yes, but we're divorced. 
REGGIE I thought that was Peter Joshua. 
DYLE (smiling) I'm no easier to live with than he was. 
REGGIE (finishing the bandage) There -- you're a new man. 
As they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes into his own room. REGGIE remains on the bed, watching him through the open door as he puts on a fresh T-shirt and shirt. 
DYLE I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this. 
REGGIE Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not? 
DYLE You can't. 
REGGIE There must be some way. 
DYLE There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he? 
REGGIE Why couldn't you just look at his feet? 
DYLE Because he's wearing moccasins. 
REGGIE Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course. 
DYLE Why not a lying Blackfoot? 
REGGIE (confused) Which one are you? 
DYLE (entering, smiling) Whitefoot, of course. 
REGGIE Come here. 
He goes to the bed. 
REGGIE Sit down. 
He sits. 
REGGIE I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee. 
DYLE Reggie -- listen to me -- 
REGGIE Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. 
DYLE So was Juliet -- at fifteen. 
REGGIE I'm not fifteen. 
DYLE Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me. 
REGGIE Why can't you be serious? 
DYLE There, you said it. 
REGGIE Said what? 
DYLE Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be. 
REGGIE Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that? 
She starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek. 
DYLE Now please, Reggie -- cut it out. 
REGGIE (pulling back) Okay. 
DYLE What are you doing? 
REGGIE Cutting it out. 
DYLE Who told you to do that? 
REGGIE You did. 
DYLE But I'm not through complaining yet. 
REGGIE Oh. (She starts kissing him again) 
DYLE Now please, Reggie -- cut it out. 
REGGIE I think I love you, Alex -- 
She kisses him on the mouth. The phone rings. He tries to talk as she continues kissing him. 
DYLE (mumbling) The phone's ringing -- 
REGGIE Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I. 
The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him. 
Finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths and mumbles into it. 
REGGIE (on phone) Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling on something. 
INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
TEX speaks into the phone. 
TEX Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd oblige it mighty highly if you could mosey on across the hall 'n chew the fat with us for a spell. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
DYLE is watching her. 
REGGIE (on the phone) Can you give me one good reason why I should? 
INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
TEX Mine's in the door. Ariva durchy, y'all. 
The THREE MEN file out. DYLE and REGGIE exchange looks. 
DYLE Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote? 
REGGIE Scobie -- he's the one that objected. 
DYLE (handing her the boy) He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside. 
REGGIE Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt. 
JEAN-LOUIS (joining them) Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize? 
REGGIE (to DYLE) What should we give him? 
DYLE How about $25,000? Or do you think it would spoil him? 
She smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to survey TEX's room. 
He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next -- he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare. 
Then, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT -- AIRLINES BAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include GIDEON, staring down at it as it lies on the table in the center of the room. 
GIDEON (eyes on the bag) Tex? 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Including TEX, busy going through the bureau. He looks up, then joins GIDEON. 
TEX What's that? 
GIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then starts examining the various items. He opens the wallet. 
INSERT - WALLET 
Inside, the initials "C.L." are printed in gold. 
TEX'S VOICE (O.S.) Charlie's stuff? 
GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.) Looks like it. 
MED. SHOT -- TEX & GIDEON 
TEX Mebbe we'd better call Herman. 
GIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter, removing it from the envelope and reading it. 
GIDEON What for? If it's not here, why bother him? 
TEX And if it is? 
GIDEON (a pause) Why bother him? 
A broad grin from TEX. They continue going through the items from the bag. 
TEX You sure nuthin's missin'? 
GIDEON No. The police have kindly provided us with a list. 
TEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag. 
TEX There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million. 
GIDEON Not unless we're blind. 
TEX (staring at GIDEON) You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream? 
GIDEON Meaning what? 
TEX You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all. 
GIDEON (very sincerely) You know I'd tell you if I had it. 
TEX Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you. 
GIDEON Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too. 
TEX & GIDEON (together) Nachurly! 
The TWO MEN look at one another, then smile -- then laugh. 
DELETED 
INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE on the phone, JEAN-LOUIS standing by. 
REGGIE -- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly. Just hurry up and get here. 
She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS. 
REGGIE Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it? 
JEAN-LOUIS I know. I would bury it in the garden. 
REGGIE Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden. 
JEAN-LOUIS Oh. (Afterthought) Neither do I. (Seeing something) Voilà! 
REGGIE Voilà what? 
JEAN-LOUIS (pointing) Up there! I would put it up there! 
REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top of the high armoire. 
REGGIE You know something, cookie? Why not? 
Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly. 
REGGIE I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy. 
JEAN-LOUIS (jumping up and down) I found it! I found it! 
REGGIE If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy. 
GRANDPIERRE No! No! No! No! 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include, REGGIE, DYLE, TEX and GIDEON, all sitting silently in the INSPECTOR's office. 
GRANDPIERRE A man drowned in his bed -- impossible! And in his pajamas -- the second one in his pajamas -- c'est trop bête! Stop lying to me -- (Tapping the side of his nose) this nose tells me when you are lying -- it is never mistaken, not in twenty- three years -- this nose will make me commissaire of police. (Tapping his fingers on his desk) Mr. Dyle or Mr. Joshua -- which is it? 
DYLE Dyle. 
GRANDPIERRE And yet you registered in Megeve as Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against the law to register under an assumed name? 
DYLE No, I didn't. 
REGGIE It's done in America all the time. 
GRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause, he looks into each face in turn. 
GRANDPIERRE None of you will be permitted to leave Paris -- until this matter is cleared up. Only I warn you -- I will be watching. We use the guillotine in this country -- I have always suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight tickling sensation on the back of the neck. It is only a guess, of course -- I hope none of you ever finds out for certain. 
DELETED 
EXT. QUAI MONTEBELLO -- LATE AFTERNOON (TRAVELING) 
REGGIE and DYLE walking along the quai, next to the Seine, CAMERA LEADING. 
REGGIE Who do you think did it -- Gideon? 
DYLE Maybe. 
REGGIE Or Tex? 
DYLE Maybe. 
REGGIE You're a big help. Can I have one of those? 
They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the Pont au Double. DYLE shrugs. 
REGGIE (to the VENDOR) Vanille-chocolat. 
During the following, the VENDOR makes a double-decker cone and hands it to REGGIE. DYLE pays and they resume their walk -- all with no break in the dialogue. 
REGGIE I think Tex did it. 
DYLE Why? 
REGGIE Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect. 
DYLE Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it? 
REGGIE What's so illogical about that? 
DYLE A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon. 
REGGIE Oh. I guess they just can't help it. 
DYLE Who? 
REGGIE Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. (a pause) Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that? 
DYLE What -- like Scobie? 
REGGIE No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some? 
She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough force to dislodge the ice-cream. It lands right next to his lapel, over his outside breast pocket. 
DYLE (frowning) I'd love some, thanks. 
REGGIE I'm sorry. 
He pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. REGGIE still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it. 
Seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket. 
DYLE No sense messing up the streets. 
REGGIE Alex -- 
DYLE Hm? 
REGGIE I'm scared. 
DYLE Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you. 
REGGIE No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed. 
They resume walking. 
DYLE Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many -- 
REGGIE What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too. 
DYLE Yes, I know. 
REGGIE First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that? 
DYLE (surprised) What? Assassinate somebody? 
REGGIE No -- 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Including the Cathedral of NOTRE DAME in the background. 
REGGIE -- swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love -- like Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'? 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON 
As REGGIE and DYLE step from the elevator. 
REGGIE Hurry up and change -- I'm starved. 
DYLE Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches. 
He goes into his room and she goes into hers. 
DELETED 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 
She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks. 
BARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her. 
REGGIE (pause, quietly) Are you sure there's no mistake? 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON 
BARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 
REGGIE slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried expression on her face. Then the bathroom door opens and DYLE appears dressed in a large bath towel. Her back is to him. 
DYLE I left all my drip-dry dripping -- is it all right? 
She doesn't answer. 
DYLE Reggie -- is something wrong? 
She shakes her head. 
DYLE You're probably weak from hunger. You've only had five meals today. Hurry up and we'll go out. 
She turns and looks at him. 
REGGIE Do you mind if we go someplace crowded? I -- I feel like lots of people tonight. 
EXT. SEINE - BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- DUSK 
The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze with lights. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND DYLE (PROCESS) 
At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in the b.g. 
DYLE Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes. 
REGGIE I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me? 
DYLE Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that. 
REGGIE How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it. 
DYLE No -- not yet. 
REGGIE But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so? 
DYLE Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie? 
She doesn't answer. 
DYLE What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim? 
REGGIE It's a start, anyway. 
DYLE I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder. 
REGGIE Carson Dyle didn't have a brother. 
WIDER ANGLE 
She rises from the table and walks away. DYLE hesitates a moment, then follows. 
DYLE I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen? 
REGGIE (looking at the river) I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings. 
DYLE Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list. 
REGGIE Fiction or non-fiction? 
DYLE Why don't you shut up! 
REGGIE Well! 
DYLE Are you going to listen? 
REGGIE Go on. 
DYLE After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible. 
REGGIE I suppose all this is leading somewhere? 
DYLE It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support. 
REGGIE What do you mean? 
DYLE When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss. 
REGGIE (astonished) You mean, you're a thief? 
DYLE Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing. 
REGGIE I don't believe it. 
DYLE Well, I can't really blame you -- not now. 
REGGIE But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua. 
DYLE Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield. 
REGGIE Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more. 
DYLE (now called ADAM) The man's the same, even if the name isn't. 
REGGIE No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face -- 
ADAM Oh, come on! 
REGGIE -- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is. 
ADAM It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time. 
REGGIE Is there a Mrs. Canfield? 
ADAM Yes, but -- 
The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He presses the call button and the motor starts. 
An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic. 
GRANDPIERRE Three of them -- all in their pajamas! C'est ridicule! What is it, some new American fad? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their bathrobes. 
GRANDPIERRE And now your friend -- the one from Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked out -- pouf! into thin air! Where is he? 
ADAM I don't know. 
GRANDPIERRE Madame? 
REGGIE shrugs. 
GRANDPIERRE Tell me, Mr. Dyle -- where were you at three-thirty? 
ADAM In my room, asleep. 
GRANDPIERRE And you, Mrs. Lampert? 
REGGIE I was, too. 
GRANDPIERRE In Mr. Dyle's room? 
REGGIE (bitterly) No -- in my room. 
GRANDPIERRE (pause, lighting cigar) It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story? 
REGGIE and ADAM exchange looks. 
GRANDPIERRE And if I were you, I would not stay in my pajamas. Good night. 
GRANDPIERRE turns and leaves. REGGIE and ADAM start down the hall toward their own rooms. 
ADAM That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him. 
REGGIE You're going to look for him -- now? 
ADAM If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they? 
REGGIE Adam -- 
ADAM There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning. 
ADAM disappears into his own room. 
INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
As ADAM enters, going to the closet to remove his suit. 
The phone rings. He answers it. 
ADAM Yes? 
INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT -- TEX. As he speaks on the phone. 
TEX Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day. 
INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
ADAM (on the phone) Where are you, ol' buddy? 
INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT 
TEX (on the phone) (laughs) I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. (hangs up) 
INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
ADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts for REGGIE's door. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door. 
REGGIE What is it? 
ADAM Open up. 
She undoes the bolt and opens the door. ADAM enters. 
ADAM I think we were wrong about Tex having the money. 
REGGIE Why? 
ADAM I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it. 
REGGIE I've looked, Adam -- you know I have -- 
ADAM Where's that airlines bag? 
REGGIE Lord, you're stubborn. 
ADAM I sure am. Get it. 
She goes to the closet and gets the bag. 
ADAM Charles must have had the money with him on the train, and Tex missed it. 
He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents. 
REGGIE But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it. 
ADAM Let's look anyway. 
REGGIE Lord, you're stubborn. 
ADAM I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now. 
CLOSE SHOT -- BED WITH CHARLES' BELONGINGS 
ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.) Something on that bed is worth a quarter of a million dollars. 
The FRENCH DELEGATE is speaking. 
FRENCH DELEGATE Monsieur le Président, Messieurs les délégués -- mon distingué collègue de la Grande Bretagne -- le problème vu par mon Gouvernement n'est pas aussi simple que nos amis les Anglais voudraient nous le faire croire. Mais leur pays n'est pas, après tout, un pays agricole, n'est-ce pas? La position française, ainsi que nous l'avons soulignée dans le rapport numéro trente-neuf bar oblique cinquante-deux de la Conférence de l'hémisphère occidental qui a eu lieu le 22 mars -- 
INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY 
REGGIE is busy translating. 
REGGIE as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March (she stops) no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden! 
ADAM It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on! 
MED. SHOT -- CONFERENCE TABLE 
From REGGIE'S and ADAM'S ANGLE. All the DELEGATES and their AIDES suddenly turn, surprised, and look at CAMERA. 
REVERSE SHOT -- WINDOW 
From the DELEGATE'S ANGLE. Inside the booth, REGGIE and ADAM can be seen heading for the door in a hurry. 
MED. SHOT -- CONFERENCE TABLE 
As the DELEGATES look at one another, confused. 
EXT. GUIGNOL -- LATE AFTERNOON 
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM 
By the locked gate. 
REGGIE Now what? 
ADAM Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here. 
REGGIE But Charles' appointment was last week, not -- 
ADAM I know, but this is all we've got left. 
REGGIE Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job. 
ADAM Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there. 
VARIOUS SHOTS -- WHAT THEY SEE

EXT. FOUNTAIN -- LATE AFTERNOON 
ADAM stands by the large fountain, staring off at something as REGGIE joins him. 
REGGIE It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for. 
ADAM It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either. 
REGGIE Tex? You mean he's here, too? 
ADAM Look. 
MED. SHOT -- TEX 
He stands near the merry-go-round, looking at something in his hand: Charles' agenda. Now he closes it and moves off, disappearing behind a hedge. 
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM 
ADAM I'd better see what he's up to. Stay here -- I won't be long. 
ADAM starts off. 
REGGIE (concerned) Be careful, Adam -- please. He's already killed three men. 
DELETED 
EXT. RUE GABRIEL -- LATE AFTERNOON 
Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up. They have collected quite a CROWD. Into this area comes TEX, followed at a safe distance by ADAM. Suddenly TEX stops.

As he stares wide-eyed at something. 
CLOSE SHOT -- STAMPS 
Neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths.

CLOSE SHOT -- TEX 
He turns crazily to look at another booth, then another. 
CLOSE SHOT -- EVEN MORE STAMPS 
Various FLASH SHOTS of stamps of all sizes, shapes and colors. 
MED. SHOT -- TEX 
As he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into ADAM. TEX is startled. 
TEX Sorry, fella -- 
He rushes off past ADAM, who watches him for a moment, confused, then turns toward the booth, not yet having seen the stamps. 
MED. SHOT -- BOOTH 
From ADAM's angle. There are one or two persons standing at the booth. CAMERA ZOOMS in on the display of stamps. 
CLOSE SHOT -- ADAM 
ADAM (amazed) The letter. 
She rushes to him, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. JEAN-LOUIS stands looking at some stamps. SYLVIE grabs him. 
SYLVIE Jean-Louis -- les timbrés -- où sont- ils? 
Smiling, JEAN-LOUIS holds up an enormous sack of assorted stamps -- hundreds of them. 
SYLVIE Oh, zut! (calling) Reggie -- Reggie -- ! 
REGGIE runs up and joins them. 
REGGIE Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! (spotting the sack of stamps) What's that? 
JEAN-LOUIS A man traded with me -- all those for only four. 
REGGIE Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where? 
JEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember. 
SYLVIE Vite, mon ange -- vite! 
JEAN-LOUIS Là bas -- Monsieur Félix. 
They all run off down the line of booths. JEAN-LOUIS stops and points off. 
JEAN-LOUIS Il est là! 
MED. SHOT -- STAMP BOOTH 
Closed, deserted, empty. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS 
JEAN-LOUIS But he is gone. 
REGGIE I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives? 
JEAN-LOUIS No -- but I will ask. 
He goes to the closest booth and shakes the coat sleeve of the proprietor. 
JEAN-LOUIS Monsieur Théophile -- 
THÉOPHILE Oui, jeune homme? 
JEAN-LOUIS Monsieur Félix, où habite-il? 
THÉOPHILE A Montmartre -- demande à Monsieur August au Bar des Artistes -- Place Blanche. 
JEAN-LOUIS Merci, Monsieur Théophile. (returning to REGGIE and SYLVIE) He says to ask Monsieur August at the -- 
Before he can finish, SYLVIE, who has heard THÉOPHILE, has JEAN-LOUIS by the hand, dragging him off at full speed, REGGIE right alongside. 
DELETED 
INT. FÉLIX'S ROOM -- DUSK 
A bare, unkempt little room. FÉLIX, a man in his sixties, sits at a table, smoking a pipe. There are stamps and albums everywhere. He holds a magnifying glass in his hand, busy studying something on the table. There is a KNOCK. He looks up. Another KNOCK. 
FÉLIX Entrez. 
The door opens and REGGIE, followed by SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, enters. 
REGGIE Monsieur Félix -- ? 
FÉLIX (without looking up) I was expecting you. You are American too, of course. 
REGGIE (looking at SYLVIE) Yes. 
FÉLIX The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come. 
He gestures for REGGIE to come closer. Together with SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, she goes to the table and looks at the stamps. 
FÉLIX Look at them, Madame. 
INSERT -- STAMPS 
Four of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still attached to the portion of the torn envelope. 
FÉLIX (O.S.) Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful? 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, FÉLIX, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS 
REGGIE I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps. 
FÉLIX I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854. 
REGGIE How much is it worth? 
FÉLIX The money is unimportant. 
REGGIE I'm afraid it is important. 
FÉLIX (shrugging) In your money, perhaps $65,000. 
REGGIE Do you mind if I sit down? (she sits) What about the blue one? 
FÉLIX It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it. 
REGGIE What's its value today? 
FÉLIX In human life? In greed? In suffering? 
REGGIE In money. 
FÉLIX Forty-five thousand. 
REGGIE (to SYLVIE) Do you have anything to eat? (to FÉLIX) And the orange one -- what about the orange one? 
FÉLIX A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps. 
REGGIE And the last one? 
FÉLIX The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer. (looking at it through the glass) Today it has a value of $100,000. (a pause) Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them. 
REGGIE (hesitating) You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now? 
FÉLIX (looking at the large bag) Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty. 
REGGIE (fishing money from her purse) Here's ten. 
EXT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT 
A taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs to it. 
REGGIE (indicating the direction) Palais Royal -- vite! 
Calmly, the DRIVER points to the little printed sign on his windshield reading "ITALIE." 
DRIVER (pointing the other way) Porte d'Italie, moi. 
REGGIE Mais c'est très vite! On veut me teur! 
DRIVER (shaking his head) Italie. 
She looks around and sees ADAM come out of the hotel and straight toward her. She turns and runs off toward the Place St. Michel. 
EXT. PLACE ST. MICHEL -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE comes to the corner. She stops, sees the Métro station ("St. Michel") and rushes to it, scampering down the stairs. ADAM is behind her. 
INT. ST. MICHEL MÉTRO STATION -- NIGHT 
REGGIE comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket booth, fishing in her bag for her carnet (booklet of tickets), casting a quick look behind her. CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO ADAM just coming off the stairs, who runs after her. 
DELETED 
INT. MÉTRO TICKET GATE -- NIGHT 
REGGIE gets to the gate ahead of ADAM and manages to crowd in front of some OTHERS about to pass through. Barely stopping, she holds out her ticket to the GUARD to be punched, then heads down the platform, still running. ADAM gets to the gate but the GUARD stops him as he tries to pass through. 
GUARD Billet, Monsieur. 
ADAM (breathless) I don't want to go anywhere -- I'm only trying -- 
GUARD (pointing off) Billet, Monsieur. 
ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run. 
INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT 
CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls. 
CLOSE SHOT -- PASSAGEWAY WALL (TRAVELING) 
The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors. 
INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT 
REGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, an arrow for each. 
"DIRECTION: Pte D'ORLÉANS Pte DE CLIGNANCOURT-------" 
Choosing "Clignancourt," she runs off. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot pursuit. 
INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway. 
They stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train can be heard. 
REGGIE (to herself) Come on -- please -- 
She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station. 
INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT 
The gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and, commando style, vaults over it. 
INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move. 
INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT 
The entire length of the car separates ADAM and REGGIE. 
For a moment, their eyes meet, then ADAM starts to weave his way past the other PASSENGERS, on his way to her. 
Suddenly, he is stopped. ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD. 
TRAIN GUARD Billet, Monsieur. 
ADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but again the TRAIN GUARD stops him. 
TRAIN GUARD Vous êtes dans le premier classe, Monsieur. 
ADAM What? 
TRAIN GUARD (heavy accent) This car is for first class only -- you have a second-class ticket. 
ADAM But that's what they gave me. 
He tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself staring into the serious face of a GENDARME. 
GENDARME Monsieur -- ? 
ADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE. 
INT. "PALAIS-ROYAL" MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT 
As the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop. 
INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT 
The GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out. 
ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. She remains in the car. 
INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT 
The GENDARME gestures for ADAM to enter the green, second- class car behind the red, first-class one. Reluctantly, ADAM does. 
INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT 
As ADAM enters and goes to the door through which he can see REGGIE in the car ahead. She is gone. Moving quickly, he returns to the exit door and looks at the platform. 
INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT 
From ADAM'S P.O.V. She is hurrying toward an exit marked "SORTIE." 
ADAM Reggie -- please believe me! 
REGGIE No! 
As REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand. 
REGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, limping in her one shoe. ADAM scrambles to his feet and starts after her again. 
INT. MÉTRO TICKET BOOTH AREA -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE, still hobbling, runs through and toward the stairs, leading to the street. CAMERA PANS TO ADAM, as he, too, runs through. He is again several yards behind her. 
EXT. PLACE PALAIS ROYAL -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE comes up the stairs from the Métro. She stops long enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which forms one side of the Palais Royal). ADAM is gaining on her again. 
EXT. PALAIS ROYAL COURTYARD -- COLONNADE -- NIGHT 
The smaller court at the Comédie-Française end of the Palais gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each -- in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the columns, looking at his watch impatiently. 
Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs into the court. She spots "BARTHOLOMEW" and fishes in her bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving them. 
REGGIE Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me! 
ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the near end of the colonnade as he spots "BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE, still running, is halfway between the two men. "BARTHOLOMEW" draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked in among the columns. 
ADAM Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle! 
This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm. 
REGGIE (breathless) Carson -- ? 
She looks at "BARTHOLOMEW," then back at ADAM, who has drawn his own gun. 
(NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to). 
"BARTHOLOMEW" (calmly) We all know Carson Dyle is dead, Mrs. Lampert. 
ADAM It's Carson Dyle, I tell you! 
"BARTHOLOMEW" You're not going to believe him, Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic. He's trying to trick you again. 
REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do. 
ADAM Tex recognized him -- that's why he said Dyle. If you give him those stamps, he'll kill you too! 
REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM. 
"BARTHOLOMEW" Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said, what's preventing me from killing you right now? 
REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW." 
ADAM Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps -- he knows he'd never make it. 
"BARTHOLOMEW" What's the matter with you, Mrs. Lampert? Are you going to believe every lie he tells you? He wants the money for himself -- that's all he's ever wanted. 
REGGIE (to ADAM, explaining) He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy. 
ADAM Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle! 
"BARTHOLOMEW" That's right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm a dead man -- look at me. 
REGGIE I don't know who anybody is any more! 
ADAM Reggie -- listen to me! 
REGGIE You lied to me so many times -- 
ADAM (gently) Reggie -- trust me once more -- please. 
REGGIE Can I really believe you this time, Adam? 
ADAM (a pause) There's not a reason on earth why you should. 
She looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to "BARTHOLOMEW", then slowly starts toward ADAM. 
REGGIE All right, Adam. 
"BARTHOLOMEW" Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or I'll kill you. 
REGGIE stops in alarm. 
ADAM It won't get you the stamps, Dyle -- You'll have to come out to get them, and I'm not likely to miss at this range. 
"BARTHOLOMEW" (now called CARSON) Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me. They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach -- they knew I was still alive but they left me. I spent ten months in a German camp -- with nothing to stop the pain and no food -- they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for me. They deserved to die! 
MED. SHOT -- ADAM 
During the following, he looks around, looking for some way out. 
REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) But I didn't have anything to do with -- 
CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) You've got the money. It belongs to me now! Please believe me, Mrs. Lampert -- I'll kill you -- a little more blood won't matter. 
During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND CARSON 
CARSON I'll give you five to make up your mind, Mrs. Lampert. 
She has seen ADAM's move from her angle, but doesn't know quite what to do. 
REGGIE Wait, please! I need some time to think! 
CARSON One -- 
MED. SHOT -- ADAM 
As he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his gun ready, trying to get an angle on CARSON. 
CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) -- two -- 
Suddenly ADAM stops -- he has caught sight of CARSON through the columns. But he will have a difficult shot. 
CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) -- three -- 
CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON 
CARSON -- four -- 
CARSON Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ? 
INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT 
REGGIE huddled inside. 
INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT 
ADAM is listening carefully, trying to figure out where CARSON is standing, watching the ceiling. 
CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP 
It is marked C-4. 
CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert 
MED. SHOT -- ADAM 
As he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked C- 4. He is about to pull it. 
INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT 
CARSON takes a few more steps forward. 
INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT 
ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling. 
CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP 
The one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES to the next trap, marked D-4. 
CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert -- 
MED. SHOT -- ADAM 
He looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily. 
Now he slowly reaches for the lever. 
INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT 
CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot. 
CLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX 
As REGGIE slowly peers out. 
REGGIE'S P.O.V. 
The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap from this low angle. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE 
As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap now, runs to it, looking down through it. 
MED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP 
FROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look down at ADAM. 
GRANDPIERRE Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold Gideon, and whoever that is down there. 
ADAM is surprised, then shakes his head. 
ADAM Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He wouldn't dare hit a girl. 
EXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT 
As a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it. 
INT. TAXI -- NIGHT (PROCESS) 
REGGIE and ADAM in the rear of the cab. REGGIE has one of her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it. 
REGGIE You didn't have to chase me so hard -- 
ADAM Here, give it to me. 
He starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers him the other one. 
REGGIE That one's done -- start on this one. 
He takes the foot and begins rubbing it. 
REGGIE I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are? 
ADAM And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide. 
REGGIE The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps? 
ADAM What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that? 
REGGIE All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps. 
ADAM says nothing. 
REGGIE I said, tell me to go to the -- 
ADAM I heard you, I heard you. 
REGGIE Then say it. 
ADAM Reggie -- listen to me -- 
REGGIE Never mind -- I'll go by myself. 
ADAM What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -- 
EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- MAIN ENTRANCE -- DAY 
As REGGIE and ADAM approach the MARINE in full-dress uniform always on guard at the Embassy. 
REGGIE (to ADAM) Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay taxes.  Excuse me, soldier -- 
MARINE Marine, ma'am.

SHOOTING SCRIPT NOVEMBER 2013 
"I now predict that I was wrong." STEPHEN HAWKING 
RUN OPENING TITLES OVER: 
INT. EMPIRE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY (LATE 1980'S) 
TWO BESPECTACLED EYES. Blinking. Alert. Male. Middle-aged. Reflected in his shiny GLASSES - a WOMAN, middle-aged, (JANE HAWKING) removing the glasses from his nose. 
CUT TO: 
The MAN's POV, as - 
- his vision goes from FOCUSED to BLURRY as the GLASSES are removed. 
- his BLURRY POV of the WOMAN's hands POLISHING his glasses with a cloth. 
- his BLURRY POV then shifts (as she steps aside) onto a SMALL PERSON in the distance jumping up and down. 
- his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his nose, and - 
- with this, his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS, and the SMALL PERSON is revealed to be -- a BOY (10) playing HOPSCOTCH in the RED-CARPETED CORRIDOR. 
- Beyond the BOY, TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin (unceremoniously) to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony. They lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes. One blows his nose. 
TIGHT ON: The eyes behind the glasses watching, his eyes finally looking downward...as we hear a metallic CLICKING sound - "CLICK, CLICK, CLICK..." 
- ANGLE ON: HIS HAND, which is clicking a CLICKER-PLATE... 
- then on a COMPUTER MONITOR (mounted to the CHAIR), words form out of a streaming alphabet with each 'CLICK'. The man is at work, selecting LETTERS, then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU ...making sentences by these means. 
- OTHER PARTIAL VIEWS (ECUs) of this MAN in his WHEELCHAIR. 
We see...a TUFT of BROWN HAIR...his HAND on chair arm-rest ...his FEET on a wheelchair's foot-rests...JANE's HANDS arrange the BROWN HAIR...adjust his THIN ARMS...but never do we see the full man, as - 
- the TWO EQUERRIES open TWO LARGE ORNATE DOORS and motion the PARTY forward. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING      2 
CONTINUED: 
TIGHT ON: the MAN's HAND, pushing a TOGGLE-STICK CONTROLLER, putting the CHAIR in motion, to the sound of a small electric motor. 
END OPENING TITLES - 
TIGHT ON: The WHEELS of the WHEELCHAIR, turning... 
MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMBRIDGE STREETS - DAY (EARLY-MID 1960's) 
...the FRONT WHEEL of STEPHEN's BICYCLE, SPINNING VERY VERY FAST... 
STEPHEN HAWKING (in his early 20s) and his friend, BRIAN (same age), race each other recklessly through the NARROW, WINDING LANES. It looks VERY DANGEROUS. They are neck and neck. And they are loving it. 
STEPHEN HAWKING, his face almost entirely covered with spectacles and floppy hair, slight of frame, a velvet jacket and velvet bow tie, eccentric-looking. STEPHEN is a fun- loving, playful, active, young student. 
BRIAN, STEPHEN's best friend. More interested in life than studies, as we shall see. 
EXT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - DUSK 
STEPHEN and BRIAN arrive at the party, dismount at speed and, running to a walk, crash their BIKES into a HEDGE. BRIAN wins the race, raises arms aloft as - they enter the PARTY. We follow them in...(CONTINUOUS SHOT) 
INT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
...STEPHEN and BRIAN enter, and the CAMERA finally follows them into the main room of the PARTY. 
STEPHEN and BRIAN come to a halt in the doorway as they OBSERVE - 
- a CROWDED ROOM engaged in lively bubbly conversation. In the background suitably elegant music plays. 
BRIAN First to find a drink. 
BRIAN walks off to talk to another GIRL, while - 
- STEPHEN, left alone, decides to slowly approach JANE. JANE has hardly touched her wine. STEPHEN has a beer. 
They look around the room together, and then - 
STEPHEN Hello. 
JANE Hello. 
STEPHEN Science? 
JANE Arts. 
More silence. They look elsewhere. 
JANE (CONT'D) So what do you-? 
STEPHEN Cosmologist. I'm a cosmologist. 
JANE What's a cosmologist? 
STEPHEN It's a kind of religion--for intelligent atheists. (SUSPICIOUSLY) You're not religious, are you? 
JANE C of E. Church of England. 
STEPHEN (SIMULTANEOUSLY) - England. (SMILES CHEEKILY) I suppose someone has to be. 
JANE is not sure whether to take offence. 
JANE So--what do cosmologists worship then? 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING       6 
CONTINUED: (4) 
STEPHEN (GRINS) A single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe. 
JANE (AMUSED) Really? So what's the equation? 
STEPHEN smiles. 
STEPHEN That is the question. 
CUT TO: 
The NEEDLE on the RECORD PLAYER now drops onto a ROLLING STONES record - "TIME IS ON OUR SIDE" 
Few people remain at the party now. The tables are empty - the food is gone. The punch bowl is drained dry. 
DIANA is still talking to DAVID, laughing. 
ANGLE ON: JANE, now listening intently to STEPHEN. 
JANE Why didn't you stay at Oxford? 
STEPHEN My finals papers were such a shambles the examiners called me in for a 'Viva' and I told them - 
JANE What's a viva? 
STEPHEN A mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy. An interrogation. So I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford, but if they gave me the 1st I needed to get into Cambridge, then they'd never have to see me again. 
JANE They gave you the 1st. 
STEPHEN They gave me the 1st. 
JANE laughs. STEPHEN grins - it's a GREAT GRIN, as - 
- DIANA approaches. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   7 
CONTINUED: (5) 
DIANA This party is officially deceased! Come on--I've fixed you up a ride home. 
DAVID and DAVID's HANDSOME FRIEND wait by the door. JANE barely has time to speak before she is dragged away by DIANA. 
JANE Well, I hope you find your equation. 
The PhD STUDENTS are gathered, minus STEPHEN as SCIAMA hands back the classes answers. 
SCIAMA (PASSING PAPER) John, this so illegible I'm not quite sure how wrong it is--I suspect very--and Brian... (TOSSING PAPERS) ...that's just--baffling. 
STEPHEN arrives late - 
SCIAMA (CONT'D) Stephen, glad you could join us. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   10 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN Sorry. 
STEPHEN sets TWO TRAIN TIMETABLES on the table. Others push the TIME-TABLES down the desk to SCIAMA, who picks them up. 
SCIAMA Train timetables? Stephen, these are totally unacceptable--they expired a month ago. 
Laughter. 
STEPHEN Sorry. It's on the back. Had a little accident. 
SCIAMA turns them over and looks at them. 
TIGHT ON: the TIMETABLES, then are filled with tiny formulas and calculations. 
SCIAMA registers growing amazement, then looks up at STEPHEN - 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) I could only do nine. 
End on SCIAMA and fellow students reaction - startled, speechless, everyone staring at STEPHEN. 
SCIAMA Well...I see...well thank God. Well done Stephen. 
BRIAN (SILENTLY MOUTHS) Nine? 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
OARS powerfully cut the WATER as a TWO-BOAT PRACTICE RACE unfolds. The TWO CREWS are from the same CLUB. 
PAN DOWN one BOAT: EIGHT LARGE POWERFUL ROWERS, culminating in PETE, DAN, RAFF, BRIAN and finally the thin, boyish, STEPHEN, in the role of COX, facing the rowers, calling out the stroke-rate using a coxswain's loud-hailer. 
STEPHEN Full, give me twenty - One, drive! - Two, drive! - Three, big legs! - Four, press! - Five, boom! - Hook, send! - Catch, big send! - Hold at 32! - Big legs, Brian! - Big legs! (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   11 
CONTINUED: STEPHEN (CONT'D) - Stay long, Brian! - Stay long Brian!!!... 
BRIAN (exhausted, speaks one word on each stroke) You! - complete! - and! - utter! bastard! 
INT. PUB ON RIVER - DAY 
Rowdy tables of graduates and undergraduates and rowers, males and females. Beer flows. 
Playing PINBALL are BRIAN, REES, ELLIS and CARTER. STEPHEN watches, drinking a beer, distracted. 
CARTER No, no, listen, listen, pay attention. A man enters a lift, wanting to go to the fiftieth floor but only gets as far as the 46th. Why? 
BRIAN (EXHAUSTED) Erm - there was a naked girl in the lift. 
Collective groan. BRIAN is clipped around the ears. 
BRIAN (CONT'D) Hey--it's the closest I'll get to a unifying theory, leave me alone. 
ALL then silently ponder the RIDDLE. BRIAN, deep in thought himself, finally notices STEPHEN, bursting to provide the answer. BRIAN acts to SILENCE STEPHEN - 
BRIAN (CONT'D) (raising a finger) Uh!!! 
ELLIS No--we give up. No idea. 
STEPHEN He was too short to reach the button for the fiftieth floor. 
STEPHEN rises, triumphant, as the others groan. 
BRIAN Okay, I've got one. Okay, okay-- A naked girl enters a lift - 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   12 
CONTINUED: 
SCIAMA Come with me. 
INT. CAVENDISH LAB, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY 
SCIAMA shows STEPHEN the famous lab. 
SCIAMA This lab is where JJ Thomson discovered the electron, where Rutherford split the atom. One of the great rewards of this job is that you never know from where the next great leap forward is going to come, or from whom. 
SCIAMA takes out a pen and writes on a pad, tears it off and gives it to STEPHEN. 
SCIAMA (CONT'D) Next Friday. I'm taking a few graduates of merit to London, to attend a talk by the mathematician Roger Penrose. Come along if you're interested. (EXITING) Oh, and close the door as you leave. 
SCIAMA exits. STEPHEN looks around at the empty LAB. He goes to the BLACKBOARD, picks up a piece of CHALK, looks at the BLANK BOARD, but then puts the CHALK back down and then begins to study, with RAPT AWE, the ancient LABORATORY EQUIPMENT. 
EXT. ANGLICAN CHURCH STEPS - DAY 
STEPHEN is now sitting on a STONE WALL, waiting as - 
- the WILDES emerge, in the SUNDAY FINERY. JANE peels off from her family to talk to STEPHEN. She is pleased to see him. 
JANE So I gather you've never been to church? 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   15 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN Once upon a time. 
He smiles wryly at this Fairy Tale reference. 
JANE Tempted to convert? 
He thinks about this. 
STEPHEN I have a problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise. What are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast. 
INT. DINING ROOM, HAWKING FAMILY HOME - DAY 
Sunday family lunch. A noisy, eccentric, bohemian atmosphere. STEPHEN's father, FRANK opens his HOME-MADE WINE. His sister PHILIPPA (17) passes the plates. MARY (20) reads a BOOK. 
FRANK HAWKING And Jane? What are you studying? 
JANE Arts. Languages, poetry. I'm thinking of doing a PhD eventually. 
FRANK HAWKING Oh? What in? 
The HAWKINGS, impressed, nod approvingly at STEPHEN. 
JANE (ENCOURAGED) Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula. 
PHILIPPA snorts back laughter, whilst the other HAWKINGS stare blankly at JANE for a moment, before silently returning to setting the table. FRANK rescues the mood - 
FRANK HAWKING Arts. So, what painters do you like? 
JANE Well, I like--Turner... 
FRANK HAWKING Really? Turner? To me they all look as if they've been left out in the rain. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   16 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN laughs. JANE shoots him a surprised look, as FRANK pours a glass of wine. 
JANE And...William Blake. 
PHILLIPA Good heavens. Surely not! 
FRANK HAWKING (TO JANE) Will you try my elderflower wine? 
JANE Yes, please. 
STEPHEN (TO JANE) Don't touch it, don't touch it Jane. 
Enter ISOBEL, STEPHEN's mother, with a ROAST CHICKEN. 
As FRANK passes wine, JANE looks nervously at STEPHEN, who smiles at her. FRANK picks up the CARVING KNIFE and starts to SHARPEN it. 
FRANK HAWKING Stephen doesn't like my homemade wine. Philistine. (TO STEPHEN) If you don't watch out I'll send you back with a couple of bottles. 
STEPHEN Oh, no, no. Happy to observe the phenomenon--but I can't possibly imagine participating. 
JANE I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance? 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   19 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN No, I'm quite serious. I don't dance. 
JANE has a wistful look of disappointment. AWKWARD SILENCE. 
Just then - A BLUE UV LIGHT comes on. This causes great excitement on the dance-floor. All the other couples "ooh" and "ahh" and even more people take to the floor - not so, STEPHEN and JANE. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Do you see how the men's cuffs and shirt-fronts, how they glow more than the dresses? 
JANE (smiles, expectant) Yes... 
STEPHEN Do you know why? 
JANE Why? 
STEPHEN "TIDE." 
JANE The washing powder? 
STEPHEN The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light. 
JANE Why do you know that? 
STEPHEN (GRINS) When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light, almost all the stars would disappear--and all we'd see would be these spectacular births and deaths. And I reckon-- it would look a little - 
JANE stares at the glowing swirling people with STEPHEN's eyes. 
JANE - like that. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   20 
CONTINUED: (2) 
They watch, impressed, as - FIREWORKS are suddenly heard, EXPLODING LOUDLY. 
EXT. TERRACE/LAWNS/RIVERBANK - G&C COLLEGE - NIGHT (1963) 
MONTAGE: 
A) A FIRE-WORK DISPLAY - STEPHEN and JANE watch as SKY- ROCKETS light up the sky. 
B) A CAROUSEL - JANE and STEPHEN ride the CAROUSEL. STEPHEN watches JANE, captivated by her happiness in this moment. 
C) A CHAMPAGNE TENT - JANE selects a FLUTE OF CHAMPAGNE and takes a BIG SIP, to the sound of a NEARBY 1920's CHICAGO JAZZ SWING band. The GATSBY-THEMED BAR-STAFF are dressed in 1920's TUXEDOS and FLAPPER-DRESSES. 
STEPHEN So why... (PASSING CHAMPAGNE) ...why... 
JANE Why? 
STEPHEN Why medieval Spanish poetry? 
JANE surveys the gay party, sipping her champagne - 
JANE (HAPPILY) I suppose I like to time travel. 
STEPHEN And what particular time periods do you visit? 
JANE takes the CHAMPAGNE STEPHEN has just chosen and pours half of his into her glass. 
JANE The Twenties is always fun. 
STEPHEN The roaring twenties! Cheers! 
They CLINK GLASSES and sip their champagne, laughing. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) So--The 1920's. A good time for poetry was it? 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   21 
CONTINUED: 
JANE "Seek then/ No learning/ from Starry Men!/ Who follow with Optic Glass/ The Whirling Ways of Stars that Pass." 
ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) The star, in fact, gets denser as atoms--even subatomic particles-- get literally crushed, smashed into smaller and smaller space. And at its end point what are we left with? 
He draws a point. 
ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) A point. A spacetime singularity... 
STEPHEN is captivated. 
ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) With extraordinary properties! Infinite density. Space and time come to a stop. All of the known laws of science--they just stop working. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   24 
CONTINUED: (2) ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) What I've just shown is that this happens in every black hole. Its really happening, out there. To real stars--and its happening right now! 
STEPHEN smiles - seeing his future revealed. 
INT. MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT 
SCIAMA and his students, returning home. 
As his friends talk excitedly, STEPHEN is silently staring down at the CIRCULATING COFFEE in front of him, into which he pours CREAM... 
SLOWLY, CLOCKWISE - the cream is spread outward by the circulating coffee until it looks like a SPIRAL GALAXY. 
As he stares, deep in thought, the SPIRAL of CREAM pulses with LIGHT - he is having an epiphany here - a major insight... 
...and then TIME GOES INTO REVERSE. As it does so, the CREAM CHANGES DIRECTION, goes ANTI-CLOCKWISE now, the SPIRAL once more returning to its original central dollop, and then vanishing. The coffee creamless. STEPHEN looks up... 
STEPHEN (TO SCIAMA) I wonder what would happen--if--I wonder what would happen-- 
Sensing his protege is on to something, perhaps even a small smile. 
SCIAMA Go on. If? 
STEPHEN If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe? 
SCIAMA stares at him. 
EXT. RIVERBANK, CAMBRIDGE - SUNSET 
STEPHEN excitedly expands on his new idea to a DELIGHTED, SMILING JANE as they WALK side by side. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   25 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? - 
JANE - Alright - 
STEPHEN - which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock... 
JANE grabs his hands and begins to SWIRL him around. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
JANE Winding back the clock! 
STEPHEN (LAUGHING) Is that what you're doing? 
JANE That's what I'm doing. 
STEPHEN Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding... 
They SPIN faster and faster until they almost trip and only save themselves by clasping each other closely... 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) (SUDDENLY SERIOUS) ...until you get - 
INT. SCIAMA'S OFFICE/DAMTP, CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
STEPHEN at the blackboard makes a DOT on the blackboard. 
SCIAMA A singularity. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   26 
CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time. 
REACTION: STEPHEN, devastated. Frozen. People walk past him and he doesn't move, doesn't react. 
INT. BATHROOM, TRINITY HALL - DAY 
WATER drips in SLOW MO from an old TAP. 
STEPHEN lies in a bath, in a TRANCE, knees drawn up, hair wet, not moving, in a STATE OF SHOCK, as he stares at the DRIPPING TAP, until - 
- his eyes are drawn to his ARM where he sees a weird PHENOMENON - it's called FASCICULATION - a visible throbbing that travels underneath the skin. 
INT. COLLEGE STAIR-WELL - DAY 
BRIAN rushes up the SPIRAL STAIRS, past the "BEDDER" - a woman who looks after the STUDENTS domestic needs. 
BRIAN (TO BEDDER) Is he up yet? THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   29 
INT. STEPHEN'S DORM ROOM/CAMBRIDGE UNI   - DAY (EM60'S) 
Suddenly, a pounding on his door, and then BRIAN enters STEPHEN's room. 
WAGNER is playing INCREDIBLY LOUDLY on an old TAPE-DECK. BRIAN shuts it off and looks at - 
- STEPHEN, in the corner, in his pyjamas, his MATRESS now on the floor (rather than on the HIGH BUNK as before) legs drawn up, reading a book of CHESS. 
BRIAN "Welcome--to this week's episode of The Natural World, where we explain the extraordinary hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge Physicist--seen here in his wonderful plumage..." 
Silence. BRIAN waits for STEPHEN to speak. 
BRIAN (CONT'D) So? What did they say? Your wrist. What did they say? 
STEPHEN I have a disease, Bri. 
BRIAN (WHISPERS) Is it--venereal, Stephen? 
STEPHEN No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player. 
BRIAN Motor what? Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering work on rare automotive and baseball diseases. Come on, let's go to the pub. 
BRIAN tries to pull STEPHEN to his feet. 
STEPHEN (IMPASSIVELY) I have two years to live. (PAUSE) Sounds strange, doesn't it, when you say it out loud. 
BRIAN What? I--I don't understand. It's not possible! It's ridiculous! (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   30 
CONTINUED: BRIAN (CONT'D) You were fine a couple of days ago. (SILENCE) Steve? You're fine. What did they say...? 
STEPHEN Will you leave me Brian? 
BRIAN I'm sorry, look, I was just being a berk...I'm so... 
The BEDDER knocks and enters. 
BEDDER Stephen! Phone for you! It's a girl. 
BRIAN has no choice. He is badly shaken by the news. 
BRIAN Right. OK. So--see you soon, yeah? 
STEPHEN does his best to smile. Brian exits. 
BEDDER (TO STEPHEN) She's waiting. 
INT. HALLWAY, WILDE FAMILY HOME - DAY 
JANE on phone. 
JANE Stephen? Hi. It's me. (CLICK!) Stephen? 
She holds the DEAD RECEIVER in her hand. 
EXT. TRINITY HALL, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY 
Through the swirl of UNIVERSITY life comes - JANE WILDE. 
INT. HALLWAY/STEPHEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
JANE knocks - gets no answer. 
Silence. STEPHEN waits, as the PANEL turn the pages of his thesis. STEPHEN grows WORRIED. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   38 
CONTINUED: 
SCIAMA (CONT'D) A black hole at the beginning of Time. 
KIP THORNE A spacetime singularity? 
SCIAMA and PENROSE and KIP THORNE look at each other. STEPHEN can't breath for the tension. 
SCIAMA Brilliant. It's brilliant Stephen. So all that remains to be said is...well done. Or should I say, well done Doctor. And extraordinary theory. 
STEPHEN Thankyou. 
STEPHEN sighs with RELIEF, and smiles. 
SCIAMA So, what now? 
STEPHEN Prove it. Prove...with a single equation, that Time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice Professor? One single elegant equation to explain everything? 
SCIAMA Yes. It would. It would indeed. 
INT. LOUNGE, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - EVENING 
CHAMPAGNE is OPENED and POURED. 
A celebrational dinner party, attended by JANE, BRIAN, ELLIS, REES, CARTER and two of their GIRLFRIENDS. JANE rises to give a TOAST. 
JANE TO DOCTOR- 
BRIAN -Who? 
Over laughter - 
JANE To Doctor Stephen Hawking. 
CUT TO: 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING    39 
CONTINUED: 
BRIAN holds forth on a funny story about him and Stephen, as he uncorks a bottle of wine - 
BRIAN What's astonishing is that for Stephen and I, "work" was the worst four-letter word, the worst. (LAUGHTER) Stephen probably averaged, what was it?--an hour a day your entire university career? (LAUGHTER) Unbelievable levels of sloth! 
As the conversation turns into a HUBBUB of chatter, STEPHEN, smiling, drops his FORK. JANE, in conversation now with one of the GIRLFRIENDS, picks up the fork without barely looking at STEPHEN and put it back in front of him. 
STEPHEN watches everybody      talking, eating, drinking, being wonderfully, effortlessly      dextrous. FRUSTRATED, ENVIOUS, and saddened, STEPHEN watches      closely then, before emotion breaks through, rises, grabs his      TWO WALKING STICKS and starts to leave. 
JANE (CONCERNED) Stephen? 
STEPHEN I'm sorry. 
Everyone watches him go with concern. It's a painful sight to see how hard it is for him to walk now. 
When he is gone only a few seconds, the guests stop their chatter when they hear a huge THUMP. Several men are about to rise to his aid when JANE signals for everyone to remain in their place. Everyone understands and settles again. 
INT. HALL, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - EVENING 
STEPHEN tries to pull himself up the stairs by the spokes of the balustrade. It takes him many seconds just to get up the first stairs but we see his determination. 
INT. LOUNGE, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - EVENING 
The DINNER guests are now eating DESSERT, and talking quietly. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   40 
INT. HALL, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - NIGHT 
STEPHEN is only halfway up the STAIRS, using his last heroic energies. Finally, he STOPS, EXHAUSTED. Hearing something, he looks up - 
The TWO YEAR-OLD ROBERT has woken, and stands in his pajamas at the BABY-GATE at the top of the stairs, looking down at his father. 
STEPHEN It's okay Robert. 
For the first time - with his head resting on the step, and with his eyes turning back to look through the balusters at the REFLECTION in a DINING ROOM mirror of the dinner party (his POV: tilted at 90 degrees) TEARS fall out of his eyes. A PRIVATE MOMENT of great despair. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
KIP THORNE What is it? 
SCIAMA Stephen! He's changed everything! 
SCIAMA runs on, informing a mopping JANITOR - 
SCIAMA (CONT'D) (TO JANITOR) Black Holes aren't black! And they explode! (RUNNING OFF) They explode!!... 
REACTION: KIP THORNE, confusion. 
INT. LOBBY, RUTHERFORD LAB - DAY 
STEPHEN is about to present his ideas to the conference. He is SURROUNDED by his PEERS. 
SCIAMA All set? 
STEPHEN nods - nervous. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   43 
CONTINUED: 
SCIAMA (CONT'D) You'll do fine. 
AT A DISTANCE - at a TEA TABLE - excluded, and looking EXHAUSTED after a LONG NIGHT - JANE sits near TWO CLEANERS IN WHITE, and overhears the female gossip about STEPHEN's condition. 
CHAR 1 Look at him. It's awful, in't it? He's falling apart at the seams. 
JANE reacts, says nothing but bites her lips and frowns indignantly, as the CLEANERS walk away. 
JANE then approaches STEPHEN, nervously. But when he looks up at her, his EYES are BLAZING WITH LIGHT and passion - this pulls her out of her SADNESS. 
JANE (LOVINGLY) Good luck! 
He SMILES back at her, as the ENTRY DOORS to the HALL open, and REVEAL a PACKED EXPECTANT ROOM. It's daunting! 
SCIAMA Ready or not. 
SCIAMA PUSHES STEPHEN into the HALL, as - 
- JANE hurries to gather STEPHEN's NOTES, his WATER-BOTTLE, his BLANKET and her HANDBAG, only just slipping through the CLOSING DOORS. 
INT. LECTURE HALL/RUTHERFORD LAB/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
Before his peers, STEPHEN finishes his address. SCIAMA sits with JOHN TAYLOR in the front row. JANE sits toward the BACK. 
STEPHEN (SLURRING SLIGHTLY) ...allowing us to predict that some particles can in fact escape a black hole. Black holes aren't black at all, but glow with heat radiation. 
Stony, sceptical faces greet this outrageous idea. As STEPHEN continues his speech, ANGLE ON SCIAMA and TAYLOR. 
SCIAMA (aside, to TAYLOR) He's unifying Relativity--plus Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics. For the first time. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   44 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN TAYLOR (shakes head, to SCIAMA) Thermodynamics? Last used to describe the steam engine. 
During this exchange (O.S) STEPHEN has been saying: 
STEPHEN In other words--the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass, they evaporate, eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion. So... 
INTERCUT THIS LECTURE SCENE (as necessary) with the FOLLOWING SCENE: 
INT. PUB ON RIVER, CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT 
BRIAN and REES, CARTER and ELLIS discuss STEPHEN's theory. 
BRIAN No,no! What he's saying is--just as a hot body loses heat--right? - 
REES Second law of thermodynamics. 
BRIAN - that a black hole - 
BRIAN dips a finger in the FROTH of REES's BEER and draws a CIRCLE on the TABLETOP. 
REES - thanks - 
BRIAN - that if it is losing particles, then, then over time - 
BRIAN BASTARDS! 
BRIAN lifts STEPHEN out of his chair. He's heavy. 
BRIAN (CONT'D) Jeez!--uhhhh!--how the hell does Jane manage? 
He starts to carry STEPHEN up...up...up... 
STEPHEN Big legs! Big legs Brian! 
BRIAN So, tell me, this Motor Neuron Disease, does it effect, y'know... 
STEPHEN What? 
BRIAN Everything..? 
BRIAN indicates 'down there'. 
STEPHEN Different system. Automatic. 
BRIAN That's kinda wonderful, actually. And it explains a great deal about men. 
BRIAN and STEPHEN then disappears over the top of the STEPS. After a few beats BRIAN reappears and runs down the steps to reclaim the wheelchair. He picks it up and starts up the steps with it. 
CUT TO: 
STEPHEN, cradled in the giant arms of a seated MARBLE STATUE!!! (maybe Queen Victoria) - cradled like a baby, waiting for BRIAN to return. 
INT. UNIVERSITY BOOKSHOP - DAY 
The SHELVES are being restocked. The latest issue of "NATURE" MAGAZINE is set on the stand by a STOCKIST. The COVER reads: 
"HAWKING RADIATION" 
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   48 
EXT. WEST ROAD FLAT, CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
CLOSE ON: STEPHEN. Waiting in his WHEELCHAIR on the front LAWN. About 8 YEARS have passed since we last saw him. His physical deterioration is marked. His body is thinner and powerless. His legs are bent and his face is slightly asymmetric. 
WIDE: Beside him is STACKED a mountain of FAMILY HOLIDAY LUGGAGE (umbrellas, beach balls, plastic cricket set, tent etc.) 
In the Background, the NEW WEST ROAD FLAT - a LARGE VICTORIAN HOUSE. The sign in front reads "GONVILLE and CAIUS COLLEGE". 
On the LAWN the children (ROBERT, now 9 - and LUCY, now 5) PLAY with BEACH TOYS, until - 
- JANE (with a new haircut and fashion befitting the LATE 1970's) yells - 
JANE Get in the car! Get! In! The Car! Come on! Let's go see Gran and Grandad! 
The CHILDREN obey, and jump into the now OLD MINI parked at the kerb, as - 
- JANE confronts the MOUNTAIN OF STUFF, including STEPHEN, that must somehow be stowed. No way. 
LATER - back and forth JANE goes between LUGGAGE and MINI. STEPHEN can only watch her load the stuff into the car and onto the ROOF-RACK. Finally - REVEAL the LOADED MINI - it looks ridiculously burdened! 
JANE takes a deep, exhausted, breath, then turns back for STEPHEN. He sits there in his wheelchair, looking at her... 
ROBERT and JANE together, with GREAT DIFFICULTY, get STEPHEN into the front seat and shut the door. ROBERT struggles to COLLAPSE the WHEELCHAIR, until JANE comes and together they muscle it onto the ROOF-RACK. 
EXT. WELSH COTTAGE - WALES - DAY 
FRANK & ISOBEL HAWKING's tumble-down WELSH COTTAGE high above on a STEEP HILLSIDE, only reached by an ENORMOUS FLIGHT of STEPS. 
REACTION JANE: Exasperation! 
ISOBEL descends to greet them, followed by FRANK. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   49 
CONTINUED: 
ISOBEL Isn't it marvellous? We can rent it every year! 
JANE Yes. I see. But what about all the steps, Frank? 
FRANK HAWKING Oh, it's nothing. The climb is absolutely worth it. You get the luggage. 
FRANK backs STEPHEN (in his wheelchair) up the STEPS, one at a time, while ISOBEL runs up ahead with the CHILDREN, leaving JANE, alone, with ALL THE LUGGAGE. 
STEPHEN (SLURRING) Yes, a magazine subscription. 
SCIAMA Why would you bet against yourself? (PAUSE) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   52 
CONTINUED: SCIAMA (CONT'D) A subscription to what? Nature magazine? 
STEPHEN Pent-house. That way even if I'm wrong, I still win! 
SCIAMA laughs heartily as - 
- STEPHEN grins, at the same time SPYING - up ahead, TWO ATTRACTIVE UNDER-GRADUATE GIRLS about to enter the LIFT. 
STEPHEN hits the GAS! - and SPEEDS toward the LIFT... 
SCIAMA Penthouse? 
STEPHEN SPEEDS toward the LIFT, whose DOORS ARE READY TO CLOSE. 
SCIAMA winces in expectation of a horrible accident. 
WIDE: it looks suicidal but the chair just flies through the GAP in the last split second before the DOORS CLOSE - the doors shaving the wheels, with a small spark. 
INT. LIFT, DAMTP, G&C COLLEGE - DAY 
STEPHEN, in there with the TWO UNDERGRADUATE GIRLS, SMILES at them. 
INT. LIVING ROOM,WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
JANE picks up pieces of a BROKEN POTTED PLANT, dirt spilled over the carpet, then violently VACUUMES as BERYL comes in with a tea-tray. 
BERYL Jane--Jane? Jane? Jane! STOP! 
JANE keeps VACUUMING. BERYL pulls the PLUG on the VACUUM CLEANER. JANE stares at her Mum. 
BERYL (CONT'D) Sit down. Sit. 
BERYL pours TEA for the exhausted JANE. JANE sits. 
BERYL (CONT'D) Now--I'd like to make a suggestion-- it might sound unusual--but I've seen it work wonders. I think--you should consider - (BEAT) - joining the church choir. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   53 
CONTINUED: 
REACTION JANE: Momentarily SPEECHLESS - 
JANE Mum--I think that is possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said. 
BERYL Maybe so. 
JANE I used to love singing. 
BERYL You're very good at it. 
JANE I don't know about that. 
BERYL Go. (pause) It's one hour a week. 
They sip tea in silence. 
INT. CHURCH - EVENING (LATE 70'S-M80'S) 
JANE walks in - and up the AISLE - as we hear CHORAL MUSIC. 
JANE takes a pew, and then her eyes widen slightly as she recognizes the CHOIR MASTER. It's the BEARDED MAN from the supermarket car-park. She studies him, as he gently instructs and then conducts the CHOIR. 
CUT TO: 
After the rehearsal, the CHOIR file past JANE. JONATHAN recognizes her at once. 
JONATHAN Oh, hello. 
JANE Hello. 
JONATHAN Are you here to sing? 
JANE I um--I just came to-- 
JANE Well, that's a long story. 'Night. 
EXT. WEST ROAD FLAT, CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
STEPHEN motors down the street, fast, and swings up the ramp in front of the door. He BANGS into the front door. 
Then waits. He hears PIANO music - a lesson in progress. 
INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
As STEPHEN and JANE watch - JONATHAN gives ROBERT (11) a piano lesson. 
JANE smiles at STEPHEN, who remains cautious. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   57 
INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT 
JONATHAN is eating dinner with JANE and STEPHEN. JANE feeds STEPHEN a forkful of food. STEPHEN chews slowly. 
STEPHEN sneaks glances at JONATHAN. 
JONATHAN shoots a SMILE at JANE. She smiles back in return. STEPHEN catches sight of both these smiles, and sees the GROWING INTIMACY. 
JANE Water. 
She exits. JONATHAN smiles at STEPHEN who is staring back at him. 
JONATHAN (TO STEPHEN) So - Stephen. Er - Jane tells me... 
JONATHAN picks up STEPHEN's fork, spears a cube of steak. 
JONATHAN (CONT'D) ...you have a beautiful theorem that proves that... 
JONATHAN offers up the steak, but STEPHEN's glare makes him aware this isn't welcome. He lowers the fork again. 
JONATHAN (CONT'D) ...that--that the universe had a beginning? 
JANE returns with the a JUG OF WATER and GLASSES on a TRAY. 
STEPHEN (testily, his slurring not easily understood) That was my - PhD thesis. 
JONATHAN looks to JANE for a translation. 
JONATHAN Your...? 
JANE PhD thesis. 
STEPHEN My new project - disproves it. 
JONATHAN Disproves it? Really? (as JANE nods) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   58 
CONTINUED: JONATHAN (CONT'D) You no longer believe in the Creation? 
STEPHEN What one believes - - is irrelevant--in physics. 
JANE                             JONATHAN ...is irrelevant                   ...is irrelevant 
JANE ...in physics. 
JONATHAN looks to JANE, hoping he has not caused offence. 
JONATHAN Oh, is that so? 
JANE (ANNOYANCE SHOWING) Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all. No boundaries, no beginning. No BEGINNING - 
JONATHAN - no God? Really? (TO STEPHEN) Fascinating. Because I'd understood you'd proven the need for a Creator. My mistake. 
STEPHEN No. Mine. 
JONATHAN (UNDERSTANDING THIS) Yours. Your mistake? 
JONATHAN is surprised by this sharp reply. (He also sees that this matter is a CAUSE OF DIVISION between JANE and STEPHEN.) 
JANE Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe. So God must die. 
JONATHAN Why must God die? I don't see. 
STEPHEN doesn't react, so JANE spears a PEA on her FORK, then picks up a SECOND FORK and spears a LARGE BOILED POTATO with the other. 
EXT. GARDEN/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT 
Under a STARRY sky - JONATHAN helps STEPHEN sip his coffee. STEPHEN accepts this now. 
JONATHAN It was leukaemia. Coming up on a year ago. She fought it, I nursed her, but in the end... Music is my salvation. Teaching and playing. I've struggled with loneliness, of course. Tyranny of the empty room, all that. Music is a consolation, although my career... Well, I'm not very ambitious. (SMILES) Is that a sin? 
STEPHEN Wrong guy to ask. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   62 
INT. HALLWAY, WEST ROAD FLAT, CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT 
JONATHAN puts on his JACKET to go - JANE and STEPHEN see him off. 
JANE Thank you for coming. 
JONATHAN No. Thank you. It was wonderful. (starts to go, then stops) And if--if there was anything I can do. To be of service. To you, your family. I have no children, no commitments. If I could help you, I believe I would find a purpose that would alleviate my own situation. It would be a privilege. 
STEPHEN looks to JANE for her reaction. JANE senses EMOTIONAL DANGER and, frightened, merely smiles. 
JONATHAN (CONT'D) Night then. 
He exits. JANE shuts the door. 
INT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT 
JANE puts PILLOWS behind STEPHEN, who now sleeps almost upright in bed. She then takes off her BATHROBE and gets into bed herself. 
STEPHEN I understand you need more help. And if there is - someone - who is prepared to offer it - I won't object, as long - as long as you continue to love me. 
JANE Of course. For infinity. 
Beside him in bed, she kisses his cheek and then lays her head on his frail chest. 
MUSIC UP: BACH PRELUDE, as played by JONATHAN on PIANO, over - 
MONTAGE: 
A)   (MOVED TO: POSITION "G" in MONTAGE) 
A1) The CAM RIVER. A PUNT on a SUNNY DAY drifts under the BRIDGE OF SIGHS - in the front of the PUNT, JANE cradles STEPHEN and ROBERT and LUCY. JANE smiles at - 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   63 
CONTINUED: 
- JONATHAN, who is POLING them. He smiles back at her. 
B) HAWKING FRONT ROOM. JONATHAN plays the BACH PRELUDE divinely on JANE's PIANO, as - JANE, BESIDE HIM on the piano stool, turns the pages. STEPHEN watches without jealousy and with enjoyment. 
C) HAWKING BATHROOM. JONATHAN takes STEPHEN to the TOILET. 
D) When JONATHAN and JANE pass each other in the KITCHEN, and JONATHAN quite naturally takes her hand. JANE, surprised, looks at him. He SMILES at her. Their FIRST TOUCH! 
We can see that the temptation to act further on their feelings is now HUGE for both of them, but they do nothing. JANE forces herself to break away, hurries into the next room to be with STEPHEN, the kids and a train set. JONATHAN is left to deal with his feelings. He sighs, sublimates them, then returns to his domestics. 
E) BRANCASTER BEACH. SUPER-8 FOOTAGE of their day at the beach... 
STEPHEN's wheelchair sits on the sand at the water's edge, his trousers rolled up, water lapping his naked feet. STEPHEN helplessly watches from his wheelchair as JONATHAN engages in some playful rough and tumble with ROBERT and LUCY, kicking a FOOTBALL back and forth. JANE watches on. 
JONATHAN cradles STEPHEN as they sit there and look out to sea, both men carefree and happy, STEPHEN accepting of JONATHAN's care now. They appear as FRIENDS now. 
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
The CHOIR sings a beautiful CAROL. The CAMERA finds JANE - singing nervously - the only SINGER NOT LOOKING at JONATHAN - her eyes are glued on her hymn sheet. In DENIAL. 
CUT TO: 
After the Rehearsal, the CHOIR leaves. JANE and JONATHAN clear up the hymn sheets. She passes her pile to him. He puts his hand on hers. She withdraws her hand. 
JANE I have to tell you something. 
JONATHAN Is anything the matter? 
She looks at him for the first time that evening - 
JANE I'm um--I'm pregnant.

EXT. PHONEBOX - GERMAN CAMPSITE -   MORNING 
JANE stands in a phonebox, then slams down the PHONE and rushes back to the CAMPSITE in panic. 
EXT. AUTOBAHN - NIGHT 
The VOLVO drives through the night. Takes an exit marked "GENEVA". 
INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT/GENEVA HOSPITAL - DAY 
STEPHEN lies quiet and still, his eyes closed. JANE looks down on him. She has GUILTY tears in her eyes. 
The SWISS DOCTOR enters, speaks with JANE...Tout en Francais...with ENGLISH SUBTLTLES. 
SWISS DOCTOR (IN FRENCH) He has pneumonia. He is on a life- support machine. I am not certain how long he will live. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   71 
CONTINUED: SWISS DOCTOR (CONT'D) I need to know whether my staff should disconnect the ventilator? 
JANE switches to ENGLISH - 
JANE (IN ENGLISH) What are you talking about? 
SWISS DOCTOR (IN ENGLISH) If we try to bring him round from the anaesthetic it is not sure he will survive resuscitation. 
JANE Stephen must live! You have to bring him round from the anaesthetic! 
SWISS DOCTOR Are you sure this is what you want? The only way of weaning him off the ventilator would be to give him a tracheotomy, a hole in the neck, by-passing the throat. He will never speak again. 
JANE stares at him - deeply upset but finally manages to SAY - 
JANE There's no question. Stephen must live. I will see he gets everything he needs. I will have him transferred back to Cambridge. 
SWISS DOCTOR He may not survive the journey. 
JANE looks pale and weaker than we have ever seen her. 
EXT. AIRPORT, GENEVA - DAY 
On the tarmac, the two HAWKING children are led toward a BA FLIGHT (in the far distance) by an AIR-HOSTESS. 
Meanwhile, A small AIR-RESCUE PLANE nearby awaits JANE and STEPHEN. STEPHEN is just then being loaded on board. 
JANE turns and faces JONATHAN. A private moment. Her LOOK OF SADNESS speaks volumes. He NODS - he KNOWS. 
JONATHAN I'll step back. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   72 
CONTINUED: 
She NODS, SADLY. Her eyes start to well up. His too. It's a break-up. Turning to look back to the plane... 
JANE Drive--safely, yes? Did you get everything in the car? His chair, equipment... 
JONATHAN nods. 
She KISSES   him on the cheek and he presses his cheek against hers. They   both hold onto each other for a moment, knowing it's their   final embrace, and then she hurries, tearfully, toward the   WAITING PLANE, leaving him standing there. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/SURGICAL THEATRE/ADDENBROOKES - DAY 
JANE, is gowned for theatre. With an ENGLISH DOCTOR she watches the OP through a window. 
ENGLISH DOCTOR It'll take a miracle. 
ANGLE ON: JANE's POV - of the surgeon picking up a MARKER- PEN... 
INT. SURGICAL THEATRE/ADDENBROOKES HOSP. - DAY 
...A SURGEON prepares to perform a TRACHEOTOMY on STEPHEN - marking the spot on his neck with the MARKER PEN, and then picks up the SCALPEL...about to make the INCISION... 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/ADDENBROOKES - DAY 
REACTION JANE: as - she WINCES, then GASPS in horror. 
INT. RECOVERY ROOM - ADDENBROOKES HOSPITAL - DAY 
ELAINE (CONT'D) A tea beginning with B? Builder's tea! Right? 
He GRINS. She SMILES. She goes to get him some TEA. 
INT. HALLWAY/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
ELAINE, smiling, enters hall (from the LIVING ROOM) and bumps into JANE, who has just arrived home with GROCERIES. They stop in front of each other. 
ELAINE (CHUCKLING) I think he's the most brilliant man I've ever met. You're very lucky. 
JANE Thank you. 
ELAINE You must worship the ground beneath HIS - 
JANE - wheels. 
JANE can't fail to see how enthralled ELAINE is. 
ELAINE And he's the perfect patient. Looking after him is so much easier than other patients I've had. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING    76 
CONTINUED: ELAINE (CONT'D) And sooo funny, oh my God. When you read about him people don't tell YOU - 
JANE (cutting her off) You only do two shifts a week, Elaine. 
INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
STEPHEN sits in the armchair, propped up by cushions, while a TECHNICIAN bolts the NEW COMPUTER SCREEN onto STEPHEN's WHEELCHAIR. JANE watches. 
TECHNICIAN Almost there! 
JANE How does it work? 
TECHNICIAN A guy called Walt Woltosz invented the software. Uses a very simple interface that scans through the alphabet and allows each letter to be selected one by one. Using this technique, the Professor can expect to write at about four words per minute. 
ELAINE enters - 
JANE (After initial dismay) Better than one a minute. 
TECHNICIAN What I've done is--use components from a telephone answering system actually-- to convert the written text into synthesized speech. The voice sounds a bit robotic, but... (IT'S READY) Okay. Shall we give it a try? 
CUT TO: 
JANE and ELAINE hoist STEPHEN into the new chair. 
TECHNICIAN (CONT'D) There we go. (GRANDLY) Welcome to the future! 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   77 
CONTINUED: 
The TECHNICIAN sets a pressure-sensitive 'clicker' in STEPHEN's hand. The SCREEN suddenly floods with COMPUTER CODE. REFLECTED in the glass is the WIDE-EYED FACE OF STEPHEN. 
JANE and ELAINE sit on the couch together watching - 
The TECHNICIAN demonstrates - builds a sentence for STEPHEN, selecting one LETTER at a time. STEPHEN is all concentration, observing how it is done. 
TECHNICIAN (CONT'D) All set. Then you just click 'PLAY', like this - 
STEPHEN looks back at the screen, then CLICKS ONCE. The COMPUTER comes to life and says STEPHEN's first words in months. 
STEPHEN (electronic voice, strong American accent) My--name--is--Stee--ven--Hawking. 
STEPHEN stares at JANE - incredulous. JANE stares back at STEPHEN - horrified. 
JANE It's American! Oh, my Goodness. (TO TECHNICIAN) Are there any other voices? 
TECHNICIAN That's all they have at the moment. Is that a problem? 
ELAINE I think it's great! 
STEPHEN looks bewildered. 
INT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT 
In a quiet moment, STEPHEN sits alone, trying out the new device. His face shows SADNESS, BLEAKNESS. His eyes move back to the COMPUTER SCREEN. His fingers CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the monitor. And finally we hear - his sadly moving homage (to "2001: A Space Odyssey"). 
STEPHEN Daisy. Daisy. (BEAT) Give Me Your Answer Do. 
TWO MOVERS pack STEPHEN's PRIZES and MEDALS, lifting them from the SIDEBOARD, as - JANE watches, hiding her emotions. 
EXT. BOOKSHOP - DAY 
The window is dominated by a single display for STEPHEN's book - A Brief History Of Time. 
INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
CLOSE ON: The SUNDAY TIMES NEWSPAPER. The BEST-SELLER LIST. ECU on: A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, at NUMBER 1. Weeks: 8 
WIDE. JANE and her MOTHER, BERYL, at the dining table, the PAPER spread out before them. 
BERYL Remarkable. How is he? 
JANE He wants to marry her. 
BERYL Don't blame yourself. We're proud of you. 
JANE is touched. 
JANE I'm trying hard not to think of this as a failure. 
BERYL But it wasn't a failure. 
JANE But it feels like it! It feels like it, Mum. (BEAT) Was it inevitable? 
BERYL doesn't know what to say. Yes it was. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   85 
CONTINUED: 
BERYL Perhaps too many people were drawn in? (SILENCE) What will Stephen do next? 
JANE (SHRUGS) He's gone back to looking for his Theory Of Everything, his single equation. Well, it'll have to explain human relationships too. 
BERYL ponders this: 
JANE (CONT'D) It's going to have to be a wonderful piece of mathematics. (PONDERS) All the accidents... 
BERYL All the unexpected forces... attractions... 
JANE looks at her mother quickly - "attractions"? 
BERYL (CONT'D) (wistful, dreamy) A attracts B -- 
JANE And vice versa. 
BERYL Of course. 
JANE Then add Time - Adversity - 
BERYL Yes. Adversity over time -- 
JANE - until the situation becomes unstable, heats up. 
BERYL Bang! 
JANE And the whole thing starts over. Whole new galaxies. 
BERYL gently grabs JANE's wrist - 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   86

BERYL Darling, I think we've cracked it. Shall we phone the Nobel committee now or shall we have another cup of tea first? 
JANE, wipes her eyes, smiles sadly. 
EXT. CHURCH - DAY 
The CHURCH in winter - a dusting of snow on everything. To the sound of ORGAN, SINGING CHOIR and CONGREGATION, the front doors open, and the VICAR appears to shake the hands of the first departing church-goers. 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
The SERVICE is over. The congregation departs, revealing - 
- JANE in her seat, still reading a prayer book, as - 
STEPHEN I now predict -- that I was wrong. 
LAUGHTER. 
GUEST 4 Is Time Travel possible? 
LAUGHTER. 
STEPHEN I have experimental evidence that Time Travel is not possible. I gave a party for Time-Travellers but no- one came. 
LAUGHTER. As GUEST 5 rises and starts to speak, the volume goes down on this question... 
GUEST 5 Professor Hawking, you have said you don't believe in God... 
CLOSE ON STEPHEN, slipping into a reverie as - he notices the CAP of a YOUNG LADY's PEN falls off the front lecture bench and drops to the floor...(in SLO MO). STEPHEN stares at the fallen CAP. 
ANGLE ON: GUEST 5, MUTED, his mouth still moving... 
ANGLE ON STEPHEN gets an idea. He wants to go and pick up that fallen CAP...Miraculously, the muscles in his slackened face start to stir...slowly his distorted expression straightens...his slumped head stirs and moves...his fingers stir...his feet ...his legs...he slowly, slowly straightens in his wheelchair, and not only this...he even begins to rise painfully out of it, at last standing on his own... Standing, he crosses the floor, picks up the fallen CAP, and holds it out the pretty YOUNG LADY. She smiles at him, not at all astonished! 
CUT TO: 
GUEST 5 - we can hear him now.

GUEST 5 (CONT'D) You have said you do not believe in God. Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you? 
ANGLE ON: STEPHEN - back in his chair, as at the start of the scene, heart-breakingly unable to do what he wishes. 
STEPHEN It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies... 
ANGLE ON: The CAP on the floor, just where it had fallen. 
ANGLE ON: STEPHEN, in his chair - then on MEMBERS of the AUDIENCE, being greatly stirred by the following words - 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) ...but--ever since the dawn of civilisation, people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe - and what can be more special than that there is no boundary? And there should be no boundary to human endeavour. We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run of the mill human being--but we share the same human spirit. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope. 
APPLAUSE, STANDING OVATION. 
ANGLE ON: ELAINE, clapping - proud. 
ANGLE ON: STEPHEN, in his chair, on the stage, sees ELAINE. Smiles.

INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
JANE is studying again, going through her IBERIAN POEMS, when JONATHAN walks in with the MAIL, and sets one LETTER in front of her. JANE opens it. 
JANE It's from Stephen. (READING) He's--he has invited--the children and I--to accompany him. 
JONATHAN reads her card, and then look at her, surprised. 
JONATHAN Gosh. 
EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE, LONDON - DAY 
The PALACE. 
INT. EMPIRE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY 
We are BACK in the FIRST SCENE OF THE MOVIE. 
JANE moves close to STEPHEN. They look at each other in the eyes for the first time in a long while. They finally SMILE tenderly, and then - 
JANE Your glasses are always dirty. 
STEPHEN'S POV as - his glasses are removed from his nose by JANE, cleaned, and then replaced on his nose. He is moved by this old ritual. 
The HAWKINGS then sit silently, but happily, surrounded by exquisite paintings and furniture. 
INT. GRAND HALLWAY/BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY - LATER 
STEPHEN and family - JANE, ROBERT (23), LUCY (19) and TIM (10) - roll up past pillars toward a SET OF ORNATE DOORS which open magically to reveal -

[Scene: A highway. There's a huge traffic jam. Peter drives forward a bit at a time and he sees an old man with a walker on the sidewalk. The lane next to his is moving, so he switches lanes, only to have it stop and the lane he was on move. He switches back and then it happens again. The old man is now ahead of him.] 
Cut to Michael, who's rapping along with the radio. A black guy selling papers walks by and he shuts the windows and turns down the volume. He passes and he turns it back up again.

(repeats that over and over) 
Bill comes up to Peter. 
BILL Hello, Peter. What's happening? Uh we have sort of a problem here. Yeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your TPS reports. 
PETER Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I, I forgot. 
BILL MMMM..YEAH. YOU SEE, WE'RE PUTTING THE COVERSHEETS ON ALL TPS REPORTS NOW BEFORE THEY GO OUT. DID YOU SEE THE MEMO ABOUT THIS? 
PETER Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just forgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no problem. 
BILL Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that will be great. And Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo Mmmm, Ok? 
He walks away. Peter's phone rings and he answers it. 
PETER Peter Gibbons. (listens) Yes. (listens) I have the memo. 
[Scene Another part of the room. Paper jams in the printer.] 
SAMIR Oh no! Not again! Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam?!! I, I swear to God, one of these days, I, I, I just kick this piece of shit out the window!!!

MICHAEL That's me. 
NINA Wow! Is that your real name? 
MICHAEL Yeah. 
NINA So are you related to the singer guy? 
MICHAEL No, it's just a coincidence. 
SAMIR How come no one in this country can pronounce my name right? It's Na- gee-een-ah-jah. Nagaenajar 
MICHAEL At least your name isn't Michael Bolton. 
SAMIR Michael, there's nothing wrong with that name. 
LAWRENCE NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? 
PETER Besides two chicks at the same time? 
LAWRENCE Oh yeah. 
PETER Nothing. 
LAWRENCE Nothing, huh? 
PETER I would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing. 
LAWRENCE You don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my cousin. He's broke and don't do shit. 
[Scene Peter's room. He's in bed and he keeps hearing voices.] 
NINA Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. 
Peter buries his head in his pillow. 
[Scene The staff meeting. Peter's watch reads Friday 12, 10:37. Everyone's standing outside their cubicles. There's a banner that says "Is This Good for the COMPANY?"] 
BILL So you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points to the banner) Is this good for the company? Am I helping the best way that I can for the company... 
PETER Is that the guy? 
TOM Yeah... 
BILL Good. Well, uh, I'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team. Uh, Bob Slydell. Yeah. Uh, he is, uh, a consultant. Yeah. He is a consultant. (Tom shakes his head) He'll be helping us out a little here, asking some questions, making sure things go a little more smoothly. Yeah. Oh and remember, next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day! So, y'know, if you want to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans. 
[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner. He's on the phone with Peter.] 
MILTON I, I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told Bill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting. I'm going to quit. And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk four times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels and they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. (he's holding his red Swingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston and I kept the staples from the Swingline stapler. 
PETER Ok, Milton. 
MILTON And if, if they take my stapler, I will, I will set this building on fire. 
PETER Oh, that's great. I will talk to you later. 
He hangs up and looks at his watch 
4:45. Peter looks around and sees Bill. He ducks and peeks to see Bill talking with some workers. He quickly tries to save his files, but the computer is slower than he'd like. Bill is talking to other guys. 
BILL Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lum - 
Next message 
BILL Yeah, it's - 
Next message 
BILL Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh - 
Next message 
BILL Yeah, it's me again. Uh, I was away from my desk for a minute. Just checking in case you called while I was gone. 
The phone rings. Peter answers it. 
PETER Hello? 
ANNE Peter, what's going on?! 
PETER Huh? 
ANNE It's 3:30. Why aren't you at work?! 
PETER Because I didn't feel like it. 
ANNE Peter, what is wrong with you?! First, you sit there while Dr. Swanson dies and you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my friends. Don't blame this on hypnosis either. That's total bull! 
Peter hangs up but Anne calls back. 
ANNE ANSWERING MACHINE) LISTEN, ASSHOLE. NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME. WE'RE THROUGH!!! AND HA- ONE MORE THING. I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON YOU!!!! (BEEP 
Peter gets back into bed. 
[Scene Initech. Another staff meeting.] 
BILL From now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job codes and you need the extra columns to fit it all in. Otherwise, use the old time sheets... 
TOM Where's Peter? How come he didn't show up this weekend? 
MICHAEL I, I don't know. 
BILL ...it would really, really help us out. 
TOM Well, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax. 
BOB SLYDELL Ah. 
BOB PORTER Then you must physically bring them to the software people. 
TOM Well...no. Yeah, I mean, sometimes. 
BOB SLYDELL Well, what would you say you do here? 
TOM Well, look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to!! I have people skills!! I am good at dealing with people!!! Can't you understand that?!? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!!!!!!! 
CUT TO THE CUBICLES. TOM EXITS THE INTERVIEW ROOM AND MICHAEL ENTERS. 
Cut to inside. 
BOB SLYDELL Let's see. You're Michael...Bolton? 
He nods. 
BOB PORTER Is that your real name? 
MICHAEL Yeah. 
BOB PORTER Are you in any relation to the pop singer? 
MICHAEL It's just a coincidence. 
BOB SLYDELL LAUGHS) TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOVE HIS MUSIC. I DO . I AM A MICHAEL BOLTON FAN. FOR MY MONEY, I DON'T THINK IT GETS ANY BETTER THAN WHEN HE SINGS WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN. 
BOB PORTER I mean you must really love his music. 
MICHAEL Yeah. Yeahhe, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good, I guess. 
BOB SLYDELL You're GOD DAMN right he is. 
They laugh. 
BOB PORTER So tell me. What's your favorite song of his? 
MICHAEL Hmm. I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all. 
The Bobs laugh. 
PETER Ok. 
JOANNA So, where do you work, uh, Peter? 
PETER Initech. 
JOANNA And, uh, what do you do there, Peter? 
PETER I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch. 
JOANNA NODS) WHAT'S THAT? 
PETER You see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put 98 instead of 1998. So I go through these thousands of lines of code and uh, it doesn't really matter. I, uh, I don't like my job. I don't think I'm gonna go anymore. 
JOANNA You're just not gonna go? 
PETER Yeah. 
JOANNA Won't you get fired? 
PETER I don't know. But I really don't like it so I'm not gonna go. 
JOANNA LAUGHS) SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT? 
PETER No, no, not really. I'm just gonna stop going. 
JOANNA When did you decide all that? 
PETER About a week ago. 
JOANNA Really? 
PETER Oh, yeah. 
JOANNA Ok. So, so you're gonna get another job? 
PETER I don't think I 'd like another job. 
JOANNA LAUGHS) SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MONEY AND BILLS? 
PETER Y'know, I never really liked paying bill? I don't think I'll do that either. 
JOANNA LAUGHS) SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? 
He walks off. 
MILTON Ok. I'll set the building on fire. 
[Scene Hallway at Initech. Peter enters in casual clothes. Milton walks up to him.] 
MICHAEL Peter! 
PETER Michael! 
MICHAEL What the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here and start shooting. 
PETER I just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a number I don't wanna lose. 
MICHAEL What?! Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on Saturday. What were you doing? 
PETER Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything that I thought it could be. 
MICHAEL Well, I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know, you're supposed to be having your interview right now with the consultants. 
PETER Who? 
He writes down Joanna's number. 
MICHAEL What has gotten into you? 
PETER Oh yeah. Right. 
MICHAEL Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make something up. 
PETER Ah, no way. I feel great. 
[Scene The interview room.] 
BOB PORTER The next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons. 
Peter enters. 
BOB SLYDELL Aha! All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter Gibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate, Bob Porter. 
PETER Hi, Bob. Bob. 
BOB PORTER Why don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute? 
BOB SLYDELL Wow. 
Cut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall. 
BILL Hey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh - 
Peter walks right past him. 
[Scene Chotchkie's] 
STAN Joanna? Would you come here for a moment, please? 
JOANNA I'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch. 
STAN I need to talk about your flair. 
JOANNA Really? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him 
STAN Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok? 
JOANNA Ok. 
STAN Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare minimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a terrific smile. 
JOANNA Ok. Ok, you want me to wear more? 
STAN Look. Joanna. 
JOANNA Yeah. 
STAN People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about. It's about fun. 
JOANNA Ok. So, more then? 
STAN Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we encourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you? 
JOANNA Yeah. Yeah. 
STAN Great. Great. That's all I ask. 
JOANNA Ok. 
[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.] 
BILL Yeah... 
[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He takes a drill and removes the metal door handle.] 
Cut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot. 
Cut back inside. Peter tears down the banner. 
Cut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to pull off the bumper. 
Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss. 
LAWRENCE Hey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!! 
Cut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not there. 
Cut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a big fish. 
Cut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler. 
DOM Hello, Peter. 
PETER Hey Dom! 
He slaps him on the back. 
Cut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut it. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports. 
Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. 
Cut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it over. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes. 
[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as Bill walks up.] 
BILL So, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have those TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh, yeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, hmm? 
PETER Not right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a meeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes. 
BILL Uh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them. 
PETER Yeah, they called me at home. 
BILL That sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all fixed up for you later. 
PETER You're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!? 
BOB PORTER We're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in Singapore, that's the usual deal. 
BOB SLYDELL Well, it's standard operating procedure. 
PETER Do they know about this yet? 
BOB SLYDELL No! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a Friday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an incident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as many as four people working right underneath you. 
BOB PORTER This is a big promotion, Pete. 
BOB SLYDELL Huge. 
PETER So you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money? 
BOB SLYDELL Umm-hmm. 
PETER Wow! 
[Scene Michael is messing with the printer.] 
MICHAEL Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me. Come on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. Let's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu- 
Peter walks up to him. 
PETER Listen... Well, what are you doing tonight? 
[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.] 
PETER There comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is now, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future. 
MICHAEL Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're the one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious experience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or you're gonna get canned. 
PETER Yeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money... 
MICHAEL Yeah? What about it? 
PETER Well, how does it work? 
MICHAEL It's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it takes those remainders and puts it into your account. 
PETER This sounds familiar. 
SAMIR Superman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to get my resume ready. 
PETER Get your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for no reason? 
SAMIR That's right! If I'm lucky. 
PETER Look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed around. Aren't you? 
SAMIR Yes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal. 
PETER Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't Riyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have conjugal visits there? 
SAMIR Really. 
PETER Yes. 
MICHAEL Shit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months. 
SAMIR So what do you think? 
MICHAEL This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir. 
PETER You came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock of that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two options 
unemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be? 
SAMIR I have a question. 
PETER Yes. 
SAMIR In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women? 
PETER Yep. You sure can. 
SAMIR Ok. I'm gonna do it. 
PETER That's what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!! 
MICHAEL Peter Let's discuss the plan, all right? 
PETER All right. 
MICHAEL All right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the rest. 
JOANNA Oh, for everybody. Ok. 
PETER Yeah, well, those are whole pennies. 
JOANNA Yeah. 
PETER Right. I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it from a much bigger tray. A couple of million times. So what's wrong with that? 
JOANNA It seems wrong. 
PETER It's not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all right? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to get up in the morning and put on pieces of flair? 
JOANNA Yeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the register! 
PETER You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear them. 
JOANNA What?! 
PETER Look, we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go to the barbecue, all right? 
JOANNA Ok. 
[Scene Tom's house. Samir and Michael open the front door. tom is in a full body cast and is hooked up to a bunch of stuff.] 
TOM Michael! Samir! How are you doing? 
MICHAEL Hiya Tom. 
SAMIR Hi Tom. 
TOM Yeah, I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands) Rob, Michael. 
ROB Hello Michael. 
TOM Samir. 
ROB Hello - 
SAMIR Samir. 
ROB ...Samir. 
(Peter and Joanna enter. 
DREW That's something about old Tom Smykowski, huh? 
PETER Yeah. 
DREW Lucky bastard. (sees Joanna) Hey, isn't that the girl who works over at Chotchkie's? 
PETER Yeah. 
DREW Hmm, who's she here with? 
PETER She's here with me. 
DREW Really? 
PETER Yeah. 
DREW All right, Peter! Ooh! Ooh! Right on. Make sure you wear a rubber, dude. 
PETER Why's that, Drew? 
DREW Are you kidding me? She gets around, all right? 
PETER She does, does she? 
DREW Oh yeah. Like a record. 
Joanna waves. 
PETER With who? 
DREW Well, let's see. Lumbergh fucked her. Ah, let me see who else... 
PETER Lumbergh?! 
[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are leaving the party.] 
JOANNA Oh, what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I just don't know if this is such a good idea. 
PETER ANGRY) YEAH? WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH LUMBERGH! 
JOANNA What?! What are you - Oh! All right, Lumbergh... 
PETER ARGH!!! AH GOD! LUMBERGH!! 
JOANNA Yeah? 
STAN We need to talk. Do you know what this is about? 
JOANNA My, uh, flair. 
STAN Yeah. Or, uh, your lack thereof. I'm counting and I only see fifteen pieces. Let me ask you a question, Joanna. 
JOANNA Umm-hmm. 
STAN What do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum? 
JOANNA Huh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over there, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of flair? 
STAN Well, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself. 
JOANNA Yeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I don't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (gives him the finger) All right? There's my flair! And this is me expressing myself. (holds up her hand) There it is! I hate this job! I hate this goddamn job and I don't need it!! 
She storms out. 
[Scene An ATM machine. Peter gets out a receipt that says he has 
[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael have obviously seen the receipt.] 
SAMIR Shit, shit, shit, shit. Son of a bitch! Shit! This is a - fuck! Son of a bitch! Shit! 
MICHAEL What happened? 
PETER You tell me, Michael, it's your software! 
SAMIR Yes, it's your software! 
PETER Corporate accounting is sure as hell going to notice 305, 3 (grabs the receipt) 26.13!! Michael!! 
MICHAEL Oh shit! They, they probably won't notice it's gone for another two or three days. 
PETER Michael! Michael! You said the thing was gonna take two years! 
SAMIR What happened?! 
PETER You said the thing was supposed to work. 
MICHAEL Well, technically it did work. 
PETER That's a great idea. Ok, how do we do that? 
MICHAEL I don't know, I don't know. I don't even know what it means. It's something I think, I think coke dealers do. 
PETER Ok. Do we know any coke dealers? 
MICHAEL My, my cousin's a cokehead. We're in deep shit. 
SAMIR Yes. We are in very, very deep shit. 
[Scene Milton's new "office" - the basement. Bill enters with a piece of cake.] 
BILL Milton? 
MILTON Yes. 
BILL What's happening? 
MILTON I wanted to see you because - 
BILL Say, you know what would be a great idea? 
MILTON No...no. 
BILL Since you're already down here, it would be great if you could get a ca of pesticipe and take care of the cockroach problem we've been having in here. 
MILTON I...I...that's really not my job and I haven't received my - 
BILL For now, why don't you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and - 
Dom enters. 
DOM Bill! We need you upstairs right away. Some major glitch in the accounting. A lot of money missing. 
They go upstairs and Bill turns off the light. 
MILTON Excuse me? Excuse me? Ok, that's the last straw. 
[Scene Peter's place. Michael is looking up "money laundering" in the dictionary.] 
MICHAEL LAUNDERING. TO CLEAN...NO, UH, HERE IT IS. TO CHANNEL MONEY THROUGH A SOURCE OR BY AN INTERMEDIARY. 
SAMIR It doesn't really help us, Michael. 
PETER He doesn't know anything, all right? 
SAMIR Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You just give us the name of one drug dealer. I could talk to him. I have good networking skills. 
STEVE NORMAL) I LIED. ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT ME BEING A CRACKHEAD WAS TO HELP ME SELL MAGAZINES. I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER. 
PETER You're a software engineer?! 
SAMIR Working must be, must be very hard for you. 
STEVE I made more money selling magazine subscriptions than I ever did working at Initrode. 
MICHAEL Huh? You worked at Initrode? 
PETER You can't tell anybody about any of this stuff I told you. I mean, we know a lot of the same people. 
STEVE Actually, that all depends. 
He holds up his clipboard. 
Cut to later. Peter closes the door. 
PETER What am I going to do with forty subscriptions to Vibe ? 
MICHAEL I wish we had never done this. What are we going to do? You know what I can't figure out? How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia guys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly at it? 
SAMIR We're new to it, though. If we had more experience - 
MICHAEL No. No. Y'know what I think? I think we're screwed. There's evidence all over that building to link it to us. Even if we could launder money, I wouldn't want to. If we're caught while laundering money, we're not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison. No, no, no. We're gonna go to federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. 
SAMIR I don't want to go to any prison! Why the hell did I do this?! I've never done anything wrong in my whole life! We weren't thinking clearly because you told us we were losing our jobs! And look at us now, we're, we're worried about going to prison! 
PETER Don't worry about it. I'll think of something. 
SAMIR Ass. I'm going home. You are a very bad person, Peter. 
Samir and Michael leave. Peter knocks on the wall. 
PETER Lawrence! You awake? 
LAWRENCE Yeah, man! 
PETER You wanna come over? 
SECRETARY Um, why don't you go and sit at your desk. Mr. Lumbergh should be here any minute. 
MILTON Mr. Lumbergh - 
SECRETARY Just go and sit at your desk. 
MILTON But - 
SECRETARY Oh? 
MILTON Ok, I, I, I'm going to set the building on fire. I tell him, if I don't get my stapler (the secretary leaves) I'm going to have to get my stapler back because it is my stapler. (he goes into Mr. Lumbergh's office) It's my stapler, the Swingline. It's been mine for a very long time. 
[Scene Peter's room. He's packing his clothes. He goes outside and knocks on Lawrence's door.] 
PETER Hey, Lawrence, are you there? 
LAWRENCE Hey, Peter, man. 
PETER Hey. So, I may be going away for awhile. 
LAWRENCE Yeah, I know, man. It's a bummer, dude, what can I say? 
PETER Yeah. Well, it's time to go face the music. You take care of yourself, cause I don't wanna see ya. 
They shake hands. 
LAWRENCE You too, man. Take care. (Peter starts to leave) Hey Peter! Watch out for the corn hole ok? 
PETER Ok, Lawrence. 
[Scene Peter's car. He's driving along when he sees something.] 
Cut to Initech. It's on fire, big time. Peter joins the crowd of his co-workers and watches. Milton walks away quickly. A structure falls and Peter laughs. 
Cut to inside, a burning cubicle. 
[Scene The burned ruins of Initech. Peter is now a construction worker, working alongside Lawrence. Lawrence digs up Milton's burnt Swingline.] 
PETER Let me see this. 
LAWRENCE Who would want that stapler, man? That's toasted, man. 
PETER I know someone who might want this.

1   EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET LONDON - MORNING                     1 
MALCOLM TUCKERS, government director of communications, is arriving early. 
2   INT. NUMBER TEN CORRIDOR/MALCOLM'S OFFICE - MORNING         2 
A CIVIL SERVANT hands Malcolm a CD. 
CIVIL SERVANT Monitoring. All the usual. 
MALCOLM How did your team do at the weekend? 
CIVIL SERVANT Yeah, alright. We won. 
MALCOLM Great. (to himself) Wanker. 
Malcolm reaches his office. His assistant SAM is there. 
MALCOLM (CONT'D) Sam. Morning. 
He hands her the CD and she puts it into a CD player. 
MALCOLM (CONT'D) Well, pop pickers....what Shall we start with today? Wonky Ron....or Simon Foster, on the PM programme for the BBC. Malcolm starts listening to the recording of Simon on the radio. 
EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO) Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster, the Minister for International development. Thank you for joining us. 
MALCOLM Here we go. 
EDDIE MAIR You've been in the job now for eighteen months, do you think you're making headway? 
SIMON (v/o on radio) Ah. Yes I do. You'd expect me to say that I suppose.

Judy Malloy, the Department's Press Officer, is preparing for her minister's arrival. 
JUDY Mark, are you co-ordinating that millenium goals press release? 
MARK Yes. 
JUDY Well co-ordinate it better. 
MARK Yes, can do. 
JUDY Is that the Minister? Bloody nail - has anyone got a nail file? 
4   INT. DFID OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY.                             4 
SIMON is arriving with JUDY. Simon carrying his red dispatch box. Simon's worried. 
SIMON Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night's interview? 
JUDY No not yet. SIMON Perhaps he didn't hear it. 
JUDY Or maybe he's dead. 
SIMON (with a degree of genuine hope) He might be dead. He might have had that massive stroke we've all been waiting for. It's in the post. 
5   INT. MALCOLM'S OFFICE. DAY.                                  5 
SIMON (ON RADIO) ...preventable sickness in many of the poorest countries round the world....and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which is a major, major issue.... Page 2

MALCOLM Diarrhoea? I mean, this is the minister for International Development. He should be talking about food parcels, not fucking arse-spraying mayhem. 
SAM laughs. 
SIMON (ON RADIO) And so if we can tackle the easy things, like diarrhoea, then we can..... 
MALCOLM Oh yes, say it again. Very good. What is this, The Shitting Forecast? 
SIMON (ON RADIO) ...and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases. EDDIE MAIR You mentioned the word `war" 
MALCOLM is paying extremely close attention now. 
MALCOLM Steady Eddie... 
SIMON (ON RADIO) Against preventable diseases, yes.... 
EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO) Yes. All the evidence now points to a US military intervention in the Middle East. Is that you view? 
TOBY Yeah, alright. 
SUZY Oh and be careful - cars! 
They walk off in separate directions. 
9   MORNING/INT. MICHAEL'S FO OFFICE - MORNING                        9 
Toby is walking towards DFID. As he nears the building he finds himself next to Malcolm, who is heading in too. Toby is on the phone. 
INTERCUT PHONE CALL: 
TOBY Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes, because you're starting to remind me of my mum. And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction. 
Suzy is still in the FO office. 
Page 6 
9   CON TINUE D:                                                     9 
SUZY I'm just checking whether you put last night's lasagne in the fridge. 
In the FO office, MICHAEL arrives. He has a small suitcase and a paper bag. He holds this up. 
MICHAEL (mouthing) Croissants! 
Back with Malcolm, Toby close by. Malc's on the phone. 
MALCOLM No. You're fine to go ahead and print that. It's lies, you'd be lying, but go ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No he did not. Oh, just before you go -- when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference...would email be better? Or a phone call? Or, hey I know, I'll write it on a cake, "Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the new baby" in those little silver balls. (BEAT) Yeah, maybe best to spike it? Okay. Fuckity-bye! 
Toby is now next to Malcolm in the building (or better still, in a lift). Malcolm becomes aware of him. 
TOBY No, it's fine, it's in the fridge. I put some clingfilm over it. In the FO office, Michael switches on some classical music. 
SUZY Why did you put clingfilm on it? 
TOBY To keep it fresh. 
Malcolm starts dialling on his phone. 
SUZY It's in the fridge, that'll keep it fresh. 
TOBY No, but it still might dry out. 
MALCOLM (into phone) Yeah, Malcolm Tucker. Can I speak to James Lewis at the PM Programme please? Page 7 
9    CON TINUE D: (2)                                            9 
Michael hands Suzie a croissant. 
MICHAEL (knowing Toby is on the other end of the line) Still slightly warm. That's how I like my women as well. 
SUZY Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby. 
TOBY No it isn't. That's a myth. Clingfilm is perfectly safe. 
Malcolm now eyeing Toby with suspicion/contempt -- who is this dick? Toby tries to smile, lowers his voice, embarrassed. 
MALCOLM (into phone) No, I'll hold,. what's he waiting for?     A sex-change? 
TOBY They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer. Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer. And Lasagne doesn't give you syphillis. 
MALCOLM James! Right --Simon Foster? Yeah, very funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody. Listen, we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow, OK? (getting annoyed) No, YOU relax. Tell you what, I'll come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown. GET ME FUCKING BRIAN!

10   INT. SIMON'S OFFICE - DAY.                                  10 
Simon and Judy are still prepping the funny question. .. 
SIMON Paris Hilton? 
JUDY Are you serious? 
SIMON Lily Allen. 
JUDY No. No women. Page 8 
10   CON TINUE D:                                                     10 
SIMON The Olson twins? 
Judy gets a call. 
JUDY Hi. Right. I see. 
She rings off. 
SIMON (sensing something's up) What? 
JUDY Malcolm's coming to see you. 
JUDY Because it's a scheduled media appearance by this department's Secretary Of State and it therefore falls within my purview... 
MALCOLM Your purview? Where do you think you are sweetheart, in some Regency costume drama? This is a government department, not a fucking Jane Austen novel. Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock. 
JUDY Malcolm, your swearing doesn't impress me. My husband works for Tower Hamlets and believe me, those kids make you sound like Angela Lansbury. 
MALCOLM (to Simon, lads' chat) She's married? The poor bastard. 
SIMON But...okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment.... (Judy walks out) Are you saying that I'm now not allowed to make any media appearances? 
MALCOLM No, not until we can trust you to keep to the line. 
SIMON But I was going to keep to the line: "I don't actually think war is unforeseeable." 
Page 12 
12   CON TINUE D: (3)                                          12 
Malcolm's looking out of the office, monitoring Judy's movements. She's flashed up on his radar. He's tracking her. 
MALCOLM What is it then? 
A beat. 
SIMON Is it...I don't know? Foreseeable? No. 
MALCOLM No. Not foreseeable. That's fucking declaring war. Do you want to fucking declare war? 
SIMON I'm a cabinet minister. I didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance I ever had. 
MALCOLM Write this down. It's neither forseeable nor undorseeable. 
SIMON Right. So not inevitable, but not...evitable. 
Malcolm leaves the office. Toby is still hovering. 
MALCOLM (calling back to Simon) Okay, you need to work on this fucking line. (to Judy) That includes you, Jane Fucking Austen with the strap-on. Oh, and put the sniff out there that the next time the BBC ambushes a Minister with a war question we'll drop a bomb on them. 
JUDY I can't do that. That's political, that's not in my... 
MALCOLM Purview, Marie Antoinette? Weel listen, darling, why don't you fucking scuttle off back to fucking Cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks. Let them eat cock! (TO TOBY) You, Ron Weasley -- you do it. 
Malcolm heads out.

13   INT. FO MICHAELS OFFICE - DAY                              13 
Suzy and Michael in Michael's office. Suzy's getting documents together for the big meeting. Michael's at his computer, on the phone. Classical music still on. 
MICHAEL (on phone) You needn't worry about the Canadians. They're just happy to be there. (Pause) Yes, well, they always look surprised when they're invited. 
SUZY Listen, shall I just give Toby a quick call about the Simon Foster thing? 
Suzy dials. 
14   INT. DFID/INT FOREIGN OFFICE MICHAELS OFFICE               14 
Toby checks the phone. Sees it's Suzy -- Christ, not her again, I'm a bit busy here. He answers. 
INTERCUT PHONE CALL: 
TOBY Hiya. You do know this is the third time you've rung? Are you on a new tariff? 
SUZY So? How's it going? You found the bogs yet? TOBY All a bit manic. It was never like this at Agriculture. People tend not to swear so much about wheat. Apart from farmers. They swear about everything. 
SUZY (to Michael, re. the music) Can you turn that down a bit? (to Toby) Look, I've got a leg up for you. I think we could get Simon into the big meeting with Karen Clark? 
TOBY Right - Karen Clark from...is that the woman who went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia? 
Page 14 
14   CON TINUE D:                                                   14 
SUZY Karen Clark, US Assistant Secretary of State? 
TOBY Oh right. Shit. Karen Clark. Wow. Thanks. 
SUZY Hang on, Michael wants to say something. 
MICHAEL Meat. 
SUZY Meat. 
MICHAEL Meat! Simon's only going to be meat in the room. Don't get his hopes up. SUZY Yeah, so you know -- Simon, between us, he's just going to be meat in the room. 
TOBY Meat? 
Judy, nearby, hears this. 
SUZY (waving him away) Yeah. The Americans don't feel they're getting a real meeting unless there's thirty of you on each side. So Simon is...you know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical goods? Sort of one of those. But you might not want to tell him that. I ought to go. I love you. 
CHAD We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon delegation. First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters. 
SUZY Right. CHAD Thanks so much. 
He walks purposefully off. 
MICHAEL My God. Who was that, Young Lankenstein? 
JUDY Oh he'll be running something relatively major. They're all kids in Washington. It's like Bugsy Malone, but with real guns. 
18   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE GRAND MEETING ROOM      - DAY              18 
Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's pretty much full. 
KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately. 
Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services. 
Lots of hubbub. 
SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to their seats. 
Page 18 
18   CON TINUE D:                                                   18 
They're as far away from the US delegation as it's possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore important I am'. 
SIMON No-one will hear me if I say anything. How's your view? Can we swap? 
Simon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see anything. 
SIMON (CONT'D) (to Judy) Can I swap with you? 
JUDY I think the meeting's starting. 
It is. 
SIMON Well, quickly then, swap. 
Simon and Judy swap seats. 
The meeting is now underway. We're with Karen Clark. 
KAREN We all agree this is a very tough time, but I don't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point. 
Back with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to see. 
SIMON Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit hardcore. 
He cranes again to see. 
SIMON (CONT'D) No, this is worse. Swap back. 
Simon and Judy swap seats again. 
Back with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red folder.

KAREN This paper, authored by one of my aides, Liza Weld. You don't mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza? 
Liza reacts. Her paper? In a big meeting. Is this good or bad? 
KAREN (CONT'D) Illuminates the logistical factors we face. She highlights a number of reasons why, in practical terms, we can't envision a theatre deployment for twelve months. 
BOB ADRIANO Although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper. 
KAREN Really - such as what? 
BOB ADRIANO The committee feels a much quicker deployment is possible. 
KAREN Which committee? 
BOB ADRIANO (covering) This has been discussed in a number of committees. If I said one committee... 
KAREN You did. 
ADRIANO Then that was a slip of the tongue 
KAREN Have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee? A war committee? 
MICHAEL If I can interject here, I'm aware we're pushed for time. I'd like to move us on agenda-wise. Our next item is international relief co-ordination. 
Karen is conferring with Liza, Adriano with his guy. 
KAREN Have you heard of this committee? 
ADRIANO What's this Liza Weld paper? Page 20 
CHAD Ooh. 
LIZA See, you're an only child, aren't you? 
CHAD You bring this up whenever you run out of arguments. I don't see how my parents' limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me. I'm the sperm that made it. 
Liza walks off, over to Karen. 
CHAD (CONT'D) Have fun with your career kryptonite. 
21   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE LOBBY - DAY                                   21 
SIMON (re : Karen talking conspiratorially to Liza downstairs) What's that all about? It looks important. 
22   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE LOBBY - DAY                                   22 
Karen is back, huddled up with Liza. KAREN My teeth hurt. I think the veneers are chipped. Do they look chipped? 
Liza stares into Karen's mouth. 
LIZA Well, I think that one, that one's always been there, right? I'm not sure. Have you got any painkillers? 
KAREN Oh, don't look at my teeth.

24   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE LOBBY - DAY                             24 
KAREN (looking up at the Brits, off Simon's smile) I don't want to risk a dentist here. 
25   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE UPSTAIRS MEZZANINE - DAY                25 
The US delegation are heading off 
TOBY (shouting) Hey Liza! 
LIZA Oh ... Hi ... hi? She knows him but can't immediately place him. 
TOBY Toby? It's Toby. 
LIZA Hi. Hi. 
She makes the phone sign. He gives a thumbs up, she thinks he's misread the phone sign and gestures, or email by doing typing in the air. Toby signs back, yeah, call on the phone or email - does the typing back. 
JUDY (re the typing gesture) What are you doing? You look like    you're practicing baby massage. 
TOBY She did the Kennedy scholarship at my college. I had a small thing for her. 
JUDY I can imagine. 
TOBY I'm not sure she remembered me. 
JUDY No, that is one of the side effects of Rohypnol.

26   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE. DAY.                                 26 
KAREN Linton has set up a secret war committee, I just know it. I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic, Liza. He is dangerous. The voices in his head are now singing barbershop together. 
27   EXT. FOREIGN OFFICE - DAY                                 27 
The conversation is continuing between Simon Judy and Toby as they exit the FO. 
SIMON Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's not a war. It's going to be a nightmare. It's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics. 
They appear outside. There's a press pack of 10 or so reporters and photographers there. 
PRESS Minister!/Simon!/Mr Foster! 
Simon is taken aback. 
SIMON Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don't need this. 
JUDY Er, you wanted a chance to row back on the war. Do you want to nail the line? 
SIMON What? No. No. I'll freestyle it. 
The press are calling. 
REPORTER 1 Is war unforeseeable Minister? 
SIMON Look, (grappling now) ...loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable. Y'know, For the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly very real and inevitable. 
Toby and Judy look at one another. This isn't good. 
Page 26 
LINTON Thank you, James 
CHAD Chad. 
KAREN Ok. Why don't you just recap for me all the committees that you're currently sitting on? 
Page 36 
34   CON TINUE D: (2)                                          34 
LINTON I'm Sorry, Karen, you appear to be bleeding from your mouth. 
She is. But she doesn't want to leave the meeting. 
KAREN Oh don't try to change the subject Linton. 
LIZA (Looking at Karen) Oh no. Holy Mother of.... 
Everyone is just looking at her. 
LINTON I don't mean to be rude Karen but that is a tad... repulsive. I can't concentrate on what you're saying. You have blood coming out of your teeth and that's not right. 
Karen gets up to go. It's awkward, she's boxed in and has to clamber over the others to get to the door. 
KAREN Okay, Liza come with me. 
CHAD (aside, to Liza) Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen now. 
Liza follows Karen out. Chad takes Liza's seat. LINTON I don't like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth. It makes me think of Country and Western music. Which I really can't abide. 
CHAD (what?) Yes! Ha ha! Exactly. 
Linton sees his chance to take advantage of Karen being out of the room. 
LINTON Actually while we're on Any Other Business I do have a few points I'd like to resolve. 
Page 37 
35   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - CORRIDOR/BATHROOM - DAY              35 
They head into the bathroom. 
Liza is pulling handfuls of tissue. Handing them to Karen who is dabbing her teeth. 
KAREN Where are at you at with the committees? 
LIZA I got it down to two. The Aims and Policy Alignment Committee. Here - put some down your front - you don't want it to go down your... And the Future Planning Committee. 
KAREN Well, it's not the first one. I set that one up. Does that really sound dull to you? I thought that was a good name. 
LIZA Right, no, it is a good name. 
KAREN Okay, find out if it is definitely the Future Planning Committee. 
LIZA Okay. Okay. Right, listen, I might go and do that. You're not going to shout at me if I go and do that are you? KAREN I'm not a fucking monster Liza, okay? Will you stop implying I'm some kind of monster? 
36   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                                  36 
Liza heads out of the toilets to see Bob Adriano ahead, quite a long way. 
LIZA Bob! 
Bob Adriano stops and turns. 
BOB ADRIANO Liza. 
Liza sprints and catches up with him.

LIZA So listen, Bob, there's something I really want to tell you. We're having a hunk of the month competition, and I just didn't want you to be feel...objectified in any way....and 
BOB ADRIANO (hopes it might be a come- on?) Oh really? 
LIZA Karen knows about the Future Planning Committee. 
Bob Adriano looks shocked, tries to cover it up. 
BOB ADRIANO I have no idea what you're talking about. Liza smiles. Runs back into the toilets and gives a thumbs up to Karen. 
37   INT. WASHINGTON AIRPORT - DAY                                    37 
Simon and Toby walking past the queues at US immigration, they are being ushered through a separate channel by airport workers and diplomatic staff. As they're escorted Simon and Toby catch each other's eye. 
TOBY This is cool. SIMON Don't be callow Toby. We're on official business. 
A Homeland Security official ushers them through. 
SIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd) This is a little bit fucking cool. 
TOBY (CONT'D) Technically, you've got a Capitol Hill view. 
45   INT. GEORGETOWN HOUSE - NIGHT                                    45 
A smart private cocktail party in a fancy Georgetown house. Karen and General Miller spot each other. 
They each take a glass of champagne from a waiter. 
GENERAL MILLER Hey Karen. You look beautiful. 
KAREN I bet you say that to all the girls. GENERAL MILLER Yeah I do. And some of the guys. 
KAREN That's why you shouldn't run for Senate. Too many skeletons in your enormous closet. 
GENERAL MILLER Yeah, don't believe the hype. I'm just thinking about doing ... something. I'm more than just a soldier, Karen. 
KAREN That's right, you're passionate about education and housing and what's the other thing? 
GENERAL MILLER Lingerie.

KAREN That's right. 
GENERAL MILLER And bestiality. 
KAREN I'd forgotten about that. Are you still allergic to that dog? 
GENERAL MILLER Yes, yes. I wake up and my eyes are closed and my head is swollen and I look like a giant ball sack. 
KAREN Oh my god, they do have memdication for that.....but a beautiful ball sack, though. And how's the pentagon? GENERAL MILLER It's kicked up a level. Talking invasion real soon. 
KAREN Is there somewhere we can talk? 
GENERAL MILLER I don't know, I don't live in this house. 
46   INT. CAULDERWOOD'S PARTY. ADJOINING PLAY ROOM - EVENING          46 
General Miller and Karen are in Caulderwood's kids' play room. Toys are piled up everywhere. KAREN What if someone comes in now? 
GENERAL MILLER I can't think of an excuse that would work can you? 
KAREN No. Just be careful. Don't mess stuff up. 
They sit down on the child's bed. Miller grabs a crayon. 
GENERAL MILLER Okay so that's total minimum European Theatre requirement. 
He shows her a figure on a piece of paper. 
GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D) (he scribbles) This is Far East, Korea, Japan etc. Page 43 
46   CON TINUE D:                                                     46 
He scribbles. 
GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D) Add those. Plus contingency already deployed. 
KAREN Er - you've lost me. 
Miller looks around, grabs a child's laptop. Opens it, it says `howday' in an electronic voice. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Your military hardware is impressive. 
GENERAL MILLER Not anymore it isn't. Okay so this is total current deployment. (he types) Europe, Asia. (He types) And the contingency already deployed. (He types) So the current number of combat troops available for an invasion according to these figures would be ... (he presses the `equals' button) 
COMPUTER VOICE Twelve. 
KAREN Thousand? GENERAL MILLER No, twelve. Twelve soldiers. Twelve. 
KAREN You're shitting me. 
GENERAL MILLER Of course I'm shitting you, but 12 thousand isn't enough. Twelve thousand's about how many are going to die. And you really need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it looks like you've lost. 
KAREN Uh-huh. Tomorrow I've got to meet these Brits. Simon Foster. He's the guy that said war was unforseeable, and I think he could very useful on the committee because he could internationalise the dissent.

INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - TOBY'S ROOM. Simon knocks on the door. Toby opens, he's in his boxer shorts and shirt. 
SIMON Tobes. Hi. So! What's the plan? What swanky reception are we going to? 
TOBY (panic in his eyes) What's the plan? For tonight? 
SIMON Well that's what I'm asking you Toby, my chief aide, my political advisor. 
Toby comes out of the bathroom. 
TOBY Simon, I've managed to get us on the... 
Malcolm is suddenly in his face. MALCOLM Hello!! 
TOBY (heart attack) Fuck! Malcolm! Jesus. 
MALCOLM You're meant to shit yourself in there. Not out here. 
TOBY Right. (to Simon) I've got us on to Linton's Future Planning Committee in the morning. 
SIMON Okay. What's that?

TOBY It's the war committee. 
MALCOLM What? The actual....war committee? 
TOBY Yeah, Liza says that... 
MALCOLM Who's going to be there? 
TOBY Karen Clark, Liza, me and Simon. (off Simon's look) Simon and me. 
MALCOLM Who else is going -- Jimmy Osmond? Gwyneth Paltrow? You've been invited to a diversion. The real committee, the real thing, that's happening at The White House. 
Toby picks his jacket up. 
TOBY Yeah well, I'll text you the details because I'm going to go out.for A quick drink with some State Department bods. 
MALCOLM Don't mention this to the press, ok? Don't mention it to anyone. Because if the press get a whiff there's a war committee, even a cardboard one, every fucker in this town is going to turn up and try and get on it. So no matter what gay bar you end up, keep it schtumm. 
Malcolm flicks the TV over to a news channel. 
SIMON I was watching that. 
Malcolm looks at him. 
MALCOLM I have to have a word with you. You might want to slip into your negligee. 
Toby heads out.

55   INT. BLACK CAT INDIE CLUB - NIGHT                           55 
Toby and Liza sit in a booth. They are by far the most formally dressed people in the club. A band are playing angry rock with a vaguely political message. A small knot of people are rocking out. 
LIZA (re : the mosh pit) You see those guys? The mosh pit? 
TOBY Yes, I don't think I've ever seen a more civilised 'mosh pit' it's more of a mosh caucus actually. 
LIZA House staffers, Senators' interns, most of them are half-man half-PDF file. Tonight they rage hard. Tomorrow they go back to the hill and argue noise reduction legislation. 
They're chuckling, having a good time. 
TOBY (beat, looks at her.) You're worried. 
LIZA (she's been mulling on something else entirely) It's Pwip Pip. TOBY I'm sorry? Pip Pip? Is this... a person or a cell phone tarrif or.. 
LIZA It's my paper. On the war. Pros and Cons of the war. But I came up with too many cons. The pro-war guys have started calling me `Connie'. So, yes I'm fucking worried. My career's on the line. 
TOBY Yeah- I noticed you're worried, cos I saw you looking worried. I'm perceptive like that. But... (can't think of anything else) Don't worry. 
LIZA Okay, this place blows. I'm going. What are you doing? Page 50 
55   CON TINUE D:                                                     55 
TOBY Well I'm incredibly tired. It feels like my brain's eight hours behind but my liver's 12 hours ahead. 
LIZA You don't want to come back to my place for a quick catch up? 
It's an alluring offer. 
TOBY However, due to technological developments I no longer need sleep, but am physically rejuvenated by alcohol! 
He guzzles from his beer bottle as they leave. 
56   INT. LIZA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    56 Toby and Liza are on the bed together, kissing. 
TOBY Could I just say, you know, that what happens in Washington stays in Washington? 
LIZA Yeah I live in Washington. So that doesn't really work for me. 
57   INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - EVENING                                  57 Malcolm is     still in Simon's room. He's texting. Simon sneaks the     remote and flips from the news back to the shark doc.     Malcolm, without looking up, picks up the remote and     flicks back to the news. 
MALCOLM We are under enormous pressure Simon. Karen will want you to say, `war is unforeseeable'. Linton will want you to talk up `climbing the mountain of conflict'. You say nothing, okay? You can't swing both ways, you're not David fucking Bowie. 
SIMON Toby -- I don't want to read you the riot act here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act. Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey. (special needs) `The British are coming'? 
TOBY (feels he's taken enough now) So I turned up late to the meeting Simon. I'm sorry. But it's not like I threw up in there. 
Page 54

SIMON No you're right. I should be thanking you for not throwing up. Well done. You're a star. You didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'. No I'm being unfair, you got so much right. Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career. You're a legend. 
An uncomfortable beat. 
TOBY That was just - the first bit was it? We're going back in do you ...think? 
SIMON We'd barely said hello. I've had muggings that have lasted longer than that. We really only spoke about flammable cheese. 
Liza comes out, passes by. Toby mouths `shit' to himself. 
LIZA (looking at a list on her desk, then to a staffer) Are these all requests to get on the committee? What's going on? Did someone post an invite on Facebook? I'm drowning in Senators. It's Senator soup here. 
TOBY Hi Liza. 
They're uncomfy with each other. 
LIZA Hey Toby. 
Toby gets up for a private word. 
TOBY (re last night) You feeling okay? 
LIZA Yes, I'm feeling fine. Why were you late? 
TOBY Because...you know...you didn't wake me up.

LIZA You looked so sweet. I thought you knew what you were doing. 
TOBY I was asleep, of course I didn't. That's how people walk out of windows. 
STAFFER ((hand over phone, calls over) Hey Liza, I've got another call about the Committee from Senator Crudden's office, he wants in too. 
LIZA What is going on here? Fuck. Why's this my problem? Toby you sure you didn't do bad? You didn't mention the committee to anyone else? TOBY Nada. Nada.. Bad-da. Nada-bada bing-bong ding-dang-dong. (beat, she looks at him) I have no idea what I'm saying anymore I think I really am still quite drunk. 
Chad is passing. As Liza turns away Toby's face does a spasm of regret at his brazen lying. 
CHAD Everyone is so hot for your paper. I'm running off another ten copies. It's spreading like a virus, Liza. You're in hot water. You're lobsterising. 
LIZA I don't feel that. 
CHAD It's by degrees. Wafting. Bisque. I smell lobster. Can you smell lobster, Toby? 
Simon calls Toby back over. 
SIMON (O.S.) Mate! 
TOBY I need to... 
LIZA Sure. 
Toby goes back to Simon Page 56

63   INT. WHITE HOUSE. SMALLISH ROOM - DAY                       63 
Malcolm is arriving into a meeting room set up with water etc with a young man who looks like an intern, A.J. 
A.J. How are you today? Beat the traffic? 
Malcolm looking around, as if things aren't right. 
MALCOLM Yeah yeah. Hunky dory. Can I get a coffee? He gives AJ his coat. 
A.J. (doesn't take coat then eventually does and just puts it on a chair, not the coat stand) Sure, sure, if we get started, I'll get my assistant to bring us some refreshments. 
MALCOLM (realising) Your assistant? A.J. (sitting, picking up a file in the room) Yeah. So, Item. We need to have a conversation about the mood of the British Parliament. Any bumps in the road ahead. 
MALCOLM I'm sorry son, am I - is this it? No offence, but shouldn't you be at school with your head down a toilet? 
A.J. Your first point there, the offence. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take it. Your second point. I'm 22. But - item - It's my birthday in nine days, so if it would be more comfortable we could... wait...?

MALCOLM Don't get sarcastic with me son. (starts dialling) We burnt this tight-arsed city to the ground in 1814 and I'm all for doing it again. Starting with you, you frat fuck. You get sarcastic with me again and I will stuff so much cotton wool dowm your fucking throat it'll come out of your arse like the wee tail on a playboy bunny. Okay? I thought...I was led to believe I was attending the war committee. 
Linton calls the over-stuffed, standing-room-only room to order. 
LINTON Okay, due to the fact that seemingly everyone in the world who owns a suit has turned up for this meeting, we'll be relocating to a bigger room. Room 720. So, if you will be so kind... The committee members file out.

The committee members file in. 
Miller goes close up to Linton. GENERAL MILLER Just so you know -- Karen and I did not appreciate having to sneak around like Mulder and Scully trying to find out about this committee. 
LINTON Well, you're both here now. John and Yoko. 
GENERAL MILLER You and I need to talk, mano-a-mano, cocks on the block, about how things are operating around here at the moment. 
Linton not fazed by this. 
LINTON Sure. How about 12:30 tomorrow, my office?

GENERAL MILLER Good. 
General Miller takes his seat. Linton turns on Adriano. 
LINTON What the hell happened? 
ADRIANO I have no idea how they all heard sir. There must have been a leak. 
General Miller is sitting next to Karen. They're watching Linton having angry words with Adriano. 
GENERAL MILLER Look at Adriano. Poor fuck. He looks like he's with his Daddy: "Sorry, Bob, you're adopted. From a couple with hereditary heart defects." KAREN "And your mother only ever kept your baby clothes for the purposes of voodoo." 
Simon is sitting with Toby, marvelling at the numbers of people cramming into the room. 
SIMON I'm room meat again. This is a massive abattoir of room meat. Stay outside Tobes, I need a guy on the outside. Make friends with Chad, that boy from The Shining. He knows stuff. Pump him. TOBY Oh no. I want to stay in here with Miller. Don't make me pump Chad. 
SIMON I'm making you pump Chad. Go on. 
Toby gets up to leave. 
SIMON (CONT'D) It'll be easy peasy lemon squeezy. 
TOBY No it won't. It'll be difficult difficult lemon difficult. 
Toby reluctantly leaves, trying to grab another peek at Miller.

Everyone is finally assembled. The room has thirty or so people in it. 
LINTON So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged session of the Future Planning Committee. You can all see an agenda? 
People are looking at their agendas, low-level chatter, pouring of water, etc. - a general pre-meeting feel. 
KAREN Assistant Secretary -- here on point 6, it feels like there's an assumption that we'll be invading. Should we talk about the practical? I mean this is the war committee after all? 
LINTON It's the Future Planning Committee. 
KAREN Unofficially it's known as the war committee. 
LINTON Well, unofficially we can call anything whatever we like. (he holds up a water glass) Unofficially, this is a shoe. But it's not a shoe, Karen, it's a glass of water, and this is the Future Planning Committee.

KAREN But what I'm asking is has a decision been reached in principle to advocate invasion? 
LINTON That's way off agenda Karen. Although it would seem a general consensus may be forming.

KAREN Yes I want that. (points to various packages) I want that, that, that, that and that. Those I don't care about. And these let's pack up and drop on North Korea. 
GENERAL MILLER (beat, reads) Someone should leak this. 
Outside Liza sees them discussing her paper animatedly. It doesn't look good to her. 
KAREN Someone maybe shaped a little bit like you. 
GENERAL MILLER Me? Are you kidding? KAREN You have more gravitas. 
GENERAL MILLER Exactly. I'm too senior. I can't leak. Leaking is for people like your Liza and the Boy called It out there. (eats) It's insane. Not only is the case against war incredibly strong, the case for is caveated to hell. (reading) "Most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders..." Then here in the caveats, the only source is `Ice Man' - a possible alcoholic - who's probably called that cos he gets through ten bags / icebergs a day in his fucking vodka tonics. INR say we can't trust him. That's us disputing our own findings. Has Linton read this? 
KAREN I'm not sure he reads. You're a General. Have him killed. 
GENERAL MILLER You see this is why we never got together. That and the hobo teeth.

SIMON Well, yeah. I mean, your lot are probably getting it somehow, but our lot shouldn't be. 
Paul Michaelson calls over. 
PAUL MICHAELSON I'm still here, Simon. 
KAREN What's going on Simon? 
SIMON Departmental business. About a wall. KAREN Gaza? 
SIMON Uh-huh. What can I do for you? 
KAREN Where were you in the committee? I called for back-up, you sat there like a dumb sack of shit. Maybe worse, cos at a molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy. 
SIMON Well - okay. Yes. Um. Well, I have to say Karen, I have a clear strategy here. I'm playing the long game. 
KAREN There is no long game. They've bounced us into a short game. You looked like a...what do you call it in England? A 'wanker

TOBY Sorry. But I'm on your side. I have to look after my Mum too. You do, or they get shafted don't they? So... 
Simon wants to talk. 
Roz takes over. 
PAUL MICHAELSON I'm going to pursue this with, what do they call it? Extreme prejudice, to the very end. I can be enormously persistent. Ask my ex-girlfriend. 
ROZ Okay, well, I'll take your details. Roz leads Paul away 
SIMON That guy's a bit full-beam. 
TOBY Full-beam? 
SIMON Yeah, full-beam. Headlights. (he opens his eyes wide to show what he means) I kept thinking, is he going to nut me. He appears not to be nutting me, but he might well nut me. 
TOBY So what did Karen Clark want? 
SIMON Do you think I came over as weak on the committee over there?

Karen runs out of the lifts. There's even more of a buzz than usual, people running around. She sees Bob Adriano, Linton and Chad in a huddle in Linton's air. Hurries over to Liza. 
KAREN Liza, what's up? Why is everyone running around? This better be a fucking fire drill. 
LIZA The President has said he's vetoing tarrifs on Chinese auto imports. 
KAREN Shit. Karen calls over to a staffer, ABBEY. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Abbey, get me the president's statement. 
ABBEY Mr Barwick has asked me to... 
Karen is   beginning to lose it. 
KAREN You work to me, Abbey, you fucking work to me. Get me the statement. Or I will call security and have you escorted off the premises via the window. Karen crosses quickly to her office. Liza follows. 
LIZA Sorry, why is that...? He's...what, buttering the Chinese up?

Suzy cuts in. 
SUZY You've got a text. 
TOBY (reading, covering) Oh yeah. It's just Rob about football. 
SUZY So, Liza. You shagged her? 
TOBY What? No. 
SUZY (to Judy) Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been getting his flakey end away? 
JUDY I don't know anything about his flakey end. 
TOBY Could we not talk about accusations and, health issues, in the pub? 
JUDY I should go. 
SUZY You haven't finished your drink. 
JUDY No. I mainly have. 
SUZY Why did you do it? 
TOBY I don't know, it was a weird, intense time over there. It was...maybe, subconsciously, I don't know, it was a kind of last ditch attempt to stop this, awful...war.

Simon, Toby and Judy are on the way to Heathrow. 
SIMON Should I resign? I've floated that I might, when I thought I wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if I did. I mean, do you think, is it braver to just resign and say, `No, no war'? JUDY Yes. 
SIMON Or is it actually braver to say, `I don't agree, but I'm going to grit my teeth and get on with it?' Is the really brave thing actually doing what you don't believe? 
JUDY No. 
TOBY Though -- maybe? What's brave about doing the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the wrong thing is braver. In a way. I mean, you know, wars sometimes work. The War of Independence, that worked. For the Americans. Second World War. That was a good idea. I mean not a good idea but ... 
SIMON I know what you mean. And the Crimean War -- we got nurses out of that. 
TOBY Nurses are good.

95   INT. AIRPORT ARRIVALS - DAY                                      95 
Judy, Simon and Toby are walking past a baggage carousel. 
SIMON (conspiratorially to Toby) In the motorcade. Let's get a car without Judy. 
TOBY You want hookers? You like hooky fucky? 
SIMON I want to talk about the resigning thing. TOBY Still? 
SIMON But with you and not her. She has this air of moral righteousness that inhibits you from... saying anything morally wrong. 
96   INT. LIMO - DAY                                                  96 
Simon and Toby looking very uptight. Malcolm's with them. 
MALCOLM (looking at phone) So. The wires are all currently reporting that you're going to resign from government over the war. 
SIMON What? That wasn't supposed to get outside. 
MALCOLM Yeah well it is outside. It's lurking outside like a big hairy rapist at a coach station. 
Simon looks to Toby for help. 
MALCOLM (CONT'D) Do you know, if I could I'd punch you into total paralysis.

INT. UN BUILDING - DAY Malcolm, Simon, Toby and Judy are being led through a bleak, soulless basement corridor in the UN by Sir Jonathan Tutt, the British ambassador to the UN. 
SIR JONATHAN Hello, gentlemen, Sir Jonathan Tutt. This is it. The United Nations. 
SIMON It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it? 
JUDY It could do with a few more scatter cushions and a bit less asbestos. 
SIR JONATHAN I don't know what you were expecting -- Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of stonework tracery... great fountains... 
MALCOLM It's a shithole. It looks like a hospice for robots. 
They pass a big office. 
SIR JONATHAN Linton Barwick is in there. Karen Clark is there. You're right here. 
Sir Jonathan shows them to their office. SIR JONATHAN (CONT'D) If you need anything, just whistle. You know how to whistle don't you Malcolm? You just put your lips together and blow. 
Malcolm and Toby look at one another. 
SIR JONATHAN (CONT'D) Right. I'm off upstairs to the informal delegates' reception. Hope there's nibbles, I'm ravenous. 
Sir Jonathan leaves. 
SIR JONATHAN No, it can't be. I mean it could be done, it just can't. 
MALCOLM Then I'll do it. (motioning to a door) They're through there? 
SIR JONATHAN Yes but you can't go in, that would be a serious breach of protocol ... 
He's blocking Malcolm. Malcolm grabs his hand. 
MALCOLM Then you do it. Get in there. 
He is almost man-handling him in. SIR JONATHAN I'm not dancing with you Malcolm. 
MALCOLM I'm leading, look follow my lead. 
SIR JONATHAN You're not dancing me into the secretariat! 
Jonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to go in. 
As Malcolm is leaving Miller blocks his path. MALCOLM Where's the intel? Are you sure you're working as hard as me? Cos I'm sweating spinal fluid here. I'm a husk. 
MILLER You get everything you need? 
MALCOLM (in a hurry) Oh yeah I think so. Thanks. (a beat, thinks) Oh, Whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment General Flintstone. Was it you? Did you leak Pwip Pip? I know you can't fire a gun, but can you use a fax? 
MILLER No, see, because I'm upfront about what I do. I don't creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other people's dirty work. Page 98 
100   CON TINUE D: (4)                                         100 
MALCOLM I'm doing my own work. I'm doing my job. 
MILLER Uh-hu. I think you're doing Linton's dirty work. I think you're his English bitch and if I walked into your hotel room tonight I'd find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of you. 
MALCOLM Oooo. Tough talk from the armchair General. What you going to do? Throw a cushion at me? Put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why don't you? 
GENERAL MILLER Listen, Tucker, you may be some scary poodlefucker back in London, but here? You know what you look like? A fucking squeezed dick. You got a blue vein running all the way up to your temple there. That's where I'd put the fucking bullet. But I'd stand well back. You look like you'd be a squirter. 
MALCOLM Have you ever even killed anybody? Really? 
GENERAL MILLER Yep. 
MALCOLM Falling asleep on someone doesn't count. 
GENERAL MILLER (closer) I've done my share. How many you kill, pussy drip? 
MALCOLM Personally, I prefer maiming. 
GENERAL MILLER Go on, tough guy, take a swing at me. I'll smack you so fucking hard you'll be shitting teeth. 
MALCOLM Go ahead. I can see the headlines now. 'Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In UN, Swiss Intervene'. I don't know, I'm no expert on spin but could that hurt your career?

They eyeball each other. Is Miller going to hit him? He doesn't. 
MALCOLM (CONT'D) Right. Do excuse me. I've got work to do. Oh, and don't EVER call me fucking English again. 
101   INT. UN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                              101 
Sir Jonathan walks in. A lot of faces are turned towards him, expectantly. 
SIR JONATHAN Hello everyone. I was wondering if I might suggest a cheeky early vote? Bit of an adventure. Maybe, we could knock off early, go for a drink? Ha. I'm kidding. Or am I? No, I am. 
102   INT. KAREN CLARK'S UN OFFICE - DAY                         102 
Karen and Miller are looking at a computer screen, presumably reading about Simon's floated resignation. 
KAREN (looking at computer) There it is. Simon's going. Everyone's saying he's going. 
Simon passes their open door. 
GENERAL MILLER (spotting Simon) Simon! There he is! Simon. (re internet) This is great shit. I wasn't sure you had the nerve. You're resigning? 
SIMON Ah okay. They're not running with that? I have not said that. 
GENERAL MILLER You're not resigning? 
KAREN You're still playing the hawk? 
SIMON It's much subtler than that. It's nuanced. I'm playing a much cleverer game than that. I'm a (whispering) fake hawk. Page 100 
102   CON TINUE D:                                                102 
GENERAL MILLER I'm sorry? 
SIMON (whispering) Fake hawk. 
GENERAL MILLER You're a fake hawk? You're a fucking idiot. You're not a fake idiot are you. 
Karen and Miller go into a confab. 
Michael and Suzy are sitting talking in an FO office. 
Jamie bursts in. 
JAMIE Was it you? MICHAEL Sorry? 
JAMIE Not you. I know it wasn't you, you're too fucking horny for your Knighthood. (TO SUZY) Was it you? 
SUZY Was what me? 
JAMIE Was it fucking you!? Answer the question! MICHAEL She can't very well answer the question if you don't tell her what it is, can she? 
JAMIE Fuck off to your room, Count of Cunty Cristo, this is between me and her. (to Suzy) You leaked Liza Weld's paper to the BBC. Tell me you leaked it. 
SUZY I didn't leak anything. I don't know what you're talking about. 
JAMIE You're lying. You touched your nose. That's what's called a `tell'. You are lying.

105   CON TINUE D:                                                105 
SUZY No I'm not. 
JAMIE `No I'm not.' That's a tell as well. Classic. (changing tack to terror) I know the leak came from here, from this fucking fax machine here. 
He pushes a fax casually off the table onto the floor. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) This is what I'm doing to the machine. (he kicks it, hard till bits start to break off, but he's still quite controlled talking, as he kicks more) You see? This is how angry I am with the piece of office equipment which leaked this document, so can you imagine how angry I am with the person who did it? Yeah? Can you Suzy? 
He kicks the fax machine again. 
MICHAEL It was me. 
JAMIE Oh fuck off. Don't come over all Spartacus now. 
MICHAEL I leaked it. JAMIE What? 
Advances on Michael, becomes aware of the music. Jamie points to the CD player. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) Okay for a start turn that fucking row off. It's just fucking vowels. Listen to it. Just subsidised fucking foreign vowels. You only listen to that shit because it's bad form to actually wear a big hat that says "I went to private school". 
Michael doesn't turn it off, so Jamie does. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) Who did you leak it to? 
Page 105 
105   CON TINUE D: (2)                                         105 
MICHAEL I just sent it. I thought it was important so I sent it through. 
JAMIE (considers then, ) Ok. See this fax machine?(kick) That's your career. I'm pretty sure it's fucked. Let me just check (kick). Yeah, it is. Plus, breach of Official Secrets, so that's fucking swannee. Maybe you can get a part time job in West End as a gentleman's fluffer. Or whatever the fuck they call it these days. 
Jamie is heading off. 
MICHAEL Well, you know -- better to go out with a bang... JAMIE No, no. I will not allow this to be a bang. This will be a whimper, a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being fucked by a big metal puppy-fucking machine. And they do exist, `cos my gran's got one. 
Jamie leaves. 
106   INT. UN MEDITATION ROOM - DAY                                106 
Malcolm and Linton enter. We see Simon's mints lying on the big stone in the middle of the room. 
LINTON So we're down to the wire here, Mr Miracle Worker, what have you got for me? What intel have you rustled us up? 
MALCOLM Honestly? I haven't got it. We need more time. 
LINTON You haven't got it? Can you delay the vote to give you time to get it? 
MALCOLM No. I've had the vote brought forward. 
Simon comes in to retrieve his mints. 
SIMON Just getting my mints. Page 106 
106   CON TINUE D:                                                106 
LINTON I am telling you to delay the vote and get me some new intel. Now. 
MALCOLM Okay, quick reality check, J Edgar Fucking Hoover. I don't work for you. You don't tell me what to fucking do. 
LINTON Well firstly, don't raise your voice. This is a sacred space. You may not believe that, I may not believe that, but by God it's a useful hypocrisy. And secondarily you do work for me. Your prime minister instructed you to work for me. 
Malcolm glances at Simon. MALCOLM Get your Polos and fuck off. 
Simon stays where he is. Linton starts laughing. Toby enters, watches in amazement. 
LINTON The great Malcolm Tucker. One of your guys has leaked a paper, you can't do anything. We tell you to get intel, you can't do anything. I need the vote put back - you can't do anything. You, sir, are a useless piece of `S' star star `T'. 
A beat. MALCOLM (quietly, to Toby) What do you want? 
TOBY "That's that then"? That's your quote for the ages is it?

The mood is quietly buzzy. Job well done. Liza is there too. 
LINTON We did it Bob! BOB ADRIANO Yes sir! There were moments when it was a little hairy ... 
LINTON No there weren't, no. 
They shake hands with various colleagues.

A TV shows BBC News 24's report on the vote. Jamie is stroking Michael's hair in a sweet and therefore very very scary way. Michael's staring ahead pretending it isn't happening. 
JAMIE (sweetly) Well done Michael. You did a good job. You did a really, really good job. 
INT. UN OFFICE - DAY Karen enters. Chad is there too with General Miller. 
KAREN So, I emailed my resignation ten minutes ago. (to Miller) Yours should come right after the President's announcement, to have the biggest media impact.

GENERAL MILLER I've been thinking Karen. This has been the hardest fucking decision of my political life. I'm not resigning. 
KAREN What the fuck George. Seriously? You said that the war was intolerable and we'd go together. 
GENERAL MILLER It is - it is intolerable. I still agree with myself about that. But I've got to tolerate it. My loyalty is with the kids. At the end of the day I'm a soldier. 
KAREN You're not a soldier. 
GENERAL MILLER Look at the uniform, Karen. I'm not a pastry chef. I have military commendations on my chest, not a little fucking label saying My Name Is George. 
KAREN You're a politician. You live on canapes and white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and you scour the national papers for mentions of your name. You're a fucking politician. 
GENERAL MILLER I'm still a soldier. KAREN When was the last time you shot a guy? 
GENERAL MILLER What, if I haven't shot a guy in 15 years then I'm not a soldier? City hall don't insist I bring along a fucking bullet- ridden corpse every five years to renew my soldier licence. 
KAREN You know this is an unnecessary war. It's a war you don't believe in. Show me some balls, George. 
GENERAL MILLER I know I've got balls, I don't need to show them to you.

KAREN Oh sure, It just so happens they're sitting pretty in a pair of Egyptian cotton Ralph Lauren shorts on a Government salary. 
GENERAL MILLER Don't talk about my fucking balls that way. My balls have been around. My balls have got balls. 
KAREN Come on Chad, let's leave the General and his over-stuffed scrotum. We're going to draft our resignation announcements. 
Karen turns away from him. 
CHAD Er, I might, stay with the General actually Karen, if that's okay? If he's staying I might stay with him and see what assistance I can furnish. 
KAREN Okay. General Shrek and his faithful talking donkey. 
She goes. 
GENERAL MILLER This takes balls Karen. 
CHAD You've got balls Sir. Anyone can see you've got big balls. They're two-thirds of a snowman. 
GENERAL MILLER Get the fuck away from me. 
Miller walks off. 
CHAD Okay. This was not the plan.

SHAME 
Written by 
Steve McQueen & Abi Morgan 
INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. DAWN. 
BRANDON SULLIVAN [early 30's] lies staring up caught in a disarray of sheets until- 
The PEEP PEEP PEEP of an alarm clock, from deep within a distant apartment. 
The MUFFLED PAD of FOOTSTEPS crossing overhead- 
BRANDON listens then gets up, pulls blinds and heads out towards the bathroom- 
The SOUND of his feet disappearing down a distant corridor. 
The MURMUR of an answer phone as we hear BRANDON peeing, in a far off bathroom. 
2   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                    2 
BRANDON stands, looking down, watching until- 
A SUDDEN breeze, the subway train oncoming- 
BRANDON boards. 
The doors GLIDE SHUT- 
BRANDON just visible through the window of the train, walking towards a distant seat. 
3   INT. TRAIN. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                    3 
BRANDON   sits, eyes casually tracing over the faces in the crowded   train. A HOMELESS MAN sits, further along the car, haggard   and grey, and sleeping, the seat empty, either side of him.   He looks more like a pile of clothes. 
BRANDON turns back. The reflection of an PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL caught in the glass opposite. 
4   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                                 4 
BRANDON padding naked along a corridor. He flicks on an answer machine in passing- 
FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE Hey...It's me?...Pick Up.. Pick Up... 
He enters the bathroom. 
5   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                               5 
We hear BRANDON peeing in the bathroom. 
6   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                               6 
The answer machine message drowned by the flushing of the toilet, the shutting of the door and the shower being switched on. 
7   INT. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                         7 
A HOMELESS MAN head lolling, sat alone at the end of a busy car. 
BRANDON considers, catching the eye of- 
A PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL seated opposite, the whisper of a smile, grazing her lips. 
BRANDON's eyes teasing over- 
The fall of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's hair- 
The dip in her collarbone- 
Her nail polish with French manicure- 
BRANDON looks at her. She looks away. 
BRANDON resumes staring. She looks back through the bodies of commuters. We see their eyes looking at each other. Their seduction continues through the collage of colors and bodies. 
8   INT. OFFICE - BOARDROOM. DAY.                                 8 
BRANDON, sits in a packed meeting room, a pitch just audible, DAVID FISHER, [early/ late 40's] BRANDON's boss, a kind of white noise, and yet- 
DAVID (O.S.) I find you disgusting..I find you inconsolable..I find you invasive.. 
FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) Brandon? 
BRANDON crosses the hall and enters the toilet. 
FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) Brandon? 
BRANDON turns on the light, puts down his glass and urinates. 
FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) (whispers) Brandon Where are you?- Brandon? Brandon? (louder) Brandon... Urghhh! 
BRANDON finishes, flushes toilet, steps off screen 
FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) This is me Calling you.. (SIGHS) Fuck! 
DEAD TONE 
The CALLER hangs up 
BRANDON re-appears and closes the bathroom door 
12   INT. BATHROOM. APARTMENT. DAWN.                           12 
BRANDON in the shower, a sense of movement, his hand, barely visible, moving back and forth. 
The fall of the shower- 
BRANDON stands, letting the water wash over him. 
13   INT. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                        13 
BRANDON sits, looking over at the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL sitting opposite- 
The train moves on, after a while stopping at another platform. 
PEOPLE get on, PEOPLE get off. 
BRANDON's eyes travel down over the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's legs and up- 
She opens them a little, the dip of her skirt, sinking deep between her thighs- 
She looks up, senses BRANDON watching. She lets her fingers fall in her lap. 
BRANDON shifts a little in his seat to get a better look through the crowd. Suddenly she stands and makes her way to the train door. Hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole for stability, revealing a wedding ring. 
BRANDON's hand reaches for the pole too, touching her as he stands behind her. There is a gentle unison contact. BRANDON's breath, heavy on her neck. Both are frozen to the spot, caught in a mutual moment. 
14   INT. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                        14 
The train door bolts open and the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL disembarks. BRANDON is blocked by a MALE PASSENGER as he gets out in quick pursuit of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL. 
BRANDON is several paces behind now, pursues. She turns left into a stairwell. 
It's almost like fighting a downward river. People are walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL. 
The tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs. A moment later, BRANDON reaches the summit, to be greeted by a wrought-iron gate. 
He looks left at one staircase. People ascend. 
He looks right at another staircase. Other passengers ascend. 
People come in and out of the turnstiles on the right-hand side. He has lost her. A sudden moment of disappointment crosses his face. 
He descends the staircase, dejected. 
15   INT. OFFICE. DAY.                                            15 
BRANDON walks into his office and to his desk, stops in his tracks, heart thumping- 
A bare space where BRANDON's computer once was and next to it a replacement computer. A pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck to the screen. 
16   INT. CUBICLE. MEN'S TOILETS. OFFICE. DAY.                    16 
BRANDON walks into a toilet cubicle, shuts and locks the door. He cleans the seat with toilet paper, flushes, stands, and starts to masturbate. 
17   INT. OFFICE - DAVID'S OFFICE. DAY.                           17 
A TAP on the door- 
BRANDON enters DAVID's office, DAVID is lost in paperwork, looking up from his desk. 
CUTE NEIGHBOR (in greeting) Hey. 
BRANDON (nods) Hey. 
BRANDON juggling cellphone, keys and satchel, heading off to work, watching the sway of her ass. 
24   INT. OFFICE - BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                       24 
MARIANNE is on the phone in a busy office 
25   INT. HOTEL ROOM. BRANDON'S FANTASY.                        25 
Profile of MARIANNE's bare back. 
26   INT. OFFICE - BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                       26 
BRANDON, seemingly in a trance, looking out across the office, eyes fixed on MARIANNE in her glass cubicle, unaware of BRANDON staring. 
STEVEN's reflection in the window, we see him screw up a piece of paper and throw it at BRANDON. 
BRANDON shakes his head. 
BRANDON You're such a dick 
STEVEN (O.S.) What are you doing, man? 
BRANDON once again looks up toward MARIANNE. 
27   INT. OFFICE. DAY.                                           27 
MARIANNE on the phone. 
DAVID now appears in front of BRANDON. From afar, nods to him, and greets a group of CLIENTS. 
DAVID (WHISTLES) Alright, gentlemen, If you'll just please make yourselves at home. 
CLIENT Thank you. 
28   INT. OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY.                         28 
Just visible, in the conference room- 
BRANDON inside with the CLIENTS and DAVID. A sense of camaraderie. The meeting at an end. DAVID, slapping BRANDON on the back, the sense of celebration. 
DAVID (O.S.) It falls upon me, as your beloved boss, to propose a toast. To Success. 
29   INT. AFTER WORK BAR. NIGHT.                                 29 
The thump of music- 
BRANDON, DAVID and OTHERS wedged in a leather booth, several shots and beer down, the table littered with beers. Cheers. Male camaraderie. 
DAVID I hope my wife appreciates it. 
ALL chink glasses 
DAVID (CONT'D) Get a new tie, please. 
COLLEAGUES (snigger) 
DAVID Oh my goodness. (SNIFFS) I love women in suits. I love women in suits. 
ALL Look off-screen at the women. 
DAVID (CONT'D) We could talk business, I would rearrange my life.. Wow, she's beautiful. 
BRANDON Grey suit? 
DAVID I'm gonna go talk to her. 
BRANDON You should go talk to her. 
DAVID OK...OK..Count me down... 
BRANDON Yeah you should 
BRANDON fist bumps with DAVID 
BRANDON (CONT'D) 
BRANDON (Laughs) 
RACHEL and LOREN walk off to the dance floor 
LOREN Dance? 
BRANDON No. 
LOREN Are you sure? 
BRANDON I'm sure. 
LOREN (O.S.) OK. 
ELIZABETH and DAVID are amongst the dancers on the floor. DAVID is performing enthusiastically. ELIZABETH, slow, glances at BRANDON. 
We see BRANDON through the dancers, watching. 
32   EXT. AFTER WORK BAR. NIGHT.                                 32 
DAVID struggling to push his arm through the twisted sleeve of his jacket, pursuing ELIZABETH and her friends up the street. 
DAVID Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. Hold on, hold on. No, listen. I just got to talk to you one more time, one more time. Listen.. 
BRANDON comes out of the club, doing up his coat. Looks away at DAVID haranguing the trio. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Your eyes, they're beautiful. You know why I didn't get it right the first time? Because it's, it's like a collage. Let me see your hand, let me see your hand.. 
DAVID smiles, gently coaxing her in the opposite direction- 
BRANDON hails a cab. DAVID continues haranguing ELIZABETH 
DAVID (CONT'D) Look at those eyes, look at those eyes. I know the color of your eyes. 
BRANDON (OVER) David, come on. 
DAVID Come on, we can play that game. That's so much fun when you play that game. 
LOREN Bye. 
A cab pulls up. 
DAVID It's okay. `cos I'm going this way. 
BRANDON opens the cab door and waits with the taxi. DAVID walks towards BRANDON. 
BRANDON Hey man, he's going uptown. 
DAVID concedes throwing his arms up, jacket half on. DAVID paws BRANDON affectionately, straightens BRANDON's jacket, gives him a kiss and stumbles into the cab. 
DAVID (Laughs) Ok. 
BRANDON I'll see you tomorrow 
The cab pulls away. 
33   EXT. STREET. NEAR AFTER WORK BAR. NIGHT.                     33 
A car glides close to the kerb- 
BRANDON head down walking- 
ELIZABETH Hey. Wanna ride? 
BRANDON smiles- 
BRANDON Sure. 
BRANDON gets into the car. 
34   EXT. FREEWAY. BRIDGE. NIGHT.                                 34 
The incessant drone of cars, steady overhead- 
Vast concrete supports edging the highway- 
BRANDON presses ELIZABETH flat again the grit of the wall 
Caught in the scissored half light, they move, with glorious abandon- 
BRANDON shakes his head, at a loss. 
BRANDON Shampoo 
SISSY (OVER) Is it for grooming dogs? 
SISSY throws the towel and BRANDON 
SISSY (CONT'D) Good to see you. 
BRANDON throws the towel back at her. 
BRANDON Lock the door next time. 
SISSY Yeah. 
BRANDON turns to leave the room 
BRANDON Don't use all the towels 
SISSY I won't. 
BRANDON closes the door to the bathroom. 
39   INT. LIVING ROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       39 
We follow BRANDON as he walks through to the living room to the record player I Feel Love stuck in eternal groove. He gently lifts the needle off the record. He uses the baseball bat to pick up SISSY's scarf. He sniffs it. 
Silence- 
BRANDON stands considers- 
40   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           40 
Later - 
BRANDON is watching pornography on his laptop, hears SISSY on the telephone. He listens. 
SISSY ..I want you. I don't want anyone else. There is no one else. I love you. I'll do anything. 
Pause 
SISSY (CONT'D) I'll do anything. Please don't say that. Please don't say that. 
Pause 
SISSY (CONT'D) I love you. I love you. I'll do anything. I'll do anything. 
BRANDON moves the laptop and starts to get up. 
41   INT. LIVING ROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       41 
SISSY I don't have to go out. I don't have to go out. I don't even fucking want to go out. I can stay with you. I don't care. I don't care. I don't need anybody else. I love you. I love you. I love you so much (CRIES) I love you, please. I love you. I love you. 
42   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           42 
BRANDON is listening at the door. 
SISSY Please (CRIES) I feel sick. I feel really sick- 
BRANDON closes his eyes, resigned. 
43   INT. KITCHEN. APARTMENT. MORNING.                         43 
BRANDON sliding whisked eggs into a pan of sizzling butter- 
SISSY enters and sits on the kitchen counter, wearing a long- sleeved white t-shirt and holding the earring left by the Pretty Woman [prostitute]. Dangling it in front of BRANDON- 
SISSY Morning. Nice earring. Hot date? 
Hiding his surprise, BRANDON gets some juice out of the fridge, passes it to SISSY. 
BRANDON Juice? 
BRANDON gives SISSY a carton of juice. Still sitting on the counter, SISSY grabs it with both hands, almost like a child's bottle and starts drinking. 
SISSY Mmm. 
BRANDON, irritated, says abruptly- 
SISSY sprinkles salt on her breakfast. She smile, playful, resumes eating- 
SISSY (CONT'D) (Reacting to food) Mmm. Mmmm! (SHOUTS) So good.! 
The door slams. SISSY sighs and stares towards the front door, a sadness hanging- 
44   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. MORNING.                              44 
SISSY stands, toes edging over the platform.   BRANDON pulls her back. 
BRANDON Stop fucking around. 
SISSY stares at BRANDON. Instinctively, BRANDON feels her gaze. He turns and looks. They hold each other's eyes for more than a beat. BRANDON turns away. SISSY begins picking pieces of fluff off BRANDON's shoulder. BRANDON, visually irritated. 
SISSY goes again. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Leave it. 
SISSY You have fluff. 
BRANDON I like it there. 
A quick moment passes. BRANDON picks the fluff off his shoulder and puts it on SISSY's shoulder - to her amusement. 
SISSY (LAUGHS) 
BRANDON How are you for money? 
SISSY I'm good. 
BRANDON Cause if you need some money. 
SISSY Honestly, I even make money now and everything. 
BRANDON Yeah, sure. 
SISSY Huge amounts. 
BRANDON nods at SISSY's hat. 
BRANDON Are you collecting mad hats? 
Sissy smiles- 
SISSY (LAUGHS) You should come and hear me. 
BRANDON Yeah. I will. 
SISSY `Yeah I will', like, `yeah I will' like last time? Please come. 
BRANDON takes off her hat. 
BRANDON Where'd you get this, anyway. 
SISSY It's vintage. 
BRANDON Yeah, I can see that. 
SISSY (LAUGHS) 
SISSY takes the hat and puts it on BRANDON. 
SISSY (CONT'D) Wow. 
BRANDON (WHISPERS) Do you like? 
BRANDON adjusts the hat. 
SISSY Yeah. 
SISSY gently bumps his shoulder with hers. 
SISSY (CONT'D) Please come. 
BRANDON Ok. I will. 
SISSY stamps her feet excitedly. 
SISSY Yaay! 
SISSY (CONT'D) (singing) Are melting away... 
Fingers touching the keys once more, masterfully picking up and improvising with the last few bars- 
SISSY (CONT'D) (singing) I'm gonna make a brand new start of it - in old New York.. 
SISSY leans back. She is on fire now, singing with every fibre of her heart and soul, like no other rendition heard. 
SISSY (CONT'D) (singing) And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere It's up to you- 
SISSY holds BRANDON with a voice, a sudden flickering emotion threatening to topple her, somehow in SISSY's hands this song is heartbreaking... 
SISSY (CONT'D) (singing) New   york New york (quieter now) New   York..New York.. (even quieter) New   york New york (almost to a whisper) New   york New york. 
SISSY strikes one last note, lost deep within herself- 
HUSHED SILENCE- 
DAVID Wow. Wow! Bravo! 
Sudden APPLAUSE, CHEERS, OVERWHELMING- 
DAVID turns to BRANDON 
DAVID (CONT'D) (LAUGHS) She's good! She's good! 
BRANDON looks away, eyes filling with tears. 
BRANDON puts down his drink, blotting his coaster with the imprint of the deep red rim of his glass- 
He's the only one not applauding. 
50   INT. BOOM BOOM ROOM. NIGHT.                                  50 
SISSY is being congratulated by a HIP MEDIA TYPE and his WIFE. The scene is one of congratulations, SISSY is admired. 
SISSY confident approaches DAVID and BRANDON. She is bold and self-aware. 
DAVID Hi. 
SISSY Hi. 
DAVID I'm David. 
SISSY Sissy. 
DAVI It's a pleasure to meet you. 
SISSY Nice to meet you. 
DAVID (OVER) I think you were fantastic and you look great in the dress, too. Please sit down. 
SISSY Thank you. (TO BRANDON) What did you think? 
BRANDON Yeah, it was... interesting. 
SISSY (LAUGHS) What do you mean? 
BRANDON Er.. No, it was, er.. It was good. It was good. 
DAVID finishes his martini. 
SISSY It was good? 
DAVID He was crying. He was crying. THere were tears coming down his face. I saw it. You made a grown-man cry. 
SISSY Really? 
DAVID Hm-hmm. 
BRANDON I'm gonna get some more drinks. 
DAVID That's a great idea. Why don't you get a round for the table, buddy? 
SISSY (OVER) Yeah. 
Brandon exits. 
DAVID OK, I'm really sorry about that, I.. He's had a rough day at work. I think he's a bit emotional right now. 
DAVID (CONT'D) We're going to get you a golf cart. We're gonna get you a gold cart and you will drive the golf cart around. 
SISSY (OVER) Wow, now we're talking. I would..yeah. 
DAVID (OVER) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SISSY Everybody should drive golf carts. 
DAVID (OVER) A golf cart right up Fifth Avenue, huh? (LAUGHS) 
SISSY sips her drink. 
SISSY (LAUGHS) Mmm. 
DAVID You know, they should They should. It would be a lot cleaner and greener. It would be great for the city. Brandon, what do you think? 
BRANDON Sounds great. 
DAVID Yeah? 
DAVID looks at BRANDON. BRANDON looks like he would rather be anywhere than where he is now. 
DAVID (CONT'D) (laughs) I love your, brother. What an amazing man. How long are you here for? 
SISSY I don't know. 
DAVID You don't know? Can I see you again? Please? 
Sissy laughs. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Is that too forward? I just.. I find you fascinating, I really do. I think you're a fascinating creature, I'd love to see you again. (beat) Listen, why don't we.. this is a celebration, let's have champagne. 
SISSY Yes! 
DAVID Champagne for everybody. For the whole table. Come on! 
SISSY (OVER) Champagne! 
BRANDON looks unenthusiastic 
BRANDON Champagne. 
51   INT. CAB (CROWN VIC STYLE). NIGHT.                         51 
BRANDON wedged in the back of the cab, with DAVID and SISSY as they are lost eating one another's faces. 
Looking uncomfortable, BRANDON frequently takes glimpses in the rear view mirror. 
DAVID and SISSY continue making out. It's almost animal. 
52   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                     52 
A dimly lit street- 
A cab is pulling up. DAVID opens the door. 
DAVID I've got it, I've got it. Get out, get out, get out, get out. 
DAVID is wearing SISSY's hat. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Come here, come here, come here, come here. 
Finally SISSY steps out of the cab, DAVID lifts her over his shoulder. 
SISSY (YELPS) Oh, God! No! (LAUGHS) 
DAVID (STRAINS) Come on, come on with me, come on... 
SISSY Get off. Get off. Get off. 
DAVID (OVER) You wanted me to do that. How did that work? 
SISSY Get off me. 
SISSY starts to enter thru the revolving door. DAVID follows 
DAVID Ah come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... 
BRANDON is left alone to pay the driver. 
A lone condom disregarded on the floor. 
We see his bedside drawer ajar. 
He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut. 
59   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             59 
Later - 
BRANDON lies on his bed, with clean white sheets, sidelight on. 
SISSY enters. BRANDON opens his eyes, inwardly flinches. 
SISSY gets into the bed, covering herself with the white sheet. Snuggles up to BRANDON 
BRANDON I have to be up and out by seven. 
SISSY inhales through her teeth. 
SISSY (to herself) It's cold. 
Uncomfortable SILENCE- 
BRANDON Sissy, get out of my room? 
SISSY doesn't move. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Sissy, get out of my room. 
All this time, BRANDON has not looked at SISSY, staring up to the blank ceiling. He SCREAMS at the top of his lungs- 
BRANDON (CONT'D) GET THE FUCK OUT! GET OUT! 
SISSY gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and slowly walks around the bed. 
SISSY SLAMS the bedroom door on her exit. 
60   INT. OFFICE. DAY.                                            60 
Midday- 
The office is in full flow- 
BRANDON crosses it, clearly worse for wear. 
A TECHNICIAN wheels a computer out of BRANDON's office. 
STEVEN (in passing) Hey slacker, your computer's back. 
BRANDON heads towards his desk, stopping on seeing- 
STEVEN (CONT'D) Dave's looking for you. 
STEVEN exits again. 
BRANDON observes, his computer is back at his desk. 
61   INT. OFFICE - DAVID'S OFFICE. DAY.                           61 
BRANDON puts his head around the- 
DAVID (O.S.) (INTO PHONE) Yeah, yeah. It was really great last night. 
SKYPE SON (OVER) (THRU COMPUTER) Daddy, daddy. 
DAVID (O.S.) (INTO PHONE) Ah, listen, I gotta go. OK, thanks for calling. 
DAVID (O.S.) (CONT'D) (INTO COMPUTER) Hey, buddy. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Er, listen, we said an hour French and then Isobel's gonna pick you up because Mommy's picking up Nathan. Alright? You can go after. 
SKYPE SON Yeah, I know. But Mommy says I can't 
DAVID (OVER) OK, well. Let's go talk to Mommy hmm..? 
SKYPE SON Aw.. She's all the way downstairs. 
DAVID (OVER) Well, go downstairs and tell her that Daddy said it's okay for you to go to Jason's 
62   INT. COFFEE AREA - OFFICE. DAY.                             62 
BRANDON, lost in familiar routine, pours sugar into his coffee- 
MARIANNE Hey- 
BRANDON looks up, MARIANNE loiters- 
BRANDON Hey. 
MARIANNE You like your sugar. 
BRANDON (nods/ smiles) I do. 
MARIANNE is still standing, waiting. They look at each other. Eventually she turns and walks out. 
63   EXT. PIER. HUDSON RIVER. NIGHT.                              63 
BRANDON stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward the Hudson River, the LAP of murky water, audible. He hovers for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back to the main road. 
The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond. 
64   EXT. NEAR STANDARD HOTEL. NIGHT.                             64 
Above, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny still lives. 
BRANDON comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans. Above him, engraved in stone is "1949." He looks up toward the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin building. Stark and authoritative. 
A KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor window, a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away. 
A WOMAN, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans and t-shirt, paces along the window. Catching sight of BRANDON, she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass. 
A MAN stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up. 
A FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy duster. 
And then BRANDON sees her- 
A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands, naked her body pressed against the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson River. The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up fuck. 
BRANDON hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDON's eyes lock with the MIDDLE AGED WOMAN's dead gaze, standing high above- 
A CAR HORN LOUD UNREMITTING- 
BRANDON turns, his hypnotism broken. It's as if he comes back to himself. 
65   EXT. STREET. NEAR RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                         65 
A distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street- 
MARIANNE waiting inside the bar, seated, with a drink, clearly there for some time. Her eyes checking the room, with quiet concern. 
BRANDON stands watching from a distance- 
BRANDON makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter until- 
66   INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                                      66 
BRANDON enters the restaurant. 
BRANDON Hi. 
MARIANNE Hello- 
BRANDON Hello. (LAUGHS) 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Did you find it okay? 
MARIANNE Yes, I'm glad you made it. 
BRANDON Oh, yeah. I'm late. Sorry. 
BRANDON sits down at the table where MARIANNE is already seated. 
MARIANNE You look handsome. 
BRANDON You look amazing. 
A WAITER enters. 
BRANDON Er.. I have a sister. 
MARIANNE I have two. 
BRANDON Oh, yeah? 
MARIANNE Yeah. 
BRANDON Older, younger? 
MARIANNE Older and younger. I'm in the middle. 
BRANDON stares at MARIANNE 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) What? 
BRANDON Just wondering. 
MARIANNE (LAUGHS) are you nervous? 
BRANDON Why would I be nervous? 
MARIANNE smiles, holds his look. 
MARIANNE You look a little nervous. 
BRANDON Do I? No. 
MARIANNE Well, what's a date? 
BRANDON shrugs- 
BRANDON It's no big deal. 
MARIANNE It took me an hour to figure out what to wear. 
BRANDON You chose wisely. 
MARIANNE shrugs, smiles- 
BRANDON laughs- 
The WAITER returns- 
WAITER I forgot to say the crab comes in the shell. 
BRANDON Great. 
The WAITER pauses, expectantly. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Oh. Yeah... I haven't even looked at this. 
MARIANNE Erm, I'll have the lamb. 
The WAITER scrawls it down on a pad, barely looking up. 
WAITER The Lamb. 
BRANDON I'll have the Lamb too. That sounds great. 
MARIANNE (LAUGHS) 
WAITER Erm, No appetizer? 
BRANDON (looking to MARIANNE) You want-? 
MARIANNE shrugs, closes her menu. 
MARIANNE I'm fine. 
BRANDON No. 
WAITER OK, and how would you like the lamb? 
BRANDON Medium. 
WAITER We recommend it pretty pink. 
The WAITER waits- 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) OK. Well, this is me. 
BRANDON nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet- 
BRANDON This is you. 
They stand heady from the wine and a little awkward. 
MARIANNE Thank you very much Brandon. 
BRANDON Thank you very much MARIANNE. We should do this again. 
SILENCE 
They loiter on the edge of something more. 
MARIANNE Right. 
SILENCE 
BRANDON hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of uncertainty. MARIANNE descends into the depths of the subway, with a half wave. 
BRANDON So, is that a yes? 
MARIANNE (O.S.) Maybe, yeah. 
69   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             69 
The CLICK of the door- 
BRANDON enters. The sound of the record player, which had finished hours ago, rotates empty on the turntable. 
Pulling off his jacket- 
BRANDON Hello? Sissy? 
SILENCE- 
BRANDON puts the needle back in it's dock. HE hangs up his jacket, takes his bag, heads towards the living room. He spies all SISSY's crap spilling out across the floor- 
He sighs. 
Heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge. 
70   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             70 
The lock of the front door rotates. Someone is entering the apartment. 
Darkness- 
SISSY bursts through the door, in a hurry. 
After a moment the bathroom door opens, cutting a slit of light into the darkness. 
From the blackness we see BRANDON framed, masturbating in front of the bathroom sink. 
SISSY, shocked, stands with her hand still on the door handle, transfixed by a naked BRANDON. 
As BRANDON instinctively turns, SISSY runs from view. 
SISSY slams the door shut. 
BRANDON (O.S.) Oh! Fuck! 
SISSY (SNIGGERS) Fuck! 
BRANDON looks at himself in the mirror, full of shame and bewilderment and deep embarrassment. 
Slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage. He hits the wall in frustration. 
SISSY (CONT'D) Fuck! 
71   INT. LIVING ROOM CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                71 
BRANDON opens the bathroom door, with towel tied around his waist, looking for SISSY. 
BRANDON What? Are you fucking spying on me? 
SISSY (LAUGHS) Lock the fucking door, Brandon. 
SISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued- 
Suddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a woman legs splayed- 
FROM SCREEN Hey, where's Brandon? Are you Brandon's girlfriend? Do you want to play? 
SISSY looks closer, mildly appalled. 
FROM SCREEN (CONT'D) Do you wanna play with my tits? I know Brandon would really like it.. And I know exactly what Brandon likes. 
BRANDON picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom. 
SISSY takes her coat and leaves the apartment. 
74   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                              74 
LATER- 
The thump of music- 
BRANDON sitting on the edge of his bed, the pumping music from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder, hands grasping his hair. Then suddenly he enters the whole contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag. 
Then, BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment, a black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone numbers on the back. 
BRANDON moves on, picking up anything he can find. An old jacket, elbows worn. A handful of old t-shirts. 
He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing more crap along the way, one of SISSY's dirty thongs on the floor. He picks it up, moving on. 
75   INT. KITCHEN. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                              75 
An open fridge- 
BRANDON tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by date mush into the bag. 
Cans of Red Bull, crappy cereals, jam with mould on top, an old joint, magazines all get dumped on route. 
BRANDON heads out, picking up more detritus along the way, old pens, an old cellphone, a pair of defunked headphones- 
A pile of porn mags, in a cupboard, pulled out as he heads down along the corridor. 
76   INT. LIVING ROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                          76 
BRANDON strips the room, pulling out an old pair of sneakers smelling and cracked from under a chair. He peers up, looks around the room almost bare- 
His laptop resting on his desk. BRANDON stops, considers, initially resistant and then something finally compels him to do it- 
He picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall. Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff. Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the heaving bag of crap out into the corridor. 
The SLAM of the front door- 
77   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       77 
BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up along the street in waiting for collection. 
Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk. 
A SIREN goes past- 
The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS. 
BRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door firmly. 
78   INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                                  78 
BRANDON, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into MARIANNE's office. He studies her, almost like prey. The moment seems to last a lifetime. There is much want in BRANDON's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable. 
Suddenly, and without any warning, BRANDON walks into his dream, entering MARIANNE's office, and pulls her behind a partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately. 
She responds, startled, but happy to be taken. She surrenders. 
They pull away, looking at one another. She smiles, laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on. 
BRANDON Come on. 
BRANDON leads MARIANNE away. 
79   EXT. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                                  79 
BRANDON and MARIANNE stepping out of a cab, BRANDON leading MARIANNE, both giggling and tripping. 
The CLICK of the door, MARIANNE gone. 
The HUM of the traffic, audible through an ajar window. 
BRANDON reaches his hand out, catching the breeze, peering down, a man on the edge. 
83   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                           83 
BRANDON banging the life out of HOTEL LOVER, doggy style, tits pressed up against the glass of the window- 
The DISTANT SCREECH of horns. 
84   EXT. STREET. BELOW STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                      84 
The trawl of cars- 
The grey of the Hudson River- 
BRANDON and the HOTEL LOVER just visible high above, caught full frontal in the window- 
85   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                           85 
BRANDON close to climax- 
A cold sweat beading BRANDON's forehead as he comes, face twisted before the slow seep of release. 
BRANDON withdraws, laughs. The HOTEL LOVER laughs as well. 
BRANDON turns, for a moment she is almost beautiful. 
HOTEL LOVER smiles, already pulling on her underwear. BRANDON watches her, pulling on a tiny thong. She looks up, stares at him. 
BRANDON looks away, fighting back the cold flutter of shame. 
BRANDON Can I get you a drink? 
HOTEL LOVER hesitates, smile, shakes her head. 
HOTEL LOVER No. 
BRANDON nods. HOTEL LOVER fingers fastening a cheap nylon bra. 
HOTEL LOVER (CONT'D) Fuck. 
BRANDON Need a hand? 
HOTEL LOVER The hooks odd- 
HOTEL LOVER (CONT'D) (SIGHS) There you go. 
86   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                          86 
BRANDON sits on the bed, now alone, caught in the half light of dusk- 
The rise and fall of a distant lift. 
87   INT. LIVING ROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                         87 
BRANDON is sitting on the couch, watching a cartoon. SISSY enters the apartment, on her cell phone. BRANDON ignores her 
SISSY (O.S.) (into phone) David?.. Pick up. I take it you're at your pottery class. 
SISSY hangs up. 
SISSY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Have you eaten? 
BRANDON No. 
SISSY (O.S.) Are you hungry? 
BRANDON No. 
SISSY Sits down next to BRANDON on the couch. 
SISSY Can you just give me a hug? 
BRANDON puts him arm around her. She snuggles up to him. 
BRANDON He's not gonna screw you again. 
BRANDON I don't want to talk. Try not talking. Try just listening or thinking for a change. 
SISSY Yeah, `cos that's working great for you. You're completely fine. 
BRANDON Well, I've got my own fucking apartment. 
SISSY Oh, whopee-fucking-shit. You have your own apartment, that's amazing. Your job and an apartment, I should be in awe of you. 
BRANDON Well, at least I'm responsible for it. At least I don't depend on people all the time. You know, you're a dependency, you're a parasite. 
SISSY You don't have anybody. You don't have anybody. You have me and your fucking pervert boss. 
BRANDON You slept with that fucking pervert boss. So what does that make you? 
SISSY DOn't talk to me about sex-life Brandon. Not from you. 
BRANDON Whatever. 
BRANDON makes his way to the closet, taking his coat. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) I'm going out. 
SISSY Great. And then you'll just come back and we'll just have this same fucking conversation again. 
BRANDON No, you'll move out. 
SISSY And then I'll never hear from you again? 
BRANDON exits the apartment. 
88   INT.SUBWAY TRAIN. NIGHT                                    88 
BRANDON's reflection in the window as the train travels. 
We see that BRANDON has a nasty cut on his cheek. 
89   INT. BAR. NIGHT.                                           89 
Earlier that night- 
BRANDON sits, drinks alone at the bar- 
An OLDER GUY paws a GAUNT YOUNG WOMAN plying her with drinks, knocking them back much to his delight. 
BRANDON watches, catching the eye of a girl (CARLY) walking towards the bar, her friends playing pool- 
CARLY Hey- 
BRANDON Hey. 
CARLY smiles, as she leans against the bar, her breasts spilling out of her T-shirt. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) (close to) You want to get out of here? 
CARLY giggles- 
BRANDON (CONT'D) I could take you somewhere. 
CARLY looks over at her MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND just visible across the bar talking to a couple of GUYS. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) What? Are you with someone? Does he go down on you? I do..That's what I like to do.. 
CARLY looks at him, sobering and yet- 
BRANDON's hand discreetly reaches down, up and under the girl's skirt, shocking her a little and yet- 
BRANDON (CONT'D) I like the way it feels. I like the way it's just me and it... I wanna taste you. I like to slip my tongue inside you- 
CARLY leans in closer, her lips blotting the edge of a glass overfilled with beer. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) ...just as you come. 
CARLY hesitates, the moment hangs dangerous between them. BRANDON sucks his fingers. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Want me to make you come? 
BRANDON (CONT'D) I can do that. Want me to do that? 
BRANDON strokes her chin- 
The SCREECH of horns- 
BRANDON ignores them, he crosses streets, traffic, darting off the sidewalk into the road, when human, dog or stroller gets in his way until- 
92   EXT. STREET. NIGHT.                                         92 
BRANDON walking past a blur of yellow Neon and glow of shop signs- 
Across the street, a snaking queue of MEN wait in line outside a club. 
He keeps walking, eyes scouring- 
TEENAGERS loiter, in oversized clothes, sunk under caps and hoods. 
93   EXT. STREET NEAR CLUB. NIGHT.                               93 
A lively bar; a couple of HOT GIRLS entering- 
BRANDON considers, goes to enter, barred by BOUNCERS, who point him back along the cue- 
He stands in line- 
Across the street, a THICK SET GUY eyes him. He stands smoking outside a heaving bar. BRANDON looks away- 
A GANG OF GIRLS pass, The BOUNCERS let them in with ease. BRANDON reaches for his iPhone, tries to cover his face with his phone to get into the club- 
BOUNCER Woah! Not tonight, buddy. 
BRANDON ties to get in again. The BOUNCER stops him a second time. 
BOUNCER (CONT'D) I said not tonight. 
The THICK SET GUY over the street, flicks out his cigarette, eyes grazing over BRANDON as he re-enters the heaving bar opposite. 
BRANDON considers, hands sunk deep in his pockets. 
Through the glass a heaving bar. BRANDON considers, on the edge until- 
He suddenly crosses the street, narrowly avoiding a taxi streaking past. 
94   INT. CLUB. NIGHT.                                            94 
Fluorescent light skimming the thick black darkness like a beam on a lighthouse- 
A heaving dance floor of BUTCH BEARS, SKINNY BOYS, and TWIGS, arms raised, dancing to the pulse of music. 
The THICK SET GUY, walks away, waiting for BRANDON to follow. 
BRANDON follows. 
95   INT. CLUB. LABYRINTH. NIGHT.                                 95 
Passing through a low hung door, BRANDON moves along a dark labyrinth of corridors, eyes grazing over- 
Dimly lit crevices, MEN caught briefly in light, lost in fellatio and stand up fucking- 
BRANDON keeps walking, drawn towards a dark doorway- 
96   INT. BACKROOM. CLUB. NIGHT.                                  96 
An endless darkness, punctured with groans from dark cubicles- 
BRANDON hesitates, foot slipping on the moist floor. 
Suddenly a hand reaches out, drawing him into the dark cubicle- 
The THICK SET GUY presses BRANDON up against the wall, kissing him, tongue searching his mouth, rubbing along its roof, hungry and urgent. 
BRANDON pulls away, hands gently yet forcefully pushing the THICK SET GUY down on his knees. 
BRANDON looks beyond- 
A THIN BOY down on his knees sucking a cock through a hole between walls. 
BRANDON stands, legs splayed letting the THICK SET GUY take him in his mouth. He is beautiful. 
The palm of BRANDON's hand pressed against the side of the cubicle. He stands, fucking the THICK SET GUY in the mouth- 
The PULSE of music heaving, the club rocking, punctured by groans and grunts of rough sex from deep within. 
An old New York POST. 
Graffiti on all the car windows. 
They wait. 
Suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way through the carriage that BRANDON's in, with the CONDUCTOR ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end. 
CONDUCTOR (O.S.) Watch your step between cars. 
Passengers asking, "What's going on?" 
BRANDON finally makes his way down with the other passengers to the last carriage. As he steps out, he looks down to his far left and sees a POLICE CAUTION LINE being unraveled, and ENGINEERS and FIREMEN making their way to the far front of the train. 
102   INT. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                          102 
A LARGE BLACK WOMAN, face bowed, sits talking to a POLICE OFFICER giving a statement- 
CONDUCTOR Watch your step. 
Several ENGINEERS stand further down the platform surrounding a TRAUMATISED DRIVER- 
CONDUCTOR Follow, me please. Follow me. 
Two PLATFORM ATTENDANTS talk to POLICE OFFICERS. 
CONDUCTOR (CONT'D) Watch your step. This way. This way. Quickly 
FEMALE CONDUCTOR This way. Nothing to see. Move on. 
CONDUCTOR (O.S.) (OVER) Right this way, please. 
FEMALE CONDUCTOR Move on. This way. 
BRANDON makes his way past the wrought-iron gate with other passengers, going up the stairwell. 
103   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE SUBWAY. DAWN.                          103 
BRANDON climbs the stairs, filing out of the subway, eyes catching on- 
A WOMAN's shoes, like Sissy's earlier at the Boom Boom Room, discarded. BRANDON picks up his pace. 
The intermittent WHIR of sirens- 
BRANDON emerging from the subway, already reaching for his cellphone- 
Beyond the glow of an ambulance- 
BRANDON keeps walking, heading off up the road quietly distracted. He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his ear. 
The PULSE of a distant phone ringing- 
The answer machine kicks in- 
ANSWER MACHINE This is Sissy..leave a message.. Don't if you're an asshole. 
BRANDON flicks it off, slips it back in his pocket. BRANDON picks up his pace. 
He flicks out his phone again. Tries again- 
ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) This is Sissy..leave a me- 
BRANDON is running now, heart beating fast now, breath quickening, a seeping panic threatening to unleash- 
BRANDON Shit! 
SUDDENLY he makes a dash for it, weaving through the sidewalk at pace. 
104   INT. BRANDON'S BUILDING - LOBBY. DAWN.                      104 
His finger repeatedly presses the elevator button as if by doing so will make it arrive quicker. 
105   INT. BRANDON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR. DAWN.                   105 
BRANDON enters into the elevator. The door shuts immediately behind him. 
106   INT. BRANDON'S BUILDING - CORRIDOR. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. DAWN. 
Exiting, BRANDON heads along the faceless corridor, reaching his front door.

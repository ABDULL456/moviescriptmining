CHAPTER 1: Earth 2058 
FADE IN ON: 
EXT.-SPACE 
PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE FRAME, a sphere of red desert and fast rushing crimson clouds. 
A triangular CARGO SHIP descends from the dark of space. 
PILOT (OVER) 
Mars mining base, this is Grissom One, Request final descent vector. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
EXT.-MARS 
A row of giant red mountains and beneath, on the planet's surface, the spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated landing crosshairs alight a landing pad, beckoning the ship. 
CONTROLLER (OVER) 
Roger, Grissom One, this is Mars Mining, You are cleared to land. Hope you got some Partagas in that rust bucket, Sal. 
EXT.-EDGE OF SPACE 
THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere. 
PILOT 
I brought you the most amazing... 
Amazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire. 
EXT.- MARS 
LOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME, BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed. 
INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER 
POV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast. Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash. 
EXT.-CARGO SHIP 
The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull. 
WIDER 
Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship, FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire. 
A BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN. 
INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER 
A lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider. 
The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome, intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST. 
WEST 
Sino-Jordanian Raiders. They're claiming the cargo ship violated their air-space. 
INT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER 
Another pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING towards the assault craft just below West's. 
JEB 
This cold war's heating up. Where did they come from? 
INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER 
WEST 
Hell. And we're going to send them back screaming. 
West activates his targeting computer. 
WEST 
Last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer. 
TARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires. 
EXT.-SPACE 
The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS. 
INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER 
West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent surface of the bubble glass under West's feet. 
WEST 
What's that sound? must be the fat lady warming up. 
EXT.-SPACE 
The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction, heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken. 
INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER 
West doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships heading straight for each other. 
WEST 
That's right. Come on, come on, you wanna play, I wanna play. 
EXT.-SPACE 
The two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd 
INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER 
WEST 
I can hear her. Oh, yes, oh yes. She's gonna sing. 
TARGETING:DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a tactical grid. 
COMPUTER 
Target lock. 
EXT.-SPACE 
Imminent collision. 
INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER 
The hull of the Attack Ship fills his bubble glass. 
WEST 
The lights are dimming. The curtain's coming down. Sing you fat, old bag, sing! 
West hits the firing stud. 
EXT.-DEEP SPACE 
West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead, the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him. 
INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER 
(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the blackness of space and the starfield beyond. 
Major West, your ship is not equipped for rescue. You are not authorized to jeopardize this asset. That is a direct order. Acknowledge! 
West slams a switch, deactivating his radio. 
WEST 
Never liked that station, anyway. 
He BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him. 
EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL 
Jeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below. 
Overhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle. 
INT.-3EB'S FIGHTER 
The canal floor is rushing up fast. 
COMPUTER 
Impact in five seconds. 
INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER 
Don is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below. 
COMPUTER 
Warning. Proximity alert. 
WEST 
Jeb, I'm going to give you a little kiss. Don't take it the wrong way. 
EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL 
West angles his ship directly under Jeb. 
INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER 
The expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship. 
JEB 
Don, abort. Abort. 
INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER 
Jeb's fighter is visible overhead. 
West going up. Don angles the throttle. 
EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL 
Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter, angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust. 
INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER 
JEB (OVER) 
Does this mean we're going steady? 
West pulls his throttle all the way back. 
EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL 
West shoots up and out towards the dark of space. 
WEST (OVER) 
You weren't getting out of buying those beers that easy. 
The rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
WILL ROBINSON (10) hides in a small space, watching the commercial on a jury-rigged, palm-sized computer. He mimics the Naylrator. 
WILL 
Coke. Saving the world for our children. 
(a beat) 
Give me a hi-test break. 
WILL-POV. Spying through the open slats of his biding place into... 
INT:-LIVING ROOM-AFTERNOON 
Basic twenty first century modern. MAUREEN ROBINSON stands, talking with a PRINCIPAL who in less than happy. 
PRINCIPAL 
He hacked our main power grid to run his experiment. The school was in chaos. We didn't even have lights. 
The room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body. 
Maureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously glancing behind couches, into cabinets. 
PRINCIPAL (OVER) 
He never showed, huh? 
WILL 
Maybe if I had actually broken the time barrier he would have paid attention. 
PENNY 
Don't let him get to you, kiddo. He just gets busy with work is all. 
Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb. 
WILL 
So, that's a no to family dinner? 
PENNY 
Let's see, do I spend my last night on Earth watching Mom and Dad pretend not to be fighting again or get in ten years of making-out at the mall ... you do the math. 
WILL 
Mom's gonna go thermal. 
PENNY 
What's she gonna do. Ground me? 
CHAPTER 4: Major West 
INT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR 
John and the General walk the metal passageway. 
JOHN 
We're lucky they didn't press on Daniels, condition. 
GENERAL 
I figured a chance to look at the ship would keep the dogs at bay. 
JOHN 
Ben, I'm worried about jamming in a replacement pilot at the last second. My family' a on this mission. I need someone who's more than just spit and polish. 
GENERAL 
I've got your man. He just doesn't know it yet. 
The General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal... 
INT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS 
A figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated. 
GENERAL 
At ease, Major. 
WEST 
Sir, why was I pulled off active duty? I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll fight a court martial, General. 
GENERAL 
Do you know Professor Robinson? 
WEST 
By reputation only. 
(to John) 
Your father's battle strategies were required reading at the Academy. 
GENERAL 
How much do you know about the Jupiter Mission, Major? 
WEST 
The Jupiter is fully automated. The pilot flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's a baby sitting job, sir. 
GENERAL 
Major, you are aware Earth's resources are severely limited. 
WEST 
Every schoolchild knows our recycling technologies will save the environment. Sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages. 
GENERAL 
What I am about to tell you is classified. Every schoolchild has been lied to. The recycling technologies have failed. In less than two decades Earth will be unable to support human life. 
GENERAL 
We spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets. We partnered with Coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government. The SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth as well as we do. They hope to reach Alpha Prime first - And if they do, I guarantee you, they will not share the Dimondium with Western Demons like us. our crops will wither. We will be left to die. 
WEST 
...Captain Daniels doesn't have the flu, does he sir? 
GENERAL 
Daniels was murdered in his apartment last night. The flu story is a cover we fed the press. 
WEST 
Dan was a good pilot. A good man. 
GENERAL 
Your rescue stunt over Mars was foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major. 
WEST 
I had a friend in trouble. 
GENERAL 
You endangered a one billion dollar spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order because of a friend? 
WEST 
Yes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir. 
JOHN 
He'll do. 
(stepping forward) 
GENERAL 
Congratulations Major, you're the new pilot of the Jupiter mission. 
CHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith 
EXT.-DESERT-DAY 
Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN. 
MAN 
Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory lane is required. I was contracted to provide Daniels, apartment code. My work is done. 
BUSINESSMAN 
Major, your escape vector in clear of all military and commercial traffic. Op in go on your command. 
INT.-JUPITER ONE 
WEST 
Roger, Houston. 
West reaches for a glowing panel. 
WEST 
We're outta here. 
EXT. JUPITER ONE 
The atomic power source fires a focused BLAST, shooting the Jupiter through cloud and sky towards the black edge of space. 
INT:-MISSION CONTROL 
The main screen shows a graphic of the Jupiter's trajectory as the ship arcs toward the outer edge of the atmosphere. 
NOAH 
Jupiter One, you are clear Earth's atmosphere. 
A CHEER goes up in the control room. 
EXT.-JUPITER ONE 
The giant saucer shell EXPLODES, revealing the inner ship, the glittering high tech shape of the JUPITER TWO. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Don watches as the Earth recedes into a blue marble, flickering orbital billboards growing distant. Smiles at the familiar sight. 
WEST 
Jupiter One booster disengaged. Proceeding towards Mercury. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
Nuclear diodes at the ship's base spin into life, glowing with atomic fire, the ship now heading towards Mercury and beyond. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS 
The Robot stands dormant in his service bay. HOLD on the closed service drawer in the b.g. PUSH IN. 
INT.-SERVICE DRAWER 
Smith lies still, unconscious in the dark compartment. 
INT-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE 
Mercury hangs like a red moon in the front viewscreen. 
WIDER 
Don presses a button and two giant blast shields close over the Jupiter Two's main viewscreen. 
WEST 
Houston, diverting all spacecraft controls to the main computer. 
(off mic) 
Eight years of flight training. 
He walks to the center of the bridge and activates the navigational holograph, images forming in mid-air over the pedestal. 
HOLOGRAPH- CLOSE. The Jupiter Two is visible, backed by the planets of our solar system. 
WEST 
Navigational holographics on line. 
(off mic) 
Fifty combat missions. 
Don touches buttons and a highlight indicates the ship's trajectory past mercury, around the Sun in a slingshot and into space beyond. 
WEST 
Course confirmed for slingshot exit of the solar system. 
(off mic) 
Just so I can take the family camper on an interstellar picnic. 
Don walks to the freezing tubes. He zips up his silver flight suit. 
WEST 
Ten world series. My, nephews' high school and college graduations. A decade's worth of Sports Illustrated swimsuit editions. 
(a beat) 
Noah, ten years in a lifetime. 
West climbs into his tube. 
INT.-MISSION CONTROL 
NOAH 
Sleep well, old friend. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Don hits a switch and his tube closes. A beat then he is engulfed by the blue glow, frozen in space. The tubes rise into the craft. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The ship flies on into the endless night. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CHAPTER 9: Destroy! 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE-LATER 
Smith lies still. He starts from a nightmare into...-a nightmare 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS 
Smith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm. 
He spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits a stud. The blast shield opens. Space. 
SMITH-CLOSE. Shock. No words. 
THE ROBOT-CLOSE. In his docking bay. Suddenly the automaton powers up, lights activating as his CPU comes on line. 
SMITH 
No. 
Smith turns, slaps the burned out programming module on the Robot. 
SMITH 
Disable program. 
No response. The Robot continues to power up. 
Smith engage interface. Initiate system shut-down. 
ROBOT 
Robot. Return to your docking bay and power down. 
ROBOT 
Command accepted. 
The Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator. All watch in amazement. Will grins, a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes. 
WILL 
If the family won't come to the science fair, bring the science fair to the family. 
An EXPLOSION rocks the ship. 
PENNY (OVER) 
Mom, look, it's Doctor Smith. 
Penny stands over Smith who lays crumpled in the corner. Maureen grabs an emergency medi-kit from a wall clamp, tosses it to Penny. 
MAUREEN 
Pulse, respiration and bleeding- 
PENNY 
Basic triage, lock down and stabilize. I know the drill. 
John is standing, helps Don to his feet. 
WEST 
NEXT picnic, no robots. 
Don moves fast to the helm. The main view screen is still closed, covered by giant metal blast shields. 
WEST 
Communications links are down. 
Maureen is at the life sciences console. 
MAUREEN 
Life support is at ten percent. Trying to bring secondary systems on line. It's not working. 
VIDEO MONITOR-POV. Penny is bandaging Smith's head, her bravado barely masking her fathoml4ss terror. 
PENNY 
Explosions rock the ship. Danger is everywhere, 'Yet the Space Captive is fearless as she... 
A console FLARES. Penny fights back tears, terrified. 
PENNY 
I want to go home now. 
Don is at the navigational system. 
WEST 
Rerouting power from the secondary couplings. Try it again. 
MAUREEN 
Finding a power tap.... 
Suddenly the lights go on, the air compressors begin to Hiss. 
MAUREEN 
Life support is back on line. 
WEST 
I can't get the blast shields open. We're flying blind. 
Penny in working ever Smith, bandaging his head. She runs stimulator under his nose. Smith begins to stir, COUGHING. 
PENNY 
I've got life signs. 
(wincing) 
Boy, somebody could use a breath mint. 
West turns, spots Smith for the first time. 
WEST 
(to John) 
Try the emergency back-ups. 
Don moves to the fallen figure, lifts him up against the bulkhead. 
WEST 
Smith, what the hell- 
SMITH 
I was making a last minute check ... someone hit me from behind. 
Don almost buys it. Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it. 
BURN-CLOSE. The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature seared into his flesh. 
WEST 
Sino-Jordanian technology. You're a Goddamned spy. 
(realizing) 
You did this. 
Don slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the airlock. The pilot hits a switch. The inner hatch opens. 
SMITH 
Stop. What are you doing? 
WEST 
Dropping some extra weight. 
MAUREEN (OVER) 
Help, somebody. Please. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Maureen stands at Judy's freezing tube. The young doctor's cryofield is sparking on and off. 
MAUREEN 
The thawing engine in broken. can't get her out. She's dying. 
Smith uses the distraction to palm-slam Don in the chin, knocking him backwards. Don staggers, goes again for Smith. 
SMITH 
Touch me and the girl dies. 
Don freezes in his tracks. 
SMITH 
WEST 
Unable to re-route to Mercury. The sun's pull is too strong. 
(a beat) 
Noah, I need options. 
INT.-MISSION CONTROL 
NOAH 
Major West we are unable to provide contingencies. 
(a beat) 
I'm sorry, Don. 
ON SCREEN-THE JUPITER TWO is heading towards the sun. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-SICKBAY 
Penny, Smith and Maureen have transferred Judy onto a hi-tech scanning-bed. A hovering holographic schematic of Judy's physiognomy appears over her, descends onto her body. 
SMITH 
No cardio-pulmonary or respiratory functions. 
MAUREEN 
Body temp at 68 Fahrenheit. 
SMITH 
Get her flight suit off. 
Penny unzips the silver material as Smith works the console, highlighting her holographic heart. 
SMITH 
Clear. 
The holographic image of her heart beats once, then is still. 
SMITH 
Again. Clear. 
The lights flicker on the bio-console, the holograph winks out. 
SMITH 
Power's down. 
MAUREEN 
We're losing her. 
CHAPTER 10: Initiate Hyperdrive 
INT. -JUPITER TWO 
DON and John man the Com. The sun is a raging fireball dead ahead. 
JOHN 
I've re-routed all secondary systems to the main drive. 
WEST 
She won't budge. Shortest baby sitting mission I've ever done. 
JOHN 
My family's not going die in space. 
WEST 
I'm open to suggestions. 
COMPUTER 
Outer hull breach in 30 seconds. 
INT.-SICKBAY 
Smith begins pumping Judy's chest by hand. 
SMITH 
Come on, child. Fight. Put a little heart in it. 
Smith steps back, begins precise, staccato blows to Judy's chest. 
SMITH 
The life.. . 
(hit ) 
I save ... 
(hit) 
may be 
(hit) 
my own. 
Smith stops, presses his ear to her chest - Takes her pulse. Smiles. 
MAUREEN 
Judy? Baby? 
A beat. Then Judy opens her eyes, manages a weak smile. 
JUDY 
You should try to look less worried. It has a tendency to spook the patients. 
MAUREEN 
(to Smith) 
Thank you. 
Smith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like. 
SMITH 
You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man could see that. I hope I have proven the well-being of your family is of great importance to me. Perhaps, if you convinced your husband to trust me... 
Maureen stares at him. A beat. She pulls a laser from the wall. Points it at his forehead. 
MAUREEN 
Stabilize her, Smith. Because you only breathe as long as she does. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE 
The ship is shaking in the mighty pull of the sun. Don is struggling to keep the ship stable. 
COMPUTER 
Heat seal breach in 20 seconds. 
JOHN 
MAUREEN 
What happened, John? Where are we? 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE 
Don in at the navigational holograph, patching sparking wires. The rest of the crew emerge onto the bridge. 
WEST 
You had me worried, Doc. Nice to see you thawed. 
JUDY 
Smart maneuver with the hyper-drive. 
WEST 
A fighter who thinks, what do you know? You're just in time for the show. 
Don makes a connection. The pedestal powers up, a holograph of the Jupiter Two appearing over its surface. 
WEST 
Computer, map our current location. 
HOLOGRAPHIC PEDESTAL-CLOSE. The area around the Jupiter Two is now filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system. 
JOHN 
See anything familiar? 
Don just shakes his head. 
COMPUTER 
Searching for recognizable constellations. 
(a beat) 
Unable to locate. 
JOHN 
This computer has star maps of the entire known galaxy. 
PENNY 
We're lost, aren't we? 
Judy wraps her arm around her sister. 
WEST 
What the hell is that? 
VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The nearest planet is starting to glow. Suddenly a distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal. 
JOHN 
Any effect on the ship? 
WEST 
No. 
VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. All the planets and constellations beyond the portal appear to be in different places. 
JOHN 
(off the navigational hologram) 
All the planets have moved. 
WEST 
And where did that come from? 
CHAPTER 12: The Proteus 
EXT.-SPACE 
Breaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle catches the light from the dual suns. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
The crew man their stations. Only Will is absent as they the ship maneuver around the portal. 
VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. As they, move behind the portal it seems to disappear, showing only the blackness of space. No ship beyond. 
WEST 
It's gone. 
JOHN 
No. Go back in front of it. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
As the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within... 
JOHN 
It's a hole in space. A doorway. 
WEST 
A doorway to where? 
JOHN 
If we want to reach that ship, we're going to have to find out. 
EXT.-SPACE 
The Jupiter Two flies through the pulsing hole in space. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
The giant, silver ship looms in the windscreen. 
MAUREEN 
No apparent effects on the ship. 
WEST 
I'm hailing on all frequencies. No response. 
JOHN 
There are some markings on the starboard side. Can you throw some light on her? 
WEST 
Don't know if the exterior spots are working.- There we go. 
THE WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. Powerful spotlights hit the ship. 
WEST AND JOHN-CLOSE. And really surprised. 
WEST 
If this in all a dream, why can't there be more girls? 
THE SPACESHIP-CLOSE. Essentially a needle covered with metal scallops. On its hull, under the legend PROTEUS, an American flag. 
WEST 
JOHN 
After it. Move. 
(to the Robot) 
Bring Smith. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR 
Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor. 
THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery. 
Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside. 
INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB 
A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don. 
WEST 
This explains where all the plants came from. 
JUDY 
Growth like this would take decades. 
The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw. 
SMITH 
Unhand me, you mechanical moron. 
Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head. 
WEST 
Don't move. 
SMITH 
I am sick of your terrorism. If you are going to kill me, be done with it. Otherwise I will insist you treat me with the respect and- 
WEST 
(like steel) 
I said don't move. 
Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he pulls from its hiding place a small creature. 
About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Will is watching through the Robot's eyes. 
WILL 
Neat. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN 
West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more friendly blue. Judy approaches. 
JUDY 
Well, who do we have here? 
As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like, trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast. 
WEST 
Easy there, little buddy. No one's going to hurt you. 
SMITH 
How do you know it won't hurt us? 
Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds. 
JUDY 
Looks like you've made a friend. You have a good bedside manner, Major. 
WEST 
I'm going to let that one go. 
SMITH 
How charming. Doctor Dolittle of outer space. 
JUDY 
Where do you think it came from? 
JOHN 
It's possible this is one of the creatures represented in the hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It must have been their ship attached to the other docking ring. 
The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there, burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH. 
WEST 
It looks like a child. 
SMITH 
If so, my dear Major, what do you suppose happened to its parents? 
JOHN 
Let's get back to the bridge. 
As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the background. Ominous. Unseen. 
CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders! 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Penny is still hanging overhead. 
PENNY 
I think I've got it. 
The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor. 
MAUREEN 
That's strange. 
SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with ambient heat. Penny lands beside her. 
PENNY 
Those scales are giving off heat. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE 
John is at the Com. 
JOHN 
I've tapped into the internal sensor array. Besides us, this ship is totally deserted. 
SMITH 
EXT.-SPACE 
The Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the wake of the fusion drives. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
COMPUTER (OVER) 
Warning. Inner hull breach in twenty seconds. 
JOHN 
Give them a little encouragement. 
WEST 
Electrifying outer hull ... now. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive. 
The spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of the giant probe ship. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
ON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the giant probe ship. 
JOHN 
Get us out of here. Fast. 
Don looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls. 
JOHN 
What are you doing? 
WEST 
Never leave an enemy stronghold intact. One of your father's first rules of engagement. 
Don hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD. 
JOHN 
Don, stop. That's a direct order. We might need to salvage- 
WEST 
This is a military emergency. That means I'm in command. 
JOHN 
Don, no. I'm ordering you- 
WEST 
I hate spiders. 
Don hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD. 
WEST 
Hang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy ride. 
Don angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's engines begins to glow. 
EXT.-SPACE 
The probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow, venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star. 
THE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders. 
THE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
The ship is buffeted by the shock wave. 
WEST 
I can't hold her. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Don is struggling to keep control. 
WEST 
We're going down. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
The windscreen is filled with a RUSHING BLIZZARD. 
WEST 
Can't get the stabilizers on line. 
JOHN 
Pull up. Pull up. 
WEST 
Really? No kidding? Thanks. 
WINDSCREEN- CLOSE. The storm clouds suddenly PART TO REVEAL ... A GIANT SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN RANGE. 
Don banks the controls. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
WEST 
I'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm going to try and make it. 
EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE 
The Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
The surface is coming up fast. 
WEST 
Got to slow us down. 
EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE 
The Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice, three times across the alien sea. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
WEST 
WILL 
But I downloaded your neural net. 
ROBOT 
Robot tried to destroy the Robinson family. Why would Will Robinson save Robot's personality? Your actions do not compute. 
WILL 
I guess sometimes friendship means acting with your heart, not your head. 
ROBOT 
Logic error. Friendship does not compute. 
WILL 
Don't worry, Robot. Im going to build you a new body. I promise. 
Will turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of the ship. He lifts a circular bubble of diodes. Smiles. 
WILL 
Mom always said I should try to make new friends. 
CHAPTER 15: Follow Orders! * return to CHAPTER 
INT.-BRIDGE 
Maureen stands at her life sciences station with John and Don. 
MAUREEN 
The atmosphere here can sustain human life. I've located 500 Rads radioactive material a mile north. 
JOHN 
That's at least what we'd need to get the core functioning again. 
John looks out the viewscreen at the alien night. Turns to Don. 
JOHN 
We'll set off at daybreak. it'll be safer. Those are my orders, Major. 
WEST 
I agree with your recommendation, Professor. 
MAUREEN 
Dtente is a beautiful thing. 
INT.-SICK BAY 
Judy examines the lizard monkey. Penny strokes the tiny creature, producing a string of BLIPS. 
PENNY 
What's the diagnosis, Doc? Is it cowboy or ballerina on Halloween? 
JUDY 
Right now she's a girl. But I think your little pal here is from a self-replicating species. At different stages of life she, or he, probably alternates sexes. 
PENNY 
Imagine the savings on dating outfits alone. 
The tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner. 
PENNY 
Can I keep her? 
JUDY 
Penny, you've never taken care of a thing in your life besides yourself. 
PENNY 
Please. She's all alone. I promise I'll look after her. She needs me. 
JUDY 
...The moment you misplace her, or forget to feed her, we leave her on this planet where she can live in the wild. I'm not kidding Penny. 
And with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature. 
PENNY 
We're both a long way from home, aren't we little one? 
The creature makes a tiny BLIP. 
PENNY 
That's what we'll call you. Blip. 
Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist. 
PENNY 
You like that? 
Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks up, eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek. 
PENNY 
Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice. 
The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying to imitate Penny's words of comfort. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
Judy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling. 
CHAPTER 16: Alien World 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB 
Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed security panel in the wall. 
SMITH 
Remove that lock this instant. I shall not be caged like some animal 
WEST 
(lethal) 
I gave my word I'd let you live. I never said for how long. 
SMITH 
These quarters will be fine. 
Smith stares at him a beat. 
SMITH 
Tell me, Major West. Are you really confident in Robinson's ability to guide us? If I were set free, I would support your right to command. With minimal force, we could take this ship and assure this mission continues under your leadership. 
WEST 
...My God Smith, you're right. How could I have been so blind? I'll just run and get you a gun so we can hijack the ship. Okay? 
SMITH 
Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles. 
JOHN 
What? 
MAUREEN 
It's nice to have our family under one roof. Even if we had to go half way across the galaxy to manage it. 
John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles. 
JOHN 
How would you feel about a little late night tutorial, Professor? 
John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME. 
MAUREEN 
Mm. That's new. What are you doing? 
JOHN 
Going for extra credit. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT 
The ship sits on the alien landscape. 
MAUREEN (OVER) 
Good night John. 
JOHN (OVER) 
Good night Maureen. 
WILL (OVER) 
Good night Judy. 
PENNY (OVER) 
Good night Will. 
JUDY (OVER) 
Good night Penny. 
WEST (OVER) 
You guys have got to be kidding. 
CHAPTER 17: The Core 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING 
Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen. 
WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock. 
WILL 
Oh man. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship. Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees. 
INT.-BRIEFING ROOM 
The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes. 
PENNY 
What are those rumblings? They've been happening all morning. 
JUDY 
How can half the landscape have grown up overnight? 
JOHN 
Okay, let's get settled. Maureen? 
MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates that make up this world appear mismatched. 
MAUREEN 
It's impossible. But this planet's geothermic plates don't match up. 
JOHN 
I was afraid of this. 
Al1 eyes turn to John. 
JOHN 
I think these tremors are the result of opening and closing doorways. 
PENNY 
Doorways to where? 
JOHN 
The future. 
SMITH 
Perhaps the Professor was hit on the head when we landed. 
JOHN 
Remember the portal that lead us to the probe ship? What if we crossed a into a time years after Earth sent a rescue mission. 
WEST 
You're not serious? Time travel is impossible. 
WILL 
No it's not. It's just improbable. Like hyperdrive was a hundred years ago. Nothing's really impossible. 
JOHN 
This world could be riddled with doorways to the future. 
WILL 
So if we walk into that forest outside, we're really just walking into this crater years from now. 
MAUREEN 
Geological plates from different times wouldn't fit together. That would explain the tectonic mismatch. But doorways in time, John? 
JOHN 
If these portals are opening and closing, part of some cascading, natural phenomenon, they could be tearing this planet apart 
WILL 
These portals are exactly what I predicted my time machine would do. What if the doorways aren't natural? A machine that bends space, like our hyperdrive, could be modified to bend time as well. What if someone on this world has built a device? 
JOHN 
Son, I appreciate your input but now isn't the time for flights of fancy. 
Robot is on line. 
(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled. 
WILL 
It sounds like old morse code. 
Chapter 18: Danger Will! 
INT.-CORRIDOR 
Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison. 
Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table, hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside. 
Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again. 
WILL 
(sounding out the code) 
Danger. 
INT.-SMITH'S CELL 
The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand. 
WILL 
You said someone is in danger. 
SMITH 
We all are. You are wise to arm yourself. 
Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy. 
WILL 
This gun is set to fire for me only so don't try anything funny. 
Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going instead to the window and opening the blast shield. 
SMITH 
William, you misjudge me. I only want to help you. 
WILL 
Help us? You tried to kill us all. 
SMITH 
But now our fates are intertwined. if your father and that idiot West fail, I will have no chance of getting home. It is in my best interests they succeed. And I always follow my best interests. 
Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL. 
SMITH 
What monsters roam these alien wilds? Fools. To set off blindly across this savage land. Much as I hate to admit it, it will be harder to manage without them. 
WILL 
What are you talking about? They'll be back. They'll be okay. 
Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat. 
WILL 
Someone should go after them. 
SMITH 
Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A clever one, certainly, but a child nonetheless. This planet is likely full of predators. Even if you found them, what if they're hurt, ravaged, dying, what good could you do? 
WILL 
But you're a doctor. 
Smith turns away, hiding his smile. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY 
Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds. 
JUDY 
It's impossible. 
MAUREEN 
Not really. Geologists have speculated that Dimondium might be naturally occurring in many older worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of rejuvenating itself. 
JUDY 
This one is ten times more powerful then that on Alpha Prime. There's enough here to save Earth. 
Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples, talking into her video recorder. 
PENNY 
After much deliberation, the Space Captive has decided to accept her new role as member of the crew. The Robinsons, after all, can  obviously use her help... 
Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground. 
PENNY 
(flaring) 
Now look what you've done. Stop hanging all over me. 
Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick brush.. 
PENNY 
Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn. 
Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten. 
CHAPTER 19: A Different Future 
EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY 
Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation tracker in his hand. 
WILL 
I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon. 
Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves moving in the wind like an azure sea. 
WILL 
Wow, that's Mom's favorite color. 
SMITH 
How droll. 
(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them, flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within. 
SMITH 
Run, child, run. 
Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes. 
SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown. 
Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon. 
JOHN 
We should be able to see the ship. 
Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand. 
METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency. 
WEST 
Could these be from the probe? 
JOHN 
Corroded. This metal is decades old. 
Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand. 
WEST 
It's not possible. 
WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two. 
WEST 
What kind of nightmare is this? Where the hell are we? 
JOHN 
No, Major, when the hell are we? 
Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying. John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful electrical blast, falling hard. Still. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot. 
EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE 
Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky. 
WILL 
I feel like we got turned around. 
SMITH 
Just follow your father's signal, young William. 
WILL 
Oh shit. 
SMITH 
A boy of your intelligence shouldn't swear. 
WILL 
(pointing) 
Look. 
SMITH 
Oh. Shit, indeed. 
REVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open to the sun. 
CUT TO: 
JOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness. 
WIDER 
INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE 
Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him. 
VOICE (OVER) 
Well, well. All things really do come to he who waits. 
A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow. 
JOHN 
What is this place? 
FIGURE 
Why Professor, the shock must have scrambled your brain. Look around you. Don't you recognize the spot? You've come home. 
JOHN 
This can't be... 
But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is. 
JOHN 
What have you done to the ship. ...Where's my family? 
FIGURE 
Your family is dead. Dead and in the ground. 
JOHN 
No! 
FIGURE 
What fickle consort in memory. Time dims certain images while others shine clear and bright as yesterday. 
The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar. 
FIGURE 
I'll never forget that morning. Twenty years ago. What was it you said? I'll be back. I promise. But I knew better. You never came home. 
The figure walks to one of the burned out panels. 
FIGURE 
Without you, your family never had a chance. A few spidersv survived the destruction of the probe ship. They reached the planet and attacked. I can still hear the women scream. 
JOHN 
Who are you? 
The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but familiar. John's father's dog tags. 
FIGURE 
Don't you recognize me, Dad? It's me. I'm your son. Will. 
EXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY 
Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush. 
JUDY 
Penny? Penny? 
The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny. 
Enable gun for all users. 
GUN 
Voiceprint confirmed. 
Will hands Smith the gun. 
SMITH 
Finally. 
Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple. 
SMITH 
A brief lesson in survival on this world or any other. Never trust anyone. Remember it into your old age, should you have one. 
(shoving him forward) 
Now move! 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE 
John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the control panel and the descending core material. 
JOHN 
We can go back across the portals to the past, to the functioning Jupiter Two, where your mother and sisters are still alive. We can use this core material to escape together. 
OLDER WILL 
And then what? All of us lost in space. Don't you see? I can do what you never could. I can save us all. 
Don has edged his way to the descending core material. 
SMITH (OVER) 
I'm afraid not. 
Through the doorway comes young Will, Smith walking behind him, hand on his shoulder, gun to his head. 
SMITH 
Never fear. Smith is here. 
JOHN 
Will, I. . . 
SMITH 
Don't move, Professor Robinson or this rather peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief. 
(off Don) 
I'll ask you to step away from that console, Major. 
Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John. Smith approaches the Robot. 
SMITH 
Well, well, some of us just don't know when to stay dead. 
Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt. 
SMITH 
I borrowed this from the probe ship in hopes of taking over the helm once we were in flight. But I seem to have found a better use instead. 
Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up, then fall limp. Docile. 
SMITH 
Let's try this dance again. You are the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do get it right this time. 
Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again. 
SMITH 
Robot, enable electric disrupters. 
The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles. 
SMITH 
Now that's a good gargantuan. 
Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head. 
SMITH 
Say goodbye to your past. You're future lies with me. I'm going home in your place. 
Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring at the time machine, eyes wide with awe. 
WILL 
You did it. Just like I imagined. Re-routed the hypercore. But the natural power source, the delivery system. I never thought of those. 
Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger self. Touches his hair. 
OLDER WILL 
You will. The future is never what it looks like when you're ten. 
SMITH 
Heartwarming. Nauseatingly sentimental but heartwarming. 
Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will. 
SMITH 
We certainly could have aged better, I must say Now, show me how your little time machine works. 
But Will just smiles. 
SMITH 
An odd moment for mirth, don't you think? What are you grinning at? 
OLDER WILL 
Look around you, Doctor. At this hostile world. Do you really think a boy could have survived all alone? 
SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar. 
VOICE (OVER) 
Never fear, Smith is here. 
The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith. 
SPIDER SMITH 
Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me again after all these years. 
Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye. 
SPIDER SMITH 
The spider's sting had some unexpected side effects. 
Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm. 
SPIDER SMITH 
But my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world. 
Let's forget the past. 
Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows. 
SPIDER SMITH 
What are you doing? 
OLDER WILL 
Focusing the aperture. Remember, the energy around the portal will rip a man to pieces. 
SPIDER SMITH 
Isn't the doorway too small? 
OLDER WILL 
Not for me. 
(a beat) 
But then I'm not going, am I? The spiders didn't kill the girls. It was you. I just never let myself see it. You kept me alive because you needed me. Because I could build this for you. You killed my family. Destroyed this world. And I helped. You became mad as the spiders. ...And I became you. 
SPIDER SMITH 
Poor, poor boy. Did you really think I would let you go home? Let all that I have become vanish? Look at me. I am no mere man. I am a God. 
Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders. 
SPIDER SMITH 
Your father was right. Within me roil the growing needs of a master race. We WILL descend upon helpless Earth. An entire planet to rule. 
His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth, bearing venomous fangs. 
SPIDER SMITH 
An entire planet on which to feed. 
INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE 
John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER) the TREMORS are increasing in frequency. 
WEST 
I'll run, draw his fire. You may have time to get away with Will. 
ROBOT (OVER) 
Halt or Robot will destroy. 
The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot. 
WILL 
Do you remember what I taught you. A long time ago. About friendship? 
ROBOT 
Friendship means acting with your heart not your head. 
WILL 
That's why I rebuilt you. Because I wanted us to be friends. 
ROBOT 
Logic error. Friendship does not compute. 
WILL 
Forget logic. Act with your heart. 
ROBOT 
Robot has no heart. Robot is powered by a fusion pulse generator 
WILL 
Every living thing has a heart. 
The Robot stares at him a beat. 
ROBOT 
Any attempts to override command protocols may result in fused processors in my neural net. 
The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams. 
WILL 
Please, Robot, if you don't let us go, we're all going to die. I'm asking you now, will you help us? Will you be my friend? 
The Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control bolt attached firmly on his CPU. 
ROBOT 
Robot attempting to deactivate control bolt-commands overriddenattempting to reroute-dangercircuitry overloadattempting to escape-kill them, kill them... 
The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire. 
At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt. 
WILL 
You did it. 
ROBOT 
Robot will save ... I will save Will Robinson. I will save my friend. 
CHAPTER 21: Time to Die! 
EXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT 
Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into the daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES. 
MAUREEN 
(shouting ) 
Penny? Penny? 
Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently. 
MAUREEN 
Where did you go? 
PENNY 
I came through the forest. I had a promise I had to keep. 
Before Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling. 
JUDY 
Inside. Fast. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE 
Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the ground RUMBLES. 
JOHN 
You've got find your way back to the ship. The portals may still be stable. I'll try to meet you there. 
WEST 
The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards... 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT 
The women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble. 
PENNY 
Mom, the forest. 
Penny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back. 
MAUREEN 
Where's John? 
WEST 
The portal closed behind us. It was his only way back. 
MEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air. 
WEST 
We've got to try and lift off. 
MAUREEN 
We've already begun the pre-flight countdown. You have the Com. 
(off Don's expression) 
I'm going to save as many lives as I can, Major. Now strap in. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE 
(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls themselves beginning to crack. 
SMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank unfolds above the doorway in time. 
JOHN (OVER) 
Not so fast. 
WIDER 
John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand, slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists. 
JOHN 
You sabotaged our mission. 
(hook) 
You killed my family 
(jab) 
You stole my son. It's payback time. 
Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect. It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform. 
SPIDER SMITH 
Spare me the fury of the righteous. 
The monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw. 
SPIDER SMITH 
I think there's time for a snack before my trip. 
John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek. 
SPIDER SMITH 
(sarcastic) 
Oh, the pain. The pain. 
JOHN 
You ain't seen nothing yet. 
John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch. 
SPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised. 
JOHN 
Remember the probe ship? These monsters eat their wounded. 
SMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping. 
SPIDER SMITH 
No. Stop. No! 
Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him, sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below. 
Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red laser and is swept up by the tides of time. 
JOHN 
Take all the time you want to die. 
Spider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether. 
John turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT 
The landscape is a sudden inferno. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT 
Don is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair. 
MAUREEN 
I kept hoping somehow he'd appear. 
Maureen stares a beat out the window. 
MAUREEN 
Let's go, Major. 
Don hits the engine switch. The.mighty generators WHINE into life. 
MAUREEN 
(quiet) 
Goodbye, my love. 
CHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity 
The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way. 
WEST 
Engaging primary thrusters. Now! 
EXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT 
The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise. 
We are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam. Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair. 
MAUREEN 
I kept hoping somehow he'd appear. 
Maureen stares a beat out the window. 
MAUREEN 
Let's go, Major. 
Don hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life. 
MAUREEN 
(quiet) 
Goodbye my love. 
PENNY 
Look. 
The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL. 
2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE 
The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated doorway. Older WILL looks to his father. 
OLDER WILL 
DON'T make me wait another lifetime to know how you feel. 
And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down through space and into the bubble and the doorway below. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the watery hull. 
JOHN 
Come with us. 
But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g. 
OLDER WILL 
I can't. There was only enough power for one person, one trip, remember? 
MAUREEN 
Will? 
OLDER WILL 
It's good to see you again, Mom. It's good to see you alive. 
(fading) 
Sorry about all the monkey business. 
Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever. 
JOHN 
He sacrificed everything for his family. 
MAUREEN 
(fighting tears) 
He had a good example. 
Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will. 
WILL 
Dad? 
A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags. 
WILL 
I'm glad you came back. 
JOHN 
I just want you to know I love you son. I love you very much. 
John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close. (OVER) more RUMBLING as the ground continues to give way. 
WEST (OVER) 
The planet is breaking up around us. 
John moves fast to the Com. 
WEST 
Nice of you to drop in. 
John smiles a beat, then he's all business. 
JOHN 
Status? 
(OVER) A tremendous CRASH. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into 
giant caverns of fire. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
SMITH 
We're doomed. We're doomed. 
West turns, hauls off and PUNCHES Smith, knocking him out cold. 
WEST 
Boy, that felt good. 
JOHN 
Get us airborne. 
Don throws the power switches to full. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The landing struts retract. The power drive begins to spin. The Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses upon itself. Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
WEST 
I'm going to try to reach escape velocity. Maybe we can break the gravitational pull. 
JOHN 
No. We don't have the core material. The gravity wells will drag us down. 
WEST

FADE IN: 
1 INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT (PASADENA, CA) - EVENING 1 
Soft music. A classy joint. Below the tables, WE PAN well-heeled feet nuzzling. Finally we SETTLE ON: 
A PAIR OF FEET 
WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here. 
PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY (41). A handsome couple. He'd be JFK to her Jackie O... if he gave a shit. Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.: white sneakers in fancy French restaurant). 
Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu. 
CAL Well, I'm full. You were right, hon. I shouldn't have eaten all that bread. (THEN) Want to just share a dessert? 
Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu. 
CAL You okay, babe? You seem out of it. 
TRACY Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want. 
CAL Me too. Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three... TRACY CAL I want a divorce. Creme Brulee. 
CUT TO: 
2 INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE (PASADENA) - SAME EVENING 2 
JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9). Jessica's skinny, wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt. In five years, she's going to make all the boys' heads spin. But not yet. 
(CONTINUED) 2 CONTINUED: 2 JESSICA I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna getcha! 
She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the nearby console. Jessica picks it up: 
ON SMASHED PHOTO 
Cal and Tracy. This is their house. 
BACK TO SCENE 
JESSICA It's okay, my fault. (THEN) Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home. Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac. Go brush your teeth! 
Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately. 
CUT TO: 
3 INT. BAR 3 
Meanwhile, TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN drink and laugh at a table. HANNAH (24) is clearly buzzed. HANNAH I don't care. I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies. 
Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS. 
LIZ Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd do Conan O'Brien? 
HANNAH I'm just saying, Richard's a lot of things: successful, smart... 
LIZ Boring, workaholic, sexually repressed... 
(CONTINUED) 3 CONTINUED: 3 HANNAH But he's not very funny, that's all. 
LIZ Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a good lay, go get yourself some of... that. 
She motions off to the side. 
HANNAH What? 
LIZ The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour. 
THE CROWD PARTS, revealing: JACOB PALMER (32). The smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen. He tilts his glass at them, toasting. 
4 INT. LEXUS SUV 4 
Meanwhile, Cal sits in the passenger seat, dazed. A "to- go" box from the French restaurant in his lap. Tracy drives. 
TRACY Aren't you going to say anything? 
Nothing. 
TRACY Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say? 
She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward. 
HANNAH Is that so? 
JACOB It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you. 
LIZ Multiple times. 
(CONTINUED) 6 CONTINUED: (3) 6 JACOB That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink? 
Hannah and Liz share a look. 
HANNAH What do you expect me to say to that? 
JACOB Margarita, rocks, salt. 
HANNAH Wow. 
She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand. 
HANNAH Okay, time to go. 
Liz doesn't move. 
LIZ I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a CRAP -- 
HANNAH Liz! 
LIZ (whispering to him) Another time, maybe. 
GIGGLING, the girls leave the bar. 
7 INT. LEXUS SUV 7 
Still driving, Tracy looks at Cal. He remains silent. 
TRACY I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know? 
He keeps staring straight ahead. 
TRACY Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more. Maybe that's good, maybe that's good. Okay... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 7 CONTINUED: 7 TRACY (CONT'D) (THEN) There's this person. 
No response. 
TRACY We've been spending time together. Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff... 
Silence. She closes her eyes tightly. 
TRACY I slept with him. Kind of. 
Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing. 
TRACY No, no kind of. I can't believe I said kind of. That's just not something you do in a kind of way. I slept with someone. There. I said it. I slept with someone. Oh God. It's the worst thing I've ever done but it feels so good to say out loud. I slept with someone. I SLEPT with someone. I slept with SOMEONE. I slept with ... please stop me, please say something. 
No reaction. 
TRACY David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party. You remember that party? They had the giant paper-mach√© wreath? I kept asking the decorator how he made it? You wore that sweater -- 
Finally, Cal speaks -- 
CAL Please stop. 
TRACY The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal -- 
CAL If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car. 
(CONTINUED) 7 CONTINUED: (2) 7 TRACY But the fact that I did, that it could happen at all, I think it just shows how broken we are and -- 
CAL Okay. 
Just like that, Cal OPENS THE DOOR to the moving car and, simply, steps out. Tracy SCREAMS as Cal goes flying. 
She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror. 
8 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 8 
Tracy runs to him. He's on the curb, BLOODIED but okay. 
TRACY Are you out of your mind!? 
He looks up at her, pleading. 
CAL I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it. 
She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's still something here. 
TRACY Okay. 
CAL Okay. 
He stands, limps back to the car. 
JESSICA Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10 CONTINUED: (2) 10 JESSICA (CONT'D) You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy. 
Cal smiles, distracted but grateful. 
JESSICA In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a LITTLE CRUS-- 
CAL (NOT LISTENING) Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents? It's probably better they hear it from us. Okay? 
JESSICA Uh-huh. 
CAL That's my girl. 
Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car. 
CAL Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening. 
She smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees... He's holding CASH out the window to pay her. 
CAL You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford. 
And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer. 
CUT TO: 
11 INT. BAR - LATER 11 
Cal sits at the bar, drinking away his sorrows. He's disheveled, a bit wobbly. He motions for the BARTENDER. (CONTINUED) 11 CONTINUED: 11 BARTENDER Another vodka cranberry? 
CAL Yes. Just... yes. 
A GIRL (30s) approaches the bar. Cal taps her shoulder, a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen. 
CAL Guess what? 
GIRL What? 
CAL My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me. 
GIRL I'm sorry to hear that. 
CAL That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore. 
The Girl has turned back to a group of friends. 
CAL I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz. (to no one) She screws him. 
Something catches Cal's eye across the bar. We PAN TO... 
JACOB PALMER 
wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table. 
Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the bartender, and decides: 
CAL (RE: JACOB) Gay. 
12 EXT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - MORNING 12 
You know these places: basically a "strip" of identical housing units -- usually occupied by newly-divorced dads. 
A WOMAN (60s) gives Cal the tour. 
WOMAN So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2 is a lot like unit 1 except you're downstairs so... the ground is closer. Which is nice. 
13 INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 13 
The most depressing, empty, beige place ever. 
CAL I guess the price is right. 
WOMAN Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys here. You'll fit right in. 
Cal SIGHS, un-enthused. 
CAL I'll take it. 
WOMAN Ooh, the gym has an elliptical machine... I assume you want to get back in shape? 
Cal looks down, embarrassed. 
CAL I guess. 
WOMAN Great! I'll let you know when they fix it. 
14 INT. OFFICE - AFTERNOON 14 
Cal sits at his desk, doing paperwork. His BOSS ENTERS. 
BOSS Cal, I just got the weekly sales report, good good good! You really killed this quarter! (MORE) 
BERNIE It's cologne. 
CAL Are you breaking up with me? 
BERNIE Claire's waiting in the car. Um... there's a gift receipt in there. Sorry. 
Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. 
Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender. 
CAL Do you have anything with a worm in it? Because I'd like a gallon of that now. 
ON JACOB 
Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get dumped this whole time. 
He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting, untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair. 
Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, gets up and walks away. 
BACK TO CAL 
As the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender. 
CAL This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things. 
A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob. 
Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool. 
(CONTINUED) 18 CONTINUED: (2) 18 Cal points at himself: "Me?" Jacob nods: "Yep." Cal SHRUGS, stands, and wobbles over towards Jacob. 
JACOB Jacob Palmer. 
CAL CAL WEA-- 
JACOB I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal. 
CAL I already have a drink. 
JACOB Let me buy you a drink, Cal. 
CAL Okay. 
Jacob motions to the Bartender who NODS. Cal SITS. 
CAL My wife is cheating on me with -- 
JACOB David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story. 
Cal takes this in. He STANDS. 
CAL You know what, I don't need this CRAP -- 
JACOB Sit down, Cal. 
CAL Okay. 
Cal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk. 
(CONTINUED) 18 CONTINUED: (3) 18 JACOB Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand? 
Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues: 
JACOB As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal. 
Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw. 
JACOB You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it? 
Cal shakes "no." 
(CONTINUED) 18 CONTINUED: (4) 18 JACOB Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say? 
Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up. 
CAL Yeah, okay. 
JACOB Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock. 
CAL I'm sorry, what? 
Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby). 
JACOB You ready to go? 
She nods, subservient, and follows him out. 
Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw. 
MOLLY Don't you love us anymore? 
Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up. 
CAL Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 20 CONTINUED: 20 CAL (CONT'D) But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron-- 
MOLLY TROY! 
She bolts past Cal to the TV, where ZAC EFRON is on- screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform. Robbie and Cal stand there, awkwardly. 
ROBBIE Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her. 
Cal NODS. 
ROBBIE You okay? 
CAL You? 
Robbie shrugs. 
ROBBIE Can I say something with a curse? One time? 
CAL Yeah. Why not? 
Robbie NODS, takes a deep breath. 
ROBBIE Love is fucked. 
Cal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved. 
CAL Is that so? You in love, buddy? 
ROBBIE Well, if you must know -- 
JESSICA (O.S.) Ding dong. 
They turn -- it's Jessica, the baby-sitter. 
ROBBIE What is she doing here? 
CAL Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for COMING -- (MORE) (CONTINUED) 20 CONTINUED: (2) 20 CAL (CONT'D) (back to Robbie) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking -- 
ROBBIE What? 
CAL Huh? 
JESSICA (CHANGING TOPICS) The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver. 
CAL Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you. (TO ROBBIE) Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few. 
ROBBIE But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that! 
CAL I know, buddy. 
Cal musses Robbie's hair. 
CAL My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it? 
Uch. Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying. 
CAL Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy? 
No response, she's glued to the television. 
ROBBIE Wait, where are you going? 
CAL I'm, uh... I decided to take a class. 
(CONTINUED) 20 CONTINUED: (3) 20 JESSICA That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before... 
Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off. 
CAL Okay, well... Molly, last chance!? 
But Molly is still locked on Efron. 
CAL That's my angel. Back in a few. 
ROBBIE But, Dad -- 
CAL Nope. 
The door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool. 
ROBBIE I don't need a baby-sitter. 
JESSICA I know, Robbie. 
An awkward beat, then. 
JACOB Take them off. 
Cal bends down, takes one off. 
JACOB (CHEWING) Other one too, please? 
Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes. 
Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing. 
CAL What the hell!? 
JACOB Are you in a fraternity, Cal? 
CAL Those were my favorite shoes. (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: 24 JACOB ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!? 
CAL No. 
JACOB Are you Steve Jobs? 
CAL What? 
JACOB ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS? 
CAL No. I'm not Steve Jobs. 
JACOB Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go. 
25 INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 25 
Cal (barefoot) follows Jacob around the store. 
CAL I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea. 
Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES. 
JACOB Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items. 
CAL Ha! I think I read that in GQ. 
JACOB You did. I wrote it. 
CAL Really? 
Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes. 
JACOB Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers. (CONTINUED) 25 CONTINUED: 25 Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS. 
CAL I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ? 
Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away. 
JACOB Your credit card please? 
MONTAGE - FROM STORE TO STORE 
We watch as Jacob narrates the wardrobe essentials (and as Cal's arms get progressively fuller) in each store. 
26 IN A SUIT STORE 26 
Cal gets fitted. 
JACOB (V.O.) Two suits: one black, one grey. One sports jacket, navy preferred. 
Jacob leans in toward the tailor. 
JACOB Take it in there... and there. 
27 AT ANOTHER STORE 27 
Cal holds jeans in front of him, eyes them suspiciously. JACOB (V.O.) One pair of quality jeans. 
CAL These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap? 
He looks up. Jacob is gone. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
28 EXT. MALL - MOMENTS LATER 28 
Cal runs outside. Jacob is already halfway to the car. 
CAL I'm sorry! Don't leave! (CONTINUED) 28 CONTINUED: 28 Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers: 
JACOB No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap. 
CAL What's wrong with the Gap? 
JACOB In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal. 
CAL Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little. 
JACOB Shut up, Cal. (TO TIFFANY) You'd fuck him, right? 
CAL (HORRIFIED) Jesus! 
TIFFANY Yeah, probably. 
CAL Tiffany! (then, realizing) You would!? 
Tiffany SHRUGS. 
JACOB You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link. 
Cal takes this in. 
CAL Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me. 
JACOB No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover. 
Cal's lower lip begins to quiver. 
(CONTINUED) 33 CONTINUED: (2) 33 CAL Yeah, okay, that was meaner. 
CUT TO: 
34 INT. BAR - NEXT NIGHT 34 
Cal sits next to Jacob. Cal is wearing his new "outfit." He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new "gear." 
Jacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a men's magazine. And he knows it. Cal looks at Jacob. 
CAL I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right? 
JACOB No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly. 
Cal rubs his hands together, nervous. 
CAL We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are -- 
JACOB Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with? 
CAL Sexually? 
JACOB Yes. 
CAL In my entire life? 
JACOB No, synchronized swimming. Yes, Cal. Sexually. 
Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on one hand. (CONTINUED) 34 CONTINUED: 34 He smiles at Jacob proudly when he has to move the count to a second hand. Then: 
CAL One. 
Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly. 
JACOB Wow, okay... wow. (then, checking) Not at a time? Total? 
CAL What? I married young. We met in high school. 
He smiles, remembering. 
CAL Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it. (THEN) Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it -- 
JACOB Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go. 
CAL (a bit emotional) I miss my wife. 
JACOB Shut up, Cal. 
A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side. 
YOUNG WOMAN Hi. 
JACOB Hi. Jacob Palmer. 
YOUNG WOMAN Amy Johnson. 
Cal extends his hand. 
(CONTINUED) 34 CONTINUED: (2) 34 CAL CAL -- 
JACOB (QUICKLY) Don't. 
He pulls it back. 
CAL (TO HIMSELF) -- Weaver. 
JACOB Can I get you a drink, Amy? 
Robbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up. 
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Listen, Robbie -- 
ROBBIE Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that. 
Tracy RE-ENTERS. 
TRACY You ready to go? 
ROBBIE (SUDDENLY SWEET) Mommy, can we do Chinese for dinner tonight? 
(CONTINUED) 44 CONTINUED: (4) 44 Tracy waves to David as she and Robbie EXIT, leaving him stunned in the middle of her office, staring at: 
THE PHOTO OF CAL AND TRACY that Robbie has left directly in his line of sight. 
CUT TO: 
45 EXT. THE WEAVER BACKYARD - LATE EVENING 45 
Bushes rustle. Once, then twice. It's Cal, sneaking into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the house. All is quiet. He gets to work. 
-- He spreads FERTILIZER on the grass. 
-- Trims some bushes. 
-- Picks off some petals from some dying flowers. 
It's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen. Finally, he finishes. 
ON CAL 
Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back in order. As he takes it all in... 
A LIGHT pops on. 
Cal DIVES into a SHRUB. 
46 INT. BAR - THAT NIGHT 46 Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward. 
Jacob looks at Cal. Cal looks great, more comfortable in his new "skin" than when we left him. He's drinking a martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry. 
A WAITRESS passes. Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of the glass, silently requesting a refill. It's a cool, practiced move... and he did it instinctively. 
Jacob smiles, leans forward. 
JACOB I think you're ready, Cal. 
CAL For what? (CONTINUED) 46 CONTINUED: 46 JACOB To talk to a woman, take a woman home. 
CAL Oh, no. No, I'm not. 
JACOB You've been watching me do it for two weeks. 
CAL Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball. 
JACOB Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches? 
CAL Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone? 
Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience: 
JACOB Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down? 
CAL You ask if you can buy her a drink. 
JACOB And what if she says no? 
CAL You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there. 
JACOB When she asks me a question about myself? 
(CONTINUED) 46 CONTINUED: (2) 46 CAL You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about yourself. 
JACOB And what happens? 
CAL They talk about themselves. A lot. 
JACOB And what do I do? 
CAL You act really interested. You nod a lot. 
JACOB And at the end of the night? 
CAL You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place. 
JACOB Do I ask? 
CAL No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place. (THEN) Holy shit! You Mr. Miagi'd me! 
KATE Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? 
Cal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then: 
CAL You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me. 
KATE (PLAYFUL) Ask me again. 
Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident. 
CAL I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me. 
Kate looks up, genuinely turned-on. 
CUE MUSIC: "SEXYBACK" by Justin Timberlake. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
47 INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - LATER 47 
Cal and Kate BARGE in, passionately kissing. 
CAL (gasping for breath) This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife. 
(CONTINUED) 47 CONTINUED: 47 KATE (TURNED ON) I love that you're being so honest. It's so different, so hot. 
CAL I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife. 
KATE More, tell me more. 
CAL I'm worried you have AIDS. 
She stops. 
CAL Only a little. 
She pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off. She's wearing just a bra. She looks amazing. 
KATE What do you want to do with me? 
CAL Show you off to my wife to make her jealous. 
She GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch: 
48 CAL WEAVER'S "SEXYBACK" MONTAGE (THE NEXT FEW WEEKS) 48 -- The next morning a DISHEVELED CAL lets Kate out, gives her a big passionate kiss, and closes the DOOR. 
-- We STAY ON the DOOR. After a beat, it opens up: as Cal bids farewell to a NEW GIRL on a new morning. 
49 AT THE BAR 49 
Cal strides in -- a skip in his step, a perfectly tailored suit on his body. Everything's in SLOW MOTION. He points at someone, winks at a waitress... 
A SAD SACK GUY at the bar watches Cal stride by, jealous. Cal Weaver has evolved into "the fucking man." 
50 SNAPSHOTS 50 
MEANWHILE -- 
1) HANNAH studies late into the night for the bar. 2) JESSICA reads magazine articles on "How to Make Him Notice You." 3) TRACY eats ice cream in bed, alone. 4) ROBBIE drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard. But we're mainly with CAL... 
51 BACK TO CAL'S APARTMENT 51 
A NEW WOMAN EXITS. The door closes. It re-opens as he kisses goodbye ANOTHER WOMAN! 
52 BACK AT THE BAR -- CAL AND JACOB 52 
are mid-conversation. 
JACOB ... it would work! 
CAL You're out of your mind. 
JACOB What do college guys hate? Doing laundry. What do they love? Strippers. It's a strip club where they can do their laundry. 
CAL It's ridiculous. JACOB And yours isn't? A candy store that only sells red candy. 
CAL Everyone loves the cherry. Look, I'm not rejecting the psuedo- cherry flavors like raspberry or strawberry, anything in the -erry family is allowed. But let's be real here: no one wants the lemon. No one likes the grape. 
JACOB I like grape. 
CAL Well then you can't come to my store. (CONTINUED) 52 CONTINUED: 52 They LAUGH, quickly becoming inseparable. 
53 INT. SUBURBAN KITCHEN - EVENING 53 
A late 40s couple eat dinner: BERNIE (the big guy who "broke up" with Cal earlier) and CLAIRE, a bubbly little woman -- the polar opposite of her husband. 
CLAIRE Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon. 
BERNIE For God's sake, Claire. 
MADISON Do what I do. Send him a postcard from downtown. 
JESSICA Huh? 
MADISON Go TMZ on his ass. 
JESSICA I'm not following you, Madis-- 
MADISON The full gyno. 
Off Jessica's blank look. 
MADISON A crotch shot? A nip slip? (THEN) A dirty picture! You can even Annie Leibowitz it. Tasteful but with nipple. Yeah, that's what you should do: make it artistic. Black and white. Make this face. 
She makes a raw sexual face. 
JESSICA Jesus, Madison! 
(CONTINUED) 54 CONTINUED: (3) 54 MADISON Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. 
Madison walks off, calls back. 
MADISON Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And then your brother sees it, tells your mom, and suddenly you're not allowed to use Facebook for a month. Thanks, Kevin! 
She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice. 
55 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LATER THAT DAY 55 
Jessica EXITS the school, lost in thought. There's a bit of commotion outside. TEENAGERS are pointing and LAUGHING at something. 
Jessica pushes through and sees: 
ROBBIE, standing atop a man-made, tall, wooden platform/scaffold in front of the school. 
ROBBIE (DRAMATICALLY) There she is! 
ON JESSICA 
Oh shit. 
BACK TO ROBBIE 
as he RIPS OPEN his button-up shirt, revealing a SCARLET J taped to his pale, hairless chest. He has recreated the famous Scarlet Letter tableau. He pulls out a piece of paper, reads it. 
(CONTINUED) 55 CONTINUED: 55 ROBBIE Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.' 
Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers. 
ROBBIE I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the one! I know it to be true, and so now do the multitude. (CORRECTING HIMSELF) Multitudes? (then, deciding) No, multitude. 
JESSICA Robbie, get down! 
ROBBIE I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me. 
JESSICA Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW! 
That does the trick. He gets down to mocking APPLAUSE. Jessica pulls him off to the side. 
JESSICA (HEATED WHISPER) What the hell are you thinking? 
ROBBIE You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it. (THEN) Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down. Wave hello. 
(CONTINUED) 55 CONTINUED: (2) 55 OFF TO THE SIDE: Three excited THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WAVE and give THUMBS-UPS to Robbie. Jessica waves, confused, turns back to Robbie. 
JESSICA This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously. 
ROBBIE You'll learn to love me. I promise. 
JESSICA I won't. 
ROBBIE Just because I'm four years younger than you? 
JESSICA BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!! 
This stops Robbie dead in his tracks. 
JESSICA I've been spending time with him for a while. 
Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual. 
ROBBIE No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last MONTH -- 
JESSICA He's older. I don't want my parents to know. 
And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen. 
ROBBIE Who is he? 
JESSICA It doesn't matter. 
58 EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NEXT NIGHT 58 
PARENTS walk hand-in-hand, into the school. It's Parent- Teacher conference night. 
59 INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NEXT NIGHT 59 
Cal sits on a small chair outside a classroom. Tracy approaches. 
TRACY (O.S.) Wow. 
Cal looks up. Tracy stands there. She's dressed down, but looks amazing. Vulnerable and nervous. 
TRACY (FLOORED) You look great, Cal. 
CAL Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so... 
TRACY Well you look great. Really. 
Cal smiles. 
CAL Thank you. (THEN) You always look great, so... 
Awkward. Neither knows what to say now. Tracy takes the seat next to him. 
CAL I talked to Nanna yesterday. 
TRACY Me, too. She sound okay to you? 
CAL She sounded like... Nanna. She worries about us. (CONTINUED) 59 CONTINUED: 59 
Tracy NODS. A long beat, then: 
CAL I feel like I'm about to get detention. 
Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit. 
CAL Which teacher is this? 
TRACY Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. 
Cal smiles. 
CAL He's a really weird kid, isn't he? 
TRACY Yeah. (THEN) I kind of like him, though. 
CAL I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital. 
TRACY Me, too. 
They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. 
An awkward beat, then: 
CAL So, how are things with... (a beat, then) How's it going with David? 
She looks down. 
TRACY Oh... it's not. (THEN) It wasn't about him, if that means anything. 
CAL No, I know. (CONTINUED) 59 CONTINUED: (2) 59 Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture. 
TRACY You seeing anyone? 
CAL Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really. 
TRACY Oh. Because you hear things, you know. 
CAL Yeah, well... 
Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy. 
CAL I miss you, T. 
Tracy looks up surprised. 
CAL I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high school... you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you know? 
She smiles. 
CAL I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer. 
TRACY I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. 
He smiles, emboldened. 
CAL All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 59 CONTINUED: (3) 59 CAL (CONT'D) (THEN) I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me. 
Tracy's eyes well up with tears. 
61 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 61 
A three-way chase: 
CAL Tracy, wait! 
TRACY Leave me alone, Cal! 
KATE I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you ASSHOLE! 
ON SPECTATORS 
TEACHERS and PARENTS (including Jessica's parents), stepping out into the hallway and following them outside. 
62 EXT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS ACTION 62 
Tracy races to her car. 
CAL Tracy, c'mon! We were separated. 
TRACY (fumbling for keys) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you. 
CAL Okay, so -- 
TRACY I can't do this now, Cal. 
CAL Tracy, I love you. 
KATE Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, ASSHOLE! 
Tracy looks at Cal, stunned. That's their thing. 
(CONTINUED) 62 CONTINUED: 62 CAL It's a funny story, actually -- 
TRACY I'm going home. 
She opens the car door. 
CAL Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher! 
GASPS from the crowd. Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a picture with her cell phone. 
CAL But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU! I LOVE YOU!!! Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment. 
CAL Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're STILL... 
He instantly trails off, realizing. MORE GASPS. 
CAL (MEEKLY COMPLETING) ... the only woman I want to be with. TRACY I don't even know who you are. 
Tracy gets in her car and speeds off. 
CAL (weakly, to himself) I'm your soulmate. 
Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met... 
By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF. 
CAL HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT! 
(CONTINUED) 62 CONTINUED: (2) 62 THUNDER CRACKS in the sky. It begins to pour. Cal stands there, soaked. He looks up at the sky. 
CAL REALLY!!!??? 
63 EXT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY 63 
Meanwhile, the rain pours down as DINERS scurry into the restaurant. 
64 INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 64 
We've been here before... the same group of BORING PEOPLE at the same table. Liz and Hannah CHAT off to the side. 
There's a cake on the table that says "CONGRATS HANNAH!" 
Richard stands on a chair. 
RICHARD Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!? 
The room goes quiet. 
RICHARD Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here... I forget what she looks like, anyone remember? 
POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard. Is this it? 
RICHARD I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course... 
More CHEESY LAUGHTER. 
RICHARD Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie... 
HANNAH Let's go. 
She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to. 
WOMAN #1 Slut. 
66 INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - LATER 66 
We haven't been here yet. It's exactly what you'd expect though: an elegant bachelor-pad. Modern furniture. Sleek. Everything just right. Jacob puts an album on his record player. 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: 66 HANNAH This place looks like something out of a men's magazine. 
JACOB Is that a compliment? 
HANNAH I'm not sure. 
Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones. 
HANNAH I like this song. 
JACOB I thought you would. (THEN) Drink? 
HANNAH Yes, please. 
Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings them (and the bottle) over towards the couch. 
He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down. 
JACOB Cheers. 
HANNAH Cheers. 
They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She holds out her glass for a refill. 
Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking... 
HANNAH So is this how it normally works? 
JACOB What? 
HANNAH How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink? 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 JACOB Yes. That's how it normally works. 
Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig. 
HANNAH And then you sleep with them? 
JACOB Yes. 
HANNAH So that's what happens next? We sleep together? 
JACOB At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. 
She takes a deep breath, admits: 
HANNAH I'm very nervous. 
JACOB I'm getting that. 
HANNAH I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. 
Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS. 
JACOB You're adorable. 
Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy. 
HANNAH No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here! (THEN) I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me. 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (3) 66 JACOB I don't think people say `bang' anymore. 
HANNAH I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! 
Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up. 
HANNAH Okay, okay, this is happening. (THEN) Take off your shirt. 
JACOB What? 
HANNAH I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. 
Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped. 
HANNAH Holy crap. 
She pokes a finger at his abs. 
HANNAH It's like you're photo-shopped. 
HANNAH And time for stuff like that? 
He LAUGHS. 
JACOB My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually... 
We PULL BACK as they continue chatting. 
TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then another. 
Body language shifts. 
-- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more. 
-- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's 
Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him. 
CUE MUSIC as we begin a... 
MONTAGE. IN ONE CONTINUOUS DOLLY MOVE WE HEAD, FIRST, TO... 
69 INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING 69 
Hannah looks longingly at Jacob's plate of pancakes. 
He notices, switches plates. 
She smiles. He smiles. God, he's crazy about her. 
He looks at the next table, watches a LOVELORN GUY switch plates with his GIRLFRIEND. 
Uh-oh. 
70 INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 70 
DOLLY DOWN the row, HANDS are held between COUPLES, all entranced by the movie, until we REVEAL: 
JACOB 
staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's. He looks terrified. 
71 INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - EVENING 71 
Now it's Hannah who's asleep in bed, and Jacob who stares at her lovingly. Suddenly, he catches himself. 
In a series of COMEDIC JUMP-CUTS, he wrestles with the implications of what's happening to him. 
-- Pacing. A drink. A big drink. Fingers pulling at his own hair. Hyperventilating. More staring. More pacing. 
CUT TO: 
71A INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM 71A 
And finally, he loses the battle: he tucks Hannah under a blanket, kisses her forehead, and finally... 
Gives in to falling in love with her. 
CUT TO: 
72 INT. BAR - EVENING 72 
Cal is sitting at the table that once belonged to Jacob. He suddenly seems very alone. (CONTINUED) 72 CONTINUED: 72 He looks towards the bar, notices that same SAD SACK MIDDLE-AGED GUY. Also alone. He picks up his cell. 
73 INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 73 
Tracy sits at a table, FLOWERS off to the side. Her phone rings. She looks at it, sees it's "Cal." She hits IGNORE. 
PULL BACK to reveal DAVID JACOBWITZ, across from her. He looks at Tracy and smiles. She smiles back weakly. 
74 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - LATER 74 
The awkward end of a first date. David walks Tracy to the front door. She's carrying those same flowers. 
Awkward beat. 
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I was wondering if -- 
TRACY David, stop. Look, I had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the... times I've been having lately. So, I don't think I'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime I guess I wouldn't say no. 
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Wow. You know, that's exactly what I was thinking. It's almost uncanny. 
They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry. Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then... 
THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there. 
JESSICA Hello. 
TRACY Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry. Jessica, this is my work-friend. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 74 CONTINUED: 74 TRACY (CONT'D) He's an accountant named David. David, this is my baby-sitter, Jessica. Okay, David, well everything sounds great. Spreadsheets. 
88 INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM 88 
Meanwhile. Claire is putting away laundry. She throws some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer. 
Notices something. An envelope. It's addressed to Cal Weaver. Curiosity piqued, she picks it up. Looks inside. Almost faints. 
89 INT. CLAIRE AND BERNIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 89 
Big Bernie sits in a recliner, watching football and drinking a cold one. Jessica lies on the floor, doing homework. 
Claire ENTERS, ashen. Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the envelope. Jessica looks up, sees it. 
JESSICA No!!!! 
She jumps, but it's too late. 
(CONTINUED) 89 CONTINUED: 89 ON BERNIE 
Staring at the picture. We don't see it, but we get the point: it's a father's worst nightmare. 
Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope. He looks at the envelope again. 
ON ENVELOPE 
Cal's name. A heart. 
BACK TO SCENE 
JESSICA Daddy? 
Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY. 
ON JESSICA 
Realizing. She grabs a second set of keys. 
90 EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 90 
Jessica runs into a second car. Races after her father. 
91 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE 91 
Meanwhile. Tracy approaches Robbie. Not only is he wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES. Tracy LAUGHS. 
TRACY Baby! What are you wearing!? 
ROBBIE Dad's here. 
Tracy's face drops. 
ROBBIE I have to blindfold you. 
TRACY (WEARY) What is this? What is he doing? 
(CONTINUED) 91 CONTINUED: 91 ROBBIE Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive. 
She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind. 
He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER! 
ROBBIE Okay, we're good, let's do this. 
92 INT. BERNIE'S CAR 92 
Meanwhile. There's no expression on Bernie's face. It's frightening. He looks down at passenger seat. At the ENVELOPE bearing Cal's address. 
He RACES through a light. A HORN blares behind him. 
93 INT. JESSICA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 93 
Jessica is the one BLARING THE HORN, crying and panicked. 
She too RACES through the same light. 
94 EXT. WEAVER BACKYARD 94 
Robbie leads a blindfolded Tracy into the backyard. She looks like a zombie with all the scarves over her face. We see what she is not yet privy to. 
ON THE BACKYARD 
Cal's Shangri-La has been transformed: the yard holds a FULL-BLOWN MINIATURE GOLF HOLE, windmill and all. 
Cal stands behind it all, in a tux. 
CAL Hi, T. 
TRACY Can I take these off, please? 
CAL Almost. Kids? 
ROBBIE Is that Jessica? 
BAM! Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw. 
HANNAH Daddy! 
JESSICA Daddy! 
TRACY (YANKING ON BLINDFOLD) What's happening? 
Bernie is pummeling Cal. 
BERNIE I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S SEVENTEEN! 
Jacob dives in. Tries to pull Bernie off. Bernie NAILS Jacob with an UPPERCUT! 
HANNAH Jacob! 
CAL (GETTING PUMMELLED) Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! 
Bernie picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF COURSE, readies to bash it over Cal's head. Jessica throws herself on Cal. 
JESSICA Daddy, stop! 
This breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates. 
JESSICA He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know. 
(CONTINUED) 94 CONTINUED: (5) 94 ROBBIE Know what? 
CAL Know what? 
TRACY (STILL BLINDFOLDED) Robbie, please get this off me! 
ROBBIE (struggling with it) I'm TRYING! 
JESSICA He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him! 
Robbie stops, turns. 
ROBBIE With who? 
JESSICA (pointing at Cal) With him. 
CAL Are you pointing at me? 
ROBBIE Are you pointing at him? 
TRACY Who is she pointing at!? 
ROBBIE (PROCESSING) Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing? 
BERNIE I knew it. 
He gets ready to pummel some more. Jessica grabs him. 
JESSICA (TO BERNIE) He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him. 
ROBBIE You made him dirty pictures? Oh God. 
(CONTINUED) 94 CONTINUED: (6) 94 Robbie looks to Cal. He's angry, jealous, and broken- hearted all at once. 
ROBBIE (TO CAL) You're the one? You're the one she... (then, furious) You stole my soulmate. 
CAL Wait: Jessica is your soulmate? 
VOICE (O.S.) I'm sorry, is Tracy home? 
Everyone turns: DAVID JACOBOWITZ stands in the doorway. He's holding up a SWEATER in his right hand. 
DAVID JACOBOWITZ You left your sweater in my car the other night. 
HANNAH Who are you? 
DAVID JACOBOWITZ David Jacobowitz. 
JACOB David Jacobowitz! 
CAL David Jacobowitz!? 
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Is this a bad time -- 
WHACK!!! Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right hook. 
HANNAH Jacob! 
JACOB You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!? 
Before Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob. 
CAL AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT DIDN'T YOU, SWEETHEART!? 
This time it's Tracy whose face registers shock. Hannah takes Jacob's hand, pulls him away. 
JACOB (one last try) Cal, c'mon -- 
But Cal won't even look at him. 
MOLLY (CALLING OUT) Goodbye, Nanna. (CONTINUED) 97 CONTINUED: (2) 97 HANNAH (THROUGH TEARS) Goodbye, cutie. 
They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things. 
CAL She's all yours, David. 
Ouch. 
TRACY (WOUNDED) Nice. 
Before he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie. 
CAL Go big or go home, right, buddy? 
Robbie looks up at him, cold. 
ROBBIE Go home, Dad. 
Cal NODS, EXITS. 
98 INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - THE NEXT MONTH 98 
CUE: John Mayer's "Who Says." 
1) ROBBIE, at school. His spirit is crushed. He looks at his CONTACT LIST, thinks, and DELETES JESSICA. 
99 JESSICA 99 2) at home, grounded and sad. 
100 JACOB 100 
3) trying to get HANNAH to make a phone call to her father... she won't. 
101 TRACY 101 
4) at her office, finally taking down the picture of her and Cal. And speaking of Cal... 
102 INT. BAR - AFTERNOON (THREE WEEKS LATER) 102 
Cal sits back at his usual table. This isn't "Cool Cal," the Jacob disciple. No, this is "Sad Mess Cal." He's grown a patchy beard. He's wearing a ratty sweatsuit. 
He's drinking, once again, vodka-cranberry out of a wimpy red straw. It's pathetic. A WAITRESS APPROACHES. 
WAITRESS Can I get you another? 
CAL What time is it? 
WAITRESS 2:30. In the afternoon. 
CAL 2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress. (THEN) Yes, another drink would be grand. 
She EXITS. 
Cal feels bad for that one. As she re-approaches: 
CAL That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick. 
JACOB (O.S.) Ah, it's okay, I deserved it. 
ON JACOB 
Standing there. As always, he looks perfectly put together. He takes in Cal. 
JACOB It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal. 
CAL What do you want? 
JACOB Can I sit? 
CAL I don't know, can you? 
(CONTINUED) 102 CONTINUED: 102 JACOB Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children? 
CAL (MIMICKING) `Are we going to be mature or act like children?' 
JACOB Okay, so like children then. Move over. 
Jacob SLIDES in. 
JACOB I'd like to talk. 
CAL You still seeing my daughter?

He has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is on the other side. He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course. In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like stones in a stream. 
He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing.    He then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger holes. 
After a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse, three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall. 
He then triumphantly pulls out a painting.     It's the one!, 
SUIT MAN What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art stored in that one, curious brain of yours. 
BEAN beams. 
INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.   BOARDROOM - DAY 
GARETH Then we are agreed, gentlemen.   He goes. 
VINCENT Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render Mr. Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete. 
HUBERT There's no question. 
LORD WALTON Very well.   Mr Bean is.... art history.    We can all stop taking the pills. 
A reserved smatter of laughter, from relief more than anything.      LORD W. talks into an intercom on the table. 
LORD WALTON Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom, please. 
MISS HUTCHINSON (V/O ) 
Yes sir. oh, and Lord Walton, the Grierson Gallery called again. 
LORD WALTON Thank you. (To the room) One final thing. Once again we have been invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly modest collection - but it does include the most famous American painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts? 
Cut to the trustees - they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not very interested. A 106 year old SIR RUPERT puts up his hand. 
LORD WALTON Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge. Your invaluable thoughts, sir? 
SIR RUPERT Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question. 
CUT TO: 
INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      STORAGE OFFICE - DAY 
Back in his office area BEAN ceremoniously hands SUIT MAN the Van Hocht painting. He's very proud of himself. 
SUIT MAN Thank you, Bean.      You're a genius. 
BEAN laughs - delighted.         SUIT MAN exits and MISS HUTCHINSON enters, warily. 
MISS HUTCHINSON Mr. Bean.     Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom. 
BEAN gives a little pleasured squeak.             How exciting for him.   He follows MISS HUTCHINSON out into the corridor. 
CUT TO: INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      CORRIDOR.   DAY 
BEAN    walks along    the same corridor as before. Turns off another light. Then comes    to the room    where he saw the Programmer. The computer, showing a Van Gogh    portrait, is    on and no-one's there. BEAN, who hates wasted electricity, goes    in to switch    it off. 
We see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room - with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located. BEAN is clearly going to be replaced by this programme. Or not ... BEAN searches for the plug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the back the computer. The entire system clicks off. At which moment the Programmer comes back in. 
PROGRAMMER What's happening here? 
BEAN Ahm... 
With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And a disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on white, then pop out completely. 
BEAN Ah.... Ahm.... 
BEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable into another circuit. The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen. BEAN and PROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief. BEAN smiles and leaves quickly. But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides down the screen like a water-colour in the rain. The PROG difficult to breathe. 
CUT TO: INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      BOARDROOM - DAY 
LORD WALTON You have your voting slips, gentlemen.          Please remember the 
Americans are looking for something quite high powered.     A doctorate preferably... 
There is a knock at the door. BEAN enters. LORD WALTON smiles. The rest of the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug. BEAN is very nervous indeed. 
LORD WALTON (gravely) Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news which will not, I'm afraid... 
The phone rings. LORD WALTON answers. BEAN sits next to VINCENT and sniffs at him. VINCENT's breath hasn't improved. 
LORD WALTON (into phone) Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How? All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here will    you, dear boy. 
GRIERSON 
Various things. Thank you. However, as you know, this is not an inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very serious crap right now. 
He can't quite hide his tackiness.) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON - then sees an old woman coming towards him. He waits for her to go through, and due to his sweetness, is again left behind. He rushes to catch up. 
They are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop. DAVID exchanges smiles with the cashier, ANNIE. Very bubbly, not very bright. The shop is full of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes. 
GRIERSON So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel. 
BERNIE Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period. 
GRIERSON David? 
DAVID Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ... 
GRIERSON I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ... 
DAVID on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due? 
GRIERSON hands DAVID a piece of paper. 
GRIERSON Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that? 
PAUSE 
DAVID No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it. CUT TO: 
INT.    LONDON . PHOTO BOOTH.    DAY. 
The camera faces Mr BEAN sitting in a Photo booth. His face is totally impassive for 1, 2, then 3 flashes. And then, just before the 4th flash, he pulls the biggest, maddest face you've ever seen. Flash! He gives a little 
Satisfied giggle. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.    THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY 
7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a bum-fluff moustache. 
DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them. 
DAVID Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some more. 
The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON, has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are laughing in the car as DAVID walks up. 
He is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID. 
CHARLES Hello, David. 
DAVID Hi, Charles. (To Alison) Wow - late! 
ALISON (brightly) I had to do some last minute stuff. 
CHARLES My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you, gallery going well? 
DAVID Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it .... 
ALISON Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short. 
Alison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better - she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out. 
ALISON Kevin!   You stop that right now! 
CHARLES Great kids.     Good looking too. 
DAVID You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay, looks-wise. 
CHARLES 
Take after their mother, huh? 
DAVID Ah ... absolutely. 
DAVID is not very happy here. 
CUT TO: INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   KITCHEN - DAY 
It is open plan and leads through into the lounge. DAVID and ALISON enter. ALISON puts her port folio on the table and leads DAVID onto a sofa. She puts her arms round him. 
ALISON Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi. 
BEAN acts fast.    He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's cup of tea. 
He sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns. Simultaneously, the man tries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea. A horrid experience for both. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   AEROPLANE - DAY. 
Boarding time. BEAN enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the plane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back up to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the elegance, and space of First class. 
BEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments from this nightmare flight. 
1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess slides it into the compartment above her head. 
OLD LADY Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter. 
The next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the     same locker, and tries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks at BEAN suspiciously. 
2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man, whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual. 
Champagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well practised art).     No response. 
BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face - straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless. 
Then 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his mouth, chews it into a spitball 
And rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under high pressure, shoots 
into it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start. 
3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better. 
4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading. 
But even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards sleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and unfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact with REYNOLDS'   flies. 
From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked, comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON.... 
5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him. Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess. 
6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son isn't very well. 
BEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them. 
He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill to be impressed. 
BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea. He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them. 
He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun. 
Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes, that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     ARRIVALS - NIGHT 
The traditional exit area. A random bunch of people are waiting - relatives, limousine drivers - and, rather strangely, three 30 year old women dressed in curly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie'. 
The LEARYS are at the barrier. KEVIN has a cardboard sign with 'MR. BEAN' written on it. People are streaming out of the Arrivals gate. ALISON is not happy. Actually no one is. JENNIFER looks particularly fed up. 
DAVID 
For all you know, he may be a very attractive young man. 
JENNIFER Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.   All Englishmen are ugly. 
DAVID What makes you say that? 
JENNIFER All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors. 
DAVID Richard Burton was very good-looking. 
JENNIFER Welsh. 
DAVID Sean Connery. 
ALISON Scottish. 
DAVID Tom Jones? 
JENNIFER Welsh again. 
DAVID 
No, no.   I'11 try again ... 
ALISON I said, I'11 go. 
She goes. KEVIN shakes his head disappointedly al,-- his father. DAVID slumps down on the seat. He overhears JENNIFER flirting with an incredibly undesirable bloke in a leather jacket - white, with Rasta hair extensions, and about sixty rings in his nose. (This is STINGO). 
JENNIFER So. where do your parents live? 
STINGO My parents are dead. 
DAVID is pretty confident that he knows who killed them. 
JENNIFER Yeah, so are mine.

EXT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     TAXI RANK. NIGHT 
COP 1 puts BEAN in the back of a taxi with his case.      He

He slams the door and the taxi drives away.

EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT 
The taxi draws up outside the house.      BEAN gets out with his case.   The CAB DRIVER is strangely friendly. 
CAB DRIVER Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya. In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya, with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener, ya know that? 
BEAN smiles politely. Taxi drives away. BEAN walks up to' the front porch, checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. No answer. Presses again. Still no answer ... Now where have they hidden the key. He inspects things carefully. 
The camera sees what he sees ... the     doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge ... and then he spots a little stone     frog. BEAN smiles. Key hiding is something he knows about - and people     are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN picks up the FROG to reveal the front     door key. It glints in the porch-light. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.     HALLWAY - NIGHT 
BEAN lets himself in. The pre-alarm buzzer goes off quietly. He has 15 seconds before the alarm goes off proper. He strolls confidently to where the alarm control unit obviously is ... under the stairs. 
Close-up of flashing L.E.D. Again, BEAN looks carefully and finds the magnetic box, housing a little key, attached to the underside of the console. Just as the alarm goes off, for the splittest of a secondette, he turns the key in its slot ... and is safe. 
BEAN finds the switch and turns on the hall light. He switches it off again ... then on. Then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly.Fun.

KEVIN and JENNIFER are asleep in the back. DAVID drives in silence, Alison next to him. Uneasy atmosphere. DAVID stabs at buttons on the car radio. 
ALISON It isn't working any more, David. 
DAVID I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it. Stupid thing. 
DAVID That poor guy, Bean ... He's probably still sitting at London Airport! 
He finishes his teeth then runs the hot faucet.       He exits to bedroom as BEAN enters from hall with dirty socks.

CUT TO: 
INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      LANDING ~ NIGHT 
BEAN notices a framed photograph on the wall. It is of the LEARY family. They are grouped outside their house. It is a very happy picture. BEAN smiles at it. He takes it off the wall and takes it into a bedroom. As the door quietly closes we see the sign: 'JENNIFER'.

Lights are out.       DAVID and ALISON in bed.    The latter is facing away. 
DAVID I need to make a confession. I know you're awake.       Please, it's important. 
(Long pause) 
ALISON (without stirring) Go ahead. 
DAVID I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator. 
ALISON smiles in spite of herself. She turns over and puts her arm around DAVID. She gets up close to his face. 
ALISON There were three strawberries. 
DAVID One. 
ALISON Liar. 
DAVID 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know. 
ALISON smiles, sleepily, and goes to kiss him. She stops and sniffs. Thoroughly put off, she rolls over and closes her eyes. 
DAVID Ali?    What's wrong? 
ALISON Your face smells like a foot.

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY 
The whole family charges out onto the landing. JENNIFER hurtles out of her room screaming. She barges through the family and locks herself in the bathroom. 
ALISON What is it?    Jennifer! 
JENNIFER (0.O.V.) ... There's a man ... there's a man ... there's a man in my... 
DAVID Honey, calm down now... it's okay... 
JENNIFER (p.o.v.) There's a man.    I woke up next to a man ... 
KEVIN 
It wouldn't be the first time. 
ALISON Shut up, Kevin. (to Jennifer) Honey, you-re not making sense ... 
DAVID It's okay.    There's no one out here. Just open the door.   Trust me. 
Pause ... then a click of the bathroom lock ... Jennifer comes out. Then there's another click. BEAN breezes out of Jennifer's bedroom, past the family, in his pyjamas, carrying a wash bag and a towel over his arm. He waves to them friendly, slips into the bathroom and closes the door. The family stare in amazement. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE He doesn't like to say much does he? 
DAVID Right first time. 
ANNIE I can understand THAT. Neither do I. 
As BEAN and DAVID move on, BEAN gives ANNIE a 1ittle wave. She waves sweetly back. She cocks her head to one side and watches him go. She likes Mr. BEAN a lot. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GRIERSON GALLERY. GROUND FLOOR- DAY 
BEAN and DAVID arrive In the ground floor gallery. A few visitors are viewing the paintings. The acknowledge ELMER, the huge, ex-army, Security Man, sitting on a small chair by a wall, reading a newspaper. The pass two oldish ladies inspecting a painting 
DAVID You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep aesthetic level. 
Stay with the ladies as DAVID and BEAN head on. 
OLD LADY 1 What do you think? 
OLD LADY 2 0h yes - lovely - very nice. 
OLD LADY 1 And what colour would you use for the curtains? 
OLD LADY 2 Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom would be nice in this yellow .... 
And-they head on to a Van Gogh with a nice yellow in it. 
BEAN stops to admire a painting. It is Pre-Raphaelite in style, depicting a woman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber. She is wearing a chastity belt fastened with a small padlock, her breasts are concealed under a draped flag. 
It is a tasteful and romantic picture. 
DAVID Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96. Know it? 
BEAN shakes his head. It's the padlock he's interested in he points at it and smiles. ANNIE walks up. 
ANNIE Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs. 
DAVID Thanks, Annie. 
ANNIE walks off back the way she came, looking at BEAN approvingly over her shoulder. 
DAVID Better go.    Grierson hates people being late. 
BEAN Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ... 
He gestures that held like to tidy up a little. Brush his hair, etc. BEAN waddles off after ANNIE clearly in need of relief. DAVID watches him go. 
DAVID Why me? 
CUT TO: 
INT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY. 
BEAN is catching up with ANNIE. She notices him following and coyly smiles to herself. She stops, turns round and grins. She thinks he has come to say something to her. 
BEAN stops dead in front of her - then turns sharp left into the men's washroom. ANNIE's smile fades. 
CUT TO: 
INT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   WASH ROOM - DAY 
BEAN    comes out of a booth. He tidies his hair and tie in a mirror. He pushes down    the pressurised tap to wash his hands. It splashes terribly. The whole front    of his trousers are soaked. The last thing you want when about to meet your    new boss. Damn! 
There now follow a quick, complicated piece of business. 
1/ BEAN spots a paper-towel dispenser. He turns towards it at just the moment a man exits from a booth - BEAN turns back to the sink to hide his trousers, as the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the last towel. Damn again. 
2/ BEAN    now puts    his hope in a rolling    towel. But it's rather high. He has to jump    to try to    reach the trouser.     At which point Another Man enters. Jumping    BEAN has    been caught in a very    weird position. He pretends he has .chosen    the Men's    Room as the place to    do his rather energetic exercise routine. 
3/ As the man leaves, he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth. Another Man enters. Again, BEAN is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more exercises. That man also enters a booth. 
4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work. Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's working excellently. 
5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the mirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position. He pretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly and polishes. The man leaves, BEAN smiles.           But as he exits, BEAN's face transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb. 
6/ BEAN rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the water - and soaks himself all over again. At which moment, DAVID enters, exasperated. 
DAVID Come on!     Let's go! 
BEAN exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch.          They enter the corridor, and he spots a newspaper. 
DAVID You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir. 
GRIERSON beams. 
MIX THROUGH TO: 
INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
End of the day.. ANNIE perks    up at the reception desk as DAVID, but especially BEAN, approaches    from the gallery area. She has a pile of tissues near-by and draws a    heart on one of them. She arranges it on the counter-top where BEAN could    not fail to see it on his way to the exit. 
DAVID Goodnight Annie. 
ANNIE Night. 
BEAN does not even notice her.    As DAVID heads for the exit, BEAN suddenly sneezes. 
He reaches for ANNIE's love message and blows his nose on it. He drops the tissue in a bin as he exits. 
ANNIE sighs her disappointment. 
CUT TO: EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BY PARKING LOT - DAY 
(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask, performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers. 
The MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb her hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman quickly moves on. 
BEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to him - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of a tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a pane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass wall, and hits the MIME's nose. 
CUT TO: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off. 
The MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last.    He 
takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed. 
The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns .... 
But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it. 
The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the terrified MIME. 
Finally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50 yards away. 
BEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded, leans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same as this morning). 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT - DAY 
DAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible. 
DAVID 
Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good. Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right, Bean, or ... (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay? 
BEAN nods.   DAVID gets out and heads for the mall.   Nearby woman tramp (BAG LADY) goes   through a trash can. 
BEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate. 
BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to them as if to say: "Are these yours?" 
[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.] 
Then suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall, weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight, 
a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.      As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old friend, the MIME. 
ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his pockets ... 
BEAN leans into shot.     He holds out the keys, grinning. 
ROBBER Gimme the keys! 
BEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the spot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman. He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual. 
ROBBER I said, give me the keys! 
BEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The perplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts it hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground, the bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality. 
But not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face, ticking him off for breaking the rules. 
ROBBER OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!! 
DAVID Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do it) ... to say good night. Okay? 
BEAN nods.    DAVID smiles and goes to the door. 
BE-AN waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. Even when we feel sorry for him, he's a little rude. DAVID walks away, shaking his head. 
DAVID Spineless. CUT TO: 
INT.   DAVID AND ALISON'S BEDROOM. 
The first morning without ALISON.    "She's Gone" by Hall & Oats begins to play, a song full of yearning. 
DAVID feels the other side of the bed.    No-one there. 
He walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Then walks back into the bedroom - She's gone - I've got to learn how to face it " He takes a towel from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. He feels very alone. 
He removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower. - she's gone - she's gone" - but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all. BEAN has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself, wearing ALISON's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them.

DAVID sitting down at table, with BEAN, who is tucking in happily ~ eating a burger & bun with knife and fork. DAVID speaks after a longish pause. 
DAVID Bean can I ask you something? 
BEAN nods. 
DAVID Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think? 
BEAN thinks hard, then looks at his watch, makes his excuses and simple walks away.

INT.    BEAN'S BED-SIT.     DAY 
10 am U.K.    time. (The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on the T.V. A    morning kids show blares out. A huge wardrobe stands four feet away from    a wall. There is a string tied to one of it's door handles, stretching    out of shot. The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an angel. It     rocks slightly and creaks. (Feature its padlock). 
There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw fashion. One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe. 
BEAN's G.P.O. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table. It lands on the end of the ironing board. The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. The string tied to its handle becomes taut. 
CUT TO: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the string is tied to it. The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket. The T.V. screen goes blank. Shot of TEDDY in the cardboard hotel'.

INT.    CANTEEN.   DAY. 
BEAN returns, sits down and starts to eat again. David is still deep in thought. 
DAVID 
Well, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of thing. Take it day by day. Keep working. Keep to your normal patterns. That's the only hope. So let's just ... take today shall we? 
BEAN nods.    He is not on David's emotional level here. 
DAVID I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame. She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the flesh? 
Sure enough, all around are posters, and the silhouette of Whistler's Mother. BEAN nods, though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin he's found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers.

INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY. 
BEAN and David en route to the painting. 
DAVID I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but' let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great works of art is true, huh? 
CUT TO: 
INT.    THE WHOLE GALLERY - DAY 
BEAN and DAVID do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors - in an elevator. A sense of expectation and excitement. En route, they are joined by ELMER, the huge Security Guard. 
The three arrive outside a large oak door. ELMER ceremoniously unlocks the door, all the time glaring at BEAN - who swallows hard. A light turns green and a buzzer sounds. 
Then there is the door to the inner sanctum. ELMER stares at BEAN as he unlocks it. Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds. 
DAVID As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right? 
CUT TO: 
INT.-GRIERSON GALLERY.     OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Pause. Then out comes BEAN, drying his empty hands, miming, "Sorry, Sorry.". We see into the toilet. nothing there. No sign of the painting. BEAN turns sharply left. 
CUT TO: EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY 
DAVID is talking to BERNIE in the grounds.       We can see the side of the whole gallery in shot as they talk. 
BERNIE I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project today. 
DAVID Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know? 
BERNIE Howls he getting on with the family? 
DAVID Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great. 
We will be slightly distracted by      the observation that Whistler's Mother, America's most valuable painting,      is at this moment balanced on a very thin ledge three floors up - where Bean      has put in, outside the Men's room window. A bird and then a couple       more birds perch on it. 
BERNIE And howls Alison? 
DAVID She's ... well, she's good. 
BERNIE Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking. 
DAVID Yes, isn't he. 
BERNIE 
It's great when people who work together can become real friends. 
DAVID Isn't it? 
BERNIE I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that way, huh? 
DAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely. 
Now we see BEAN's plan -    he has emerged at a nearby window. He    can't reach the painting at first.     So he stretches further and further out   the window. No good. Finally he has     to go out on the ledge. He shoos away    the birds, who then decide to settle on    him instead. Finally he gets a hand on    the painting. As he does so, he loses    hold. He just manages to grabs a window    before he falls. 
DAVID Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy. 
BERNIE Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure. 
Period. 
BEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the painting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go. 
BERNIE By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or we're all in the crap house. What     do you think? 
DAVID 'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right? 
BERNIE Not necessarily. That's where this ... ( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN ) comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough. 
BERNIE grins and walks away. Bean does one final swing, and .... 
CUT TO: 
INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.   STOREROOM - DAY. 
A small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through the window. He has the picture and is safe. 
He sets the picture down on a table.      Darn!   The birds have done their business on it. 
He maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. He chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs. This smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new. 
BEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening.      The liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror, America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas. 
BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where       once was a sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like Danny de Vito. 
Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately, there's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more. Total destruction. 
CUT TO: 
INT.     GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY. 
BEAN Hurries down the corridor with his pseudo-trolley again, and a vaguely mad look on his face. He spots ANNIE at a drinks machine. She smiles sweetly (here comes her man) BEAN takes a sharp left into an adjacent corridor. ANNIE is hurt. 
ANNIE True love can be very hard. 
CUT TO: 
BEAN Actually I'm not a... 
DAVID That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes. 
GRIERSON Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself... 
DAVID No! 
GRIERSON Er ... pray tell me why? 
ELMER Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir.     That's why. 
BEAN and DAVID die and go to hell until ELMER laughs at his own little joke. GRIERSON laughs too. 
ELMER I better continue my rounds, sir.. 
He strolls away. 
DAVID The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift. 
GRIERSON Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh? 
DAVID Exactly.   She's in a surprisingly terrible state.    Isn't she, Bean? 
BEAN Oh yes. 
DAVID Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints .... 
BEAN hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing. 
The colours are beginning to fade. However ~     if you give me just one little year I can restore the picture to its original    glory, the way it looked when Whistler's Mom first looked at it and said....    0 Actually I'm not sure you've got the hair right, darling." By the way, your    hair is looking great today, sir. 
GRIERSON Thank you David.   However, flattery will get you nowhere.    Truth 
is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama. Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ... 
DAVID ... you have to sack me.     I understand, sir.    I'll go quietly.     In fact I'll go right now. 
GRIERSON No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother. 
DAVID lets out a little yelp. 
GRIERSON Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective       buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the       news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you? 
DAVID Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo. 
GRIERSON leaves.    DAVID turns to BEAN. 
DAVID Bean.   Do you drink? 
BEAN shakes his head. 
DAVID Neither do I. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   BAR - NIGHT 
It is very late and very gloomy. Just a couple of loners staring into their drinks. The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the sports pages. There is a T.V. on above the bar, showing baseball. 
BEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar. The latter has had far too much whisky and looks the worse for it. BEAN has a tall glass packed with fruit and paper umbrellas. We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. DAVID almost, but not quite, slurs his words: 
DAVID It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job - lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean? 
He turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose. 
DAVID I guess not. 
He fills his glass from a bottle. 
You know, I don't get it. The New Artist     exhibition-this year - people might not all have liked the dead    sheep, but ... the place didn't look that empty to me. It wasn't     full but I saw people. I just don't understand how the gallery can    be so bankrupt they have to sell the Whistler. 
He looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril. DAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely .... 
DAVID He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it? 
BARTENDER goes back to reading. DAVID searches for his last train of thought, taking a huge swig from his drink. 
DAVID ... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then, I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels. 
BEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick. He throws a peanut high into the air - and catches it in his mouth. Then does two. Then does it with his eyes closed. Actually, it's rather impressive. 
He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with DAVID's key card. 
The job is done.     He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin, and heads off.

DAVID 0 my God. Tell it vas a dream. 
The door swings open.       It is Bean with a tray of coffee and toast. 
BEAN Morning. 
DAVID It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.

Still highly amused, BEAN      guides DAVID in the direction of Whistler's Room. David takes out his key to      open the room - but the door swings open. DAVID is shocked. There stands       GRIERSON, looking straight at Whistler's Mum. In all its untorn, unsmudged,      undestroyed glory. 
GRIERSON I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s. 
DAVID Ahm.... 
GRIERSON Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?       Don't want anything to go wrong. 
DAVID Quite right, sir. 
Grierson leaves.    David gets close to the painting and peers .... 
DAVID Wait a minute. 
BEAN just puts his finger to his mouth... 
BEAN Ssshhhh. 
He lets out a hug smile - he can solve the problems of the world, as well as create them.

JENNIFER skips down t-he stairs, carrying a trendy duffel bag, just as DAVID enters from the kitchen. 
JENNIFER Bye, Dad. 
DAVID Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.    Jen? 
ANNIE Did he now? 
KEVIN He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain cell count of about two and a half. 
ANNIE Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually. (to Bean) But I'm great in bed. 
BEAN is unsettled by this.     He gives a shudder and heads for the gallery. 
KEVIN Catch you later, babe.(goes after Bean) Come on, Beanie - there must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't do anything.

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.    DAY. 
BERNIE, DAVID and GRIERSON. BERNIE looks very confident at a computer monitor. A painting is in fact 'doing' something, on the computer screen, as the girls in a Toulouse-Lautrec painting actually dance the can-can. 
GRIERSON Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David? 
DAVID Certainly is. 
BERNIE We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the Governor. 
GRIERSON Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team. 
DAVID slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team.      He looks

KEVIN and BEAN have found a computer,    also showing BERNIE's Gallery programme. The monitor shows the interior of the    ground floor of the gallery. KEVIN clicks, and up comes the same Toulouse    Lautrec picture. As KEVIN works the mouse, BEAN hums the catchy tune from    'GOBLINS 21. It's play time again. 
KEVIN This is way cool, Beanie. 
He clicks again, and a tiny talking Toulouse Lautrec starts to explain the provenance of the painting.

DAVID is overseeing things. There's a burgundy rope, keeping people a bit away from the case in which Whistler's Mother is contained. ELMER brings in two large flower displays. BERNIE enters. 
BERNIE Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who actually gets things done. 
He exits. BERNIE is growing in confidence - and getting nastier by the minute. DAVID pulls a face at ELMER. 
DAVID You arrange those flowers yourself? 
ELMER Sure did. 
DAVID They're pretty.   Learn it in the army? 
ELMER No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

The final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up-tempo, "we're getting ready" music. 
1.    Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc. And someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something which might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting. 
2.    BERNIE watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in the gallery flickers and starts up. 
3.    ANNIE at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational. She shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an imaginary V.I.P. 
4.    ELMER, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat with scissors. He has a row of war medals on his chest. He polishes them proudly with his sleeve.

Close on the bottom    of the black cars rear door. It opens and a pair of legs, wearing black shoes    and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet. As they walk purposely    up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to reveal that this is    BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by GRIERSON at the main    entrance. 
GRIERSON What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. (checks a prompt card). 
BERNIE And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.

The staff and various dignitaries are lined, looking out through the glass in anticipation. Through the glass we see a couple of Police Motorcycle Escorts pull up outside followed by a beautiful, old, classic Rolls Royce. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY 
The red carpet unrolls all the way to the Rolls, rear door. Close on the bottom of the driver's door. It opens and out step a pair of legs, wearing army boots and khaki trousers. 
The legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. Camera pans up to show us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of medals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same grand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before heading on. 
BRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him.       They are the Police presence today. 
GRIERSON and BERNIE greet REYNOLDS at the entrance. 
GRIERSON is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit.       BERNIE is frowning - not happy about that uniform. 
GRIERSON what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome. 
REYNOLDS Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.       Going on To my regiment/s reunion after. 
GRIERSON Not at all, Governor.    Very striking. 
REYNOLDS takes in GRIERSON's suit. 
REYNOLDS Interesting suit. 
GRIERSON (Beaming) Why thank you sir. 
REYNOLDS off the peg? 
GRIERSON (crestfallen ) Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ... 
He gestures to BERNIE but REYNOLDS cuts in and hands BERNIE a set of car keys. 
REYNOLDS (To Bernie) Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son. 
BERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers the car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and follows the Governor. 
BEAN (wearing "Dr Bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door, thus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to delegate. 
BERNIE Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you. 
BEAN assents happily. BRUTUS spies BEAN over his shoulder and frowns - its that mad English guy again. BEAN gets to the door and sees the Governor's car. Yummy!

GRIERSON leads REYNOLDS to the reception counter, as BERNIE sneaks up to take his position again. ELMER is in the background trying to look professional, deferring to BRUTUS. 
ANNIE steps out from behind the counter, curtsies and ,shakes REYNOLDS' hand. 
ANNIE Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller than you were half an hour ago. 
REYNOLDS Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much. 
ANNIE Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does she 0 have a decent job? 
REYNOLDS Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine. 
He spots KEVIN and winks at him.      KEVIN smiles back. CUT TO:

BEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather seat. 
He starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact. Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left. 
BEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the one he's used to. 
He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't large enough. 
With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process. BEAN looks a tadge concerned. 
CUT TO: 
INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY. 
REYNOLDS has moved on to ELMER who salutes crisply.         REYNOLDS returns the salute with pride. 
It's part of his plan of caution - he knows there's something wrong - and wants as few people as possible to .see the painting close up. The crowd moves back. 
DAVID I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with his new friend. 
REYNOLDS is flattered. Silence. DAVID inserts the plastic card key - opens the doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistler's Mother'. Respectful silence. 
REYNOLDS is delighted.     He stands back to inspect her. 
REYNOLDS Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to me - or should I say ten million dollars! 
Everyone applauds. 
GRIERSON Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it 
myself, rather 'expensive' champagne. (grins smugly) 
People start to file out. REYNOLDS, GRIERSON, BERNIE and DAVID stay behind. DAVID spots BEAN arriving. He hands the car keys back to BERNIE with a slightly dazed smile. DAVID eagerly takes his arm and brings him over. 
DAVID Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from England. 
They turn to each other - recognition from BEAN "it's the man from the plane". He does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before REYNOLDS recognises him... 
BEAN Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ... 
BEAN turns. In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone getting too close to the great painting. He spins and falls in the direction of the painting. 
CUT TO: the looks of horror on all the faces. 
CUT TO: BEAN, reaching out to keep himself standing. We think he's going to tear the painting. He doesn't. He simply catches hold of the bottom of the ornate frame. It ,,snaps off. 
CUT TO: a look of relief for an instant on all faces. 
CUT TO: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there is the little white strip, saying, THE GRIERSON GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S MOTHER"- 
CUT TO: a look of horror on all faces. 
CUT TO: ELMER looking like someone has just murdered his own mother. 
CUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK glowering at BEAN. CUT TO: 
INT.   GALLERY CORRIDOR.   DAY. 
Governor REYNOLDS storming through the Gallery, with -BERNIE and GRIERSON scampering after him. 
REYNOLDS You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!? 
GRIERSON Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks 
CUT TO: 
INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      WHISTLER ROOM - DAY. 
DAVID and BEAN stand alone in silence, in front of the debris. BEAN is absolutely destitute. DAVID stares at him. BEAN just lifts his hands. Totally sad. What will, what can DAVID say to him? Finally, DAVID just puts his hands on his shoulder. 
DAVID Nice try, kiddo. 
BEAN cant quite believe he's forgiven. At which moment, there is a knock on the door. ANNIE enters, holding KEVIN's hand. 
ANNIE David.   There's a call for you.    It's your wife. 
DAVID Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later. 
Then he notices the worried expressions on ANNIE and KEVIN's faces. 
ANNIE She's calling from the hospital ... 
BEAN and DAVID both take this in.      DAVID turns and runs towards the reception area. ANNIE calls after him. 
ANNIE She's on line three! 
KEVIN grabs BEAN's hand and they both run after DAVID.      ANNIE watches BEAN go and sighs. 
ANNIE Such... great buns. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   GALLERY ENTRANCE HALL.   DAY. 
The party is in disarray. In the background, DAVID is on the phone at the reception counter with KEVIN and BEAN. BRUTUS hovers, he suspects BEAN - wants to question him. 
REYNOLDS I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys. 
DOCTOR 2 Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to deal with here, sir. 
ALISON looks round, and shakes her head. BEAN kicks DAVID in the shins. DAVID looks round, puzzled. There is a poster of the human skeleton. BEAN points to the spine. DAVID looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from it. 
Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first.       He's young, confident slightly arrogant. 
ALISON Excuse me, doctor. 
DOCTOR Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course. 
ALISON Okay. 
DAVID looks at the poster opposite again. Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back at Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless! 
DAVID Say that again, son. 
DOCTOR I beg your pardon? 
DAVID I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now. 
DOCTOR I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time. 
DAVID We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. 
A hint of a smile arrives on ALISON's lips. She's heard that somewhere before. 
DAVID So,    why not haul    your    ... (checks) nice little ass into this room and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence and    attention you    are    going to give her case. 
DOCTOR Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good. 
DAVID turns to ALISON - she does a little tilt of her Head `WOW'. And he turns to BEAN, who points to himself,    and nods .... n Come on! 
DAVID Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will you? 
BEAN nods enthusiastically and backs off. 
ALISON Smiling         Well, well. 
CUT TO: 
INT.     HOSPITAL.    JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Close on an E.C.G. monitor, green lines on black screen. DAVID and ALISON sit by JENNIFER's bed. JENNIFER is unconscious. She has her arm in a cast and a small Band-Aid on her head. otherwise she seems undamaged. 
KEVIN    is sitting on the end of the bed playing the SUPER NINTENDO game (the Gothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on JENNIFER'S TV earlier). It is    plugged into a T.V. which sits on a trolley. It's quite a noisy game. KEVIN    is immersed in it. 
ALISON Let's get a coffee. 
DAVID Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company. 
ALISON exits. David follows. BEAN enters.               He sees JENNIFER for the first time. Sympathy shows in his eyes. 
KEVIN Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire bats. 
BEAN is determined to help. He sits down with KEVIN. The game continues. The he-man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword. Lots of noise, but JENNIFER sleeps on. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
By a drinks machine.    ALISON finishes drinking from a plastic cup. 
ALISON Disgusting. 
She looks up at DAVID, who's looking at her.     Slowly she gets close and puts her arms around him. She's a bit tearful. 
DAVID Everything's gonna be fine. 
ALISON (pause) About Charles... 
DAVID shhh... 
ALISON It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was the last time we laughed? Any of us? 
DAVID I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard. 
KEVIN Dad... 
They look down to see KEVIN has arrived. 
KEVIN These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ... 
BEAN beams at her.      He's impressed - and feels he's accepted.    He leaves. 
ALISON He's not too bad.       I can live with him. 
DAVID I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.       I have a tale to tell. And not a happy one. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   THE LEARY'S KITCHEN.     NIGHT 
Looking in front outside, we see Alison sit down. We see, ,but do not hear David start to talk. Within seconds her hands go up to her face in horror. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.     DAY. 
With heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate. Pan across the familiar faces. DAVID. BERNIE. ELMER. ANNIE. BEAN, looking nervous and shifty. Dead silence as GRIERSON stands, very solemnly. 
GRIERSON Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice- President. 
CUT TO BERNIE, looking smug next to DAVID, who is pretty shocked by this. 
GRIERSON He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century. 
BERNIE Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ... 
GRIERSON Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius. 
BEAN looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods sagely. 
Insurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So, surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say, one helluva little man. Watch this. 
Everyone is totally at a     loss. GRIERSON stands and moves to the framed poster of Whistler's Mother on     the wall. He then produces a plastic key card and inserts it in a slot on     the side of the frame. A buzz and a click! An electric motor starts to     whirrrr ... 
The glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the original oil of Whistler's Mother. 
GRIERSON Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother! 
There are gasps from the room.     BEAN is open mouthed. 
GRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively.      He's saved! 
GRIERSON The best security in the world is no match for a master criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were so rudely interrupted by events. 
The room is emptying.     DAVID and BEAN stand there, DAVID stunned.   GRIERSON heads over. 
GRIERSON David, David, David ... 
DAVID I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen? 
GRIERSON Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse. 
David But .... 
GRIERSON I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie will. 
BERNIE looks across from the computer and smiles.      BEAN has his eyes on DAVID. He is mortified by what's 
happening.   GRIERSON notices but misinterprets his worried expression. 
GRIERSON Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite bathroom. 
DAVID glares at BERNIE.     BEAN is thinking 'No!   I don't want to stay with horrible BERNIE.' 
GRIERSON How are you making out there? 
BERNIE All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be quite a show. 
He presses an intercom.    He's enjoying himself. 
Hi everyone - this is your new Vice President, Bernie Shistler. Would you please watch your video screens. You're in for a treat, guys. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   VARIOUS ROOMS.   DAY. 
All the staff in all the rooms, gallery, canteen, corridors, look up at various screens. Cut round rooms during this flashy demonstration. 
BERNIE (V/0) Here you can see our new interactive gallery guide.    Every picture in the gallery will have its own story to tell. 
A Van Gogh picture comes up on the giant video screens 
My friends, good news. Mr Schimmel is not only no longer Vice- President. He actually no longer works here. 
BERNIE But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit suspicious that it's here at his fingertips. (pointing at Bean) There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me up! 
Pause. All eyes turn to BEAN.     CUT TO people watching the big screens everywhere. 
GRIERSON Dr. Bean.    Have you got anything to say to that? 
BEAN looks long and hard at BERNIE. 
BEAN Yes- (PAUSE) It's exceedingly rude to point. 
And punches BERNIE sharply in the nose.    Everyone in the gallery bursts into applause. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY. 
Half an hour later. Police cars draw up.      BERNIE is shoved in the back seat of one. GRIERSON, BEAN & DAVID watch. 
GRIERSON (to uniformed cop) I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd 
also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the Whistler copy. 
BEAN nods his head firmly.    The car pulls away.     Then breaks and reverses. The SIDE-KICK gets out. 
SIDE~KICK Oh, yeah - I forgot. 
SIDE-KICK opens the back of the car.    He takes out a huge bunch of flowers. 
The chief said I was to give you these. 
BEAN is delighted. Then sniffs the flowers.      What a nasty stink.    Not his sort of thing at all. 
SIDE-KICK drives AWAY.   GRIERSON turns to DAVID. 
GRIERSON I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that you do not. 
DAVID VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ... 
He looks sideways to Bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine.       DAVID gets the message, and changes his tune.. 
Let me think about that, Thomas.     We'd have to talk quite a salary hike. 
GRIERSON Of course. 
DAVID And a car. 
GRIERSON Mmmmm... 
DAVID Maybe two cars. 
GRIERSON A car sounds sensible. 
DAVID And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up. 
DAVID heads off. BEAN wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky flowers. He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them. She beams with delight: after all, he DID love her. 
BEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot.       As they go, DAVID puts an arm 
round BEAN. 
Who shoos him away instantly.           No sloppiness for him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.          HALL - DAY. 
The LEARY family in a group.           JENNIFER's arm in a sling. 
ALISON well, it's been... unusual. But thank you. 
She goes to kiss BEAN - but he just sticks out his hand, and shakes it firmly. Then moves on to JENNIFER. 
JENNIFER Good-bye Mr Bean.        Sorry I screamed that first time. 
He shakes her broken arm firmly ... and she screams again. 
DAVID Come on          hurry or we'll be late.

WHAT LIES BENEATH 
by 
Clark Gregg 
June 14, 1999 
FADE IN: 
Moving through a murky haze.  Dark blues and greens, shafts of prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance. Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera. We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens into focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water, arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by flowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING GREEN EYES, which blink closed... 
MORPH TO: 
...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from water.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in her bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side, reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being pulled. 
INT.  BATHROOM - DAY 
A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound. 
A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire starts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the red G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark shoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer starts whirring again. 
She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant- looking woman around forty. 
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door, listening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence. She quietly pushes open the door. 
INT.  ROOM - DAY 
Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a window, then pulls the curtains to reveal: 
A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A 24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake. 
The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE still shrouded by covers. 
Claire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp. 
She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped hair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her hand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly. 
CLAIRE Morning, beauty. 
Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly. 
CLAIRE Let's go.  Or we'll never leave on time. 
From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice. 
CAITLIN (muffled) I'm totally ready. 
Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes. 
CLAIRE Come on, I'll make you some waffles, maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the mall. (beat) Caitlin... 
Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's behind. 
CAITLIN Mother... 
Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box. Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow. 
CAITLIN You're such a morning person. 
Claire turns at the door. 
CLAIRE It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the plastic. 
She starts to leave.  Caitlin calls out. 
CAITLIN (O.S.) Blueberries! 
Claire smiles as she closes the door behind her. 
INT.  HALLWAY - DAY 
Claire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks.  When she stands, something catches her eye out a window.  She gazes down, transfixed. 
ANGLE 
Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door. Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD. 
A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck. He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the prominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take her eyes off the scene below. 
NORMAN They at it again? 
Claire nods. 
Claire smiles. 
CLAIRE Sweetheart, I've known this day was coming for a long time.  I've got your father and the garden and the new house. You really don't have to worry. 
Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some concern.  Claire takes her hand. 
CLAIRE Really. 
She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.  Her eyes close. 
CAITLIN (V.O.) Mother... 
EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY 
Claire's frozen in the hug. 
CAITLIN (beat) Mom. 
Her eyes open.  Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on the college campus.  The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the background. 
CAITLIN I have'ta go. 
After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  Caitlin glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed this overt display of maternal affection. 
CAITLIN I'll call you. 
Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her daughter's hand.  It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS. 
CLAIRE Come home anytime. 
Caitlin looks at Norman. 
NORMAN Really gonna leave me, huh? 
She nods.  They share a tender look. 
NORMAN Be good. 
She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  A bit overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of Caitlin's head.  After a moment, she steps back... 
CAITLIN Bye. 
...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old Columbia dorm.  A banner is draped across its portals which reads: 
"WELCOME CLASS OF '04." 
Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  Her eyes are shining.  Norman wraps an arm around her waist as she daps at a tear with a Kleenex. 
CLAIRE (smiling) I almost made it. 
They turn and head for the car.  Claire sneaks one last look over her shoulder. 
ANGLE 
Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile. 
INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton nightgown.  Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes. 
She gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him and starts reading.  After a moment: 
NORMAN Whatcha reading? 
CLAIRE (reading the cover, sexy voice) Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms. 
NORMAN (slight smile) How is it? 
Claire snuggles up. 
CLAIRE Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell. 
NORMAN (lost in his book) Nice. (beat) Almost done. 
She pulls slightly away. 
CLAIRE If you have to work... 
NORMAN No, no.  I'm just about... (beat) There. 
He places his book on the bedside table and turns to her. 
NORMAN How are you? 
CLAIRE Fine. 
NORMAN It's okay if you're not. 
CLAIRE'S POV 
She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer. Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES, STUFFED ANIMALS. 
She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in the smells.  She stares down at the word "Juilliard." 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT.  BASEMENT - DAY 
"JUILLIARD"...now it's on the same T-shirt only Claire's wearing it and she's much younger.  It's an old photograph in an album.  Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his arm draped around her waist.  A CELLO CASE stands beside her. 
Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at other photos. 
-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux with a very wide bow-tie. 
-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.  A tiny Caitlin rests on her hip. 
Claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob. 
EXT.  FRONT YARD - DAY 
Her face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN. 
The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapses into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly, she hears something coming from next door. 
She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes her way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more plaintive and fevered. 
She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence and tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathers her nerve and calls out... 
CLAIRE Hello... 
There's no reaction. 
CLAIRE Mrs. Feur? 
The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  The blue shape vanishes from view. 
CLAIRE Wait a minute.  I just want-- 
Something bumps against the fence.  Claire draws back.  She hears heavy breathing. 
MRS. FEUR (sniffling) Who are you? 
CLAIRE It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything-- 
MRS. FEUR You're the flower lady. 
CLAIRE Um...yes. 
MRS. FEUR I've seen you.  From the window. 
CLAIRE Is everything alright? 
Claire leans closer to the tiny crack.  She sees a fleshy blur and what might be part of an eye.  There's no response, just the breathing. 
CLAIRE Hello? 
MRS. FEUR I'm not... 
She seems on the verge of losing it again. 
MRS. FEUR He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath... 
CLAIRE Who?  Your husband? 
MRS. FEUR And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of... 
She trails off. 
CLAIRE What?  What are you afraid of? 
MRS. FEUR I can't, no, no, I can't... 
Claire edges closer to the crack. 
CLAIRE Tell me.  Please. 
MRS. FEUR That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear. 
Beat.  Claire's taken aback by this admission. 
CLAIRE Tell me.  I can help you. 
MRS. FEUR How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life... 
CLAIRE That's not...It's not like that. 
In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the open trunk of his car. 
CLAIRE (in a hoarse whisper) Norman! 
He's dead to the world.  She calls to him again. 
CLAIRE Norman, you have to look at this! 
NORMAN Mmnph. 
CLAIRE Hurry... 
Another flash illuminates...Norman at her side. 
CLAIRE Look! 
...an EMPTY DRIVEWAY, then blackness. 
NORMAN What is it?  What's the matter? 
She stares down into the darkness. 
CLAIRE Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something. 
NORMAN Is it gone? 
THE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway.  She nods. 
NORMAN Come on, let's go back to bed. 
Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the window. 
EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING 
Claire sets up a camera and tripod.  She steps back and aims her camera.  She glances up at a large upstairs window at the FEUR'S HOUSE.  One side of the curtain seems to be pulled open, but no one's there. 
Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  The morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house. 
She glances back at the Feur's window.  The CURTAIN IS NOW CLOSED. 
She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it. When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers across the fence.  She can barely see over, but glimpses: 
A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.  Just then, a car pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her perch. 
EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY 
Claire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes. 
CLAIRE Hey there. 
Jody hugs her. 
JODY How you holding up? 
CLAIRE Good.  I'm good. 
JODY You are? 
CLAIRE Why does everyone find that so surprising? 
JODY (are you kidding?) Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping... 
CLAIRE Okay, I'm a little tender. 
JODY Well good.  So you're human. 
CLAIRE And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club. 
JODY Wow.  Got here just in time. (reaching into her bag) I brought you this. 
She proffers several homemade tea bags. 
CLAIRE What is it? 
JODY Kambucha mushroom tea... 
CLAIRE Jody-- 
JODY It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring-- 
CLAIRE You're discussing me with your psychic? 
JODY She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit. 
CLAIRE Thanks, but I'm fine. 
JODY (pressing it into her hand) So you'll have some later. (beat) Notice anything...different? 
NORMAN He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us... 
CLAIRE Wow. 
He nods, Claire passes the joint back. 
NORMAN And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..." 
CLAIRE Well, that's nice. 
NORMAN "...especially Spencer's Theorem..." 
CLAIRE (overlapping) Oh, no... 
NORMAN "...of Perpetual Distances." (beat) Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say... 
CLAIRE (overlapping) That's... 
NORMAN "...for my father." 
CLAIRE I'm so sorry. 
NORMAN Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe. 
CLAIRE That's just mean. (indicating joint) Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some. 
NORMAN (quickly glancing over) Did you tell her? 
CLAIRE What?  No.  No. 
NORMAN You didn't? 
CLAIRE (with a smile) Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't. 
He takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom. 
NORMAN (O.S.) Cause that would be really-- 
She lays back on the bed.  Sounds of flushing. 
CLAIRE I didn't. 
He reappears without the joint. 
NORMAN Sorry.  You understand. 
CLAIRE Did you call about the Feurs? 
NORMAN Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly. 
CLAIRE Huh. 
Claire ponders this.  Norman turns off the light and joins her on the bed.  He kisses her knee. 
NORMAN Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more. 
Then starts working his way up her thigh. 
NORMAN And speak up. 
Claire smiles. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in position.  After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound. 
Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a beautiful and melancholy piece of music.  She's very, very good.  Eyes closed.  Her body begins to sway slightly as her left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck. 
She reaches a difficult transition and falters.  She seems almost surprised.  She attacks the transition again, and again falters.  Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet again, this time failing completely. 
She sits back in the chair, despondent.  Almost as an afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  At the end of the tone, something catches her ear.  She can just make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone. 
She sits up and plays a different note, then another.  Each time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  Finally she plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  The voice echoes with a distinct, unsettling shriek. 
CRASH! 
INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSK 
Claire walks in and sees: 
INSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH OF NORMAN AND CLAIRE. 
The caption announces that he's being promoted to the "distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS."  Through the spiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an older academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side. 
Claire kneels down to gather the picture.  A single shard of glass is missing.  She finds it a foot away by a distinctive knot in the wood floor. 
She notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but when she moves it, it's gone.  She places the pieces of broken glass on the frame and stands. 
JODY Know what I think? 
CLAIRE What? 
JODY Seance. 
CLAIRE Jody, no... 
JODY Telling you... 
CLAIRE (overlapping) ...no...no...no... 
JODY Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija. 
CLAIRE Please.  That's all I need. 
Jody shrugs, "Have it your way."  Beat. 
JODY Hey, look. 
CLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake. 
JODY So pretty. 
CLAIRE'S POV 
A FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study. 
CLAIRE Someone's there. 
JODY What? 
CLAIRE In the window.  Norman's at work. 
JODY I don't... 
Claire looks over at Jody. 
CLAIRE (pointing) There.  In the study.  Don't you see-- 
She looks again-- nothing. 
CLAIRE Wow.  I'm losing it. 
JODY No, you're not. (beat) But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly. 
Claire stares back at the house. 
INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Claire walks in and sets down some packages.  She opens one and pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind your pictures come back in.  She absently leafs through them, then freezes.  She gapes at one of the shots. 
CLAIRE Oh boy... 
INT.  UPSTAIRS - NIGHT 
Claire turns off the lights and crouches down.  She raises a pair of BINOCULARS. 
POV - BINOCULARS 
Claire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past their car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON DOWNSTAIRS. 
The tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for one.  He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring straight ahead.  He sips from a can of beer. 
Just then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM.  She lets out a screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her. 
NORMAN What are you doing? 
She glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing at the window, paging the curtain.  She squats down, pulling Norman with her. 
CLAIRE (shrill whisper) Get down!  He'll see. 
NORMAN (also whispers) What's going on, Claire? 
CLAIRE Shhhh. 
She peers over the sill in time to see Mr. Feur turning away from the window.  She takes Norman by the hand and leads him downstairs. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
She leads Norman in. 
NORMAN (still whispering) Why am I... (full voice) Why am I whispering in my own house? 
Claire turns. 
CLAIRE He killed her. 
She looks at his watch. 
CLAIRE Fashionably five minutes late. 
She bolts up the stairs. 
INT.  NORMAN'S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT 
They drive across the bridge. 
NORMAN (concerned, exasperated) When you do this, I swear... 
CLAIRE (overlapping) ...Don't get all... 
NORMAN ...like it never even happened... 
CLAIRE Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just... 
He pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number. 
CLAIRE What are you doing? 
NORMAN Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late. 
CLAIRE Five minutes? 
The phone flashes..."NO SERVICE." 
CLAIRE You're not at the center. 
NORMAN (overlapping) I know I'm not at the center of the bridge. 
CLAIRE We're going to be fine. 
They near the far side of the bridge.  Norman looks down at the cell phone, which now reads, "ROAM."  He presses a button. 
NORMAN There we go. 
CLAIRE Well, that's a relief. 
He shoots her a look. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A cozy, candlelit Italian place in town.  Claire and Norman arrive at the table.  STAN rises.  The chair next to him is empty.  He kisses her cheek. 
CLAIRE Hi Stan.  Sorry we're late. (too earnest) It was my fault. 
She greets Stan, a friendly looking man in his forties. 
STAN We just got here. 
Claire flashes a semi-playful look back at Norman. 
CLAIRE Where's the new squeeze? 
A VOICE speaks out from behind her. 
VOICE Here I am. 
Claire turns to find A TALL, ELEGANT BRUNETTE standing behind her.  The woman's face registers some shock. 
STAN I'd like you to meet... 
CLAIRE Elena? 
ELENA Ohmigod... 
The two women embrace, then beam at each other. 
CLAIRE Wow. 
ELENA This is... 
CLAIRE (to Norman) We know each other. 
NORMAN Hope so. 
LATER 
Post meal.  Several empty wine bottle decorate the table. 
ELENA We had this Finnish conductor, Aki, Laki, something.  He had these ridiculous bangs. And he'd sweep them off with his baton every minute or so, and it drove us insane, remember? 
Claire nods. 
CLAIRE He looked like one of the Monkees. 
VOICE (O.S.) Claire... 
INT.  BATHROOM - DAY 
CLAIRE'S POV - A FACE sharpens into focus hovering above her...Norman. 
INT.  BEDROOM - DAY 
Claire sits on the bed.  Norman dabs the blood from a tiny cut on the back of her head. 
CLAIRE I don't need a shrink. 
NORMAN (gently) Harvey says he's amazing. 
CLAIRE Norman... 
NORMAN What can it hurt to talk to someone? 
She goes to her dresser and gets a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and starts to open it.  Norman gently places a hand on her arm. 
NORMAN Please. 
She shoots him a look... 
NORMAN You promised. 
...and puts the pills down. 
NORMAN (gently) Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong. 
CLAIRE I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something... 
NORMAN I never said... 
CLAIRE ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up. 
Beat. 
NORMAN Are you lonely? 
CLAIRE No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist! 
INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in her lap, arms crossed. 
DR. DRAYTON (O.S.) (a smooth, mellifluous baritone) Who's idea was it? 
CLAIRE Mine.  His.  We both...thought... 
She trails off.  Camera slowly pulls back to reveal, DR. TIMOTHY DRAYTON, a stocky, light skinned black man in his late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes. 
CLAIRE I didn't want to come. 
DR. DRAYTON Then why did you? 
CLAIRE Because he was worried about me. 
DR. DRAYTON Your husband? 
CLAIRE Yes. (beat) I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace. 
DR. DRAYTON Do you really think so? 
CLAIRE No. 
There's a pause. 
DR. DRAYTON Why is he worried? 
CLAIRE Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and... (beat) Why is this so hard? 
Dr. Drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red FIREBALLS next to his chair.  He proffers it to Claire. 
DR. DRAYTON Fireball? 
CLAIRE You're joking. 
He shakes his head.  She shrugs, then grabs one and pops it into her mouth. 
DR. DRAYTON It's hard because I'm a complete stranger and what we're talking about is incredibly personal.  Besides, the first time most people come here, a part of them is wondering if I'm gonna think they're crazy. 
She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods. 
DR. DRAYTON Don't worry, I'm required to have at least three sessions in order to commit. 
Her eyes get a little wider. 
CLAIRE The planchette? 
JODY This. 
Jody indicates the wooden pointing device.  Each woman grasps an edge. 
JODY (in a low voice) We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. (to Claire) What's her first name? 
CLAIRE I don't know. 
Jody closes her eyes.  Claire follows suit. 
JODY I call forth the entity that is haunting this house. 
They look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved. 
JODY Mrs. Feur? 
There's still no movement. 
CLAIRE Nothing's happening. 
JODY Shhh. 
Jody focuses intently. JODY Reveal yourself to us. 
A long moment passes.  It's starting to seem like a bust. Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.  Even Jody seems startled. 
JODY (to the spirit) Who...who are you? 
At first, nothing happens.  Then, slowly, the planchette starts to move across the board. 
CLAIRE Are you doing that? 
Jody shakes her head. 
CLAIRE I'm not doing that. 
The planchette comes to rest on the letter "M."  Moments later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on "E." 
CLAIRE Oh... 
JODY M-E... 
It starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space between "E" and "F."  The planchette stops on "F."  Jody removes her fingers from the device. 
JODY Mef?  What's Mef? 
CLAIRE It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her. 
Suddenly, the CANDLE starts flickering strangely and THE PLANCHETTE SLIDES JERKILY ON ITS OWN...M-E-F, M-E-F... 
JODY Shit... 
Jody stumbles backwards, gasping. 
JODY Did you see that? 
Claire leans in. 
CLAIRE (to ghost) What happened to you? 
The CANDLE GOES OUT. 
JODY Oh God... 
Jody bolts.  Claire follows. 
EXT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the work room.  She holds onto her arm. 
JODY I have to go. 
CLAIRE Jody, wait. 
Cooper's growling in the work room.  They look in. 
JODY Claire, this is...this is... 
Claire, transfixed, walks in. 
INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT 
She stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with letters at an amazing speed. 
MEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEF... 
CLAIRE No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you. 
She turns on a heel and walks toward her car. 
EXT.  CAMPUS - NIGHT 
Norman catches up to her as a LARGE CROWD is filing out of the concert hall next door. 
NORMAN You're overreacting. 
She turns on him. 
CLAIRE Don't tell me how to react! 
Norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk. 
NORMAN Keep your voice down. 
CLAIRE I will NOT. 
Some of the bystanders stop to watch. 
CLAIRE (still loud) Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind... 
NORMAN (looking around) Claire, please... 
Claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her intensity. 
CLAIRE ...But what if I'm not?  What if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her can't move on while that's unresolved.  Can't you just... 
Something behind him catches her eye.  She trails off. 
CLAIRE Wow... 
Claire walks past him toward the parking lot. 
NORMAN Claire, please... 
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.  People step out of the way. 
EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's after.  MR. FEUR steps out from behind the open trunk of his old Buick. 
CLAIRE (walking up) You! 
He looks up at her. 
CLAIRE You think you're smart, don't you?  You think you got away clean.  Well, I know you killed her.  You drowned her in the bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and I'm gonna find her, you murdering sonofabitch. 
Mr. Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade.  Norman arrives at her side. 
MR. FEUR Who? 
CLAIRE (scoffing) Give me that shit.  Your wife. 
MR. FEUR I didn't kill my wife. 
NORMAN (to Mr. Feur) I'm sorry... 
CLAIRE (over Norman) Then where is she? 
He stares at both Spencers for a moment.  Then calls past them. 
MR. FEUR Honey... 
Claire and Norman turn.  A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the passenger seat.  She turns.  IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS SEEN.  Claire looks sucker punched. 
INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Claire sits back in the chair.  She looks drained.  A soft rain taps against the windows. 
CLAIRE And his face...it seemed so gentle, and I knew...in that second I knew that I'd imagined the whole thing. 
Dr. Drayton takes this in.  She seems genuinely frightened. 
CLAIRE What's happening to me? 
DR. DRAYTON Well, that's what we're here for. 
He watches her calmly, some empathy on his face. 
DR. DRAYTON Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern. 
CLAIRE Yes, but... 
DR. DRAYTON Your friend saw them. 
Claire pours Mrs. Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher. She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes. 
MRS. FEUR Your house is so beautiful. 
CLAIRE Thank you. 
MRS. FEUR And these roses.  They're much prettier up close. 
She regards Mrs. Feur for a moment.  She seems skittish and shy. 
CLAIRE I...there's something I have to ask you. 
Mrs. Feur waits. 
CLAIRE That day...at the fence.  You seemed terrified.  I don't think I was imagining that. 
There's a pause.  Mrs. Feur looks down into her lap. 
MRS. FEUR No. 
CLAIRE Of what?  What were you so afraid of? 
MRS. FEUR You're going to think I'm crazy or something. 
A tiny smile. 
CLAIRE Not this week. 
She looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire. 
MRS. FEUR Love. 
CLAIRE What? 
MRS. FEUR Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave? 
CLAIRE Um...sure. 
MRS. FEUR I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... (beat) I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home. 
Claire is mesmerized. 
MRS. FEUR You must think I'm pathetic. 
CLAIRE No.  No, I don't. 
MRS. FEUR I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here. (beat) Perhaps we could be friends. 
Claire stares at this strange, passionate woman. 
CLAIRE I would like that. 
Mrs. Feur smiles at her. 
INT.  VOLVO - NIGHT 
Claire pulls up in front of a large NEW YORK HOTEL. 
NORMAN (on a cell phone) ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner. (to Claire) Sure you won't stay? 
CLAIRE No, it's fine.  I'm fine. 
NORMAN (tempting her) Really big bed. 
She smiles and shakes her head.  Norman kisses her goodbye, then grabs his bag from the backseat. 
NORMAN Do I have everything? 
CLAIRE Yep. 
NORMAN Call ya later. 
He starts to walk into the hotel. 
CLAIRE (O.S.) And you glad you married me? 
He turns.  She's standing next to the car. 
NORMAN What? 
CLAIRE Are you glad?  I'm glad. 
Norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand. 
NORMAN (softly) You know I am. 
CLAIRE Good. (She gazes at him, then softly) You sat in front...I saw you there... 
CAITLIN I know he does. 
Beat.  Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter. 
CAITLIN Are you mad at me? 
CLAIRE Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother. 
They hug.  For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back. Her eyes well up. 
CLAIRE I miss you. 
CAITLIN So much. 
CLAIRE (laughing) It got so bad your father almost had to put me away. 
CAITLIN What do you mean? 
CLAIRE I started seeing things. 
CAITLIN A ghost? 
Beat.  Claire stares at her daughter. 
CLAIRE Did you? 
CAITLIN No.  But once I heard... 
CLAIRE What? 
CAITLIN Someone crying.  A girl. (beat) I thought I was crazy. 
CLAIRE (quietly) Then we both are. 
Caitlin nods. 
INT.  PRESIDENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
...a large cocktail party.  The house is crowded with PROFESSORS, ADMINISTRATORS, and their SPOUSES.  PRESIDENT TEMPLETON, a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with his WIFE, a sharp looking woman in her late fifties. 
TEMPLETON There they are. 
NORMAN You remember my wife, Claire. 
MRS. TEMPLETON (shaking hands) Of course.  You must be so proud. 
CLAIRE I am. 
MRS. TEMPLETON (to Norman) Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity. 
She takes their coats.  Dean Templeton leads them in. 
TEMPLETON Must've been some paper.  Your father would be very proud. 
This seems to strike a nerve. 
NORMAN Uh-huh. 
Claire notices this and squeezes his hand.  Templeton leads Norman into a large living room which is filled with colleagues.  Several of them turn and begin clapping.  Others follow suit. 
EXT.  PATIO - NIGHT 
Claire stands at a small bar. 
CLAIRE (to bartender) White wine please. 
She scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate conversation with each other.  She's speaking about something astonishing.  He's rapt. 
Claire locates Norman in a corner listening as some AGED ALUMNUS holds forth.  He sees her and mouths, "I'm sorry." He points to his watch and flashes five fingers.  She smiles and nods. 
VOICE (O.S.) Guess I'm not much of a medium. 
She turns to see Jody. 
CLAIRE Jody... 
They hug. 
JODY Are you okay? 
CLAIRE I think so 
JODY I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire... 
CLAIRE It's alright. 
JODY I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen. 
CLAIRE Right. 
Mrs. Templeton leaves.  Claire looks into the mirror. 
CLAIRE (V.O.) What was it about? 
EXT.  TEMPLETON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Claire and Norman walk toward the car. 
NORMAN You don't remember? 
CLAIRE When she said it, there was something familiar...but no. 
He looks at her for a moment. 
NORMAN You dropped a glass. 
CLAIRE I... 
NORMAN A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you... 
CLAIRE (something's triggered) In the living room... 
NORMAN You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home. 
CLAIRE But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely-- 
NORMAN It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time. 
CLAIRE But I don't remember. 
NORMAN Sweetheart, it was over a year ago. 
CLAIRE What's wrong with me? 
He stops, takes her shoulders gently. 
NORMAN (reassuring) Nothing.  Nothing at all.  It's been a hard year.  But you're better now.  And things are really looking up for us.  So let's try to enjoy that. (gently) Please? 
She thinks for a beat. 
CLAIRE Yes.  Yes.  That's what I want. 
She takes his hand and kisses it. 
EXT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Claire walks up to the door.  When she touches the knob she hears...the WHISPERING.  She opens the door and moves into: 
INT.  FOYER - DAY 
The same intense whispered exchange.  She glances into the mirror and sees...SHAPES MOVING, BODIES, A FLASH OF SILVER. She turns the corner and again...NO ONE'S THERE. 
INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY 
She walks in and stands before: 
The repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party for the DUPONT CHAIR. 
She takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then SMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK.  She extricates the picture from the broken glass.  The caption reads: 
"Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman." 
She stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over and scans the stories on the back.  One tells of a hotly contested city council race, another contains details of a large alumni donation to the university. 
She notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't noticed before.  It's only a small portion of one column, but it seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL. 
INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY 
Claire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.  She narrows her search to NEW ENGLAND.  A screen pops up with a list of names.  She scrolls down the list until she finds...FRANK, MADISON ELIZABETH. 
CLAIRE M-E-F... 
Claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a blurry cyber photo fills the screen.  Slowly, higher resolution moves down the image. 
IT'S THE GHOST. 
Under the photo is the legend: 
"DISAPPEARED - OCTOBER 22, 1998" 
Claire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits PRINT. 
LATER 
Claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out. 
Claire rings the bell.  A DRAWN LOOKING WOMAN in her early fifties answers the door. 
CLAIRE Mrs. Frank? 
MRS. FRANK Yeah. 
CLAIRE I'd like to talk to you about Madison. 
MRS. FRANK You know where she is? 
CLAIRE No, I don't. 
MRS. FRANK Please leave me alone. 
She starts to close the door.  Claire leans forward. 
CLAIRE She's my friend. 
The woman stops. 
CLAIRE Was.  We were...acquainted.  I've been away for awhile.  When I came back... 
She studies Claire. 
MRS. FRANK What's your name? 
CLAIRE Claire. 
MRS. FRANK She never mentioned you. 
Claire doesn't know what to say to this. 
MRS. FRANK Then again, she didn't say much about her college friends. 
She gives Claire the once over. 
MRS. FRANK I'm watchin' my shows. 
She motions Claire in. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room.  Mrs. Frank serves up a mug of coffee.  A soap plays silently on an old 19" RCA. 
MRS. FRANK Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense. 
CLAIRE It's fine. 
She sizes Claire up. 
MRS. FRANK You look a little old for a student. 
CLAIRE I'm not.  We...we met at a party. 
MRS. FRANK Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it. 
CLAIRE She never mentioned her father. 
MRS. FRANK Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that. 
There's a silence.  Mrs. Frank stares at the TV. 
MRS. FRANK Don't need the sound.  You can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces.  Turn it up sometimes, though.  Feels like someone's here. 
Claire doesn't know what to say.  Mrs. Frank turns to her. 
MRS. FRANK Why are you here? 
CLAIRE I don't know. 
MRS. FRANK It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing. (beat) Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened. 
Claire stares at this tough, tragic woman. 
MRS. FRANK Wanna see her room? 
Claire nods. 
INT.  MADISON'S ROOM - DAY 
Claire enters the room.  Her face freezes. 
ANGLE 
SEVERAL POSTERS FOR ALTERNATIVE AND METAL BANDS, side by side with ACADEMIC PLAQUES AND AWARDS. 
MRS. FRANK Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close. 
CLAIRE She did it. 
NORMAN We don't know that for sure. 
CLAIRE Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be? 
The enormity of this hits Norman.  His head drops into his hands. 
NORMAN Oh God, what have I done?  How could I have let this into our lives? 
He looks up at her, teary. 
CLAIRE I don't know. 
She gets up and walks out of the room. 
EXT.  JODY'S STUDIO - DAY 
An old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished oil paintings.  Jody brings Claire some tea. 
CLAIRE ...and everything I have, everything I thought my life was...Christ when I think of all the lies... 
Jody looks down. 
CLAIRE What? (beat) Jody what? 
Jody looks up, tears in her eyes. 
CLAIRE Oh God...you knew. 
JODY I was down in Adamant... 
CLAIRE Adamant? 
JODY Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe. 
Claire waits for her to continue. 
JODY I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young. (beat) I should have said something right away. But I didn't. 
CLAIRE Why? 
JODY Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved. 
CLAIRE Relieved? 
JODY I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed. 
Claire nods. 
JODY By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late. 
CLAIRE Too late?  Jody, it was an accident. 
JODY Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system? 
Claire walks over to a window. 
JODY I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away. 
CLAIRE All of us. 
Beat. 
JODY I'm a terrible friend. 
CLAIRE No. 
Claire turns. 
CLAIRE How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself? 
JODY What are you going to do? 
CLAIRE I don't know. 
JODY If she was dangerous before-- 
CLAIRE She could have hurt me if she wanted to. 
JODY You don't know that. (beat) If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection. 
CLAIRE No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace. 
Jody isn't as sure. 
INT.  KITCHEN - DAY 
Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed.  Madison reaches up toward the surface.  As the bubble diminish, she seems to be FADING AWAY.  When she's gone, Claire reaches out toward the water.  When her finger touches the surface... 
WHOOSH!  She's sucked down into the water. 
INT.  UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM - DAY 
Norman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off the dock.  He races out of the room. 
EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY 
Claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her deeper into the murky depths. 
EXT.  DOCK - DAY 
Norman sprints toward the dock. 
EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY 
As he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as her hand plunges into the muddy bottom. 
Suddenly, she's released.  She yanks her hand free, the silt swirls revealing...a COPPER COLORED GLINT in the mud. 
NORMAN'S HAND grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards. 
EXT.  DOCK - DAY 
Norman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock.  They hold each other. 
NORMAN Are you okay? 
She nods, catching her breath. 
NORMAN We have to get out of here. 
CLAIRE It's alright. 
NORMAN Can't you see, she's trying to kill us. 
CLAIRE She's gone. 
NORMAN What? 
CLAIRE She can't be here without me. 
NORMAN How can you be sure? 
CLAIRE I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it. 
NORMAN Claire... 
She stares into the still water. 
CLAIRE It's over. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Claire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her.  Norman walks in with some steaming mulled cider.  He stokes the blazing fire.  He sits on the edge of the bed. 
NORMAN I know it's going to take awhile before things are back...until they're better than before.  But you've given us a chance to make a fresh start.  And I'm going to spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did. 
The gaze at each other.  Tentatively, she places a hand on his. 
EXT.  GARDEN - DAY 
Claire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her rosebushes for the winter.  She picks up a basket of clipped flowers and heads inside. 
EXT.  PORCH - DAY 
She turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering.  All is quiet. 
INT.  FOYER - DAY 
She looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the lake behind it. 
INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY 
Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over. 
With a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the wooden floor.  The stream has flowed over to the knot and dripped into the crack.  Claire stares down at THE STRANGE COPPER COIN. 
She grabs a letter opener from Norman's desk and pries the coin out.  It's actually a SMALL BRASS KEY, the head of which is THREE INTERLOCKING CIRCLES.  She stares at it for a moment, then places it in her pocket. 
EXT.  SAILBOAT - DUSK 
Claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset.  The leaves on the surrounding hills are stunning.  Norman appears beside her. 
NORMAN Last sail of the year. 
She ambles off across the street.  Claire watches her go. Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop.  THREE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  She walks toward it. 
EXT.  SHOP - DAY 
Claire stands in front of the store window.  A sign in the window identifies it as "The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought jewelry and gifts."  Claire tries to open the door, but sees a closed sign. 
She steps back out to the window and looks in.  On display are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios. 
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD. 
Her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display where she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST.  Protruding from its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  Claire looks like she's been punched. 
INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Claire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman.  She gingerly slides out of bed. 
INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Claire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album, tracking the years of their life.  Her hands tremble. Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches behind the photo and produces...THE KEY. 
EXT.  DOCK - NIGHT 
Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the dock.  An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path. She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake. 
She holds out a fist.  Her fingers unfold and in her palm lies THE KEY.  She holds the key out over the water and stands there, frozen.  The lighthouse beam sweeps past her once...then again. 
Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest, then carefully places it on the dock.  She very deliberately takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps off the dock. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
AN ANGUISHED CRY from downstairs.  Norman bolts upright in bed. 
INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.  He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting closed on his desk.  He looks around, sees the room is empty and walks over to it. 
The mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is engraved:  To N.C.S. with love always, M.E.F. 
He pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside. 
THE LIGHTS SWITCH ON. 
Claire stands in the doorway, holding out the SILVER ROSEBUD NECKLACE. 
CLAIRE Looking for this? 
Norman stares at her dumbly. 
CLAIRE She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake. 
NORMAN Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is. 
CLAIRE Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed! 
NORMAN (nearly hysterical) I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have-- 
CLAIRE I don't believe you. 
NORMAN IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth! (beat, fighting tears) I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink. (beat) And I've lived with that image ever since. (beat) I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think! 
Claire's lip is quivering with confusion. 
CLAIRE I don't know what's true anymore. (beat) But that girl must be brought up.  Now do you want to call the police?  Or should I? 
Norman stares at the phone.  He's a wreck. 
NORMAN Fine.  I can't live with it anymore. 
He takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits. 
NORMAN This is Dr. Norman Spencer.  No, it's not an emergency. 
He looks at Claire. 
NORMAN I have some information about a missing girl, Madison Frank...Yes.  Could you send an officer?  Fifteen Willoughby, about a mile before the bridge...Thank you. 
He hangs up.  Long silence.  They look at each other. 
NORMAN You did the right thing. (beat) I'm going to get cleaned up. 
He walks out.  Claire walks over and stands before the box. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Claire walks into the bedroom.  The shower can be heard through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar.  Steam drifts out through the crack.

INT. OLD FASHIONED STAGE 
Circa 1900. 
A white man in a top hat introduces the final act of a black face performance. 
TOP HAT MAN In the spirit of true minstrelsy, you have again shown that laughter is the wine of life. 
Some 50 performers stand and break out into song. 
Roll credits to the music. 
An average American teenage boy begins to speak. His name is JOLIE. 
JOLIE (V.O.) All my life, my parents have told me I'm smart and talented. That I can be anything I wanna be when I grow up. Getting into the West Branch Magnet Program was supposed to be some kinda honor. They probly thought I'd grow up to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or scientist that cures cancer and junk. I mean for me school has always been a breeze. 
EXT. SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOL - CIRCA 1990 
Now in the mid-90s, for our story present day. 
JOLIE (V.O.) But when I look around, I just feel surrounded by dorks. 
Angle on an old school hoop on the horizon. A kid silouettes against the sky lays the ball in. 
JOLIE (V.O.) All I want, is to be like the kids on varisty, who live in the Maple Ave towers. 
EXT. MAPLE AVE TOWERS - DAY 
A part of a suburban neighborhood lines with huge apartment buildings. 
JOLIE (V.O.) The maple ave kids are coming up from nothing. I mean, their only shot at college is balling. And they've got girls blowing up their pagers twenty-four seven. 
Black kids play ball apartment buildings towering over them. 
INT. BASKETBALL GYM 
The young naive face of Jolie in the midst of tryout. 
JOLIE (V.O.) I pray to God I make varsity. I'd do anything to be like the Maple Ave. kids. 
Montage of tryout - Jolie the olny white kid among them. Suicide drills. Push ups. Machine gun defensive stand exercises. Scrimmaging. Jolie is just a breath behind everyone at pretty much all of them. 
And now Jolie is at the line. A classic american basketball tryout drill. Miss and you run. 
All the players but Jolie watch from the baseline. 
Jolie lines up his shot carefully. 
He glaces at the coach who holds a clipboard. 
Jolie fires. For a split second it's dead on but then it bricks wildly. 
The kids take off running. 
COACH That was terrible. 
INT. HENRIETTA'S GOLDEN BEDROOM - MORNING 
Sounds of a high pace video game begin. 
JOLIE, in his tighty-whities, plays Sonic on a Sega Genesis. Also on the bed, black girl HENRIETTA AARONSON tries to do her homework. 
HENRIETTA Do you think you're gonna make varsity? 
Jolie drops his controller and tears up. 
HENRIETTA School is so wack. 
Jolie composes himself. 
HAROON Hey, can I be excused for the Million Man March? 
JOLIE Hey, can I use the bathroom? 
The teacher MR. MCCARTY already has the passes raised. 
INT. YELLOW HALLWAY 
Empty except Jolie and Haroon. 
HAROON Dude, don't they post who made the team today? 
JOLIE Naw, not till Monday they said. 
HAROON Alright man, have a good day at school. 
JOLIE Yeah right. 
HAROON See ya. 
They smack a secret handshake and Haroon exits. 
Alone, Jolie looks longingly out the window. 
JOLIE Lucky bastards. 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT 
Haroon waves good-bye to Jolie. 
Minority kids are hopping into cars with their march signs, psyched to be getting out of school. 
JOLIE (voice over, whisper) This sucks. All the minorities get an excused absence for the Million Man March. 
An almost white looking kid enters the frame. 
JOLIE (V.O.) But me, I'm stuck in school like a bama. 
Haroon waves a last goodbye from his Nissan Saturn. 
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY 
Jolie - still looking enviously out the window. 
JOLIE (V.O.) I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. Fuck. 
INT. HENRIETTA'S GOLDEN BEDROOM - DAY 
Henrietta rocks out to her walk-man while jamming on some homework. 
Jolie's in his underwear again playing Sonic. 
JOLIE (V.O.) I'm supposed to tutor Henrietta every Sunday. She's getting an F in math. She knows how to do it though. She's flunking on purpose. 
Jolie looks back at Henrietta and smiles to himself. 
JOLIE (V.O.) She's so gangster. 
INT. HENRIETTA'S LIVINGROOM - LATER 
Jolie, clothed, bounds down the steps again, this time two at a time. 
EXT. TOWN ESTABLISHING SHOTS 
Suburban homes with large apartments towers in the background. The school is in the more urban part of town. 
EXT. WESTBRANCH SCHOOL GYM 
The doors spray-painted "thug life." 
EXT. WEST BRANCH HS TRACK AND FIELD 
Jolie and Haroon sit on the hill doing homework. 
HAROON Hey you heard Fransisco got arrested? 
SMASH CUT TO: 
Jolie takes off running down the hall past a mop leaning against the wall. 
JOLIE (voice over, whisper) As a white boy I just didn't fit in, not in Takoma Park. But now... 
Jolie becomes a black silhouette against a row of windows. 
JOLIE (voice over, whisper) I was practically black. 
EXT. SPARSE WOODS - DAY 
Jolie, in his gold Webber jersey, hops in the woods. He wears large purple ankle weights, and "Jump Soles" (clunky and clumsy looking work out shoes). 
JOLIE (voice over, whisper) I even ditched class to work on my hops. 
Exhausted, Jolie gathers his basketball and backpack and leaves. 
A metro train roars past in the background. 
INT. JOLIE'S JUNKY BASEMENT - NO WINDOWS 
Jolie is bench pressing and Haroon is spotting. 
A single florescent fixture hangs overhead. 
HAROON Man, I can't believe you made the team. 
Jolie finishes his set. Pops up. 
JOLIE I was the last bama on the list! If Francisco hadn't been arrested I'd still be a loser! I'd be just another Joe Shmoe Lame-oh geek in the Blair High School Magnet. 
CLOSE ON HAROON: his face slowly falls. 
JOLIE Oh hey, can your mom give you a ride home later. There's something I gotta do. 
HAROON Oh... Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. 
They rotate positions - we see that Jolie has only been lifting 5 lb. weights. 
JOLIE 2.5's right? 
HAROON Yeah. 
Jolie leans down on the bar and grins to himself - still on cloud nine. 
EXT. STREETS OF TAKOMA PARK - DAY 
A shiny cherry-red '93 Nissan Quest approaches. 
JOLIE (voice over, whispering) Tupac. Biggie. Snoop Dog. Easy-E. Dr. Dre. Suge Knight. Mr. T. 
The Quest pulls to the curb - Jolie and his Dad inside. 
JOLIE'S DAD Alright bye. No injuries. 
Jolie hops out in black and red basketball gear - black headband, black Jordans, even black socks. 
JOLIE Alright, bye Dad. 
A clunker 90s cell phone rings. Jolie's Dad answers. 
JOLIE'S DAD Hey, you back from the hill? What happened? 
EXT. SMALL CLEARING IN THE WOODS 
Henrietta sits alone on a stump listening to her Walkman. 
Jolie bounds down a path startling her. 
HENRIETTA It smells like dog shit in these woods, Jolie. Why'd you want to meet out here anyway? 
Jolie chokes up. 
JOLIE Wow. That is pretty bad. It smells like a dead mouse or something. 
HENRIETTA You dont want to be seen with me do you? Cus I'm pregnant. 
JOLIE ...what? No. 
The team of Blair Blazers sit together, their heads moving in unison, following the action. 
At the end of the bench are ARIUS and Jolie. ARIUS, covered in sweat, is a tall thin, care-free, light-skinned black kid. He has a huge scar on his head, a thick red headband and band- aids over his earrings. 
Jolie is bone dry and still in his warm up suit. 
ARIUS Now it comes with two free controllers and the game. 
JOLIE (not paying attention) Oh yeah. 
ARIUS Yeah. We were playing that joint at my place and one of the cheerleaders was all confessing how cute she thinks you are. 
JOLIE (EXCITED) Which one? 
ARIUS (points to the cheerleader BENCH) Christine Ortanyez. 
Jolie focuses in on a particularly cute Panamanian cheerleader - CHRISTINE ORTANYEZ. 
JOLIE POV: slow motion of Christine - taps her palms and does a leg kick then looks directly at us. 
COACH DALE Jolie! 
Jolie flinches. 
Coach Dale - in afine suit and gold rimmed glasses - glares. 
COACH DALE(CONT'D) Get Pistol. 
Jolie rips off his warm-ups in a panic. The shirt gets stuck over his head, then he trips over his pants. 
His teammates look on with various expressions of concern and laughter. 
A cheerleader from the opposing team points and giggles. 
REDHEAD GRUNGE KID (O.S.) Unsnap it! 
Struggling, Jolie frees himself. 
Coach Dale shakes his head and so does the fat black man directly behind him. Their expressions match exactly. 
The old white referee blows his whistle hard - game over. 
All the Blazers start high-fiving each other but Jolie. 
INT. JOLIE'S MESSY ROOM - NIGHT 
A six foot long poster of a '91 Lamborghini Countach covers the wall. A Nerf basketball hoop hangs on the closed door. 
Haroon is dressed up as a woman, using a wig, socks as breasts, and a sheet as a skirt. 
HAROON Come on man, we've gotta nail the Marion Barry skit tomorrow or I'm gonna get a B in English. 
JOLIE I don't feel like it. I told you. 
Jolie throws an African hat and tap shoes off his bed and they smash against the wall. 
HAROON Dude, it's was just a preseason game, come on. 
JOLIE Man, if I can't get in when we're up thirty in the preseason then I'm never gonna play. 
Jolie pulls off his jersey and throws it down. He picks up a switch blade and looks at his warped reflection. 
HAROON He tried to put you in the game. 
JOLIE Yeah, for thirty seconds. 
There's a knock on the door. 
Jolie wipes a teary eye and straights up. 
ELLIOTT, Jolie's oddly old dad - enters with a bright orange Nerf ball off the bedside table. 
ELLIOTT Three. Two. (PUMP FAKE) One. 
Elliott dunks and freezes in mid air. 
He makes the sounds of a sold out crowd, animatedly, in a comforting way. 
REDHEAD GRUNGE KID A dollar total. Or a dollar each? 
CHRISTINE Each, I hope. 
JOLIE (DISTURBED) That's a rumor, duh. They just took photos. 
CHRISTINE How do you know? Were you there? 
JOLIE I heard. 
REDHEAD GRUNGE KID Believe what you want man. That chick got gang banged! Turned out by mad dudes like a straight porno scene. 
Jolie, lost in thought. The bell rings. 
INT. HISPANIC HALL 
Dim. No windows. 
Hispanic kids line the lockers. 
Pants sag and Spanish is heard. 
One black kid from the team, Arius, looks in a locker mirror and puts on cologne. He has a gold cross and greasy hair. 
ARIUS Jolie. I heard your old girl is a straight chicken-head. 
JOLIE Who? 
ARIUS You haven't heard? 
ARIUS Heard what? 
ARIUS That Maple Ave shit. You haven't seen the porn video with your girl Henrietta? 
JOLIE I'm not with that girl man. I just tutor her in Algebra. 
ARIUS Chill brother. I'm just saying... 
MR. APPLEBAUM overhears this. 
MR. APPLEBAUM What are you boys buzzing about? Maple Ave this.. Maple Ave that.. 
ARIUS You can take the niggas out the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out the niggas. 
MR. APPLEBAUM Come on Arius. I know you've got somewhere to be. 
Still stunned by the rumor, Jolie follows the steady flow of kids out a single door to the: 
EXT. EAST SIDE OF THE SCHOOL - DAY 
The sun backlights the school. 
Jolie emerges from the school. Christine catches up to him. 
CHRISTINE Jolie, aren't you headed to computer class? 
JOLIE What? Yeah. 
CHRISTINE Is everything alright? You look kind of stunned or something. 
JOLIE What? No. I just. The sun was in my eyes. 
CHRISTINE Oh. 
JOLIE What's up? 
CHRISTINE I am totally struggling with my program this month, do you think I could look at your code? 
JOLIE My programming skills aren't that good. But we can copy Haroon's code and just change the variable names. 
CHRISTINE Really? 
JOLIE Yea. 
CHRISTINE Cool. Thanks. 
Christine gives Jolie a hug. 
JOLIE Done. 
Haroon has fires up a video game on the PC. 
HAROON Cool. Now let's conquor titen again. I think we can break the high score. 
ZEKE Seriously. 
INT. RUSTY OLD HIGH SCHOOL WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 
Every kid on the team but Jolie is wearing light tan, suède Timberland boots. 
WENDEL What's up? 
JOLIE Hey. 
ARIUS What's up Jolie. 
JOLIE What's up? 
MERLY What's up? What's up with you? 
JOLIE What's up? 
CODROY What's up? 
JOLIE What's up? 
SURGIO Chillen. 
WENDEL Peace, nigger. 
Jolie pauses for a second then half smiles. 
Haroon's face turns red as a cherry as he "maxes" on the bench. 
JOLIE See man. Ray can't mess with us now. We're rolling too deep. 
Haroon looks around, the whole basketball team is working out. 
MERLY leg presses a massive amount of weight. 
HAROON (dons his sombrero, spreading a genuine SMILE) Yea. I guess your right. Junior year's actually gonna be cool. And I love spirit week. Merly, did you bring a hat for hat day? 
MERLY Yea. 
Merly stops his leg presses - pulls on a black ski-mask. 
MERLY Hey, Jolie. Want to give us a lift to Taco Bell for lunch? 
JOLIE Yea. No prob. 
HAROON Cool man. 
EXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY 
Kids from the team pile into Jolie's Toyota Camry. 
Six are already in the ride, Haroon tries to squeeze in. 
MERLY You want my spot? 
HAROON Ummm. Naw. Naw. I'm cool. 
MERLY You sure? 
JOLIE Jump in the trunk dude. It's not far. 
HAROON You think so? 
MERLY That's rediculous. Let's just bring you back something? What do you want? 
HAROON Uh. Just like a couple burritos. Here's a ten? 
MERLY No worries. I got you. 
HAROON Oh thanks man. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) And just like that, with Marley arrested and Arius doing in-school, I might just get some playing time? 
INT. TRIG CLASS 
Haroon enters and sits next to Jolie. 
Haroon has double fresh black eyes. 
The teacher and classroom is quite and dont even pay any attention to Jolie entering. 
HAROON I thought you said Ray wasn't gonna mess with me man? 
JOLIE Woah. Dude. Are you alright? 
HAROON Do I look alright? 
JOLIE I'm sorry man. 
HAROON That's all you got? 
JOLIE No. Come on man. 
HAROON YOu said I just had to hold my ground. 
JOLIE Well at least you've still got your teeth. 
HAROON You're an asshole. 
JOLIE Let me get you back. Come to the movies with me tonight dude. The new Ice Tea flick is out. The tickets on me. Coke, popcorn, the whole nine. 
Haroon rolls his eyes and shakes his head. 
HAROON The whole nine? It's a movie. 
JOLIE It's an Ice Tea flick and it's gonna be tight as a mug. 
Haroon looks disgusted and offended. 
INT. DARK GHETTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
Henrietta leans in close to Jolie's ear. They whisper to each OTHER: 
JOLIE We had an early game today against Paint Branch. And I scored 3 points. 
HENRIETTA You know I saw you with that Cheerleader. 
JOLIE Come on. Enough with that. I washed my hands already. So I can please you. 
HENRIETTA Just tell me yall are hooking up. It's OK if you are. I just want the truth. 
JOLIE You want the truth. How is this? 
Jolie reveals a plastic case meant for baseball cards. Out of it he slides a small newspaper cut out. 
A picture of Francisco getting arrested with the headline `Sex Video Arrest.' 
HENRIETTA (ASHAMED) Yeah. Francisco got arrested. What about it? 
JOLIE I thought you said you didn't fuck any of them. 
HENRIETTA I didn't. 
JOLIE Did you suck their dicks? 
HENRIETTA Jolie. It's none of your fucking business. 
JOLIE Well everyone at school says you did. And now they're saying there's a video and that's why Francisco and Merly got arrested. 
HENRIETTA They're not arrested. They got questioned and shit and then they got suspended. 
JOLIE How do you know? 
HENRIETTA Because I hear all the Maple Ave stuff. 
Haroon pretends to watch the movie but is obviously uncomfortable. 
HAROON Shhh. It's getting good you know. 
Henrietta rolls her eyes and looks upset. 
HENRIETTA Jolie. I saw Christine was all over you at school. 
JOLIE She's just like that. She's a cheerleader. 
HENRIETTA Tell me something. What do you really want to do with your life? 
JOLIE What do I want to do? 
HENRIETTA Why do you repeat everything I say? 
JOLIE What do I wanna do? I mean, you know that, right? 
HENRIETTA You're five-eight. 
JOLIE Spud Web was five seven. 
HENRIETTA Jolie. 
JOLIE What? 
Henrietta's father Mr. Aaronson, rolls up in a VW van and speaks from the window. 
MR. AARONSON So what's happening kids? Haroon said you guys were talking about important stuff? 
HENRIETTA Dad, we're fucking studying here! Do you mind? 
MR. AARONSON In the parking lot? I just wanted to see if you guys needed anything. I made Rice Krispy treats. They're still hot. 
He showcases a saran wrapped tray. 
HENRIETTA Dad, have you seen how fucking fat I am!? 
MR. AARONSON Henrietta. Just because you don't want any doesn't mean Jolie doesn't. Tutoring is hard work, after all. (TO JOLIE) I tutored high school kids in Oakland in the 60's, and - 
HENRIETTA Dad, we all know the story of you saving kids in the ghetto, ok? 
MR. AARONSON Jolie, are you hungry? 
JOLIE UH- 
HENRIETTA Jolie's bailing, Dad. Come on. 
Henrietta hops into the Van. 
MR. AARONSON Oh. Well. That's cool. That's cool. 
Henrietta looks bummed. She cups her stomach and looks at it. Then scowls at Jolie. 
JOLIE I'm really sorry, Mr. Aaronson, but- 
HENRIETTA Dad. Just drive please. 
MR. AARONSON No worries, Jolie. Catch you later. 
Mr. Aaronson makes the West coast gang sign as a friendly gesture as a good-bye as he drives off. 
Jolie and Haroon watch them leave. 
INT. METRO - NIGHT 
The train rumbles along. 
HAROON So you've been tutoring her in Algebra and that's it? 
JOLIE Yea. 
HAROON Whatever man. 
JOLIE What? 
HAROON I was sitting right there. 
JOLIE So? 
HAROON So man. I saw what was going on. I'm not an idiot. 
ARIUS Man, Francisco is in the papers. You haven't seen? (turns and tugs at a CHEERLEADER) Come here, girl. Sit on my lap. 
Wendel lights a cig. 
Jolie lays a towel over his head and turns to Wendel. 
JOLIE Henrietta didn't really fuck any of them, did she? I mean she was just posing nude for some photos, right? 
WENDEL Well, they just paid her to do a little strip tease or whatever but things escalated. 
JOLIE How can it just escalate? 
WENDEL How did World War 2 escalate? It just did. Someone pulled out his junk teasing her, and then she started messing around with her tongue on his balls, just laughing and stuff. And it just went from there. 
JOLIE Dude? If this is a psych, you got me. OK? Just tell me the truth. 
WENDEL I'm not lying. I'm dead serious. You can see for yourself. 
JOLIE It got erased I thought. 
WENDEL The original did. But Arius has a copy. 
Jolie tugs on his underarm hair, worried. 
They look over at Arius who is daydreaming. 
ARIUS (TO HIMSELF) Booooom. 
WENDEL Arius! 
Arius snaps out of it. 
WENDEL What happened to your head man? 
ARIUS The doctors said I was crazy so they took a little piece of my brain out. 
WENDEL No they didn't. 
ARIUS Yes they did. Look. 
Arius shows off the top of his head 
JOLIE Damn. 
CLOSE ON: Arius's brutal scar in his head. Arius pushes at it with his fingers. 
ARIUS See how soft it is? 
JOLIE Yeah. 
Arius laughs. Looks around to make sure no one's listening in. 
ARIUS Come by Coach Dales office tomorrow at 3 o'clock. (MORE) 
ARIUS (CONT'D) While he's gone opening up the weight-room I'm showing the tape for five bucks a head. You have never seen anything like this, I promise you. 
A yellow Geo Jeep with 5 very thugged out kids rolls up. 
ARIUS Arright y'all. 
Arius gives them the finger from the packed with 6 Jeep as it speeds off (Geo's are equipt with only 4 seats) 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Everyone working away - Haroon and Jolie seated in the back with a giant stand alone magnifying glass. 
The teacher MR. APPLEBAUM puts a paper on Jolie's desk labeled B+, then Haroon's, labeled B-. 
HAROON B minus!? Are you serious? 
MR. APPLEBAUM Watch the language Mister Mochtarzada. 
HAROON Did you even read this shit? 
MR. APPLEBAUM Thin ice Haroon. 
HAROON Come on Mr. Applebaum? The whole undercover hooker bust opening in this thing is genius. 
GUY BEHIND THE CAMERA What would your daddy say if he saw this? 
HENRIETTA (affecting a sexy voice) He'd knock me out for the rest of my life. 
The kids in the room break out into ad-lib excitement. 
ARIUS Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Look. Right there. That's Francisco in the back. 
In the background of the video is a doorway to a hallway, and crouched on the floor as if waiting for a long time, is Francisco. 
CHRISTINE Coach Dale is coming. I'm serious. He's coming now. 
Wendel flips on the Sega Genesis. John Madden '95 appears on the screen. 
Christine and Wendel each grab a controller. 
Coach Dale enters. 
COACH DALE No weightroom today guys, we got some studying to do. This is a copy of last years Springbrook game. Get comfortable, this could be a while. 
The cheerleaders gather themselves. 
Coach Dale tries to insert the game tape but the VHS of Henrietta is still inside. He ejects the mystery tape, looks at it, unlabeled, and puts it in his bag. 
COACH DALE (cont.) Girls, you are welcome to watch but please keep it down, we have our work cut out for us. 
The cheerleaders leave, Christine the last to straggle along, grabs Jolie's hand briefly on the way out. 
Coach Dale turn off the lights and presses play on the game tape. 
Arius considers swiping the VHS. So does Jolie. But there's no opportunity. 
The low quality recording of a game plays: one pixilated, long take. 
The blue team scores. The white team - THE BLAZERS - in-bound the ball, and the camera pans following the action. The video as primitive as it gets. 
Jolie is in a daze about what has seen with Henrietta. 
Coach Dale pauses the tape. 
COACH DALE Now what was wrong with that shot? (BEAT) Jolie? 
ARIUS He shot on the first pass of a half court set. 
COACH DALE Are you Jolie? 
ARIUS (scowling at the coach) Do I look like white to you? 
Beat. 
Coach Dale assails Arius, wrestling him into a hold on the floor. 
COACH DALE How does it feel? 
ARIUS Owwww. My arm. 
The other players stand back feeling awkward about the semi- abusive coach. 
COACH DALE How does it feel? 
ARIUS Ah. Ah. Ah. 
COACH DALE Look in my eyes. How does it feel? 
ARIUS Ahhhhhh! 
COACH DALE If I ever see you back away from a rebound again I'm gonna bench you for the season. You wont play one second the whole year. You got that boy? 
Arius pinned and cringing squirms, eyes tearing, shirt bunching up and revealing a tatoo on his back for "Maple Ave." 
While everyone's distracted Jolie eyes the bag with the VHS, inching closer. Just as he's about to make his move the coach release Arius and sits back down. 
Then he pounces on Arius again and Jolie quickly grab the tape. 
ARIUS Ahhhhh! 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Hold. 
INT. FOOTLOCKER 
As Chris Rock would say, Jolie, Christine and Haroon are in the mall `white people used to go to.' 
Jolie takes a suede Timberland boot off the shelf. 
JOLIE Dude, I was thinking about getting some Tims. 
HAROON So what? 
JOLIE So you haven't noticed all the kids on the team wear them? 
CHRISTINE Duh. 
HAROON Man, with sandals you never have to tie your shoes. That's all I'm saying. 
Jolie sizes up the boot next to his foot and looks in the mirror. 
JOLIE Do you have these in a size ten. And bring a what - (looks to Haroon) Size 7? Yeah size seven for Haroon. 
Footlocker kid nods and goes. 
HAROON I told you, man, I don't want Tims. I'm a sandals guy. Like Jesus. And Muhammad. 
Haroon sits down defeated and looks in the mirror. 
CHRISTINE You'd look good in them, Haroon. You should try them on. Come on. Be cool. 
Haroon looks at his toes, wiggles them. 
Christine and Jolie french kiss as the Footlocker Kid returns with three boxes of shoes, stopping short to watch Jolie and Christine make-out. Haroon looks away sheepishly. 
Begin the make out montage: 
EXT. BLAZERS GYM PARKING LOT - DUSK 
Run down gravel plot built to fit fifteen cars. Empty except for Jolie and Christine. 
Wendel and Arius driving off in a bright yellow Geo jeep packed with 7 other kids. 
Christine and Jolie are french kissing. Both wearing their Timberland boots. 
EXT. BEAUTIFUL CEMETERY - NIGHT 
On the bank of a stream. 
Jolie unzips Christine's daisy dukes under the moonlight and traces her exposed skin with the tips of his fingers. 
EXT. EMPTY "SAFEWAY" GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Drizzling. 
Jolie's Toyota Camry is fogged up, and there are feet in the window. 
INT. TACO BELL - NIGHT 
Jolie and Christine are kissing. 
CASHIER Anything else with that? 
We see Christine slip Jolie a lot of tongue. 
EXT. TACO BELL PARKING LOT - DAY 
Jolie and Christine walk out of the bell. 
MR. AARONSON Jolie. 
Jolie turns to see Mr. Aaronson and Henrietta in their VW van. Henrietta sits all the way in the back wearing headphones. 
JOLIE Mr. Aaronson. 
HENRIETTA Dad. 
MR. AARONSON What's up? You kids want anything from the Bell. 
CHRISTINE Hurry up. 
JOLIE Dang. I don't see one here. 
CHRISTINE What? 
JOLIE Well maybe we can just do it a little bit. 
CHRISTINE No way. 
Christine rolls over. 
Jolie is still for a moment. 
JOLIE (WHISPERS) I won't even do it. I'll just feel it. 
Jolie nestles close to her. 
Beat. 
The sheets move. 
Christine lightly moans. 
CHRISTINE (BARELY AUDIBLE) Oh. 
The covers begin to shuffle 
CLOSE ON: Jolie's closed eyes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. FANTASY SMOKE FILLED BASKETBALL COURT 
A spotlit Jolie dribbling down a seemingly endless court. 
Faint roars of an unseen sell-out crowd cheer him on. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) In my head I kept thinking about dribbling a basketball down an endless basketball court, playing point guard in the biggest game of the year. The Springbrook game. 
A spotlit Christine does a cartwheel followed by a split. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) That kept me focused so I wouldn't bust in about two seconds. 
Jolie looks down at his soiled pants, forgetting his basketball that bounces off into darkness. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) I was gonna pull out but... 
Three old white referees, also spotlit, are blowing their whistles and pointing furiously at Jolie as they charge closer, revealing they all have the face of Mr. Aaronson. 
BACK TO: 
INT. JOLIE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT 
Jolie's face of extreme worry. 
JOLIE Uh, I better not keep going. 
CHRISTINE (under her breath) Oh. Fuck. 
Silence. 
Christine takes a few second to cool off. 
CHRISTINE Have any music we can listen to? 
JOLIE Yea. 
Jolie grabs some sheets around him and walks over to desk with CDs and junk. In a sneeky manor he grabs a tissue and wipes himself clean, then grabs a Handi-Snacks wrapper and throws them in the trash together. 
Then he pulls out an All Eyes on Me CD. We get a long close up of the cover. 
The music begins to play. 
Jolie and Christine cuddle. 
CHRISTINE Do you ever wish you were Tu Pac? 
ARIUS My fucking gut. I'm bleeding all over my fucking Guess. My Guess shit man! 
RAY Ah fuck man. I'm OK. I think I'm OK. 
A large crowd has gathered around the blood and broken window in the aftermath of a fight. 
ARIUS Ah shit, man! Ahhh! My fucking gut is burning! 
JOLIE Holly shit. You need help. Someone call an ambulance. 
HAROON Whoa dude. That is a lot of blood. Where is he going? 
JOLIE I dunno. 
Arius hobbles around leaving a trail of blood on the linoleum tiles as Principal Ganus and Mr. Applebaum appear on the scene and hold him up. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS An ambulance is on the way. 
Arius is hobbled out. Ray is shepparded off by Mr. Applebaum.. 
A trail of small spats of blood across the linoleum floor. 
Principal Ganus is surveying the scene with a few of the kids who were present. 
INT. PACKED BLAZER GYM - NIGHT 
The crowd is filled with energy. 
Brightly lit.   A home game. Everything is red, white, and black. 
The glossy floor shines like it has just been polished. 
Go-go music, blasting over the sub-par audio system, fades out. 
The fifteen Blair Blazers in their red and white warm ups have taken center court for a ritual. 
Huddled in a pack, hunched over and jumbled together with their arms around each other, swaying back and forth, they get pumped up: 
WENDEL Who's house? 
WHOLE TEAM OUR HOUSE! 
WENDEL Who's house? 
WHOLE TEAM OUR HOUSE! 
WENDEL Who's house? 
WHOLE TEAM OUR HOUSE! 
Ad-lib hollers in excitement as the huddle breaks and they head for the bench. 
Players wipe the soles of their shoes on the way over. 
COACH DALE OK, starting five. Let's go. 
Five players shed their warm ups and gather on the bench. Jolie is one of the starters. 
COACH DALE OK, we're gonna come out in a twenty-two going black on made buckets. Wendel and Jolie up front. 
Everyone puts their hands in together in a circle. 
COACH DALE Defense on three. 
WENDEL Defense on three. One! Two! Three! 
LATER 
The bench players have formed an entry way for the starters to take the court. 
On a crappy microphone: 
ANNOUNCER Starting at point guard. Number twenty two. Joel "Jolie" Jolson. 
Jolie trots the isle of his teammates. Wendel stoically slaps fives and gives pounds as he takes center floor. 
He takes in the experience - looking at the huge crowd in the stands around him. All applauding. 
They pass a Black Volvo and an old Red Volkswagen Bug and Golden Retriever sleeping in the yard. 
They hop into the Minivan. Jolie takes a big bite of the rice crispy treat as they drive past a "speed hump" sign. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) It must have been good for Henrietta too, because afterwords, she didn't mention joining the team to the Bowe fight, she didn't mention Christine, she didnt mention nothing. 
As they drive off Jolie looks back at Henrietta's home getting smaller and smaller. A speed hump sign in the foreground, and a basketball hoop set up on the street. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) Still though, I was worried she'd show anyway. If she did, I didn't know what I was gonna do. 
EXT. CITY PLACE MALL - NIGHT 
Wide, dark, empty streets, lit up by pools of light from street lamps. 
Haroon and Jolie cross to: Muhammad Ali's Chicken, a restaurant with TV's in the windows, and a color scheme of red, black, and white. 
HAROON So she was just pissed because you didn't invite her to this? 
JOLIE Yeah. 
HAROON But it sounds like she was really freaking out. I mean you said she smashed their PC. 
JOLIE Yeah, when I first got there she didn't even have any clothes on. (MORE) 
JOLIE (CONT'D) She threw her pajamas into the fireplace. I swear to God. 
HAROON I don't know. I mean maybe something more is going on? 
They pass a BLIND BLACK MAN in a black suit poking around a seeing-eye stick, trying to orient himself. 
HAROON (CONT'D) I mean, she's pregnant and it sounds like she's keeping the baby. Like she's fulfilling some need or something. 
JOLIE Yeah - the need for something. 
They cackle. 
HAROON You wear a condom right? 
JOLIE I don't have to. She's pregnant. 
They laugh harder. 
HAROON Ah man. Ah man. That is crazy. 
INT. CITY PLACE MALL 
They enter and their demeanors shift - they both affect bravado. 
HAROON (SOFTLY) Have you ever been here? 
JOLIE (SOFTLY) Not for a fight? 
INT. MUHAMMAD ALI'S CHICKEN 
Haroon and Jolie walk threw looking for their friends; we take in the setting as they do. 
An old dude finishes a coke through a straw; we hear the loud bubbling noise. The giant plastic cup has a picture of Muhammad Ali in his prime. 
B & W Muhammad Ali posters fill the walls. Ali stands in glory over his unconscious opponents, or lays blows to their faces, sweat frozen in the air as it flies from their bodies. 
The food is laid out cafeteria style. The tables and booths are a step above any fast food joint. Televisions hang from every angle, some even face the streets to attract pedestrians. 
On every television, without exception: a boxing match. Bowe versus a large white guy, Golota. 
Watching are about a hundred and fifty black people of all ages, mostly male, packing the restaurant. 
The crowd subdued by the early rounds. 
Jolie finds his friends from the team and their girlfriends lining the shinny metal railing that guides people along the buffet style assortment of chicken and biscuits. 
Jolie is the only white person in the whole spot. 
CHRISTINE Hey. 
JOLIE Hey. 
CHRISTINE Did you see those guys who killed Jordan's Dad got life? 
Kids and parents walk in droves. 
COACH DALE (O.S.) This is where we find out what we're made of. 
EXT. TICKET BOOTH WINDOW IN GYMNASIUM 
The line spirals around the corner and down the steps. 
COACH DALE (O.S.) What we have trained for, not just this season, but for you seniors, the last four years. 
CLOSE ON: A ticket torn at the door. One in a long line. 
INT. BLAZERS WEIGHT ROOM 
Coach Dale is directly in front of a stand alone chalk board. 
COACH DALE (O.S.) Is it unfair that we drew Springbrook in the first round? Yes. Random seeding is only because the sorry white schools complained to the school board about always losing in the first round. When I was younger the regular season meant something around here. 
Coach Dale begins diagraming the board. 
COACH DALE (CONT'D) But that means nothing now. We gotta go out and play no matter what. We're gonna open in a one- twenty-two. Wendel on the ball, Pistol on the two. Falling back into the half court, we go one- twenty FIVE. Forcing left. Trap and take the throwback. (SUDDENLY DISTURBED) Where's Jolie? 
ASSISTANT COACH He's such a goof ball, man. This is the playoffs. Where is he at?! Who's seen Jolie?! 
INT. LOCKERROOM SHOWERS 
Three Cheerleaders drag Jolie, with his bandaged thumb, to the showers. Jolie looks genuinely scared. 
JOLIE Ms. Bart. I know you're the cheerleading coach and all, but this really better be important. I'm supposed to be in the weight- room by now. 
CHEERLEADING COACH You're injured. And like I said, this is more important than any basketball game. This is life or death Jolie. 
They arrive at the last shower stall - Christine on her knees in tears. 
JOLIE Christine? 
Jolie steps into the shower. 
The Coach leaves them alone. 
CHRISTINE Jolie. I haven't had my period in three months. 
She sobs. 
Jolie gets on his knees. 
JOLIE Well, maybe you should get one of those things and check it out. 
CHRISTINE A pregnancy test? 
JOLIE Yeah. 
CHRISTINE I did. (SHE CRIES) I'm pregnant with your baby. 
She cries and shivers. 
Beat. 
JOLIE No worries. My Dad will let me put it on his credit card. Trust me. 
She cries. 
Suddenly Jolie has a face of determination. He unwraps his bandaged thumb and throws it on the floor. 
CHRISTINE Oh God. I'm sorry. 
JOLIE No. It's not your fault. I gotta run though. Let's talk about this after the game, OK? The team needs me. 
Christine nods but clearly wants to refuse. 
CHRISTINE What for? You're injured anyway. 
JOLIE I'm ok though. I can play through it. do you understand. I just gotta do this? 
CHRISTINE What? I just told you I'm pregnant with your baby. Doesn't that mean anything. 
JOLIE Tonight I'm gonna play for you and our baby. 
A couple of kids are slammed loudly against the window in the excitement. 
Through the glass Jolie can hear: 
BLACK GIRL We won! We won! We won! 
SUPERIMPOSE in the top left corner in white letters: OJ Simpson was just found not guilty. 
The hallway is growing into total commotion and chaos. 
Jolie walks through the doorway into the hall and the camera follows without a cut. 
Jolie looks out of place as he takes it all in. 
The wild scene rages. 
Jolie looks back into the main office. 
Ray comes out of Principal Ganus's door. His eyes red from tears, he curses to himself. 
Principal Ganus emerges, acknowledges the commotion in the hallway. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS What the hell is going on out there? 
JOLIE OJ Simpson....not guilt. 
Principal Ganus is stone faced. He gestures Jolie into his office. 
Ray brushes shoulders with Jolie. 
RAY You're dead. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Look who you're stepping to, Ray. A little white boy? 
Ray blows it off. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS (BEAT) Jolie. Come with me. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Look. I'm not proud of what happened in that gym. 
Surrounded by proud school ornaments and paraphernalia. 
Jolie sits alone in a chair, an empty chair adjacent him. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Everyone who was caught fighting is being suspended for a minimum of three days. And that includes most of the team. But a suspension for you would only tarnish the reputation of the Magnet program. So... 
Principal Ganus thumbs through a manila envelope. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS You're going to do this school a favor, (BEAT) at the international math meet. 
He hands Jolie a form. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS You were great your freshman year. Your calculus teacher tells me your still great, but for some reason you quit. 
JOLIE I made JV that year. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Well, there's going to be no rematch of the Springbrook playoff game. Both teams are forfeiting. So now you've got plenty of time, that's for damn sure. 
JOLIE They're not rescheduling our game? That's insane. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS The math team needs you Jolie. We're on the verge of nationals. (MORE) 
PRINCIPAL GANUS (cont'd) This year we settles for nothing less than number one, second to none. (BEAT) In whole numbers. 
The principal laughs at his own joke. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS You can go now. 
Stunned, Jolie grabs his bag and heads for the door. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Oh, one more thing. You will also join the team for an additional 40 hours of community service, as part of the new "Adopt a Highway" Program. It's part of the team punishment. 
INT. BALZERS HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
JOLIE It's not fair man. I mean everyone got suspended on the team but me. Just because I'm in the Magnet. 
JOLIE Wow. 
ARIUS Yeah. This is the future right here. 
JOLIE Why wont it go play or whatever? 
ARIUS Bandwidth. 
JOLIE (CONFUSED) Oh yea. 
Jolie tokes a blunt. 
Arius takes a last puff and puts it out. 
A little cute six year old girl comes out of the bedroom with a sheet of paper and pencil. 
CUTE GIRL Arius. Who was the first president of the United States? 
ARIUS Uh, George Washington. 
She runs back into the bedroom. 
ARIUS So. That's what it's all about. I'm a capital venturist man. Internet porn is the future of sexual healing. Henrietta was just the first of many. It's big business. Dollar bills man. 
Jolie looks on, stoned. Not sure what to make of it all. 
EXT. THE BELTWAY - DAWN 
A six lane highway banks a sharp curve. It's raining lightly. 
On the shoulder of the highway are kids from the Blair Basketball team picking up trash with pokers. They are spread out - a kid every 25 yards or so - and together they extend clear around the curve and out of sight. 
Jolie pokes a Coke can. 
Jolie plucks the can off the end metal nail and realizes he also stabbed the tape liner notes of MC Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt'em." There is a picture of Hammer on the cover. 
The coach sits in a nearby van with its lights on, parked in the shoulder. He sips hot coffee, watching. 
Jolie looks closely at the tape insert. 
It's a picture of Hammer but someone has scratched out his eyes with a pen. And the poker has put a hole through his face. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) I wasn't sure what to make of it all. Why Henrietta's parents never know she was pregant until too late? Or why I never said something myself? It was like none of it really mattered, or was even real at all, until it was too late. 
CLOSE ON: An old PC monitor. A picture slowly emerging from a blurry pixilated square of colors. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) After that I used the internet to find a bunch of places that would take Henrietta's baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy, but I found all the information right from Haroon's basement, using Netscape. 
The picture of a couple materializes: hopeful parents and their profile. 
INT. HAROON'S SECOND HOME - DAY 
HAROON This couple looks good. 
JOLIE Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're perfect. All I have to do is convince Henrietta. 
HAROON Are you guys still on good terms? 
JOLIE I don't know. Our sessions are in the kitchen now. 
Adreseis enters. 
ADRESEIS We got the trampoline set-up. Come on. 
They make their way to the back yard. 
EXT. HAROON'S BACKYARD - DAY 
Haroon's brothers have set up a trampoline to dunk on an adjustable rim lowered to 8 ft. 
The younger brothers do an awesome array of dunks. Jolie and Haroon sit on the side. 
JOLIE (BUMMED) It's weird, I don't really care if I make the NBA anymore. 
HAROON Really? What do you care about then? 
JOLIE I don't know.

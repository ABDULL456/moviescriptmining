500 DAYS OF SUMMER 
Written by 
Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber 
First Draft 
SIMPLE BLACK ON WHITE CREDITS ROLL TO BIG STAR'S "I'M IN LOVE WITH A GIRL." When all is said and done, up comes a single number in parenthesis, like so: 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says a word. 
CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants to be looked at. 
A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us. 
NARRATOR This is a story of boy meets girl. 
CUT TO: 
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t- shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored. 
NARRATOR The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his... "soulmate." 
CUT TO: 
INT LIVING ROOM - 1989 
PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV, we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!" 
NARRATOR This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, "The Graduate." 
CUT TO: 
INT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY 
The girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to get away with it. 
NARRATOR The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. 
CUT TO: 
INT BATHROOM - 1994 
Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair extends down to her lower back. 
NARRATOR Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things. The first was her long blonde hair. 
She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice. 
NARRATOR The second was how easily she could cut it off... And feel nothing. 
CUT TO: 
SPLITSCREEN. INT BOARDROOM/ INT CUBICLE - SAME 
On the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to some boring presentation. On the left, Summer answers a call, takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long narrow hallway. 
NARRATOR Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building. In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for. 
CU Summer opening the door to the boardroom, about to come face to face with Tom for the first time. 
NARRATOR This is a story of boy meets girl. 
But before they do, 
CUT TO: 
BLACK. 
NARRATOR You should know up front, this is not a love story. 
EXT STREETS OF SAN FRAN - NIGHT 
A 12 year old GIRL rides her bicycle down the block. She arrives at an apartment complex, jumps off the bike and races up the front stairs. She rings the doorbell. 
INT TOM'S PLACE - LATER 
PAUL and MCKENZIE open the door. These are Tom's best friends since birth. Paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs. McKenzie works in the cubicle next to Tom. 
INT DINER - NIGHT 
Tom and Summer in a booth ordering dinner. 
TOM (to WAITRESS) Um...you know what...let's go crazy, I'll have BOTH. (to Summer) God, I love eating pancakes at night. It's like the greatest thing ever. How great is this? 
SUMMER I think we should stop seeing each other. 
INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE 
RACHEL Just like that? 
TOM Just like that. 
PAUL Did she say why? 
INT DINER - AS BEFORE 
SUMMER This thing. This whatever it is. You and me. Do you think this is normal? 
TOM I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy? 
SUMMER You're happy? 
TOM You're not? 
SUMMER All we do is argue! 
TOM That is such a lie! 
INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE 
RACHEL Maybe she was just in a bad mood. 
PAUL A hormonal thing. 
RACHEL P.M.S.? 
TOM (to Rachel) What do you know about PMS? 
RACHEL More than you. 
TOM Oh my god. 
MCKENZIE Please continue. 
INT DINER - AS BEFORE 
SUMMER This can't be a total surprise. I mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months. 
TOM Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious. 
SUMMER No... I'm Sid. 
TOM (BEAT) So I'm Nancy?! 
The Waitress comes out with the food. Tom and Summer stop their discussion until the meal is served and the Waitress leaves. Summer starts to eat. 
SUMMER Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after. I'm starving. 
Without another word she goes back to her pancakes. Tom watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the history of mankind. 
SUMMER (mouth full) Mmm, you're so right. These are great! 
Tom looks at his food in disgust. He may never eat again. 
SUMMER (INNOCENT) What? 
Tom stands up to go. 
SUMMER Tom, don't. Come back. You're still my best fr--- 
THE SCENE FREEZES AND WE ZOOM IN ON TOM'S STUNNED FACE. 
INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE 
Silence for a few beats. 
PAUL Jesus. 
MCKENZIE That's harsh. 
TOM I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
PAUL Oh shit. 
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Tom as we saw him earlier. Bored. In the boardroom. Mckenzie is in mid-presentation. 
MCKENZIE Now I know this may be a little risque...but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that. 
Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from "Jerry Maguire". 
MCKENZIE May 21st. Other Mother's Day. 
The co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of the department. 
VANCE Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman's "Magellan Day" I'd say we've got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these? 
Tom is about to answer when... the door opens. 
SUMMER Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a call for you on line 3. 
And in walks this girl. Summer. We've met her by now but Tom hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from that moment on, he can't take them off her. 
VANCE (to the table) Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here from... 
SUMMER Michigan. 
VANCE Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this. 
SUMMER Nice to meet you all. 
Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out. 
She doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen God. 
INT. OFFICE - DAY 
Tom trying to work. And failing. He turns to McKenzie. 
TOM What do we know about this new girl? 
MCKENZIE Who? 
TOM The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office. 
MCKENZIE Dude. I hear she's a bitch from hell! 
TOM (DISAPPOINTED) Really? 
MCKENZIE Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it. 
TOM Maybe she was just in a hurry. 
MCKENZIE And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank. 
TOM Damn. 
MCKENZIE I know. She's pretty hot. 
TOM That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it? 
MCKENZIE Dunno. 
TOM Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin... 
MCKENZIE ...and really good teeth. 
TOM And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe? 
MCKENZIE (as explanation) Women. 
TOM Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already. 
INT. ELEVATOR - LATER 
Tom is listening to headphones. Summer enters the elevator and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her. Summer hears the music. 
SUMMER The Smiths. 
Tom, pretending not to hear or care, gives her an unenthusiastic wave. 
SUMMER I love The Smiths. 
Tom, still pretending, takes off his headphones. 
TOM And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper. 
RACHEL Your favorites. 
TOM We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing. 
RACHEL Oh boy. 
TOM What? 
RACHEL You know...just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her "the one." 
TOM (BEAT) Of course it does. 
SARAH (O.S.) Dinner! 
SARAH, 50s, Tom and Rachel's mother, stands in the doorway. 
SARAH Pause and come eat. 
They do. Tom enters the living room area and sits down next to his stepdad MARTIN, 60s, a quiet, professorial Southern gentleman type. 
TOM Hey Martin. 
ANGLE ON RACHEL and Sarah. 
RACHEL He met a girl. 
SARAH (EXCITED) Yeah? 
RACHEL (GRIM) Yeah. 
Sarah grows serious too. 
SARAH Oh shit. 
CUT TO: 
STOCK FOOTAGE. 
The Wright Brothers, Galileo, Heaven's Gate, Neil Armstrong. 
NARRATOR When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds. 
END ON: 
LITTLE TOM, age 6, mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of Olivia Newton-John in "Xanadu." 
NARRATOR Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of "true love." (BEAT) The evidence did not support him. 
CUT TO: 
INT CLASSROOM - DAY 
Little Tom stares at a LITTLE GIRL, 6, who has the same hairstyle and dress as Newton-John on that cover. Tom draws a picture. It's a boy and a girl with a giant heart over them. 
He stands up and walks over to the girl, putting the picture on her desk. Not a word is spoken. Satisfied, he returns to his seat and waits to see what happens. 
NARRATOR Exhibit A: Lisa Rayner. 
The Little Girl stands up and walks the picture over to ANOTHER BOY. 
Tom is mortified. The OTHER BOY eats the drawing. 
EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT 
A BLONDE CHEERLEADER leads the crowd in a cheer. PAN ACROSS to find TEENAGE TOM, 15, finishing making out with a homely HIGH SCHOOL GIRL. He says goodbye and walks off, looking back longingly. 
NARRATOR Exhibit B: Wendy Wilson. 
Once Tom is out of frame, a SECOND BOY approaches Wendy. Then they start making out. 
INT AIRPLANE - DAY 
COLLEGE TOM sits next to his girlfriend REBECCA MYLES. His smile gleams. 
TOM I'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec. I know we've only been dating a few months but it's been...awesome. 
NARRATOR Exhibit C: Rebecca Myles. 
TOM And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever! 
Across the aisle Rebecca makes eye contact with three COLLEGE DUDES. 
INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE 
The friends wait for more. 
TOM You believe that shit? 
MCKENZIE What shit? 
PAUL I think I missed something. 
TOM "It was good." She didn't say "It was good." She said "It was good." Emphasis on the good. She basically said "I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym." Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over. 
Everyone's silent. 
MCKENZIE What the hell is wrong with you?! 
PAUL Dude, you got problems. 
TOM She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do. 
MCKENZIE Based on..."it was good?" TOM And some other things. 
PAUL Like what, she said "hey" instead of "hi" cause that totally means she's a lesbian. 
TOM I gave her all sorts of chances. 
INT OFFICE - DAY 
Tom types at his desk. Summer approaches the cubicle Tom shares with McKenzie. 
SUMMER I'm going to the supply room. Anyone need anything? 
MCKENZIE No thanks. 
TOM I think you know what I need. 
There's a beat. 
TOM Toner. 
SUMMER Oh ok, sure, no prob. 
INT OFFICE - LATE IN THE DAY 
The office is emptying out. Only a few people remain but Tom and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's "I Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner. No reaction from Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down, defeated. 
INT SUMMER'S DESK 
Tom is there. 
TOM Do you want to go out with me? 
A beat. Summer says nothing. 
TOM And the Priest says, "But we're already out!" 
They both laugh. 
SUMMER That is hilarious! 
TOM I know! 
And when she walks away, he smacks his head a few times with his palm. 
INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE 
TOM Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over. 
Tom's friends all look at him like he's crazy. 
INT OFFICE - TOM'S CUBICLE - DAY 
Tom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work. But with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard time concentrating. 
McKenzie shares a cubicle with Tom. 
MCKENZIE This Friday. 10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well. 
TOM No way McKenzie. Absolutely not. 
MCKENZIE Come on! (SINGING) "Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties!" 
TOM They won't let you back in there after last time. 
SUMMER No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not comfortable being somebody's "girlfriend." I don't want to be anybody's anything, you know? MCKENZIE I have no idea what you're talking about. 
SUMMER It sounds selfish, I know, but... I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. (MORE) 
SUMMER (cont'd) I say, let's have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later. 
TOM But...what if you meet someone and fall in love? 
SUMMER (LAUGHS) Love? You seriously believe in that stuff? 
TOM Of course I do. 
SUMMER Interesting. A real romantic. 
MCKENZIE Oh you have no idea. This one... embarrassing. There was this one girl, (to Tom) I gotta tell this story -- 
Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up. 
TOM Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love? 
SUMMER I don't even know what that word means. I know I've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents. 
TOM Well mine too but -- 
SUMMER Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in "love" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about? 
TOM Well... 
SUMMER Why, what's your take on it? 
CUT TO: 
AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO. 
BACK TO: 
INT BAR 
On Tom: 
TOM I think it's...kind of a huge thing. 
SUMMER (BEAT) Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one. 
McKenzie senses some discontent. 
MCKENZIE So, uh, who's singing next? 
SUMMER (re: singing) I'd say it's your turn loverboy. 
TOM Nooo. I don't sing in public. 
SUMMER Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in. 
TOM I don't... 
MCKENZIE You really do. 
SUMMER It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous. 
MCKENZIE (can't help himself) Self-confidence! Ha! 
Tom elbows him in the ribs again. 
TOM Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people. 
SUMMER Ok then. Let's drink. 
TOM It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing. 
SUMMER Bartender! 
TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's "Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts. It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching. 
LATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming something. 
TOM That's not it. 
SUMMER What is that then? 
TOM I have no idea. 
They're both having a good time. 
Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way. 
TOM (under his breath) Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot. 
Tom walks a few more steps. 
And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED HIM INTO A KISS! 
It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually happening. 
FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates. 
EXT STREET - MORNING 
It's the greatest morning of all time! 
Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes, winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back. 
People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up. A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom singing the song. 
Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean". 
CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at them. 
INT OFFICE - SAME 
Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees him and immediately lights up. 
SUMMER Hey! 
TOM Hey! 
Vance pokes out of his corner office. 
VANCE. Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen. 
TOM Hey Mr. Vance. 
SUMMER Yes, Mr. Vance? 
And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it. Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world. 
INT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT 
Tom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs). 
PAUL You son of a bitch. 
He walks inside without waiting for an invite. 
PAUL Last night, karaoke night? 
TOM (ANXIOUS) Shhh. 
PAUL The same girl you'd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now? 
TOM I have not been... 
PAUL The same girl you said was way out of your league and you'd have no chance with no matter what. That girl? 
TOM Paul, seriously... 
PAUL Did you bang her? 
TOM No! 
PAUL Blow job? 
TOM No! 
PAUL Hand job? 
TOM No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed. 
PAUL Come on, level with me. As your best friend, who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl, nothing but Summer this, Summer that, Summer Summer Summer, I mean you were practically stalking her... 
TOM Shhh! 
Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out. 
PAUL Oh crap. 
SUMMER Hi, I'm Summer.. 
SUMMER Let's just have fun. Let's just...hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations. (BEAT) Ok? 
Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it. 
TOM Sure. 
SUMMER (BEAT) Wanna hold my hand under the table? 
A beat. 
TOM Yeah. 
INT TOM'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Summer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other. Suddenly, Tom stops. 
TOM I'll be...back in a sec. 
He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into the hallway mirror. 
TOM Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself. 
He takes a few deep breaths. 
TOM Are you calm? (BEAT) Ok. Then it's time to go back in. 
We watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom. Where Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked. 
SUMMER Hi. 
TOM Oh sweet Jesus! 
Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance. 
CUT TO: 
LATER. Sex has been had. Summer is asleep. Tom lies next to her. He still can't help but be ecstatic. He is pumping his fists in the air and silently shouting "Woo Hoo!!!!" 
CU - TOM. LOOKING THE WORSE FOR WEAR. UNSHAVEN, LONG HAIR, CRUMPLED CLOTHING. IN SHORT, HE'S A MESS. 
TOM (into CAMERA) I fucking hate Summer. 
CU - SUMMER'S SMILE (as before) 
TOM (V.O.) I hate her crooked teeth. 
CU - SUMMER'S HAIR (as before) 
TOM (V.O.) I hate her 1950s haircut. 
CU - SUMMER'S KNEES (as before) 
TOM (V.O.) I hate her knobby knees. 
CU - SUMMER'S EYES (as before) 
TOM (V.O.) I hate her lopsided, asymmetrical, cock-eyed head. 
CU - SUMMER'S NECK (as before) 
TOM (V.O.) I hate that centipede-shaped scar. 
CU - SUMMER'S BREASTS (as before) 
TOM (V.O.) I hate her...stupid...big boobs. 
CU - SUMMER ASLEEP (as before) 
TOM (V.O.) I hate the way she sleeps. 
CU - SUMMER'S LAUGH 
TOM (V.O.) I hate the way she laughs. 
OVER BLACK, play the middle 8 of "Every Little Thing She Does is Magic." 
TOM (V.O.) I HATE THIS FUCKING SONG! 
CU - TOM. 
REVERSE ANGLE on A TROLLEY FULL OF PEOPLE, terrified of this raving lunatic. 
BUS DRIVER Son, you're gonna have to exit the vehicle. 
TOM See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so... 
EXT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
Tom and Summer, who have ridden together to work, stand outside the building. 
SUMMER You wanna -- 
TOM No you go first. 
SUMMER It doesn't matter to me. 
TOM Whatever you want. 
A CO-WORKER passes. 
CO-WORKER Hey Summer. Tom. 
BOTH (like nothing's up) Hey./ Hi. 
Summer joins the co-worker and walks in. 
SUMMER (to Co-Worker) So how's it going? 
She turns back to look at Tom on the way. She sticks out her tongue to be cute. Co-Worker doesn't see. Tom is crazy about her. 
INT OFFICE - LATER 
Tom at his cubicle with the one architecture sketch. The phone rings and he picks it up. 
TOM Hello? 
SUMMER (V.O.) I remember! 
INT COPY ROOM - DAY 
Summer is on her cell phone in the office copy room. She begins to sing the theme song to "The A-Team." 
TOM (V.O.) That's it! 
McKenzie enters and sees her singing into the phone. Turns without a word and leaves. 
INT TOM'S CUBICLE - SAME 
Tom listening to her sing. McKenzie comes over. 
MCKENZIE Your girl is losing it. 
Tom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him. The smile on his face is the biggest we've seen yet. 
INT. SHOWER - LATER 
We just see the curtain, but we can see their silhouettes behind it. Summer and Tom are trying to have sex in the shower. They're trying to stable themselves, grip something so as not to fall, elbows are flying, it's a mess. 
SUMMER This is not at all as easy as it looks. 
TOM Ow! 
The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down. They fall on top of each other laughing. 
INT VIRGIN MEGASTORE - NIGHT 
Tom and Summer wander through the aisles. 
TOM There's no way. 
SUMMER Why not? 
TOM "Octopus's Garden?" You may as well just say "Piggies?" 
SUMMER I told you. I love Ringo. 
TOM You're insane. 
SUMMER Why? 
TOM Cause nobody loves Ringo. 
SUMMER That's what I love about him. (BEAT) Ooh. 
Summer drags Tom into the curtained-off "Porn" section. She picks up a box. 
SUMMER (FLIRTATIOUS) This got great reviews. 
SUMMER On some. 
TOM I like how you dress. 
SUMMER Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg? 
TOM (BEAT) Please don't. 
A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly appeared next to them. 
DOUCHE (to Summer) Hey. 
Tom and Summer stop talking. 
SUMMER Hey. 
DOUCHE How's it going? 
SUMMER Ok. 
Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more amused than concerned. 
DOUCHE You live around here? 
SUMMER Yeah not too far. 
DOUCHE I've never seen you here before. 
SUMMER You're not too perceptive. 
DOUCHE Ha. That's funny. 
Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry about. 
DOUCHE So, uh, let me buy you a drink. 
SUMMER No thank you. 
As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of them together. 
DOUCHE Are you with this guy? 
Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now. 
TOM (BEAT) Hi. I'm Tom. 
DOUCHE Whatever. (to Summer) Come on, one drink. What are you drinking? 
SUMMER Sorry, no thank you. 
Tom is pleased. 
DOUCHE You're serious? This guy? 
And now he's pissed. 
TOM Hey buddy -- 
SUMMER (to the Douche) Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok? 
DOUCHE It's a free country. 
Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now what?" After a beat: 
DOUCHE So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend? 
And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE. 
Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling. 
Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's fist). 
There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised. And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM. 
CUT TO: 
EXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it. 
TOM Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt. 
Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first time she's furious. 
Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring. It doesn't. 
INT TOM'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER 
Tom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the "sleep" button but the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm. It's his door. He gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer. 
SUMMER Say you're sorry. 
TOM Huh? 
SUMMER Say you're sorry for acting like a jerk. 
TOM I am. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk. 
SUMMER Ok. Me too. 
TOM Summer... we don't have to label what we're doing. I just... I need - 
SUMMER I know - 
TOM Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way. 
SUMMER I can't promise you that. Nobody can. Anyone who does is a liar. 
A beat. 
SUMMER I can only tell you how I feel right now... or I can show you. 
She comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second. Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins again. He shuts the door in our faces. 
INT TOM'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 
Tom and Summer in the wee hours. 
TOM Have you ever had a real "boyfriend?" 
SUMMER What? 
TOM A boyfriend. "Going steady." Whatever. You know what I mean. 
SUMMER Well... yeah. 
TOM More than one? 
SUMMER A few. 
TOM Tell me about them. 
SUMMER Oh no way. 
TOM Why? 
SUMMER Cause there's nothing to tell. 
TOM Come on, I'm interested. 
SUMMER You wanna have the relationship history conversation? 
TOM Yes. 
SUMMER You sure about that? 
TOM No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it. 
SUMMER Ok. Well, in high school, there was Markus. 
INSERT: Still photograph of MARKUS. Or at least how he appears in Tom's mind. Arm cocked, about to throw the winning touchdown pass. 
TOM Quarterback slash homecoming king? 
SUMMER He was a rower. Very hot. 
TOM What happened to Markus? 
SUMMER He works for the Republican party. Very successful. Just not for me. 
TOM Ok. And then? 
SUMMER Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt. 
INSERT: Still photograph of KURT. As Tom envisions him. Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue. 
SUMMER That didn't really go anywhere. (BEAT) And... my semester in Rome. Daniele Belardelli. AKA "The Puma." 
EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - (BACK ON DAY 51) 
Summer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the buildings. 
TOM A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that. 
Tom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the CAMERA. 
SUMMER While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, I'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire I am. 
INT RESTAURANT - SAME 
Tom and Alison. 
TOM Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know? 
INT SUMMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - (FROM DAY 39) 
From the scene in which Tom and Summer first slept together. He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had in a long while. Summer lies next to him. Wide awake. Bored and unfulfilled. 
INT RESTAURANT - SAME 
Tom and Alison. Alison is desperately trying to get a drink. 
ALISON Waiter! 
TOM Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with. 
INT ELEVATOR - DAY - (FROM DAY 22) 
Tom and Summer ride in silence for a few beats. 
TOM (BEAT) How was your weekend? 
SUMMER (winks at him) It was good. 
INT RESTAURANT - SAME 
TOM Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why. 
ALISON It's ok. I'm sure it's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend. 
TOM Actually she was never my girlfriend. 
Now Alison is really confused. And it's right around the part where Tom starts totally cracking up. 
TOM I just... I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is... When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird? 
ALISON You were in love, that's what it does. But, now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them. 
TOM Sure. (BEAT) Hey, I've been talking non-stop. You talk. 
ALISON Me? Well I grew up -- 
TOM So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now? 
ALISON I... (BEAT) (MORE) 
ALISON (cont'd) You wanna get out of here? I know this great... 
TOM (suddenly excited) Oh! You know what we should do... 
INT KARAOKE BAR - LATER 
Tom is, yes, on stage singing another song by The Clash, "Train in Vain." Not so much singing as having a nervous breakdown to music. 
TOM "You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped! 
Alison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face. 
TOM "You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me," I'm talking about you Summer! 
On Alison, having the worst date ever. 
CUT TO: 
INT TOM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out. A punkish pop song plays in the b.g. that he occasionally boogies down to. He's excited. 
He tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into the mirror. 
Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street. 
Tom is wandering through the office whistling. 
MCKENZIE Hansen, don't you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write? 
TOM Nope. All done. What are you working on? 
MCKENZIE Congratulations. But I've run out of ways to say it. "Good job," "well done," "way to go"... I got nothing. 
TOM Why don't you try... "Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a card." 
MCKENZIE (BEAT) Shit. That's not bad. 
TOM No worries. 
Tom walks by the room marked "Weddings and Anniversaries." He's about to keep going when he pauses. 
INT WEDDINGS AND ANNIVERSARIES SUITE - LATER 
All of the people who work in here are MIDDLE AGED WOMEN. Currently, they are standing around one desk where Tom sits writing everyone's cards. 
TOM This is good Millie. "To my wife, the love of my life. I love you." That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... "Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete." You know, spice it up a little. 
The Women clutch their heart like they might faint. 
INT RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS WING - LATER 
Workers are again all gathered around Tom. 
TOM Did you try... "Merry?" 
ALL Whoa/Perfect/Yes! 
TOM What else you got? 
EMPLOYEE #1 Passover. 
Tom says something totally in Yiddish. No one knows what the hell he just said except for one Employee who bursts out in tears of joy. 
INT OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER 
Tom passes Summer at her desk. She waves. He waves back. He's so in love with her. 
INT ANOTHER WING - LATER 
ANGLE ON TOM writing furiously at a computer terminal. 
TOM "...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!" (BEAT) How's that? 
The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAHOGANY WRITERS are impressed. 
MAHOGANY WRITER #1 Something's gotten into you son! 
TOM Yeah. It's pretty cool. 
EXT MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 
Tom and Summer in line to buy tickets. 
TOM You really want to see this? 
SUMMER It sounds amazing. 
TOM It's, like, all stabbing and shit. 
SUMMER Exactly. 
TOM Ok. 
SUMMER All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage. 
TOM Fantastic. 
Suddenly, Tom sees something at the front of the line. 
TOM Oh shit. 
SUMMER What? 
And here they come, Tom's mom and step-dad, Sarah and Martin. Tom's face registers a noticeable panic. 
SARAH Hey! 
Sarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence. Sarah hugs and kisses her son. 
SUMMER Then why are you here? 
TOM This is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it. 
SUMMER Yeah well, I didn't need a chaperone. Go home. You're a buzzkill standing there pouting. 
TOM (HURT) That's real nice. 
He walks off. She feels some guilt for a second. 
SUMMER Tom! 
But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again. 
LATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is alone. He can't believe it's come to this. 
FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates. 
EXT STREET - MORNING 
The worst morning ever. 
Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad, broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up. He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's brother Clint looks back. 
Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces. 
He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He doesn't even stop. 
Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away. 
The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for directions. He doesn't even look up. 
Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks. The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that. 
INT OFFICE - SAME 
He passes Summer desk on the way in. She's no longer there. He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends up just staring into space. 
INT VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Tom has been called into the Principal's office. 
TOM You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance? 
VANCE Yes Hansen. Sit down. 
TOM Ok. 
VANCE. Has something happened to you recently? 
TOM What do you mean? 
VANCE A death in the family, someone taken ill...anything like that? 
TOM No. 
VANCE Look, I don't mean to pry. Does this have something to do with Summer leaving. 
TOM Who? 
VANCE. My assistant. 
TOM (faking badly) Your...? 
VANCE. Tom...everyone knows. Nevermind. The reason I'm asking... lately your work performance has been... a little off. 
TOM I'm not following. 
VANCE For example, here's something you wrote last week... (reads from a card on his DESK) "Roses are Red, Violets are Blue. Fuck You Whore." Now...most shoppers on Valentine's Day --- 
TOM Mr. Vance... are you firing me? 
VANCE No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You're one of our most... adequate writers. 
TOM Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult. 
VANCE That's ok. I understand that. I was just thinking... perhaps you could channel your energy into... this. 
He hands him some sympathy cards. 
TOM Funerals and sympathy? 
VANCE Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live... it's perfect for you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now back to work you go. 
Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps. 
TOM Jesus Christ people! Get a room! 
They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away. 
INT TOM'S BEDROOM 
Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see Tom is wide awake. He probably hasn't slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to the alarm. 
INT OFFICE - LATER 
Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't muster responses. At his desk, 
MCKENZIE Tom! 
Nothing. 
MCKENZIE I've been calling every five minutes. Are you ok? 
TOM What? Oh yeah. Great. 
MCKENZIE Do you need anything? 
TOM Twinkies? 
MCKENZIE Sorry. 
TOM I'm out of twinkies. 
MCKENZIE Well let's go. 
TOM Go... where? 
MCKENZIE It's Thursday. 
INT BOARDROOM - LATER 
Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose. 
A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl." 
CO-WORKER This one says "Go for it!" 
She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch." 
CO-WORKER This one says "Don't give up!" 
Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap." 
CO-WORKER And this one says "You can do it!" We have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring Pickles, my cat. I think people will really enjoy them. Thank you. 
She takes her seat. 
VANCE. Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really inspirational stuff. Now, who's next. We haven't heard from "Sympathy" in a while. Hansen... 
TOM (reacting to his name) Hmm? 
VANCE. The Winter collection. You have anything to contribute? 
TOM Uh...no. I really don't. 
VANCE. You have nothing? 
TOM Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right. 
VANCE. (DISAPPOINTED) Oh...k. We'll come back to you. McKenzie -- 
TOM You know what...? 
VANCE. Yes Tom. 
TOM Can I say something about the cat? 
VANCE Well sure. Go ahead. 
TOM This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit. 
MCKENZIE Tom! 
TOM "Don't give up?" "You can do it?" 
He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to Leap" image. 
TOM (LYING) Sure. 
RACHEL Tom. 
TOM Hmm? 
RACHEL I know you think she was the perfect girl for you... (BEAT) I don't. I think you're just remembering the good stuff. But what do I know, right? I'm 13. 
She blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls. Tom watches her go. 
CUT TO: 
SPLITSCREEN - TOM'S BEDROOM/ SUMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Tom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear. 
TOM Hey. 
Summer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her side and she angles towards it. 
SUMMER Hello? 
TOM Are you still sleeping? 
SUMMER (GROGGY) I'm getting up. What time is it? 
TOM 10:30. Are we still hanging out today? 
SUMMER Ok. Sure. 
TOM I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes? 
SUMMER I might need 45. 
EXT PARK - DAY 
Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar, it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it all, finally, fell apart. 
TOM So how was last night? 
SUMMER It was fine. Just a work thing. 
TOM Where did you guys go? 
SUMMER Some restaurant. 
TOM Fun? 
SUMMER Uneventful. Didn't get home until after 12 though which is way too late for a stupid work function. How was your night? 
TOM Pretty standard. 
Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of silence. 
EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER 
Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's distant. But only if we're really looking. 
INT. APARTMENT - LATER 
Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room. 
LATER. He hangs some new pictures. 
LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf. Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something. 
INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER 
That day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper. Summer reads a novel. 
TOM It's playing at 5. 
SUMMER You want to go? 
TOM I don't know. You wanna maybe go back to your place or --- 
SUMMER I want to see it. Let's go. 
TOM Ok cool. 
SUMMER Unless you don't want to. 
TOM No, I will. That's fine. 
TOM Let's get breakfast. 
SUMMER Now? 
TOM Pancakes? 
Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is history. 
FADE UP: "Number Two" by the Pernice Brothers. Which plays OVER: 
1. INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable. 
LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other. 
2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY 
Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline. 
2. INT LIBRARY - DAY 
Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building design. 
3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY 
Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high-rise. 
4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY 
Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him. 
6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also crossed off. 
5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY 
Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge. 
8. EXT PARK - DAY 
Tom jogs. A little faster this time. 
9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost in thought. 
Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were, he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness. 
9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY 
On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window. Thinking. 
On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is lifted. And she's a bride. 
END MUSIC. 
EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY 
Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took Summer ages ago. 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice. 
SUMMER (V.O.) Hey. 
Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to do. 
SUMMER (re: suit) Where you coming from? 
TOM What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there? 
SUMMER Awhile. 
Tom finds it hard to look at her. 
SUMMER I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here. 
The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty. 
TOM So... I should probably say congratulations.

SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
EXT. TYRE, LEBANON - DAY 
A coast road. Date palms. Burnt-out hulks that once were Russian T-54 TANKS have long ago been left to rust in the sun. A 4-door MERCEDES hurtles down the ancient road. 
DEVEREAUX (V.O.) We're online for exactly two minutes. 
A SATELLITE VIEW 
Of the same scene. A grainy IMAGE of the car, and some distance away, a moving cluster of animals. They are: 
HERD OF SHEEP 
As seen at ground level. Two SHEPHERDS goad them forward. In the distance, the MERCEDES approaches. 
FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK) 
U.S. Army medics and rescue workers frantically sift through the rubble of a collapsed barracks. 
CNN REPORTS (V.O.) "...the single worst casualty in the history of American military --" 
BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD 
The Mercedes barrels down the road, doing at least 80 mph. 
THE SATELLITE VIEW 
Shows that the car is fast approaching the point where the herd of sheep are about to cross the road. 
FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK) 
Amidst the rubble, the dead are zipped into body bags. 
CNN REPORTS (V.O.) "-- the truck, carrying high explosives is believed to have hit the barracks -- 
BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD 
The driver of the Mercedes hits his horn but doesn't slow down. In addition to the driver and a bodyguard, an OLD MAN WITH A HENNAED BEARD, a turban, and sunglasses sits in back. 
THE SATELLITE VIEW 
As the Mercedes closes with the sheep: 
DEVEREAUX (V.O.) Slow down. 
BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD 
As if on command, the Mercedes finally slows as the sheep move lazily across the road. 
FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK) 
President Clinton addresses reporters in the White House. 
PRESIDENT CLINTON "To any lengths, anywhere in the world, to bring these people to justice." 
BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD 
Inside the Mercedes, they watch as the Shepherd urinates and the sheep mill about in the middle of the road. The driver rolls down his window to scream in Arabic at: 
THE POOR SHEPHERD 
Who hurries to button his fly. It is only as we look closer that we see the silenced muzzle of: 
COLT COMMANDO RIFLE 
Protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then: 
THE HERD OF SHEEP 
Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as they clear frame, we can see that: 
THE MERCEDES 
Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance: 
WITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY 
One Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to the Sheik's harness. 
AN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT 
HUB Go, Floyd. 
As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face. 
CUT TO: 
AN ORDINARY HOUSE 
In an ordinary neighborhood. Hub sits in an UNMARKED CAR. Agent Rose climbs into the front seat. 
AGENT ROSE I've got two in the Plymouth, at least three inside, and see that guy walking his dog...? He did his business about an hour ago and they're still walking. 
IN ANOTHER CAR -- 
DANNY I had a dog like that once. 
FRANK It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're spies. 
DANNY The dog works for the CIA? 
Their radio CRACKLES to life. It's Hub. 
HUB (V.O.) (over the radio) All units report in turn. 
We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock." 
HUB Let's roll. 
THE MAN WALKING THE DOG 
Is suddenly double-teamed by TWO AGENTS. 
AGENT - MIKE Federal Agents. Hands behind your back -- 
A third AGENT throws his jacket over the dog. 
TWO UNMARKED CARS 
Fishtail across the quiet street, boxing in the Plymouth as an AGENT from the sidewalk thrusts a 12-gauge Remington Pump in through the driver's window. 
AGENT - FRED -- Keep 'em where we can see 'em, thank you very much. 
THE DOOR TO THE HOUSE 
Is BLOWN-IN by a specially-designed SHOTGUN. Two MEN, eating take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn. 
FRANK Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill. 
Hub continues warily from one empty room to the next. A stairway leads downstairs. As Hub starts cautiously down, muted VOICES can be heard. Reaching the bottom, he sees: 
KHALIL 
Sitting in a chair. Behind him stands one of FREELANCERS from the warehouse. And opposite him, in a barca-lounger: 
ELISE KRAFT -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished basement is a palpable feeling of menace. 
As Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock .9 at his head. Hub just stares him down. 
ELISE Ralph, spare us. 
The freelancer lowers the gun. Hub looks at Khalil, whose face is badly bruised. 
ELISE I never touched him. 
HUB Really? I'm taking him into custody just the same. 
ELISE What are you going to charge him with? Jaywalking? (Hub stares at her) I don't suppose we could just have a little chat with him here first? 
HUB Not in this lifetime. 
ELISE You know, Hub... may I call you Hub? If you guys hadn't blown the surveillance, we'd have been able to follow the money. What do you think, Khalil, you would have led us right to your friends, wouldn't you? 
Khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her. 
HUB What friends --? What have you got for me, Elise?... Enlighten me. (she stonewalls) Tell me now or tell me downtown. 
Still nothing. Hub calls out to his agents. 
HUB Get this guy out of here and book him. 
As the other agents approach Khalil: 
ELISE One phone call and he's mine again. You know the number. I have -- 
HUB You have "the right to remain silent," you have "the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law -- 
ELISE (overlapping him) Oh, come on... Do you have any idea what you're starting here, the kind of shitstorm you're about to -- 
HUB (overiding her) -- Kidnapping. Obstruction of Justice. Assault. 
As he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent. 
HUB Cuff her. 
Has been hastily improvised behind a SWAT van. 
FRANK The driver's name is Larry Kaiser. He says they've got explosives strapped to their chests, they got automatic weapons, and they're speaking Arabic. 
HUB Where the hell's the negotiator? 
FRANK Tunnel's got twenty minute delays and they're working on both bridges. 
HUB (to the cop) What else did he say about the device? Did he describe it at all? Anything about a button, or a cord, or... 
THE FIRST ENG TRUCK 
Pulls up and raises its satellite dish. 
ELISE (almost involuntary) Oh, God. 
Frank turns to look at her. She is suddenly pale. 
ELISE (as it dawns on her) ...They're not here to negotiate. 
FRANK Meaning? 
ELISE They were waiting for the cameras. 
Hub is deep in conversation with the cops. Frank interrupts. 
FRANK -- Hub... 
Hub looks up. Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she said. 
ELISE They're want the newsies here. They want everybody watching. 
Hub and Frank look at each other. Can this be true? 
ELISE You've got the shooters in place? 
FRANK -- So? 
ELISE Use 'em. 
HUB What? 
ELISE Kill 'em now. 
They just look at her. 
ELISE It's lose-lose any way you play it... Do you want to lose little or lose big? 
The NYPD officer has been listening: 
NYPD OFFICER I got the marksmen on the com -- They're looking for a clean shot. 
As the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two more NEWS VANS pull up. The MEDIA CIRCUS has come to town: reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene reports. Hub and Elise stare at one another. 
NYPD OFFICER Shooter says they've got the passengers all standing in the aisles. He says, no go. 
Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes. As the seconds tick away, TWO NEWS HELICOPTER jockey for position above. 
HUB (to the cops) We have rules of engagement we're gonna follow here, folks, so put the safeties back on your weapons. (looks at Elise) Nobody's killing anybody until we see what's what. 
He grabs the phone. 
HUB (on the phone) Larry, this is Agent Hubbard of the FBI, I'll be negotiating our way out of this. Let me talk to one of them... I know... I know. You just hang in there, Larry... No, don't worry, I've got somebody here who can translate. 
He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell. 
HUB (on the phone) Sir, -- My name is Anthony Hubbard. I don't have any authority to make deals, or respond to demands. I just want to find out if you need anything in there? If any of the passengers are in need of medical attention? 
He waits as Frank translates. Hub covers the mouthpiece. 
HUB -- Frank? 
FRANK I don't know if they understand. 
HUB (on the phone) Sir, is there anything you want to say to me? That I can tell my people here? 
FRANK The guy's just breathing into the phone, maybe they're not even Arabs. 
HUB (on the phone) I get the feeling you don't want to talk, but will you listen --? ...Whatever grievance you have, whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn't involve these children -- 
Still no response. 
HUB (on the phone) So I'm gonna ask you to... please... let... the... children go. 
No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN 
And six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before the doors HISS closed behind them. As Hub and a couple of the cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAUSE breaks out among the cops. Elise tries to hold back tears. 
FRANK Okay, here we go... 
HUB (on the phone) Thank you, sir. I appreciate that gesture, I really do. The best way to get what you want in these situations is to show yourself to be reasonable. As you've just done. (Haddad translates) Now we've got some more to talk about... 
Elise watches as the news cameras zoom in. 
TINA You don't smoke. 
Hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into: 
THE CELL 
Frank hangs back in the doorway. Hub pulls up a chair, turns it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil. 
HUB Ten thousand dollars. 
Frank translates. Khalil pretends not to understand. 
HUB Khalil. I want to talk about the money. 
Again Frank translates. And again, Khalil looks blank. 
HUB Okay... 
Hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack of cigarettes. Khalil's eyes widen. Hub smiles at him. At the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on Khalil's forehead. Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette -- drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. Khalil unconsciously RECOILS in his chair. 
HUB (to Frank, re: Khalil) Doesn't like second hand smoke. 
Hub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his cigarette. Khalil almost jumps out of his skin. 
HUB You ready to talk about money? 
Frank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins SPEED-RAPPING in Arabic. 
FRANK (translating) ...He says he loves America and only wanted to get away from the security services at home. 
Tears stream down Khalil's face. He kneels at Hub's feet. 
FRANK (still translating) ...He says he's sorry but he didn't know he was doing something bad. His cousin introduced him to a man who promised him two hundred dollars for his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase to an address in Brooklyn. (to Hub) He's a cut-out. 
OUTSIDE THE ROOM -- LATER 
Hub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes. 
HUB Nasty habit. (to Danny) 3830 Flatbush Avenue. 
FLASH CUT -- A SWAT TEAM 
Bursts into an empty apartment. On the floor, a fax machine continuously sending the message: "RELEASE HIM." 
BACK TO -- HUB 
HUB We want every rental agreement from every landlord in Brooklyn. Hotels, motels, flophouses... (to the other agents) It's cash, guys. They're the only ones in America using cash. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
The room is dark. A TECHNICIAN operates an overhead PROJECTOR. 
TECHNICIAN This is a spectograph of the semtex used in the bomb. Look at the benzene spike. This is the genuine article. (another slide) Now... this one's from the barracks in Dhahran. As you can see, the signature is identical. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
A COMPUTER TECHIE (WHITNEY) is cross-referencing data. DIGITAL PICTURES of suspected terrorists scroll past. A surveillance PHOTO of Ahmed bin Talal. The ruined army barracks. 
HUB -- ask it if they've ever hit buses? 
The techie types in a few commands: IMAGES of destroyed BUSES file past. Tel Aviv. Jerusalem. Beirut. None a match. 
WHITNEY -- not according to the mainframe. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
The BOMB SCENE now resembles an archeological dig. Floodlights on stanchions. Forensic EXPERTS, on their hands and knees, use BLACK LIGHT and brushes to search for latent prints. Different color STRING divides the site into a grid. 
HUB -- with a Q-tip. Bone shards, hair, fingernails -- 
Nearby, Danny and Mike observe Hub's intensity. 
DANNY -- He's way over his head. 
FRANK Shut the fuck up and go give somebody a parking ticket. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
In THE LAB. A FINGERPRINT EXPERT sifts through a plastic bag of fingertips and teeth. Scans each into a computer. 
FINGERPRINT EXPERT Not yet. 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
Hub is STARING AT THE TV SETS which are all REPLAYING the terrible incident, over and over again. 
TV SOUND BITE "-- Today; Tel Aviv has come to Brooklyn. The question... is why." 
Finally, he turns away so no one will see. His eyes are hot with the emotion. 
WHITNEY You okay? 
HUB You hungry? 
ELISE We ordering in --? 
CUT TO: 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
IN A DOWNTOWN DELI 
Hub and Elise sit, eating corned beef sandwiches. 
ELISE -- The funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self- purification. First a fast, then -- 
HUB -- the washing of the body, then the shroud. I saw it on Sixty Minutes. Tell me something I don't know. 
She pauses, always gauging how much to reveal. And when. 
ELISE ...Last March in Iraq, we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year. In August, he went to Lebanon. Where he was... extracted. 
HUB Extracted? Extracted by whom? (she just looks at him) I see. 
ELISE His name is Sheik Ahmed bin Talal. He's Iraqi. And something of a religious leader. 
HUB With something of a devoted following? (she nods) ...Okay, I can understand why we might not want to publicize the fact that our government's in the kidnapping business, but why not tell us? 
ELISE He's still being... debriefed. They're not ready to go public with charges. 
HUB What else you got on his followers. 
ELISE Clearly, they're committed. 
HUB Meaning? 
ELISE In this game, the most committed wins. 
HUB So they'll just keep coming until we release him. 
ELISE Unless we match their commitment with our own. 
HUB What about talking to this sheik? 
ELISE You don't think they've got guys talking to the sheik? Except the sheik isn't talking. 
HUB So who's giving the orders? How do they coordinate, pick their targets? 
ELISE Believe me, we've put every resource we've got onto that very question. (puts down her fork) Otherwise... we wait. 
HUB We wait. 
She looks at him. For one brief moment the mask drops away. 
ELISE If there's anybody on earth who knows how you feel, it's me. But you've got to let it go. Those people were dead the minute they got on the bus. 
Frank Haddad appears, making his way toward their table. 
FRANK Sorry, boss. Hello, Elise. Mmmm, is that pastrami? (tastes it; then with his mouth full) Oh, yeah, we made the guy in the picture. 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
CUT TO: 
A CAFE 
Where Students sit inside and SMOKE, then SMOKE some more. 
FRANK (V.O.) My people. The last of the unambivalent smokers. (shakes his head) Monsters. The toughest motherfucker in Bed-Stuy is a muffin compared to some of these guys. 
They watch as SAMIR gets his bill from the waiter. 
FRANK His name's Samir Nazhde. Teaches Arab Studies at Brooklyn College. He sponsored Ail Waziri's student visa. And dig this -- his brother blew up a movie theatre in Tel Aviv. 
ELISE You might consider leaving him alone. 
HUB Why would I consider doing that --? 
In the cafe, Samir counts cash to leave on the table. 
ELISE Play him like a cop and haul him in now and get your arrest, or tag him and let him lead you to the really big fish. 
FRANK (an arabic curse) You're fishing and he's getting visas for bombers. 
ELISE You ever heard of catch and release? 
FRANK Yes, and he's on the next plane for Tunis. 
Hub looks at Elise. Samir is leaving -- it's now or never. 
HUB Take him down. 
FRANK (keys his radio) Go. 
THREE AGENTS brace Samir politely but firmly, and lead him to their car. Samir slides into the back seat next to Elise. In the REARVIEW MIRROR, Hub watches as a look seems to pass between them. Then again, it may not have happened. 
HUB Daily reports. We tap his phone. 
ELISE And I get to see the transcripts. 
HUB Fair enough. 
ELISE And I run him. 
HUB We share him. 
ELISE He can't know we're talking. 
HUB Then don't tell him. 
ELISE Done. 
HUB (to Frank) Let him fly. (back to her) But we better start seeing product. 
She nods. A deal. For now. 
HUB Any more surprises for me? 
ELISE Not tonight. 
HUB Then I'm going home to get some things. 
FRANK I'll have somebody drive you. 
HUB I'll grab a cab. 
And he's gone. Frank turns to Elise: 
FRANK Elise. I'm really high strung, too. 
She just smiles and walks away. 
OUTSIDE THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER 
Not many people around. Hub stands on the corner. A TAXI cruises up. On duty. Available. He slows long enough to see that Hub is black and passes right by. 
AT A RED LIGHT 
The taxi driver stops just long enough for Hub to slam his SHIELD on the windshield. 
IN THE TAXI 
Hub sits in back, hurtling into the night. The driver's ID identifies him as ABDUL HASSAM. Hub shakes his head. 
IN THE SHOWER 
As the hot SPRAY hits him, he runs his hands through his hair and feels the BITS OF SHATTERED GLASS. Dried blood runs off in rivulets from his hands. Not his own. He leans against the shower wall, closes his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
ELISE -- BRUTALLY SLAPPED ACROSS THE FACE 
We are in her apartment. Samir looms over her. 
SAMIR You let him HIT ME --!! You cannot care about me and let such things happen! 
ELISE Next time don't be such a smart ass -- 
SAMIR Sometimes I hate you just because you are so American. It makes me want to hurt you. I think about fucking you and hurting you. 
Elise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the price she's come to accept. In a heartbeat, it's all business. 
ELISE -- You want to fuck me? Then work with me. 
SAMIR Don't tell me what I have to do. 
ELISE No? Do we really want to have this conversation again? Do we --? 
Something quietly ominous in her tone. He lowers his eyes. And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack. Strokes his arm. 
ELISE I need you to help me. I need you to be strong. As you have always been strong. For both of us. -- Samir? Look at me... 
BACK TO HUB -- WHO AWAKENS IN THE DARKNESS 
He's fallen asleep in a chair. In his lap is a pile of visa applications. His BEEPER goes off. He rouses himself. 
BACK TO ELISE -- ROUGHLY TURNED OVER IN BED BY SAMIR 
Sex without any shred of tenderness. As Samir kisses the back of her neck, we SEE in her eyes the thousand-yard stare. 
BACK TO HUB -- ON THE STREET 
In the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a styrofoam cup of coffee. It's a ritual between them. 
BACK TO ELISE -- LYING IN BED AS SAMIR SMOKES 
SAMIR -- Some people just cannot live in the camps. For my brother, it was already like dying. The only thing he lives for is movies. 
He sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette. 
DEVEREAUX Sounds like I should get out of your way. We're there if you need us. (at the door; to Elise) Your father well, Elise? 
ELISE As can be expected. How's Maggie? 
DEVEREAUX Top of her game. (heads out) Well, go get 'em. 
And he's gone. Elise turns to Hub. 
ELISE Making new friends. 
HUB How's your lip --? 
She looks at Hub -- and now she knows that he knows. She brazens it out: 
ELISE So... you like to watch --? 
HUB No. Just learning about commitment. 
ELISE It's a full contact sport. 
CUT TO: 
JUDGE'S CHAMBERS -- DOWNTOWN 
Judge Frankel, 60, puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands. 
JUDGE FRANKEL -- You're telling me that just because some Brooklyn landlord tips you off that he's been paid in cash, you have the right to call in the cavalry -- ! Hub, as far as I know, paying cash is not yet a crime in this country. 
HUB You're not hearing me. This Khalil was carrying cash for -- 
JUDGE FRANKEL -- You've observed him giving cash to -- 
HUB ... No, but -- 
JUDGE FRANKEL -- But you have hard evidence linking this apartment to the people that blew up bus 87 --? 
Elise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials. 
HUB I know we'll turn up trace elements of semtex, chemicals... something. 
JUDGE FRANKEL And when you do, you'll get your warrant. 
HUB What about as a feasibility study? 
JUDGE FRANKEL Meaning? 
HUB We enter first, take a look, then fill out the warrant. 
JUDGE FRANKEL Tell me the difference between that and breaking-and-entering? 
HUB We're the good guys. 
JUDGE FRANKEL Not good enough. 
HUB What is good enough, Judge? Another bus? A school, maybe. These things come in waves. 
JUDGE FRANKEL Waves mean nothing to me; there's been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years, but if you came to me with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure I'd send you packing. There's a price to be paid for living in a free society -- 
HUB -- and not in cash I guarantee it. 
Hub catches Elise's eye -- "we're out of here." 
THE STAIRCASE OF A TENEMENT 
Elise and Hub climb seemingly endless FLIGHTS OF STAIRS. 
ELISE -- Not two Judges from now, not two HOURS from now, not two MINUTES from now. These guys could split any SECOND and you've lost your best shot at -- 
HUB Frank's working another warrant -- 
ELISE You don't understand, they're pros! From the age of twelve they've been dodging people like you, people better than you. 
HUB You mean people like you? 
ELISE -- no matter how sparkling your record is, no matter how terrified you are to fail -- 
Finally he stops, turns on her: 
HUB It's... against... the... law. 
ELISE -- Just because you went to night school, or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn't make you Sir Thomas More. 
HUB Just because you talk the talk doesn't make you an expert. And just because you read my file doesn't make you an expert on me. 
ELISE You're gonna lose them and they're gonna do another horrible -- 
HUB -- You think I want to lose them. Where do you get off talking that shit. (controls himself...) If I don't take 'em down properly they'll be on the street two hours from now. I could find dynamite, semtex, plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless I've got the right warrant it's all inadmissible 
ELISE They've also got a warrant. A warrant from God. They're ready to die! And your quaint laws don't mean shit to these people. 
HUB My quaint laws? Last I checked you were an American citizen. And these happen to be the only laws we got. (turns on her) Look, I'm just a cop, okay, and I'm real sorry the cold war's over, and you Masters of the Universe got nothing going on over there in Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever -- but you're just not in the Middle East anymore... 
ELISE Oh, really...? 
CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.) Sounds great, General, except why can't we find out who's behind it -- 
IN THE ROTUNDA LIBRARY 
A strategy session chaired by General Devereaux. Sleeves rolled up, silver coffee service. Staff members abound. 
FBI DIRECTOR These sects are organized so you need a kill to your credit to get inside. It makes undercover operations impossible. What that leaves us is... we're working on it. 
SENATOR WRIGHT How about who's behind who's behind this? 
CIA DIRECTOR Libya. Iraq. Iran. Possibly Syria. 
CHIEF OF STAFF Ask a question. Get an atlas. 
SENATOR WRIGHT All I know is that we must respond. 
CHIEF OF STAFF Respond, sure. But how? 
SENATOR WRIGHT Find out who it is and bomb the shit out of them. 
CHIEF OF STAFF And if we can't find out --? 
The question hangs in the air. 
CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL Look it keeps escalating. First a bus, then the theatre. What's next? 
SENATOR WRIGHT Anything but leadership. 
DEVEREAUX With all respect, Senator, why don't we just stipulate that the President is a dumb son of a bitch so we can all get down to business. 
An icebreaker. Everyone laughs. 
CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.) What about sending in the Guard? 
ATTORNEY GENERAL (V.O.) The National Guard are trained for riot control not counter-terrorism. 
SENATOR WRIGHT The Army then. I've seen the contingency plans. 
ATTORNEY GENERAL It's settled legal doctrine, posse comitatus, that the Army not be turned against our own people. 
SENATOR WRIGHT Even if that's what our own people are asking for, three to one? 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE If the President is willing to declare a State of Emergency -- 
SENATOR WRIGHT President Lincoln declared martial law in 1862. He suspended -- 
ATTORNEY GENERAL -- which the Supreme Court later found un-constitutional. Ex parte Milligan. 
CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL And I've got an election in November. Ex-United States Congressman. 
CHIEF OF STAFF Guys, guys, the President lost a lot of friends last night -- 
CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL Not to mention six points in the polls. 
CHIEF OF STAFF -- And his plane lands in two hours. We owe it to him to have a consensus. 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE You don't fight a junkyard dog with ASPCA rules. What you do is take the leash off your own, bigger, meaner dog. 
CHIEF OF STAFF ...General? 
DEVEREAUX The Army is a broadsword not a scalpel. You do not want us in an American city. 
CHIEF OF STAFF But hypothetically... how long would it take you to -- 
DEVEREAUX We only go if the President invokes the War Powers Act. 
CHIEF OF STAFF I understand that, General. Let us imagine, though, for a moment, that the order has been given. 
CLOSE on Devereaux. As he weighs his remarks, we FLASHCUT, almost imperceptibly to: 
AN ANONYMOUS ROOM 
As WATER is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized manner. O.S. we HEAR the SOUND of chanting. 
BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM -- SAME TIME 
DEVEREAUX ...Twelve hours after the President gives the word we can be on the ground. One light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men. Elements of the Rapid Deployment Force combined with Special Forces -- Delta. APC's, tanks, helicopters. And of course, the ubiquitous M-16A1 assault rifle, a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or Seven- Eleven. It will be noisy, it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a VFW parade. 
BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS ROOM 
Where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. We watch in SLOW-MOTION as it drifts down a shoulder. 
BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM 
DEVEREAUX That means civilian casualties. At a minimum it's a drunk private joyriding in a Hummer who runs down an old lady in Greenpoint. At a maximum... (sighs) Make no mistake. We will hunt the enemy. We will find the enemy. And we will kill the enemy. 
BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS HANDS 
Turning the key in an ignition. An engine rumbles to life. 
BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM 
DEVEREAUX (looks at them) And no card-carrying member of the ACLU is more deadset against it... than I am. Which is why I urge you... no, I implore you not to consider this option. 
A JEEP pulls up and Elise/Sharon gets out. 
HUB Sharon. 
Their silence speaks volumes. With Sharon is an OFFICER. 
ELISE This is Colonel Hardwick. Army Intelligence. 
HUB (shaking hands) Anthony Hubbard. Average intelligence. (clocking him) But 'til I hear otherwise this is still my show. 
COL. HARDWICK I'm here as an advisor only. I intend to keep a low profile. 
HUB I appreciate that, Colonel. 
COL. HARDWICK I don't mean to be insensitive, but what, exactly, are your capabilities at this point? Your... infrastructure -- 
HUB You're standing on our infrastructure. Excuse me. 
Hub walks back toward the rubble. Sharon watches him go. 
CUT TO: 
HUB'S APARTMENT -- THAT NIGHT 
Sofas have been pushed against the wall. Hub's apartment now serves as a temporary command post. Agents huddle together -- poring over the charred or soggy remnants of files. 
FLOYD -- They managed to get a partial VIN# off the van. DMV says it was reported stolen the day before in -- 
HUB -- Brooklyn. 
DANNY Fiber thinks they've come up with a piece of the shroud. Egyptian cotton. 
Frank joins them. 
FRANK (grim) We just got a confirmation on Mike. He was with Fred in the lobby. 
HUB How many does that make it --? 
A KNOCK on the door. They look at one another. One of the agents answers it. Elise/Sharon. She walks over to them. 
ELISE I'm... very sorry... about your friends. 
HUB (giving her nothing) Frank. This is Sharon. (to her) -- I didn't catch the last name. 
ELISE ...Bridger. How ya doin' Frank? 
FRANK Been better. 
She nods. Takes from her purse a folder, labeled in Hebrew. 
ELISE The agency has come up with another list of probables. 
She takes out photos. Neither Hub nor Frank react. She puts them on the coffee table. No one reaches for them. 
ELISE I think we should circulate them. (they stonewall her:) Hey, this stuff may be good. 
HUB Why was there no warning from Samir? 
ELISE Because he didn't know anything. 
FRANK Says Samir. 
ELISE Says me. 
HUB Maybe I'll ask him. 
ELISE Over my dead body. 
HUB Over six hundred dead bodies. 
They stare at one another. Both are tired and raw. 
ELISE Look, he's one of the good guys. Okay? 
HUB How the fuck can you be so sure? 
ELISE Because he helped me recruit the network in Iraq. OKAY? 
He just stares at her. 
ELISE We were part of the operation to destabilize Saddam Hussein. Printing up fake dinars, arming the Kurds -- 
HUB -- and financing the Sheik. 
ELISE He's Iraqi. He was going to be our Ayatollah Khomeini -- 
HUB -- And help bring down Saddam. 
ELISE I ran the network. Samir was the go- between. He risked his life for us over there. 
HUB So who are they? Give me names, Give me pictures. Not some history lesson. 
ELISE I can't give you pictures because I don't know what they look like. We did everything at arm's length. 
HUB Did you call the State Department? 
FRANK They told me to call INS. 
HUB -- And? 
FRANK They told me to call State. 
HUB Don't you just love government? 
THE EXPLOSION 
Is only the BUS backfiring. PEDESTRIANS who have thrown themselves to the ground, screaming, now pick themselves up, Laughing. Only Hub and Frank are not laughing.

Angry people, scared people. Hub, being interviewed about the coordinated efforts of law enforcement. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) Already there is talk of a protest march by a coalition of --

Hub and a few others sit on the stage. Two hundred law enforcement officials fill the orchestra seats. 
MAYORAL AA (V.O.) THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY HAVE A RIGHT -- 
DANNY (V.O.) -- THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING --! 
MAYORAL AA -- IS TO MAKE THIS CITY SAFE...! And your department -- 
DANNY My department WHAT, ASSHOLE...? 
Sharon stands at the back, meets Hub's eye, and waves. 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY Guys... GUYS... 
EVERYBODY'S talking at once. In frustration, Hub covers a microphone with his hand. The FEEDBACK silences the room. 
HUB Sorry. From now on, we will raise our hands and wait to be called on -- 
An appreciative chuckle. Hub points to A MAN IN A SUIT. 
INS OFFICIAL Howard Kaplan. INS. So we've pulled every ethnic visa in the city and traced them to source. Who wants em? 
HUB Danny --? 
DANNY We bring 'me in, have a talk. 
UNIFORM COP (V.O.) What about translators --? 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY (V.O.) How many people we talking about here? 
INS OFFICIAL Sixteen hundred, maybe more. 
DANNY Where the hell we gonna put sixteen hundred people? 
Everyone again begins speaking at once. Hub takes control. 
MAN IN SUIT What about a military presence at JFK and LaGuardia --? 
HUB I don't think we're there yet. It's also not going to stop these people. 
MAYORAL AA What about protecting the Arab population? There's a lot of anger -- 
ARAB SPOKESMAN (V.O.) I represent the American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Committee. Whatever injustices my people may be suffering at this difficult moment, we will continue to show our patriotism and our commitment to this country. 
HUB Thank you, sir. And to everyone else for their patience today. These are extremely difficult times -- London, Paris, we're not the first city to have to deal with this. 
He pauses a moment, searching for the words. 
HUB In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew up the market, the market was full. (looks out at them) This is New York. We can take it. 
And then two hundred BEEPERS all go off at once. Everyone looks at one another. Dear God, what now... 
A GRAINY BLACK & WHITE VIDEO IMAGE 
Kids, huddled in a corner, crying. A dead mom. The legs of what we imagine is the terrorist. We are in: 
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
Hub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast- barricade of desks and tables. Sharon kneels beside them. 
DANNY -- one of the moms was carrying a piece, wounds the guy as he's planting the device. He kills her and locks them all in. (points at video) Up there in the corner... by the clock. 
ELISE I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel like... being alone... tonight. 
HUB Where's Samir? 
ELISE I could call him. Maybe he'd join us. 
HUB You'd like that. 
ELISE I might. Or I could call Tina. 
HUB 
They stare at each other. 
ELISE Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but I did what I had to do. (looks at him) You know as well as I do, running an agent can be very... complicated. 
HUB How about running an FBI agent? 
ELISE You think I'm trying to run you? 
HUB (looks at her) ...Why else are you here? 
ELISE (staring right back) ...You know why I'm here. 
It's a charged moment. They're two sad and lonely people. 
ELISE Tell me to leave. 
HUB Leave. 
ELISE No. 
When they embrace, their ferocity and desperation is something more than comfort and less than love.

CUT TO: 
THE CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT 
The Chief of Staff is working late in a cardigan sweater. Devereaux, in his impeccable suit, stands opposite him. Even at ease he is smartly erect. 
CHIEF OF STAFF The FBI received another fax. 
DEVEREAUX Ahmed Bin Talal. They're still under the impression that we have him. 
CHIEF OF STAFF Do we? Have him? 
DEVEREAUX To refresh your memory, as I told you last time, it was the Libyans who -- 
CHIEF OF STAFF I remember perfectly well what you said last time. (looks at him) Do we? 
Devereaux frosts him with a look. 
DEVEREAUX Let me give you some free advice, son. Don't get between me and the President. You might break a nail. 
CHIEF OF STAFF I am speaking for the President. 
He and Devereaux look at each other. It is the moment of plausible deniability. 
DEVEREAUX As far as the President is concerned... No, we do not. 
The Chief of Staff accepts the answer because it serves him, for now. And because he has a more pressing agenda. 
CHIEF OF STAFF General, do you know that after yesterday's attack, half the parents in this country kept their children out of school --? (Devereaux nods) ...They're attacking our way of life. It's got to stop. And the President cannot afford to be weak. 
DEVEREAUX (reading the subtext) Are you saying the President is prepared to take the necessary steps...? 
CHIEF OF STAFF I'm saying, the President is prepared to be... Presidential. 
CUT TO: 
HUB'S APARTMENT - DAWN 
A ringing phone. Hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets. He looks around and realizes he is alone. Did last night even happen? 
HUB (on the phone) Hubbard... What --? ...Slow down, slow down -- 
He reaches for the remote control, turns on the TV. 
CUT TO: 
A GRINDING OF TREADS ON ASPHALT -- DAWN 
as THE FIRST APC enters Brooklyn. Followed by another. And another. And in a sound bite: General Devereaux, IN FATIGUES FOR THE FIRST TIME, and looking like grim death. 
DEVEREAUX Today, with the invocation of the War Powers Act by the President, I am declaring a state of martial law in this city. 
THE BATTLE OF BROOKLYN HAS BEGUN 
Road blocks set up at select intersections. Random stop-and- frisk. Patrols of young soldiers in the streets. GANG KIDS, same age, same color, eye them warily. 
DEVEREAUX To the best of our knowledge, we are opposed by no more than twenty of the enemy. He is hiding among a population of roughly two million. 
A FAT JOINT from an ashtray and hurries into the bathroom. 
HUB (to Sharon) Does he understand the difference between the FBI and the DEA? 
ELISE Samir... It's fine, he's cool. 
OUTSIDE, the sound of gunfire. Samir reappears, wild-eyed. 
SAMIR Listen to that --! Are you listening? They're killing Arabs out there! 
HUB You can stop it all right now. 
SAMIR What are you talking about --? The army is here. They're setting up interrogation centers right now. They're torturing people in cellars. 
HUB Let's just calm down for a second... 
SAMIR -- I've got to get out of here. You have to help me -- 
He goes over and peers out the drawn curtains. 
HUB (gentling a horse) We'll take care of you... don't worry. You just have to calm down -- 
SAMIR Money... I must have more money... 
HUB -- You got a student visa for Ali Waziri. Because... somebody asked you to -- Didn't they --? 
SAMIR I... got it myself. 
Sharon CRACKS him across the face. 
ELISE Liar --! 
Now it's Samir's turn to taste the blood in his mouth. 
ELISE You... tell him... what he wants to know. 
HUB (to Sharon) Hey, that's enough. 
ELISE He knows. He fucking knows. 
SAMIR She's crazy. They're ghosts. Jinn. They'd never trust someone like me. 
ELISE Stop simpering. 
SAMIR Please... 
ELISE I've got a picture of the two of us, do you remember that picture, Samir? (the mask coming off:) I'm going to post that picture in every mosque in Brooklyn. And then I'm gonna send copies to some friends of mine on the West Bank. You've got family there, don't you --? 
Hub jumps up, takes Sharon by the arm. 
ELISE Let go of me -- 
He gives her the BUM'S RUSH out of the apartment, shuts the door, then turns back to Samir, who sits, ashen-faced. 
HUB Now... Nobody's going to burn you, nobody's going to call anybody -- (sits beside him) -- Who asked you to get that visa? 
Samir is trembling. Tears roll down his cheeks. 
HUB Don't be afraid. I can protect you. There's nothing to be afraid of. 
SAMIR I'm afraid of going to hell. 
Hub just sits there. He knows he's got him. Finally: 
SAMIR His name is Tariq Husseini. He runs an auto shop. (Hub waits for more --) ...on Commerce Street in Red Hook. 
HUB (hands him a card) My beeper number. Anybody messes with you, I'm there in twenty minutes. 
He gets up and walks into: 
THE HALLWAY 
Where Sharon waits. As they head for the stairs we HEAR: 
ELISE (V.O.) You're good. 
HUB (V.O.) You're not so bad yourself. 
But we are HEARING IT along with: 
COL. HARDWICK 
In a nearby SURVEILLANCE VEHICLE -- where, through the newest microwave technology (the kind the FBI don't yet have), he has OVERHEARD the entire conversation. 
ON A NOTEPAD 
In his lap, the name, "Tariq Husseini." 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE SAMIR'S APARTMENT 
They are in a housing project. Hub dials his cell phone. 
HUB Damn. Do you think you could give him a message? 
TARIQ Of course. 
HUB Tell him the FBI is after him. 
TARIQ You're joking. 
HUB Very... slowly... put your hands on top of the table. 
Tariq notices that Hub's hands are out of sight beneath the table. Hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an audible CLICK. Tariq mutters a CURSE in Arabic. 
HUB That wouldn't be a racist epithet, now would it? Stand up. 
As Tariq stands, Hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs, pats him down, and cuffs him. 
MEANWHILE -- IN THE WAREHOUSE 
The two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun-wielding FBI agents and are now ROUSTING the garage workers. 
HUB Where are the others? 
TARIQ What others? 
But before Hub can answer, an AMPLIFIED VOICE is heard. 
PSY-OPS (V.O.) Tariq Husseini, this is the United States Army. You are surrounded. 
Hub is as surprised as Tariq. 
PSY-OPS You have thirty seconds to throw out any weapons and exit the premises with your hands on top of your head. 
One of the agents with the shotgun calls out. 
SHOTGUN AGENT -- Sir? 
HUB Do as he says. 
As Hub hustles Tariq to his feet, the other agents start to hustle the workers out of door, when: 
THE YOUNG MECHANIC 
Reaches into his overalls. 
SHOTGUN AGENT FREEZE--! 
But when the Mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls, all he is holding is the pin to a GRENADE. 
THE EXPLOSION 
Kills both the FBI agents and their prisoners. Hub throws Tariq to the ground. 
FROM AN UPPER WINDOW 
An AUTOMATIC WEAPON opens fire on the Army presence. 
HIGH ABOVE -- IN A CHOPPER 
Devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity. 
DEVEREAUX Code blue. 
His order unleashes an overwhelming display of FIREPOWER. 
INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE 
Hub and Tariq crawl for cover as windows EXPLODE, walls are SHREDDED, and incendiary TRACER rounds mix with solvents and gasoline to start a conflagration. With the vaguely hallucinatory quality of the S.L.A. shootout, WHITE NOISE bleeds in and ALL SOUND FADES OUT: 
AN M-60 TANK (SILENT) 
Races in from around the corner, only to be hit by A ROCKET- PROPELLED GRENADE fired through the second floor window. 
INT. CHOPPER 
DEVEREAUX Code Red. 
TWO APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS (SILENT) 
Appear from their hiding place behind a nearby building. As they dive into their attack trajectory -- 
HUB (SILENT) 
Crawls, dragging Tariq toward the doors as: 
THE CHAIN GUN (SILENT) 
Of the Attack helicopter fires 2,000 rounds a minute -- virtually UNZIPPING the warehouse -- softening it for THE TWO HYDRA ROCKETS that reduce it instantly to a huge FIREBALL. 
IN THE CHOPPER -- DEVEREAUX 
Watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment. 
INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE -- TWO SHADOWY FIGURES 
HUB I want to see him. 
Devereaux just looks at him as we CUT TO: 
THE TILED SHOWER ROOM 
Tariq is strapped, NAKED, into a folding metal chair. His head lolls on his chest, his eyes are dulled. On a nearby table, an empty syringe. Two MP'S stand guard. 
Sharon is speaking softly to him in Arabic. Suddenly, Tarak SPITS in her face. She wipes it off as if it is nothing. 
DEVEREAUX How long have you been at it? 
ELISE Not long enough, apparently. 
DEVEREAUX How much longer, do you think, before he gives up the other cells -- 
HUB He can't give up the other cells if he doesn't know about them. 
DEVEREAUX He knows. 
HUB (gestures to Sharon) What about her briefing? The strategy session -- she said the cells don't know about each other, that they -- 
Devereaux ignores him. Turns to Sharon. 
DEVEREAUX How long before he breaks? 
ELISE At this rate. Too long. The theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell. 
DEVEREAUX So -- what other models do we have -- 
No one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain. 
DEVEREAUX Shaking. 
Nobody answers. 
DEVEREAUX What about it, Sharon? 
ELISE -- Won't work. 
DEVEREAUX Works for the Israelis. 
ELISE Only in conjunction with sleep deprivation. Needs at least thirty- six hours. 
Hub stares at Sharon -- as the dark side of her professional life is revealed. 
DEVEREAUX We don't have thirty-six hours. 
Another silence. They're teetering on the edge of the abyss. 
DEVEREAUX Electric shock? 
ELISE The neurotransmitters just shut down. 
DEVEREAUX Water? 
COL. HARDWICK Palestinian authority is producing good intel using water. 
Hub finally can't take another second. Even in theory. 
HUB Are you people insane --? 
DEVEREAUX The time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundreds 
HUB How about two men? How about three? How about public executions, that might work. 
DEVEREAUX You're welcome to wait outside. 
HUB General... you've lost men, I've lost men... but what you're doing... It doesn't work in Belfast. It doesn't work in Gaza. And it won't work here. (it comes slowly at first, then in a rush:) -- What if... they don't want their leader back at all? You said yourself, we don't even have him. Maybe what they really want -- is that we herd our children into stadiums. Put soldiers into our streets. Radicalize people who want to think of themselves as Americans. Bend the law, shred the constitution. (searches for the kind of words that come so hard to him:) Because if we torture him -- and let's call it what it is... You... and I... then the country men like us have sworn to defend. And bled to defend. And died to defend... is gone. (a deep breath) And they've won. 
Gen. Devereaux stares hard at Hub. And then: 
DEVEREAUX (to Col. Hardwick) I think we have to soundproof the room before we begin. 
Hub looks at Sharon, who looks away. 
DEVEREAUX Escort him out. 
The two MPs lead Hub out of the room. 
DEVEREAUX Let's get this over with. 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
TIME CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- HOURS LATER 
Sharon emerges from the shower room. She is shattered. The blood drained from her face. As if carrying with her all the sin that was committed in the next room. 
FROM INSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM 
The sound of a GUNSHOT. The door opens and Devereaux emerges, in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie. 
She doesn't want to reveal herself this way. Doesn't want to be vulnerable. Doesn't want to cling to him. For a moment He puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful, dangerous predator. 
HUB -- But first, you helped them. 
She senses the hardness in his tone. Looks up at him, and through tears, puts her game face back on. 
ELISE What do you mean --? 
HUB They were being slaughtered. They needed to get out. But they were on the watch list. So you got them visas. You and Samir. 
ELISE I promised we would take care of them. They were working... for us. 
HUB Doing what, exactly? 
ELISE I don't know what you mean. 
HUB You said you trained them. Tradecraft. Subversion. That's what you said, right? (she nods) Only you left something out, didn't you... Didn't you, Sharon? (she can't bring herself to look at him) You taught them how to make bombs. 
The tears are streaming down her face now. Finally, she nods. 
HUB -- And now they're here, doing what you taught 'em. 
The streetlight catches Sharon's face. Her eyes are haunted. 
ELISE And I'm going to have to live with the hell of that for the rest of my life. 
CUT TO: 
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- (TO ESTABLISH) -- NEXT MORNING 
TALK RADIO (V.O.) -- the people of Brooklyn will not be held hostage! This afternoon, join community and religious leaders in a march to protest the mass arrests -- 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
CUT TO: 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
BOROUGH HALL PARK -- LATER THAT DAY 
MARCH ORGANIZER (handing out leaflets) March on city hall. Today. No fear. 
Hub and Frank are standing outside Hub's car, each on opposite sides, blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening within. 
Sharon sits inside with Samir. She uses a SCALPEL to make the slightest INCISION under Samir's arm. The RADIO plays. 
SAMIR Ahhhhhh... 
ELISE In case you decide to go on walkabout. 
Into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic TRANSMITTER. 
ELISE How did you make contact? 
SAMIR He is Afghani. Ahhhh. He got word to my uncle at the bath-house. You never met him. 
ELISE But you're sure he'll show up. 
SAMIR (trembling) Sharon, they are all dead but the last cell and they are crazy with fear. Just tell me the message and I will pass it on. 
ELISE I need to deliver it in person. Believe me, they'll want to hear what I have to say. 
She turns off the radio. 
OUTSIDE THE CAR 
Hub and Frank glance inconspicuously around. 
HUB You watch the game? 
On a piece of paper he has scribbled, "Hit Hardwick. Safe House. 11:00." 
FRANK (nods yes, then:) Kannell was really on. 
Hub then writes. "Bath-house. 12:00." 
FRANK (nods again) Think they'll make the play-offs? 
Hub looks at him. There's been little time for sentiment. 
HUB How's your boy? 
FRANK He's alright. Thanks for getting him out. 
Sharon steps out of the car. In her hands is a device resembling a PORTABLE OSCILLOSCOPE. A green dot appears. 
ELISE That's Samir. 
HUB (looks in at Samir) Green is about right. 
He slips Sharon the scribbled notes. As she looks at them: 
ELISE He's terrified. Then again, so am I. 
THE APARTMENT 
Sharon goes to a closet and takes out some old clothes. She TURNS OFF THE TV. Then: 
ELISE Here. Put this on. We don't want our friends sweating too much while they wait. 
IN THE VAN 
Hardwick speaks into a handset. 
COL. HARDWICK They're getting ready to move. Units 1 and 2, on my signal -- 
SUDDENLY -- THREE UNMARKED FBI CARS 
Seem to materialize out of nowhere -- boxing them in. 
IN THE VAN 
COL. HARDWICK What the -- 
ON THE STREET 
Undercover FEDERAL AGENTS roust Army CID agents. An FBI agent with a deep drawl, spread-eagles one against a building: 
SOUTHERN FBI AGENT Hi, there, I'm new in town. Can you direct me to Carnegie Hall, or should I just go fuck myself -- 
The NYPD under the command of Danny Sussman -- roll up the rest of the sound garden -- examine the parabolic microphones. 
AGENTS WIELDING SHOTGUNS 
Blow off the rear door of the surveillance van. Frank enters and looks around at all the high-tech, microwave technology. 
FRANK Ah, microwave. 
TWO WOMEN 
In chadors, faces VEILED, descend a back staircase. Only as their faces emerge from the shadows and are caught by a dim bulb do we recognize Sharon and Samir. 
Sharon unlocks a metal door to reveal THE HIDDEN COURTYARD of a neighboring building. She and Samir hurry through a back alley and out into an adjacent street. 
BOROUGH HALL (WAS SHOT AS 194) 
Where several APC's suddenly roar up and BLOCK off the square. Devereaux stands nearby, watching as: 
LIEUTENANT #2 (though a bullhorn) This is an unlawful gathering. You must disperse. I repeat -- 
Soldiers in full RIOT GEAR emerge to form a battle line: images of Selma, 1963; Chicago, 1968; Los Angeles, 1993. 
PROTEST SPEAKER Join together! Join hands! 
THE MARCHERS LINK ARMS 
Arab clerics and Hassidic rabbis, Black civic leaders and Hispanic gang members -- all continue to CHANT, "No fear!" 
THE YOUNG SOLDIERS Nervously look at one another as the marchers begin to move. 
LIEUTENANT #2 (through a bullhorn) These soldiers carry live ammunition. This is your final warning. 
"No Fear... No Fear..." Devereaux watches in dread as the marchers close the gap on the battle-line of anxious soldiers is this why he became a soldier? 
A YOUNG GIRL unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier. Looks into his eyes. Smiles. And walks past. Another marcher walks right past a soldier, who does nothing to stop her. Soon, they are all surging past the riot-line. 
DEVEREAUX watches, as something is revealed to him, something about America that, until this moment, he had forgotten. 
IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN 
Frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at Christmas. But something is wrong. Where once there were TWO GHOSTLY IMAGES of Samir and Sharon in the apartment -- now there is NOTHING. 
ON HUB'S OSCILLOSCOPE 
The RADIO-SIGNAL of Samir's transmitter still registers as an unmoving, steadily blinking light. Hub is watching the building. Frank steps out the van, his face pale. 
FRANK We've got a problem. 
HUB AND FRANK 
Pound up the stairs of the building. 
THE DOOR TO THE CLEAN APARTMENT 
Bursts open. Hub comes in low and fast. Frank comes in hard on his heels. 
In the center of the otherwise empty room, the white sheet, SMEARED IN BLOOD, is draped over a chair. 
FRANK What the -- 
Hub stares in dread fascination. 
HUB It's a shroud. 
And he's out the door in a heartbeat. 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
ELISE -- But... that's what you want, isn't it? Why you've done all this -- 
BELT OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVES 
Comes next. Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest. 
SAMIR No. It's not. 
He comes to stand beside her. 
SAMIR I want you to bleed... as we have bled. 
ELISE Samir, the Koran preaches -- 
SAMIR Do not speak to me of the Koran, woman. (fighting his emotion) You take our leader. A holy man. You put him in prison for preaching the word of God. You must learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live. 
ELISE (with rising terror) But it's over, your point's been made, why spill any more blood? Those poor people out there in the street, they're fucking marching for your cause... 
SAMIR Yes. (fastens the last strap on his semtex harness) And they, too, will become its martyrs. 
A VOICE from the top of the stairs: 
HUB (V.O.) Let her go and you'll live. 
Samir looks up, sees Hub aiming his .45. But Sharon is between them, blocking his shot. 
From outside, we HEAR the sound of the marchers' CHANTING, "No Fear...! No Fear...!" Samir HEARS it, too. 
SAMIR Move away from the door. 
ELISE NO --!!! 
HUB Let her go and you'll live -- 
ELISE DON'T --!!!! 
SAMIR (screaming, panicked) GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR --!!! 
HUB SAMIR --! 
SAMIR YOU WANT TO DIE --!! 
They're all SCREAMING at once. Still Samir keeps inching toward the stairs. Hub blocks the way. 
HUB No way you're going out there. 
Samir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs. 
SAMIR MOVE AWAY --! 
Sharon's eyes meet Hubs'. 
ELISE Shoot. 
HUB Shut up. 
ELISE Shoot. 
HUB SHUT UP... 
Samir is edging ever closer. Starting up the stairs. Sharon's eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption. 
ELISE SHOOT ME --!!! 
HUB I... CAN'T --! 
ELISE YOU HAVE TO. (weeping now) You... promised... 
Hub's finger tightens on the trigger. But then slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun. 
ELISE (sobbing) No --!!! 
SAMIR It is God's will. 
His left hand moves imperceptibly toward the RIPCORD of the explosive device. 
HUB If there is a God, he weeps at the crimes we commit in his name. 
HIS FIRST SHOT 
Rips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards. 
HIS SECOND SHOT 
Is to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord. 
THE THIRD SHOT 
Is a killing headshot. Rolling him into the baths. 
CLOUD OF BLOOD 
Blooms in the cleansing water. The funeral shroud billows.

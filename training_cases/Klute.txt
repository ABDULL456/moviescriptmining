Klute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then takes a last turn around the yard itself; props open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the rail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll shut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT again TO -- 
INT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY 
DIRECTOR (O.S.) (hastily) Honey, no, we don't have too many. 
She slaps the cup down, hurls herself forward -- SWISH PAN -- onto a MALE ACTOR, thrusting him down to the floor, her hands at his throat. As we WIDEN TO INCLUDE DIRECTOR AND MORE OF SCENE, and as the Director reads from script, supplying a narrator voice - 
DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Now before it comes to that, let's have a look, et cetera, et cetera -- OK - 
Bree and the Male Actor relax slightly, as - 
ANGLE TO REVEAL ROOM, OTHERS 
We reestablish the scene -- a few pieces of film equipment -- and the congery of other ACTORS and ACTRESSES preparing to read for parts. As the Director approaches, counsels Bree -- all of this quick and consecutive -- 
DIRECTOR (CONT'D) -- Honey you make it look a little real. It should have, you know, that fun to it. (beat) 
BREE Strangle him to death funny? 
DIRECTOR Well we go from this into stomach diagrams. It can't be too -- look let's try it again from - 
-- but then he glances at his watch, and at the others waiting their turn. 
DIRECTOR (CONT'D) No -- just give us the faces at the end, would you? 
Bree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together, beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a moment, as the Director reads again - 
DIRECTOR (CONT'D) (reads) -- And another family saved by Elso tablets. OK -- (brightly) Thank you very much. 
-- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at the same time as he summons from a list in his other hand -- 
DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Pierce -- Danner - 
BREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly as possible. 
EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK: PEDESTRIANS - DAY 
They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the late-afternoon crush. A LONG-LENS shot, the crowd compacted. We see BREE milling along with the rest. She maneuvers to a sidewalk PHONE BOOTH, enters. We see her deposit, dial. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH, BREE - DAY 
She is connected (to her registry). 
BREE Bree Daniel, any messages? (waits -- none) OK, thanks. 
She waits for a moment. Then makes a curious, small gesture of her hand -- deposits another dime, dials again, is answered. 
BREE (CONT'D) Trina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a commercial I thought I might get, that's all. (quickly, more brightly) Well I'd take a quick thirty, hon. Do you have a commuter for me? Wait. 
As she prepares to write it down, we CUT BACK TO - 
EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD: KLUTE - DAY 
Klute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn door. He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door open) starts engine. Again -- one last time -- the look around. Then he pulls the door shut, pulls out. And on this we CUT TO -- 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY 
A GROUP -- middle-aged Couple, Child, Bellman with suitcases -- wait to descend in elevator as BREE gets off. We TRACK with her along corridor to a door. She checks number and knocks. 
REVERSE: THROUGH DOOR TO BREE 
A MAN opens the door. We neither see or hear him clearly -- he is foreground, defocused. His shirt is untucked. Bree cocks her head, greets him cutely. 
BREE Hullo. 
He mumbles some kind of greeting, steps back. She pauses a moment in the door (casing, instantly) -- then quite confident, friendly, provocative all at once -- 
BREE (CONT'D) Ooh, I knew I'd like you. 
-- and CUT TO -- 
BREE 
BREE (through door, curtly) What is it? 
KLUTE (O.S.) Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute -- 
She turns the door handle , parts the door about three inches, looks through at him. He starts to enter. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Can I talk to you? 
-- and the door crunches against its chain-lock. He stops perforce, a bit startled. A pause. A slice of Bree's face looks coldly out at him. He summons a smile. 
BREE What about? 
KLUTE My name's John Klute. 
BREE You said that. 
KLUTE I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann. 
She tightens again. 
BREE Who? 
KLUTE Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters. 
BREE (innocently) Gee. 
KLUTE He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him. 
BREE Why? 
KLUTE You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel. 
BREE Honest? 
KLUTE Will you let me ask you some questions? 
BREE (gumbo-southern) Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun? 
He takes out a folded letter and a wallet and passes them both through to her. Silence. She examines them with care, then appears to soften a little; even smiles slightly. 
BREE (CONT'D) You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator? 
KLUTE Mm. 
BREE And you just want to ask me a few questions? 
KLUTE Mm. 
She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes). Klute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to knock again, decides not to -- turns and descends the stairs. 
BREE 
Bree listens through the door to his departing foot steps. They fade from hearing. She hastens to assemble her properties. 
EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY 
Klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store below. 
INT. BASEMENT STORE - DAY 
It had once been a Boutique that sold happy clothes. There are some psychedelic posters and a few remnants of its former identity. Klute's suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter. The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he enters. He seems out of place and out of scale. A case containing a tape recorder stands on the floor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes, and a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberately resumes his settling in. From the paper bag he sets aside an electric FAN, then lifts out from the shopping bag a cheap tin ALARM CLOCK and begins winding it. 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Bree has shifted position to a window, is looking down at the street. She sees - and we hear - SOUND OF BUS APPROACHING, distantly. She grabs her properties, whips out the door. 
EXT. ON DOOR OF BROWNSTONE - DAY 
Bree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans quickly out in one direction then the other (in case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the sidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB -- makes it, pulls herself aboard -- 
BREE VOICE That's nice; who is this? 
MAN'S VOICE I really love you baby, you know that? 
A CLICK, and the MAN'S VOICE CONTINUING, trailing into helpless sobs -- 
MAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Hello? Hello? Oh my God, hello? 
EXT. STREET: BREE 
Bree comes out from the building (note possible costume change; not necessarily consecutive action), checks off on her list continues on her way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES. Starting with a CLICK and -- 
BREE VOICE Bree Daniel. 
2ND MAN'S VOICE (nicely) Bree -- Frank Hanley, you remember, Fayetterville? 
BREE VOICE Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure. 
2ND MAN'S VOICE Well I'm in town, like to see you. 
BREE VOICE Well Frank that's awful nice but I'm out of action, sort of, you know -- 
We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD, CONTINUING, as -- 
BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE, at corner, unseen by her and apparently in surveillance of her. Then he too turns out of frame, and we CUT TO -- 
INT. PENN STATION - DAY 
CAMERA is looking down at an enormous gift package on a platform. There is a sound of a recorded fanfare and with the pull of a string the package is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL CONVERTIBLE. People applaud and the car starts to revolve. At the wheel of the car sits BREE. We CUT to a shot through the windshield of car -- 
BREE'S POV 
A sea of staring faces revolves around her. We cross fade with SPANGLER VOICE OVER (as if recalling a case record). 
SPANGLER (V.O.) Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty eight, good physical health, no narcotics record, presenting an unusually strong personality some ways, high intelligence, a high bracket call girl. 
EXT. WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA 
SPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper and sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously a man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him. Across from them some prisoners are taking their exercise. Through the metallic netting that surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York City. It only dramatizes more the sense of being caged. 
SPANGLER -- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year. (notes Klute's reaction) Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why? (stabs at record) Why do you want to know all this? 
KLUTE I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it. 
SPANGLER Not unusual. 
KLUTE Did she talk about him to you? 
SPANGLER About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either. 
KLUTE Has she talked with you since prison? 
SPANGLER No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career. 
KLUTE I think she's trying that. 
SPANGLER Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction. 
INT. PENN STATION - DAY 
POV world revolving around BREE through windshield of car. The circular motion slows down and then stops. Cut to BREE getting out of car and walking off platform. She looks a bit shaky. She is stopped by one of the spectators. 
MAN (tapping her) We had a bet on - if you were real or not. I won. 
She looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone booth. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
BREE (on phone) Marta -- 
INT. CHURCH DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT 
MR. FABER Sure dear, yes. 
BREE Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful. 
MR. FABER (intently) Yes? 
BREE And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly -- 
MR. FABER Mm. 
BREE And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been -- 
She hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of the cape. Faintly -- 
BREE (CONT'D) -- May I? It's so -- 
MR. FABER (quickly) Please -- 
She stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on the couch. But she doesn't sit again -- begins to move here and there about the enclosure, her hands wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic restlessness. 
BREE Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you. 
MR. FABER (tensely) Yes? 
BREE And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling -- 
EXT. GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT 
KLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock. He eases door open, moves inside -- 
INT. CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM: BREE - NIGHT 
BREE is farther along in her narrative, more fervent in manner. MR. FABER sits at the edge of his seat, ducking his head now and then in pleasure, but making no move to molest her. 
BREE And next day at the beach -- our beach pavilion -- I saw him again, his eyes burning into me. I was helpless. Without his even speaking to me, without his even touching, I knew that somehow -- somehow -- 
She casts away an accessory garment. Mr. Faber burns her with his eyes -- 
INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT 
KLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs, prowls along the aisles of clothing, looking -- sees -- 
POV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR. FABER 
Klute sees Mr. Faber first -- clearly a senior citizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some private dream. Then BREE drifts into view -- stands -- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles, poses -- drifts out of view again -- 
KLUTE 
Klute watches in that direction a moment longer. In his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience -- but rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure of disgust. Not his affair. He turns away from it, into camera, and -- 
EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
Near the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's apartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts angrily, miserably -- 
BREE Whyn't you just cut out? 
We WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get it. He turns, opens door to his room below. She comes slowly down steps. 
INT. KLUTE'S ROOM - DAY 
She steps in the door, looks slowly around at his various appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over the mirror, etc. -- and then, the TAPE RECORDER and then the STACK OF TAPE BOXES. Softly, venomously -- 
BREE Oh you bastard. 
But then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of fact hooker -- 
BREE (CONT'D) Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it. 
KLUTE No, I'm look -- 
BREE (vehemently again) If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard! 
BREE I can't say he was anybody! 
A brief pause. Klute sorts his notes. She may take it that he's packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow. For an instant we see the undefended girl underneath -- 
BREE (CONT'D) So -- OK -- that's all? 
Then again she changes manner -- remembering a practical problem, approaching it as a matter-of fact hooker. 
BREE (CONT'D) Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and-- 
KLUTE What about everything since? 
She draws back again. Up to now she's been reasonably on top of things. Starting now we see her driven toward the things she'd really rather not talk about -- and increasingly more shaken. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) (prompts) Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the -- 
BREE Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves -- 
KLUTE What about the other things you've reported? -- (consulting notes) -- being followed on the -- 
BREE (interrupts -- awkwardly) Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings. (beat) I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with -- 
The PHONE RINGS. She startles. Then approaches with some difficulty -- but then answers with complete calm in her Smith-girl voice. 
BREE (CONT'D) Bree Daniel. (listens. Brightly) Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted? (listens) Oh, well, thank you very much but maybe the next time you're in town? (listens) Well I just love Ted and I'd love to meet you -- you have a very nice voice -- but I just -- (listens, grows impatient) Well I'm having a chat with a very nice cop. Actually not a real cop; he's a private inves -- 
A BUZZING from the phone; the connection abruptly broken. She hangs up, recites. 
KLUTE Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else? 
BREE Most of them. 
KLUTE Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave -- 
BREE How would I remember? 
KLUTE How else do you meet them? Pimps? (a beat) 
BREE (patient) You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money. 
Klute takes up the slip of paper previously given him by Trask. In the same manner as before -- 
KLUTE I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what -- 
BREE (trembling) Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that. 
KLUTE What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber? 
She freezes again, looking at him. Then savagely -- 
BREE You saw that, goddamn you? You saw it? He's seventy. His wife's dead. He started cutting garments at fourteen. His whole life, he's maybe had a week's vacation, I'm all he has and he never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what -- 
She chokes -- then goes on -- 
BREE (CONT'D) Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or -- 
KLUTE (under) -- OK -- 
BREE -- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things -- 
She grabs up the company picture, raging on -- 
BREE (CONT'D) -- you perverted hypocrite square bastards. 
KLUTE OK. 
Something in his inflection -- very slight -- cautions her. She falls silent as suddenly as she began. Then cheerfully -- 
BREE Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse. 
KLUTE Tell me about Frank Ligourin. 
INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE 
It is as black as a dungeon and as low. He lights a match, but sees no one. There is a sound of movement coming from the floor above, He runs up the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint light coming through one of the closed apartment doors. Carefully takes out a gun and then with one quick movement he breaks through the door. 
INT. ABANDONED APARTMENT 
The walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings. The room is lighted by some candies stuck in bottles. Sitting on a blanket on the floor are several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party. They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves in the abandoned house. It is a MOOT POINT whether they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that faces them. He puts his gun away in embarrassment. Again he has been made to feel like an awkward peeping tom in this hidden world of the city. 
INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING 
CAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low door. CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow furnace room with the ceiling so low that an ordinary man could not stand up. We hear the sound of breathing. CAMERA follows the sound through the darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the corner looking like some strange animal from a painting by Bosch. It is Cable. 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Bree has wrapped herself in the quilt -- standing up against a corner shivering, immobilized. We hear KLUTE'S FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING -- she flinches -- he enters. 
KLUTE I couldn't get him. 
He sees her condition. Gently -- 
KLUTE (CONT'D) It's all right. 
He reaches to touch her -- she quails away from him. 
BREE Well do you think it was him? 
KLUTE What do you think? 
BREE Can't you get him? 
KLUTE Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't. 
BREE (pause) You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it. 
KLUTE Do you know where he got the dumper? 
BREE He never told me. 
KLUTE Well, let's go down and ask him. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST BUILDINGS - DAY 
A shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself -- our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W. The FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE walking upstreet, turning under one of the canopies -- (Klute carries a zipper book-case). 
INT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY - ON DOORMAN AT PHONE - DAY 
The DOORMAN hangs up the brass house-phone, smiles and gestures them graciously into the (self service) ELEVATOR. We see Klute -- without making too much of it -- taking in the mirrors and marble work. 
INT. ELEVATOR (MOVING): KLUTE, BREE 
She breaks the silence. 
BREE What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each. 
KLUTE Is that what you gave him? 
Silence. 
INT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT: ON DOOR - DAY 
The BUZZER sounding, FRANK LIGOURIN crossing to open the door for BREE, KLUTE. Cheerful, hospitable, nice, unpretentious. 
FRANK Bree -- hi -- come in, come in. 
The point of this one brief shot -- Bree's face -- in the instant after Frank has spoken and before she enters, with Klute following. Her half-second of hesitation. This is someone who gets to her somehow -- probably always will. 
WIDER LIGOURIN'S APT: THREESHOT - DAY 
The apartment is as expected -- but not overdone; a certain small amount of someone-lives-here litter. A few, large but not very good, ABSTRACTIONS on the walls. There is a large TABLE covered over with photographs and mock-ups of magazine pages, a felt board or easel with lettering samples -- Frank's props really. 
BREE Frank -- Klute. 
KLUTE It didn't go anywhere. (then) But that's not why -- 
BREE About the dumper, didn't he tell you that? 
KLUTE It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper. 
BREE (coldly) Well -- she's dead. 
At the corner he slows, starts unzipping his bookcase as if indicating a change of route. 
BREE (CONT'D) I thought you were going back to the apartment. 
KLUTE (he shakes his head) You said you wanted these. 
He hands over the TAPE-REELS. 
BREE Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls. (then) How come? 
KLUTE You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it. 
BREE (grudgingly) Is there anything more I could -- 
KLUTE I don't see anything, do you? 
BREE What're you gonna do next? 
KLUTE Try some other ways. (starts off) 
BREE What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me? 
KLUTE And I don't think that was Tom. 
BREE You said it was! 
KLUTE No, I said what did you think. 
BREE Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick. 
KLUTE Well -- 
BREE (harshly) Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little? 
KLUTE Yeah, you got to me. 
BREE -- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness? 
KLUTE Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know -- (hunts the word) -- too bad? Pathetic? 
BREE Goodbye. 
She turns smartly away, deposits the tapes in passing in a litter box, departs. Klute looks after her for a moment, then turns on his way. Then -- 
EXT. POV THROUGH LITTERBOX IN FOREGROUND TO POV OF FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE - DAY 
This shot holds both in view for a moment, until they both disappear separately in the traffic. CAMERA moves in slightly on litterbox as a man's hand comes into frame and removes the tapes. 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT 
Klute, in pajama bottoms, lies in bed. A miserably hot humid night. KNOCK at the door. He answers. BREE stands in the doorway in bare feet. 
BREE What the hell do you mean, pathetic? 
She walks in past him, sits down on the edge of his bed. 
KLUTE It's kind of late. 
BREE It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof. 
He takes her seriously, starts to move. 
BREE (CONT'D) Oh, don't be a doo-doo. 
A WIDE SHOT. An open casting call in an Off Broadway Theatre. Darkness, except for the work light onstage. A small GROUP there -- onstage -- including the figure of BREE. Just offstage, the figures of DIRECTOR (JANG) and a PRODUCER. And the rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted with the heads of ACTORS, ACTRESSES waiting for their turns. Bree's voice rings out across the gloom. 
BREE -- Why? 
CLOSER, ONSTAGE 
The others stand rigid as statues, facing dead front -- an experimental drama, clearly -- all holding scripts, as Bree hastens from one to another, fiercely, imploringly -- 
BREE (CONT'D) Why -- please, why? -- Why lose, why look? Why hate and give and want and love? Why get, grieve, g -- 
JANG (loudly, cheerfully) Thank you very much. 
All break posture, start offstage, while Bree, caught in mid-stride, clowns it a little. 
BREE -- gug -- gug -- 
-- then toward Jang, a bit succinctly, indicating script -- 
BREE (CONT'D) Why? -- I want to know what. 
JANG (laughs tolerantly) No, that was very good everybody. Do we have all your resumes? 
PRODUCER (from list) Booth -- Osman -- Zuff -- Anjeris Chaka. 
WIDER, near stage front. 
Bree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others. Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene. 
She finds something - someone -- impeding her way. Looks up. 
PAST BREE TO KLUTE 
Klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept her. 
EXT. THEATRE ENTRANCE: GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY 
Bree comes out, turns. 
KLUTE You asked if there was anything more you could help me with. 
BREE When? 
Pause. Impasse. 
KLUTE I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you. 
BREE Arlyn Page. 
KLUTE Did she and Jane McKenna know each other? 
BREE Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time. 
KLUTE Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too. 
BREE Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her. 
KLUTE You could help me find her. You know the people. (as she turns away) I'll pay you a hundred dollars. 
BREE I can make that in a lunch break! (then) Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds? 
KLUTE Don't worry. 
She examines him -- shrugs -- turns, proceeds along the sidewalk, Klute accompanying -- 
EXT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT 
In the small hours. The same place seen previously, the gathering place. KLUTE, BREE arriving and entering. 
INT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT 
Klute and Bree head toward the rear. Her arrival causes a little stir. She exchanges greetings with one or two, is watched by others. 
MOMMA REESE Try Bill Azure. If you can find him. 
INT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING 
This is a hangout where black and white pimps wait to meet their whores after their night of street walking. This streetwalker world is far removed from the world of the call girl or the world of Janie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the most money that night. CAMERA then goes on to reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin. 
We catch only part of their dialogue. 
AZURE -- a couple weeks then she'd drift off a couple of weeks, you know what I mean? 
KLUTE Have you heard from her recently? 
AZURE She liked me all right but she had what she liked better, you know what I mean? 
We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats -- 
KLUTE Have you heard from her recently? 
-- and CUT TO -- 
INT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE 
PROPRIETRESS -- She'd come in and I'd let her have something. Why not; she'd been a good customer, a beautiful person, a beautiful beautiful person. 
Again we fade sound a little before picture, then CUT TO -- 
EXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE, STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT 
Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th Avenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES UNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and consults another. They seem to know of Arlyn -- haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere -- 
EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAY 
A shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs. Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent. 
MRS. VASEK The whore, yeah. I threw out. 
KLUTE Do you know where she went from here? 
MRS. VASEK Live like animals. Her and the man. Out. 
KLUTE (reacts) Was she living with a man? 
We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE 
EXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAY 
We still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is a genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along street. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute waiting for her to catch up. 
EXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE 
KLUTE What's the matter? 
BREE (glances about) What the hell do you think's the matter. (then suggests) I could wait for you someplace. 
KLUTE If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann -- 
BREE (eagerly) -- Then you don't need me. 
KLUTE But if it's someone else I do. 
He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow. (There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their manners now - a reluctant collaboration.) 
BREE You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars. 
-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses street diagonally toward a half-framed house. 
INT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY 
A downshot from second floor level toward the entry way where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a match to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree climb through stench and litter to the second floor -- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the sounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle and lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates, decides against knocking, pushes in. 
INT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY 
BERGER (O.S.) Cappy? -- Cappy? 
Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGER plunges out from the connecting room, still carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing -- 
BERGER (CONT'D) Cappy it's all right! I got a radio -- don't run, don't -- 
We hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside, the sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks and races after: Klute and Bree follow. 
INT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAY 
We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. As Arlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up onto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries. Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls his face against her, croons to him, soothes and tends him. 
ARLYN Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh my baby baby baby -- 
Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously. 
ARLYN (CONT'D) Get out! (to Berger, again) Don't cry my baby; I'll find him, I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry. (to Klute savagely, incoherently) Leave us alone! Get out and get out and leave us alone! (to Berger) My honey, my baby, my baby -- 
We DISSOLVE TO -- 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE 
CAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the tunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the figure of a woman with life screaming past her out of control. 
INT. SUBWAY 
SUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits with KLUTE staring at the open door and then without warning - gets up and runs off the train. The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train. 
SUBWAY EXIT 
SHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits the sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to be out of the darkness. 
EXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the mysteries of the behavior of BREE. 
SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Alongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking to FRANK LIGOURIN. 
KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN & BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he leaves. 
INT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY 
The pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring with BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the one as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is the total image of the executive in control. 
CABLE She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict. 
KLUTE I believed her, Pete. 
TRASK He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything. 
KLUTE I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann. 
CABLE All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you? 
KLUTE (smiles ruefully) It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything. 
CABLE Then, close the case. 
KLUTE I better keep looking. 
CABLE Where, how? 
KLUTE (the best he can offer) I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel. 
CABLE You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom. 
KLUTE It's got to make sense some way. 
CABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her watch significantly. 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHT 
Darkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily shadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed. He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanket around her shoulders. The transaction is still not overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt. He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herself is quieter, comforted. She begins to stir against him. 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
The street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say. Some lit windows; a single car moving past. 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
All the windows dark this time. The deepest night, just before the sky begins to lighten. 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT 
Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach. Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory business. Her expression is more wondering than anything else -- what does she have here, and can she get used to it? 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN) 
The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the sounds of trash cans being collected. 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN) 
Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for something beside the bed. Her eyes open immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying gently to press her back. 
KLUTE Go back to sleep. 
But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls onto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the possible Bree. She observes: 
BREE I'm still scared. (beat) I mean different but still. (frowns) Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed? 
KLUTE My bed. 
She grins, then starts to reach for him, still receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang, turns her head away sharply. 
BREE Oh! 
He looks at her with concern, but only caresses her. She manages to explain -- 
BREE (CONT'D) I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you. 
KLUTE Mm. 
BREE No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I -- 
He settles himself beside her, makes overtures. She responds, but: 
BREE (CONT'D) Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. 
KLUTE Yup. 
She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely, welcomingly, full out. 
BREE Oh -- 
And we cut directly to: 
INT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAY 
Bree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In a way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry by the throat. 
BREE The son of a bitch seduced me! 
INT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The apartment is a shambles -- furniture overturned, decorations ripped from the wall, bedding scattered and ripped. 
INT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Bree follows more slowly, whispering: 
BREE Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. 
KLUTE Don't touch anything. 
He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment, looks at the rear window which has been broken inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the table at the front of the apartment; his folders. Bree cracks wise, unsteadily. 
BREE You suppose he's a married fella? 
ANGLE TO TABLE; FOLDERS 
The contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the image of Grunemann in the front row. 
KLUTE 
He stands, looking down, taking no notice as -- 
BREE He got in my clothing! 
Then a moment later, she cries out again, more sharply: 
BREE (CONT'D) Oh. Oh. 
He turns quickly. She is holding out, at arms length, a pair of her underpants. With a disgust so extreme she can only laugh. 
BREE (CONT'D) Oh look what he did in them. 
KLUTE Drop it. 
She doesn't respond. He seizes her arm, shakes the garment back onto the floor. She starts to gag, slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the bathroom. Klute yanks her back. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Stay out of there. 
She twists free of his hands, backs away. The same elementary terror we've seen before. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something. 
BREE (full out, vengefully) My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start. 
KLUTE Bree -- 
BREE Right back at the start, right? 
KLUTE Go down in my room. 
BREE You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right? 
She's broken for the door; it's questionable that she's even heard him. He hasn't time to pursue -- shouts again -- 
KLUTE Go down in my room and wait. 
Then he turns back into the apartment. 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
A DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV, connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight and the scene has been invaded by POLICE TECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of fixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are talking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled. Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of material in the dossier. It contains photographs of Cable and his life from childhood to the present - including pictures of him with his mother and father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a very passive looking man; also graduation pictures and pictures with his former wife taken when he was still a very young man. They are the personal images of a life time. 
ROSS (to Klute) But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann? 
KLUTE Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me. 
ROSS What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that? 
TRASK Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls. Cable's everything else. He's been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man -- it kept things goin'. 
TRASK Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up. 
BREE (brightly) Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it? 
TRASK A few more days. We know who did this. 
BREE So do I. 
TRASK No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page. 
She spins around -- mute -- terrified. 
BREE (manages) Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide. 
TRASK Now there's a picture I'd like you to -- 
BREE You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that. 
TRASK Well we're pretty -- 
BREE Why isn't he locked up? 
TRASK We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more. 
BREE Is that why Klute didn't tell me? 
TRASK I guess he figured it was better. 
BREE What was better? I made better bait? 
TRASK No, that's not -- 
BREE Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't -- 
TRASK (coldly) From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at. 
BREE I don't have to look at anything. I don't have -- 
TRASK Here please. 
He coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company outing picture. (We see the rip extending up through the image of Tom Grunemann in the front row.) 
BREE Oh no. 
TRASK Like for you to look for the man. 
BREE Grunemann? I've looked at him a -- 
Trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of Grunemann, indicates with the other hand -- 
TRASK No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just look around -- I said look for the Dumper. 
We see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows of faces. Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp -- 
BREE Oh! -- 
-- and WE CUT TO -- 
INT. DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAY 
Cable welcomes Klute. His outer manner is warm, voluble, congratulatory -- 
CABLE Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time. 
KLUTE Well there's a couple -- 
CABLE I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around -- 
KLUTE Well as a matter of -- 
CABLE I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me. 
Cable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then -- 
CABLE I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man? 
KLUTE Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street. 
CABLE Suppose I meet you there a half hour before. 
KLUTE Just send me a money order. 
CABLE No, I'd -- like to be in on it. 
ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the helicopter. 
Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a goodbye gesture. 
KLUTE Well -- 
CABLE Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night. 
INT. HELICOPTER 
Cable sits down next to window. The helicopter begins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium close shot of Cable against the helicopter window. The helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office building made up of endless glass squares. A telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the building directly against Cable's head and shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is almost levitating by himself. As one floor after another disappears behind him we see an almost manic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on top of things once more. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY 
We bring Klute along street, and into the Brownstone. 
INT. STAIRWELL - DAY 
Klute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment -- knocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once -- 
KLUTE Bree? 
No answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turns back, unlocks the door himself, enters. 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The room is still disordered. Bree and Frank Ligourin look at him, silently. Bree has been assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with her. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles a little -- almost apologetically. 
KLUTE I'm always getting surprises. 
Bree doesn't answer. She sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to get others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then 
KLUTE (CONT'D) I don't want you to do this. 
He still doesn't extract an answer. She returns with other dresses. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Please. I said I don't want you to do this. 
BREE (tight, small) Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it. 
He continues to look at her; she continues to gather possessions. Then trying to smile, to deal with it casually -- 
BREE (CONT'D) Look, too much is going on here. I'm moving in with another girl, that's all. Just for a while. 
FRANK (helpfully) That's right. This other girl's got a very big apartment, big, plenty of room. (then) Look, it's not necessarily how it looks, right? It's -- 
He thinks better of continuing. Klute looks from him back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing his words -- unable to speak any faster. 
KLUTE No. Please. Not with this son of a bitch. 
Frank rises, both nervous and offended -- but dealing with Klute as between civilized men. Smiling. 
FRANK Klute, let's handle it like grownups? I mean we're all grown up now, right? (ventures forward) -- we all respect each other, you know what I mean? -- I respect you, Bree respects you -- you could say, it just didn't work out between you and she. But you got to respect her too -- you know, her best interests, best for her -- 
Klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to beat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side of Frank's face, as he struggles away. Bree is screaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. He thrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break away through the still-open door. Klute pursues. 
INT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAY 
Frank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in the doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams -- 
INT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY 
Klute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here somewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the likely places -- first of all the lower hallway, then the stairwell itself, moving steadily unalarmedly up. 
At the top he notes -- but still without main concern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead -- 
KLUTE Bree -- 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY 
He enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite thoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT BACK TO -- 
EXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY 
Bree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her, nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE. 
INT. STAIRWELL - DAY 
Klute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his room, takes up the phone. Through the still-open door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO -- 
INT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY 
Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an hour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one handed, without even lifting it from the coffee table, with an absolute lack of interest, a mechanical gesture. 
We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where we are watching Bree sit. 
LELA (O.S.) Mrs. Daniel -- 
WIDER - TWO SHOT 
Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her. 
LELA -- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he -- 
BREE No. 
LELA Well I have to close up now. 
BREE Look -- could I use your phone? 
LELA Yes indeed. 
BREE Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone. 
LELA (the same tone, completely) Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me. 
Bree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's inner office and switches out the lights (establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we hear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE -- 
BREE (O.S.) Is Mr. Faber there? (beat) Mr. Faber Senior. 
INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER'S OFFICE: FABER - DAY (NIGHT) 
Mr. Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up. 
FABER Yes? (then, glancing about) Bree? 
INT. SPANGLER (OUTER) OFFICE: BREE ON PHONE - DAY (NIGHT) 
BREE (haltingly) -- I'm -- I just have to talk to someone. I'm just a little way across town -- 
FABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE) 
FABER Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half an hour, sure, yes. 
He hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of triumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie. Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of himself -- he leans forward against his desk and rubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT) 
KLUTE on phone. 
KLUTE Trina, will you call me if you hear from, her? Will you check other people she might call? Yeah, if it wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou. 
Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone else -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT VOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense of other presences. 
We see her open the envelope -- 
CLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPE 
She finds nothing inside but money -- bills totaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for a message, finding nothing. It comes to her slowly that she's been paid off and avoided. She bites her lips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding -- 
RECEPTIONIST AREA 
-- back to the reception area again. (By now this immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight of a figure or two at scene-start, moving through the background, and continue to hear an occasional NOISE or VOICE O.S.) 
Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer, starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back to Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takes up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then -- 
BREE Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet? Well if he does, I'm at -- (reads phone) -- two seven eight, three one hundred, and I guess I can wait here five minutes; then I'll try from somewhere else. (impatiently) Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows who. 
She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the envelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her direction. She glances up apologetically. 
BREE (CONT'D) Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave this for your father, and I wondered if you'd -- 
She pauses -- 
ANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE 
Cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments. In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying figure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended as a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run -- 
BREE (CONT'D) Someone -- 
-- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT) 
Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically skittish message service at the other end). 
KLUTE Did she leave a number? (beat) This is a police call; don't make me take time to prove it. Did she leave a number? What is the number? (beat) What is the number? -- 
INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT) 
Cable and Bree. They are at some remove from the site of Cable's first appearance; there are other evidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that of slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an attempt now and then to smile. Bree watches his every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for it, tries throughout to buy time. 
CABLE Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily? (beat) I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? -- 
BREE Yes -- all right -- 
CABLE -- We can talk -- 
BREE -- Yes. 
CABLE All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book. 
He looks at her discerningly. She seems not to have followed his exposition. He tries patiently to clarify it. 
CABLE (CONT'D) Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her list of -- of persons. I was told you're negotiating for it on behalf of -- 
The PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles. It has been put on night-ring, to sound all over the loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- the most bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of response to it. It rings and rings as he talks and talks -- in the same expository tone as before, without raising his voice. It drowns out most of his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of all the following -- but he seems not to hear it any more than the clamor of other things torturing his soul. 
CABLE (CONT'D) That was what Klute told me -- you were negotiating for him to buy that list. And I'm in a position to pay a good deal more for it than he can. Do you understand? I'd like you to acquire it on my -- (beat) Miss Daniel, do you not understand? (beat) Miss Daniel, I can't tell whether you understand me. (beat - still reasonably) Is this something Klute just invented? Is this a trap for me, Miss Daniel; does Klute know about me? 
He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension phones situated around the loft) -- though up to now he's given no evidence of even hearing the ringing. He just stands holding the phone for a time, then lowers it back on the receiver. With a sort of absolute quiet -- 
CABLE (CONT'D) You have no idea what I'm talking about. 
BREE Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call. 
CABLE No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me? 
BREE Yes. 
CABLE Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it? 
Pause. Then he shudders slightly. 
CABLE (CONT'D) -- Is that contempt? Is it? (then) No, I'm the one who feels contempt. 
-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree. 
Klute tries to gain aim -- 
P.O.V. TO BREE, CABLE 
-- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are too steadily in motion. 
KLUTE 
Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position -- springs. 
CABLE 
Cable catches the sound, whirls, screams -- 
P.O.V. TO KLUTE 
Klute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol - contends for it again, knocks it loose again. EFFECT -- under -- SIRENS. 
CABLE, KLUTE 
Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against one of the windows, exploding it outward with him, both frame and glass. 
EXT. WIDE SHOT: BUILDINGS - DAY (NIGHT) 
We see the body tracing its quick path down the dark side of the building. 
EXT. DOWNSHOT FROM LOFT TO STREET (KLUTE'S P.O.V.) - DAY (NIGHT) 
EXT. BASE OF BUILDING: CABLE'S BODY - DAY (NIGHT) 
The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER. 
INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE, BREE - DAY (NIGHT) 
Klute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree kneels on the floor. He hunkers down. In a gentle-enough VOICE, but matter-of-factly withal -- as if to a child -- 
KLUTE Come on. (pause) Come on. 
(Note: also shoot in MSL, without dialogue, with SIRENS O.S. full up.) Then we CUT TO -- 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
KLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He lets her in, keeps on about his business. His expression is sober; hers is quite tentative. 
BREE Hi. 
He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in, sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him pack. His arm impairs him. At length -- 
KLUTE I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife. 
BREE Oh. (pause; then sharply --) Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy. 
KLUTE Mm. 
BREE You're going back? 
KLUTE Mm. 
Pause. She compresses her lips, slips down from the table, starts smartly out of the room. 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Wait. 
She returns and sits on the table again, waits. But Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more -- goes on packing. 
BREE Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away? 
KLUTE (slowly) No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. (pause)

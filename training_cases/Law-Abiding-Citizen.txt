WHITE      -   9-7-8                                       1. 
FADE IN: 
1   OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE. Images and sounds are surreal,          1 dreamlike, disturbing: 
A HAND is trying to dial three simple numbers. Trembling fingers miss, try again...we hear boop-boop-boop. 
911 OPERATOR (filtered) 911 operator, what is your emergency? 
The phone rises, gripped tightly. Knuckles white. We're TIGHT, it's dark, we see no face -- just slack, trembling lips. 
Whoever it is, he can't talk. All we hear is breathing, all we sense is grief and panic and deep shock. 
OPERATOR (V.O.) (filtered) Hello? Can you hear me? Can you speak? 
CLYDE ...eyes... 
OPERATOR (V.O.) What? Can you speak up? 
CLYDE ...her...eyes... 
2   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                                2 
Lights appear like phantoms over blacktop, flashing. Police cars coming our way. 
OPERATOR (V.O.) Sir, what is the nature of your emergency? 
The man can't speak. 
OPERATOR (V.O.) Sir? Are you injured? Do you need medical attention? 
The cars blast by us... 
3   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                               3 
TIGHT ON PHONE AND MOUTH: 
CLYDE ...her eyes...she can't... 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                            2. 
4   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                                4 
POLICE VEHICLES converge in SLOW-MOTION, dreamlike. Doors fly open, COPS jump out, weapons drawn as WE MOVE with them to: 
Front door. RAMP TO NORMAL CAMERA SPEED as it opens, revealing: 
BENSON CLYDE, phone still gripped. He barely registers the weapons aimed at his face. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HIM, as: 
CLYDE She can't...close her eyes. 
He's pulled from frame. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, following COPS into the house... 
Dark as hell inside. And tense. Arms training weapons. Moving up a tight hallway, emerging into... 
THE LIVING ROOM 
...where the flashlight beams find blood-spatter patterns. Furniture shattered and overturned. A kid's sneaker. 
The flashlights play across TWO BODIES in the wreckage -- a woman's pale hand, a child's motionless leg. 
CAMERA DRIFTS AROUND to the cops' faces, as: 
COP #1 (unsnaps shoulder radio) Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s, need full response, 11-41. 
5   EXT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT                                       5 
Chaotic now, vehicles and lights. The eye of the storm is Clyde on the lawn, hugging his knees, fetal with horror and grief. He's screaming at the sky, but no sound is coming out. EMS TECHS enter shot, steal the frame, race toward the door... 
6   INT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT                                       6 
TRACKING SHOT at floor level, photos being taken. FLASHES bathe the foreground wreckage. FORENSIC TECHS step gingerly. Uniformed cops hang grimly back, hugging the walls... 
CAMERA BRINGS US TO CLOSEUP: A PROFILE IN DEEP SHADOW in the foreground, face tilted obliquely in the wreckage. 
A CAMERA FLASH reveals the face with shocking glare and the IMAGE FREEZES. A TEN YEAR-OLD GIRL, eyes open, staring at us. 
CLYDE (V.O.) (prelap) Her eyes. That's how they were. Open like that. You see? 
WHITE   -    9-7-8                                           3. 
7   INT. CITY HALL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                            7 
Clyde is seated, speaking slowly and precisely. ANGLE WIDENS, revealing the room, light filtering through blinds, as: 
CLYDE When I found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open. (pause) The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life. Can you understand that? 
NICK (O.S.) Yes. Yes, I can. 
Nick and Kell asleep. She's no longer pregnant -- it's now ten years later. A long beat of quiet... 
A small face peers in from the hallway. EMMA, their 10 year- old daughter. She darts in, puts her face to Nick's. 
EMMA (whispering) Dad? 
NICK Huh? Wha--? 
EMMA You know what it is? 
NICK What? 
EMMA (hollering) IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAY! 
She jumps up on the bed, bouncing up and down and dancing around, hollering at the top of her lungs: 
EMMA IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY! 
Nick and Kell are too groggy to do anything but ride it out. Emma sails off the bed and vanishes out the door, hollering all the way up the hallway: 
EMMA I'M SO COOL IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAY! 
Nick and Kell are left groping with blankets, heart rates, and consciousness: 
KELL Glad it's once a year. 
17   INT. KITCHEN/BREAKFAST AREA - MORNING                             17 
Nick and Emma finishing breakfast, getting ready to leave, Kell packing Emma's lunch at the counter: 
EMMA Why can't you be here? 
NICK It's a work thing. Grownup stuff. You know that happens sometimes. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       13. 
EMMA But it's... (draws sneakily close) ...MY BIRTHDAAAAAY! 
He claps his hand over her mouth. 
NICK I believe we've established that. I let go, you'll stop reminding me? (she nods, he lets go) We'll celebrate this weekend. Tonight is all about your friends. Knock                    * yourselves out, don't give mom any                  * grief. I'll try to be home in time to tuck you in, okay? 
EMMA Okay. But what are you doing tonight that is more important than... 
She's doing that "sneakily drawing close" thing again. Nick holds up his finger, cautioning her to say it quietly. 
EMMA (leans in, whispers) ...my birthdaaaaay. 
KELL Something he'd get out of if he could. Here. Take lunch. Grab                       * backpack. We go.                                    * 
Emma grabs her stuff, kisses dad, races from the room. Kell grabs her keys to follow, kisses Nick goodbye. 
NICK Nice evasion. Thanks. 
18   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK                                         18 
Cars are traveling an old service road... 
19   INT. TOWN CAR - DUSK                                           19 
Nick's in back with Cantrell. The years have left Cantrell 90% blind; his glasses are beyond Coke bottle-thick. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         14. 
Between them sits Betsy the German shepherd, now ten years old, wearing a guide-dog harness. She looks miserable wearing a big cone-shaped POST-SURGERY COLLAR. 
NICK How long she have to wear this stupid thing? 
CANTRELL Till the stitches heal. Week or two. 
Nick dotes on the dog, they're old pals: 
NICK Poor honey. Sucks, doesn't it? But you're very pretty. Yes, you are. Even with a radar dish on your head. 
SARAH There they are. Like clockwork. 
ANGLE SHIFTS TO Sarah -- much more confident and power-suited than last time we saw her -- riding up front with the driver. 
19A   EXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING - GEORGE HILL PRISON - LATE DAY          19A* 
The car pulls up to the gate as CAMERA RISES to reveal the         * new facility positioned right next to the old one...               * 
20    INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT                                    20 
The condemned, RUPERT AMES, is placed against the upright execution table and buckled in. The table is tilted back to vertical. All Rupert can do is lay there and watch, as: 
MEDICAL TECHS swab his arms with alcohol, prepare the needles, find his veins. The needles are inserted, taped off. The I.V. lines are attached. Very methodical. 
The techs leave the room. The curtain is drawn aside, revealing the big window that separates the chamber from: 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          15. 
21   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                         21 
Nick and his colleagues are among SEVERAL DOZEN WITNESSES seated in chairs. They watch as WARDEN IGER faces Rupert. 
DUNNIGAN STAY DOWN! 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          24. 
31   EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                     31 
Darby runs like an amped-up rat in a maze, hearing cop cars in the night: Engines ROARING, tires SQUEALING... 
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A HELICOPTER above. Darby dashes for cover against a garage, lost in shadow. A massively bright searchlight sweeps from above, probing... 
Darby crouches, heart hammering, watching the searchlight scan over rooftops. His phone RINGS, he answers: 
VOICE Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints. 
DARBY Kiss my ass. 
VOICE I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring extra ammo? 
Darby glances at the gun, realizing. He bangs his head back against the garage wall in frustration -- fuck! 
VOICE You shot at cops. That's attempted murder if they find the gun on you. You're in deep enough without that. 
Darby frantically wipes the gun with his shirttail, as: 
VOICE You'll need my help getting out. 
DARBY What'll it cost me? 
VOICE We'll discuss terms later. Go south, across 10th. Past the El tracks. Alley behind the clinic. 
DARBY What's there? 
VOICE A cop. Take his ride, he won't give                    * you any trouble. 
DARBY How do you know? 
VOICE 'Cause I tasered his ass. You gonna keep asking questions? 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         25. 
Click -- line dead. Darby breaks cover, heaves the gun into somebody's yard, keeps moving... 
32   EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       32 
Chaotic with cops and lights. Lisa is dragged out, shrieking and bleeding, her face a broken mess. ANGLE TO Nick watching it all unfold. He sees Dunnigan approach: 
DUNNIGAN No way he's getting out of this neighborhood. 
33   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                               33 
Darby finds a POLICE CRUISER parked in the moonlight, window down. Dark inside. A LOCAL COP is sprawled across the front seat...groaning, coming to. 
Darby jumps in, passenger side, wrestles the cop upright. He yanks the cop's service revolver, slapping him awake. 
DARBY Drive. 
Darby reaches over and keys the engine to life. 
DARBY Drive, fucker! I'll put your brains on the dash! 
COP (disoriented) Don't shoot! Don't hurt me, okay? 
DARBY Depends on you. Go. 
The cop hits the gas. Tense moments go by as they accelerate up a dark road. Darby ducks as COP CARS stream past. 
34   EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       34 
Dunnigan and Nick tense, hearing a VOICE over the radio: 
COP VOICE (heavily filtered) ...air unit three...see no sign of suspect...think we lost him... 
DUNNIGAN (keys mic) Keep sweeping the area, unit three. (to Tactical Commander) Go house-to-house. Check everything.                  * Garages, dumpsters, storm drains...                   * 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        25A. 
NICK                                  * You gotta be kidding me.                            * 
Dunnigan -- angry, at a loss -- doesn't reply. Cops are          * scrambling in all directions.                                    * 
Nick turns, steps TOWARD CAMERA INTO A TIGHT SHOT, gazing off    * into the darkness. Something very weird just happened here,      * but he has no idea what. Softly:                                 * 
NICK                                  * How could we lose him?                              * 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          26. 
35   EXT. INDUSTRIAL ZONE - NIGHT                                      35 
Tracks and factories, remote and deserted. Far away, the POLICE COPTER is still buzzing, searching... 
The police cruiser appears, stops. Darby emerges with gun and      * flashlight leveled, motions for the cop to get out. The cop        * complies with hands raised, shaking. 
DARBY In the ditch. 
COP ...please...don't kill me... 
THE LCD IMAGE. Grainy in low light. Clyde, now faceless behind the visor, crosses to the squirming figure on the table. We hear the CIRCULAR SAW BUILD TO A HIGH SHRIEK... 
FADE TO BLACK 
...and the SHRIEKING SAW FADES... 
40   HOLD IN BLACK.                                                   40 
THE BLACKNESS OPENS UP -- we're in a cop car's trunk looking up as the lid is opened. A FIGURE in a meat-packing coat looms over us, faceless and scary behind a dark face protector. 
ANGLE INTO TRUNK                                                   * 
reveals OFFICER HILTS hand-cuffed and duct-taped. He's spent      * the night in here. He recoils, terrified and blinded by glare.    * 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                      29A. 
The figure opens a wicked-sharp butterfly knife, CLICK-CLACKS it open. He leans down, slits the tape binding Hilts' arms, drops the keys in the cop's hands. 
41   EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAWN                                   41 
The police cruiser sits on a dirt road, a FEMALE DISPATCHER'S VOICE issuing softly and incessantly from the radio: 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          30. 
FEMALE VOICE ...unit twenty one, come in...unit twenty one, please respond...report your location... 
The mysterious figure strides from the police cruiser to a MIDNIGHT BLUE 1965 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL in superb condition, shrugging off his thick coat. He gets in, hits the gas. 
Hilts struggles to uncuff himself in the cruiser's trunk,          * arms and legs cramping, as:                                        * 
The Lincoln becomes a CLOUD OF DUST receding in the distance...    * 
42   INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MORNING                                     42* 
Cleaning up the aftermath of the party: Nick up on a step- stool taking down the birthday banner; Kell in her robe feeding the dishwasher; Emma zooming in and out shuttling paper plates and plastic cups into a big trash bag... 
EMMA ...and while we were singing karaoke, Ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face... 
KELL I saw it coming. 
EMMA ...and suddenly she just went barf. Total puke moment. And we were all like, ewwww gross! It was so funny... 
She's out of the kitchen to grab more stuff. Kell starts preparing a bowl of cereal for Emma. 
KELL Funny for her. I cleaned it up. 
NICK I had my "ewwww gross" moment last night too. 
KELL Hey. I had a house full of shrieking ten year-old girls. 
NICK Hey. I saw a guy's veins dissolve. 
KELL Honey. It's not a competition. (off his look) Okay, you win. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        31. 
Emma re-enters, dumping more trash: 
EMMA ...so Tara says that's what you get for eating too much cake and that almost made Ashley puke again... 
The DOORBELL RINGS. Kell glances out the window. 
KELL Delivery. 
EMMA (grabs her cereal) I'll get it! 
She runs out. Nick comes off the step-stool, gratefully accepts a cup of coffee from Kell. He suddenly freezes, notices: 
The kitchen TV is playing CNN: a top-of-the-hour story on the Rupert Ames execution and foul-up. 
NICK Oh, shit. We've gone national. 
43   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                            43 
At the front door, a MESSENGER hands Emma a GIFT BASKET trailing mylar balloons with "Happy Birthday Emma" on them. 
EMMA Thank you! 
She closes the door, turns toward us, finds a CARDBOARD ENVELOPE on the basket -- a card? She opens it, finds: 
Not a card. An unlabeled DVD. 
44   EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAY                                      44 
LOCAL SHERIFFS (not city cops) are spreading out across the        * fields, beating the grass, looking for clues... 
ANGLE TO Officer Hilts, blanket-draped and still rattled by his night-long ordeal, being interviewed by a SERGEANT: 
SERGEANT ...the suspect who tasered you last                    * night...was it the same person who                     * let you out of the trunk this morning? 
HILTS I never saw a face...either time...he wore a thing, a face shield... 
Suddenly, we hear a DISTANT VOICE shouting in panic: 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          32. 
56   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             56 
A GIANT EYEBALL stares at us, unnaturally magnified by a tabletop magnifier. The lens is swept aside, revealing: 
Benson Clyde. In addition to the tabletop magnifier, he's wearing MAGNIFYING LENSES on his head. He examines the figurine with his naked eye, then flips the glasses down to continue... 
57   EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                       57 
VEHICLES race along two-lane blacktop: CRUISERS, UNMARKED CARS, TACTICAL VANS. A POLICE HELICOPTER skims along just above them at scary-low altitude... 
The cars veer off pavement and up a dirt road, kicking up an awesome trail of dust as the copter sweeps wide, pacing... 
58   INT. CARS - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                                  58 
Tense faces: Dunnigan, Garza, Nick. 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                           35. 
59   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             59 
Clyde pauses, hearing a RUMBLE under the music. Glances up as the rumble passes overhead -- a helicopter? He clicks on a tiny fan, holds the figurine under it, giving it a final dry. 
60   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             60 
A shitstorm descends: vehicles swerving in, COPS jumping out, machine gun-toting SWAT TACTICAL TROOPS pouring from vans... 
61   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             61 
Clyde, still holding the figurine under the whirring fan, leans to one side in his chair, glancing out the window. 
He glimpses scurrying figures behind cars, cops darting and surrounding the house, motioning with hand signals... 
He holds up the figurine for a final look. Satisfied with it, he places it onto: 
A CHESSBOARD -- the last piece. All the others are also hand- painted, gorgeous. Real craftsmanship here. 
He stands. Calmly moves to the middle of the room. Kicks off his shoes. Peels off his shirt and undershirt. Even takes off his pants. There will be no confusion about hidden weapons. 
He positions himself, very precise and purposeful. Lifts his hands high above his head. Presenting himself. Waiting. 
Then, bam: doors EXPLODE in and windows SHATTER as the SWAT tactical troops storm the room, bad-asses in black, machine guns aimed, encircling him, everybody shouting: 
SWAT TROOPS DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER-- DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS-- 
Clyde is the calm eye of a pissed-off storm of highly professional cops with itchy trigger fingers. He remains serene, looking around at them, hands raised high... 
SWAT CAPTAIN ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW! 
He compliantly goes to his knees, then prone, offers his hands behind his back. They move in, cuff him, as troops spread throughout the house yelling "Clear!" 
62   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              62 
Nick, wearing his kevlar, follows Dunnigan and Garza. Nick glances over and sees a perfect 1965 midnight-blue Lincoln Continental in the carport... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          36. 
63   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              63 
Clyde is pulled to his feet just as Nick enters. UNIFORMS spread out, securing the house. Dunnigan faces Clyde... 
DUNNIGAN Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain silent... 
...as the full Miranda is read, Nick and Clyde have their eyes locked throughout -- this moment is all about them... 
DUNNIGAN ...understand your rights as I have explained them? 
CLYDE Yes. 
Clyde is hustled outside, leaving Nick with Dunnigan and Garza in the farmhouse -- it's renovated, clean, very loft-like. 
Nick drifts to the table, sees the chess board, can't help admiring the pieces. Then his eyes go to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase. He's stunned to realize: they're all law books. 
GARZA (O.S.) Check this shit out. 
Nick turns, moves to Garza's side. Dunnigan joins them. All three staring at a wall. ANGLE SHIFTS around to reveal: 
The long-ago PHOTO (clipped from a newspaper) of Nick and Clarence Darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps. 
ANGLE WIDENS to reveal: 
Photo after photo. The crime scene photos...photos of Clyde and his family in happier times...photos clipped from magazines and newspapers about the murder and trial...all very neatly and precisely arrayed. The entire wall covered with them. 
THE MUSIC KEEPS BOOMING from the record player. Dunnigan turns     * TIGHT TO CAMERA and yells: 
DUNNIGAN CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF, PLEASE? 
64   INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY                              64 
Clyde sits alone and isolated in a small room. WIDEN to reveal Sarah at the observation glass. She turns as Nick steps up. 
SARAH He says he'll only talk to you. 
WHITE   -    9-7-8                                         37. 
Nick and Dunnigan prepare to go in. Dunnigan takes off his gun and holster, lays them on a table, as Garza activates the VIDEO. Cantrell finds a chair by feel, sits down, as: 
NICK You think you can play us? You gonna take me on? 
CLYDE Clarence Darby did. And I'm much smarter than he was. Or you. 
Nick advances, furious, held back by Dunnigan: 
NICK I'm gonna bury you, fucker! 
CLYDE (lunges to his feet) That's it, that's what I want! That fire in the belly! That's what I wanted ten years ago! Do it, Nick! Bury me! 
DUNNIGAN (shouting at Clyde) Sit down! Sit the fuck down! 
Clyde does, settles in, speaking calmly: 
CLYDE Or. Set me free. 
NICK What? 
CLYDE Did I stutter? Make your case. Or. Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way. (off Nick's look) I'll even make it easy on you. I will confess, how's that? 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                  41. 
NICK You're gonna confess. 
CLYDE Let's start tomorrow after a good night's sleep. We'll all be fresh and rested. 
65   EXT. CITY HALL COURTYARD - DAY                            65 
Nick paces agitated, with the group:                        * 
SARAH                            * Ten years he's been planning this?             * Patient people make me nervous. This? This freaks me out.                      * 
DUNNIGAN                         * Is he serious about confessing?                * What's his deal, is he crazy? 
NICK Confession or not, we're gonna nail him on two counts of first-degree. 
CANTRELL Agreed, but softly. Nothing hard- ass, no grand-standing. Kid gloves. 
NICK Kid gloves? He's a psycho with a power saw. 
CANTRELL Depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child. (off Nick's look) Public sympathy is to be respected and feared. This could blow up in our faces if we're not careful. We can't look like we're pissed off or have an ax to grind. (stops) Are we pissed off? Do we have an ax to grind? 
NICK No. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          42. 
CANTRELL Then stop acting like it. 
Beat. Nick takes a deep breath. 
NICK Okay. He got under my skin a little. That's done. 
66   EXT. CITY HALL - DAY                                              66 
STEADICAM TWO SILHOUETTES: We're following Nick and Sarah through one of the pedestrian tunnels to the street: 
NICK ...background check's gotta be thorough, I want to know everything there is to know about this son of a bitch. Get all the ADAs on it, tell 'em I better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals... 
SARAH How about outside help? That P.I. who helped us on the Jacovitz case? 
NICK Yeah, he was good. And Hanson's                        * always reliable. But try to limit their hours, okay? 
We find a MERCEDES at the curb -- Kell at the wheel, Emma in back. Nick gets in. Sarah leans down, happy to see them. Emma's face lights up -- the little girl obviously adores her. 
KELL Well, hello there beauty! 
SARAH Hey Kell! Hey Emma, how's my dynamo? 
EMMA Hi, Sarah! 
KELL We haven't seen you in so long it's ridiculous. When are you gonna come by for a visit? 
SARAH Who needs a life, right? Talk to your husband, maybe he'll give us a day off one of these years. 
KELL Soon, huh? Seriously, we miss you. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       43. 
Sarah blows Emma a big extravagant kiss. Emma returns it, waves as they pull away. Nick and Kell glance back, happy to see their daughter acting a bit more like her old self... 
67   INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       67 
Late. Nick, in t-shirt and pajama bottoms, comes up a dark hallway with a file in his hand, rubbing his eyes. He comes to his daughter's bedroom door, quietly turns the knob... 
EMMA'S BEDROOM 
...and finds the bed empty. Sheets thrown back. 
Nick stands for a moment, every irrational fear he's ever had washing over him. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM fast down the hallway... 
...into the master bedroom, where he finds Emma sleeping with Kell. He stands for a moment, heart hammering. Softly: 
NICK Fuck. 
Kell stirs, sees him, puts a finger to her lips. In whispers: 
IGER It's not just a bed. Every inmate               * here will be on the phone to their              * lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment. Can you justify that?                * 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       47. 
SARAH                                  * (offering) We give him a bed, he confesses, we                  * take the bed away. At most it's one                  * night.                                               * 
Cantrell weighs it, decides: 
CANTRELL We're talking a high-profile double homicide. Order the bed. 
71   INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY                             71 
Clyde watches as MAINTENANCE MEN remove the unbolted cot from the cell and his Sleep-Matic is rolled in. 
CONVICTS watch, dumbfounded. Clyde's cellmate, a towering Aryan Brother named DWIGHT DIXON, stands quietly amazed... 
CLYDE (V.O.) (pre-lap) Switching the drugs was easy... 
72   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                           72 
Back in the birdcage: 
CLYDE I hacked the Fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. It's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. Nobody's questioning who receives what, or why. 
NICK And the prison phones? 
CLYDE Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit. They'll wave you through the gate, like they did me. It's simple if you know how things work. (off Nick's look) It's a system. You learn how it works. You play it. Any system. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       48. 
NICK (beat) I saw him die. That stuff burned his veins. He suffered terribly. 
CLYDE Score. 
Nick flips to a new page on his pad. 
NICK Let's move on to Clarence Darby. 
CLYDE (sits back)                                   * Hey, you like music? 
NICK (hesitates)                                   * Very much. Why?                                      * 
CLYDE I could tell. I love music. All of                   * it. It's like air in my lungs. So the thing about Clarence Darby is, I want my record collection and player brought to me. The vinyl discs as well as CDs. 
Reactions all around the room. Iger leans forward: 
IGER Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards. They make excellent weapons. My answer to that one, Mr. Clyde, is not no, but hell no.                       * 
Clyde absorbs that, looks to Nick, as: 
NICK It's a legitimate concern. 
CLYDE (beat, calls to Iger) How about my ipod and speaker dock? 
73   INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY                              73 
AN IPOD AND SPEAKER DOCK now occupy a small plywood shelf attached to the railing outside Clyde's cell. A GUARD plugs it in via a long orange extension cord. 
ANGLE WIDENS to Iger, who turns to the bars and hands a remote control through to Clyde. Dixon's watching balefully, as is every inmate on the cellblock. 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                        49. 
IGER The player stays out here. You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out. Those terms aren't negotiable. 
CLYDE I appreciate your compromise. 
Iger draws close to the bars. Quietly: 
IGER You looking to get your ass kicked? (off Clyde's look) By every inmate on this cellblock. You keep this up, they'll take it out on you. Harshly. 
Clyde glances back to Dwight. Dwight's watching, glowering, agreement in his silence. Clyde turns back to Iger. 
IGER Just trying to keep you alive in here. That's all. 
Iger walks away. Clyde aims the remote. MUSIC STARTS PLAYING. He leans his head on the bars, listening, blissed. Cons all over the cellblock are staring daggers at him. 
CLYDE (O.S.) (pre-lap) I took his fingers with a bolt cutter. His toes with a pair of tin snips. His balls with a hacksaw... 
74   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                           74 
CLYDE ...his penis with a box cutter. His skin with a filet knife. His teeth with pliers. His eyes...for those I used my fingers. (looks to Nick) Check the video I made. All that will match up. I kept him alive for an hour, give or take. Time it. 
Nick trades looks with the others in the room -- everybody have what they need? People nod. Nicks closes his pad. 
CLYDE What now? 
NICK My office types it up, you sign. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       50. 
Nick rises, putting things in his briefcase. People get ready to leave -- but Clyde motions Garza to keep it rolling. 
CLYDE How about a signing bonus? The small concessions you've made so far have kept my cooperation flowing...why not give me a reward for signing? 
NICK You don't want to sign, don't sign. We've got you on videotape, we'll go to trial. In ten years, when your appeals are exhausted, I'll attend your execution. I'll make sure nobody tampers with the drugs. 
79   INT. D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY                                          79 
Nick enters, moves through the bullpen. ADAs (assistant district attorneys) are working and grimly focused. Nick pokes his head into Sarah's office. She looks up. 
NICK What do we have so far?                                * 
80   EXT. PRISON - DAY                                                 80 
A HIGH-END DELIVERY VAN bearing the logo of La Traviata is waved through the gate into the delivery entrance... 
SARAH (V.O.)                             * He's got no next-of-kin. No family                     * since his wife and daughter were                       * killed... 
81   EXT. AERIAL SHOT - DAY                                            81 
THE FBI HELICOPTER THUNDERS over beautiful green hills... 
SARAH (V.O.) He's a tinkerer. Little inventions                     * and gizmos... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          54. 
82   INT. NICK'S OFFICE - DAY                                          82 
Nick gazing out the window, Cantrell seated with his dog, Sarah reading the report thus far: 
SARAH ...he holds two dozen patents that have made him a lot of money the last ten years. He's invested a lot of it in real estate. Weird stuff. 
CANTRELL Weird how? 
SARAH Properties with no real value. Around                  * airports, chemical plants. Stuff                       * nobody wants... 
83   INT. CELLBLOCK - DAY                                              83 
A CONVICT comes to his bars, peering out...                         * 
CONVICT                                  * Motherfucker... 
...because here comes the rolling La Traviata cart -- gleaming domes keeping food warm, silver utensils, crisp linens, a ROSE in a bud vase. A red-jacketed LA TRAVIATA WAITER is pushing the cart, accompanied by GUARDS and Warden Iger. 
More cons appear at their bars, faces peering, an angry grumble growing in the cellblock as the cart goes by. The waiter's looking around, nervous... 
SARAH (V.O.) He votes. He gives money to charity, mostly victim's funds... 
84   INT. OFFICE - DAY                                                 84 
SARAH ...but he also gives a big chunk to macular research. 
CANTRELL (looks up) He donates to eye research? 
SARAH RPI. That's the charity you work with, isn't it? 
CANTRELL Huh. Strange. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         55. 
85   INT. CELL - DAY                                                  85 
The waiter, hemmed by guards, nervously reads the order: 
WAITER ...consommé...sea bass...squab...                     * New York strip, rare...a variety of                   * pates... 
CLYDE Rack of lamb? 
WAITER ...oh, yes, rack of lamb... 
86   EXT. NEW JERSEY HILLTOP - DAY                                    86 
THE HELICOPTER ROARS IN, lands. Davies and his men jump out. 
AN FBI GROUND TEAM is waiting for them. A CAMDEN FIELD AGENT runs up and points at the ground, shouting: 
FIELD AGENT WE THINK WE'VE GOT A CAIRN HERE! SOMEBODY LAID A BED OF STONES AND PLANTED SOD OVER IT! 
Davies signals his team. SHOVELS AND PICKS hit the ground... 
87   INT. CELL - DAY                                                  87 
...while GORGEOUS FOOD hits paper plates. It's being slopped unceremoniously from the fine china by the guards. TILT UP to Iger overseeing this process, passing china and utensils to the waiter, who's flustered: 
WAITER You're bruising the crepes. 
GUARD Life's a bitch, then you die. 
IGER ...no plates, they break into nice jagged pieces...nothing sharp, nothing that can be made sharp...no forks, no knives, no spoons....lose that carafe...we will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening, thank you...you can eat with your fingers... 
CLYDE The guards will think me gauche. 
Clyde's got the rose, teasing his nose with it. All around        * the cellblock, inmates are shouting insults and threats... 
BLUE    -   9-19-08                                         56. 
88   INT. OFFICE - DAY                                                 88 
Sarah is exiting, leaving Nick and Cantrell to stare at the phone and wait for it to ring... 
NICK (calls after her) Thanks. Keep digging. 
100   EXT. WIDE LANDSCAPE/HILLTOP - DUSK                                100 
...and the dust cloud cascades across the hillside...               * 
101   INT. CELL - DUSK                                                  101 
...and Clyde has Dwight pinned on the floor against the bars, arm ramming like a piston, punching those bones into Dwight's throat again and again, blood everywhere... 
102   INT. OFFICE - DUSK                                                102 
TIGHT ON NICK holding the phone. He knows something awful just happened on the other end: 
NICK Agent Davies? 
103   EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK                                               103 
An open CELL PHONE lies on the grass. Feet stumble haltingly into the shot. TILT UP TO: 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          59. 
Davies, dazed, staring offscreen in shock. Dust and smoke billowing. People running, shouting... 
104   INT. CELL - DUSK                                                  104 
Clyde rises into the shot, calm now, covered with blood. He unwraps the napkin from his hand, snaps it open, uses it to wipe the blood from his face. 
He takes his seat, positions the cart, uncovers the crepes and resumes eating... 
FADE TO BLACK 
105   INT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY                                       105 
A steel gate slides open, revealing Nick. Flanking him are Cantrell, Dunnigan, Davies (banged up and bandaged), Iger, others. They move toward us with purpose, grim and resolute, Sarah bringing up the rear with a young ADA named ROYCE. 
NICK Why do you have him in the dome? 
IGER He killed his cellmate. We had to separate him out. 
CANTRELL What's wrong with solitary? 
IGER We don't have the authority. Not without a court order. This place was re-opened under protest as it is. Some areas are off-limits to our use -- tied up in a legal challenge by the ACLU as cruel and unusual. Especially solitary. (off Nick's look) It was nicknamed the dungeon... 
NICK (to Sarah) Get Judge Burch on the phone. 
Sarah speed-dials as a GUARD lets them in... 
106   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                             106 
Clyde waits in the birdcage, shackled. The group spreads into the room, silence thick. Nobody will enter the birdcage this time. Clyde occupies it alone -- owning it, in fact -- as: 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                   60. 
IGER Nice trick with the rack of lamb. Didn't see that one coming. 
NICK Why'd you kill your cellmate? 
CLYDE I claim self-defense. 
NICK Here's what I think. You suckered us in. You ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him. 
CANTRELL Which makes it premeditated. Again. 
CLYDE And, again, you'll have to prove that in court. As I've said before... (to Nick) ...make your case. Or set me free. 
DAVIES (pissed, moving forward) Your booby-trap killed two of mine            * and put four in the hospital. That            * brings the total of people you've             * killed to six -- and be advised the           * Bureau does not suffer losing agents in the field. (turns) We're done dancing. I have the right to claim jurisdiction here, do I not, Detective Dunnigan? 
DUNNIGAN That is correct, Agent Davies. 
DAVIES (again to Clyde) So. I'm gonna rendition your ass. Rumor has it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland. Don't bother packing, you're gonna disappear. 
CLYDE (beat, glances to Nick) You see, Nick? That man is pissed! That's what I'm talking about! No deals, no compromise! You see? 
NICK I see you totally disconnected from reality, that's what I see! 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        61. 
SARAH (handing off phone) Judge Burch with an answer for you. 
107   INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY                                     107 
JUDGE BURCH I'm the ACLU's biggest fundraiser in this state. You wanna put that piece of shit in solitary? Good. As far as I'm concerned, you can bury him in the bowels of hell. 
108   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                           108 
NICK Thank you, Judge Burch. (hangs up, looks to Iger)                     * Consider your court order signed. (moves to Clyde) Freedom? Not likely. In fact, you just bought a one room suite in the dungeon. Very exclusive. 
IGER You'll have it all to yourself -- the first man down there in over twenty years. Quite an achievement. 
Clyde sinks with a sigh of resignation and defeat, rests his head wearily on the bars. Nick moves in, speaking quietly: 
NICK You're doing everything wrong. Making all the wrong moves. 
CLYDE It would seem that way. 
The wording catches Nick -- but he dismisses it, turns: 
NICK Sam? What is it? (beat) Not far, maybe six blocks. I'm having dinner with my wife. 
112   EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT                                            112 
DAVIES Two words: doggy bag. Be in your office in ten minutes.                                 * (beat) Nick, don't ask questions. I was on the phone all day. Believe me when I say we've got one shot at this. 
He clicks off... 
113   INT. NICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                        113 
...and faces Nick and Cantrell in the dimly-lit office: 
NICK He's coming here? 
DAVIES So I'm told. It's called inter-agency cooperation, but don't ask me what agency because I wouldn't know. This isn't even back-channels, this is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth. (off their looks) I just blew thirty years' worth of favors today calling in this one chit. I hope it's worth it.                            * 
The desk phone RINGS. Nick answers, listens a beat: 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                        66. 
NICK Yes. Yes, we're all here. Downstairs? Okay. Understood. (hangs up) He said not to take the elevator. 
Off their puzzled looks... 
114   INT. CITY HALL - SPIRAL STAIRCASE - NIGHT                        114 
Huge, descending seven floors, circles within circles dropping into darkness. Nick and Davies lead the way down. Cantrell brings up the rear with his dog and cane... 
SPOOK (O.S.) That's good there. 
They freeze. Nick and Davies peer down. They start to make out a FIGURE in the murky darkness one level below. 
SPOOK Which one of you is Davies? 
Davies takes a step forward. THE SPOOK eases partially into the light -- flinty gaze, military-style haircut. 
SPOOK You must be well thought of, Agent Davies. I don't do this. But I was asked nicely by the right people. They briefed me on your problems with Benson Clyde. 
NICK What are we dealing with? 
SPOOK Things I can neither confirm nor deny. Things of which, if I'm asked, I will disavow any knowledge. 
The guys trade a look. Cantrell can't help chuckling. 
CANTRELL (to Davies) You gotta be kidding me with this guy. 
SPOOK He's not. Tell me you grasp the implication of what I've said, or we're done here. 
CANTRELL (smile fades) Yeah. Okay. I get it. 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                    67. 
NICK What was Clyde? Some kind of spy? 
SPOOK Spooks like me are a dime a dozen. Clyde was a brain. He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field. Ways to kill people. (off their looks) You need to get rid of somebody. It's not a situation where you can get close. What do you do? 
NICK Ask Clyde? 
SPOOK That's right. Ask Clyde. And he'd figure something out. Gizmos, strategy. He was good at it. 
NICK How good? 
SPOOK (beat) You play chess? 
NICK Yeah. Tournament level in college, matter of fact. 
SPOOK In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about ten steps ahead, so I'd take you in a game. 
NICK What about Clyde? 
SPOOK Off the charts. If you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty. Or fifty. He's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet. (further into the light) This cellmate he killed? You think that was random? Bullshit. That was a pawn taken off the board. If I were you, I'd be trying to figure out what the move was. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       68. 
NICK I have been. Any thoughts? 
SPOOK Top of my head? Was the cellmate ever connected with this case? Or with Clyde? Was anybody else in that facility? Guards? Cons? The janitor? Any connection at all, no matter how remote. Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does. 
DAVIES Like what? He's locked up. What can he do? 
SPOOK (gives him a look) You're an average chess player, aren't you? 
DAVIES Actually, I kind of suck. 
SPOOK I can tell. But I like your tie. 
DAVIES (perplexed) Thank you. Father's Day. 
SPOOK There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but                     * trust me it works. You put your tie                 * on and all day long it slowly tightens. You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point. (beat) Clyde invented that. 
The Spook melts back into the shadows. The guys crane forward, trying to see. There's a brief spill of light below as a doorway opens and closes...he's gone. 
The three of them stand there absorbing everything they've heard. Nick sits on a step. Quiet looks are traded... 
...and they all start taking off their ties... 
JAMESON No, Miss Lowell. 
SARAH (crossing the room) Weekend plans? Cancel 'em! I don't wanna hear any shit about it! (on Jameson again) Clack-clack, Jameson. Clack-clack. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          72. 
Jameson dives onto the keys, starts clack-clacking. Sarah gives Nick a nod -- she's got this in hand. Nick exits... 
119   EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - NIGHT                                       119 
...and finds a FORENSIC TEAM disassembling Clyde's Sleep-Matic bed -- nuts, bolts, struts, electronics. The mattress is being razored open, wadding pulled out and run under fluoroscopes. 
NICK Well? 
DUNNIGAN It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable bed. Now it's not. 
CAMERA FOLLOWS them to a table where an FBI TEAM is focusing all their skills and tech on Clyde's ipod and speaker dock. The TEAM LEADER places the buds in his ears, listening. 
NICK What do you have? 
TEAM LEADER Rocky Mountain Way. Joe Walsh. (off Nick's look) What do you want from me, it's a fucking ipod. 
The other agents snicker, not hiding their amusement, but:         * 
NICK                                     * Tear it apart, make sure. Memory.                      * Speakers. Wiring. Everything.                          * 
120   INT. CLYDE'S CELLBLOCK - NIGHT                                    120 
GUARDS, FEDS, BOMB-SNIFFING DOGS -- they're cruising the cellblocks, flashlights swiveling, beams catching the faces of sleepy cons in their cells or at their bars... 
We find Nick and Iger at Clyde's now-empty cell. TWO FBI            * emerge, shake their heads.                                          * 
FBI FORENSIC Blood stain. Few fibers. That's it. 
CONVICT (sleepy, at his bars) Warden, man, whassup? 
IGER Everybody back to sleep. 
NICK (looks to Iger) I want to see him. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          73. 
121   INT. SOLITARY WING - CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                         121 
Two doors: solid steel outer door, inner barred door. The outer slides aside, reveals Nick outside the bars. Inside stands a shadow, waiting: Clyde. 
CLYDE You're up early. Trouble sleeping? 
NICK It was a good bluff. But you're done. Fucking with my head. Scaring                    * my family half to death. Done. 
Clyde moves closer to the bars, into the light. 
CLYDE Amazing, isn't it? How primal that is. That pull? What a man is capable of when it comes to his family?                        * 
NICK                                     * You strip away all the polite shit,                    * that's what we're really about. 
CLYDE                                    * I hope you never face what it is to                    * lose them, Nick. It's like dying yourself. There's nothing worse. 
That could play as a threat, of course -- but it's not. It's       * genuine. And pained. And sincere. And Nick knows it. 
NICK Good night, Ben. 
CLYDE Good night, Nick. 
And then the moment's gone and the mocking Clyde returns: 
CLYDE Is it casual Friday? (off Nick's look) I've never seen you not wear a tie. 
And that says volumes: Clyde's totally aware of what they've been up to and is tickled by it. 
The outer door GRINDS SHUT... 
122   EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - DAWN                                        122 
Night has passed, day is coming. All the earlier energy has dissipated into anticlimax and weariness. People straggle across the yard in groups toward their vehicles... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         74. 
Nick, Dunnigan, Davies, Iger -- all look whipped. Sarah approaches, briefcase in hand, files under her arm. 
SARAH We dug pretty deep for one night. Still got a ways to go, but on a first look? Nothing. Nada. Zip. 
IGER Well, that's good news. 
NICK So far. Now we double-down. Make                    * absolutely certain.                                 * (nods after ADAs)                            * Let them all sleep a few hours,                     * then bring 'em back for round two.                  * 
SARAH Due diligence. My middle name.                      * 
She trudges toward her car, following the ADAs toward their vehicles. Nick trades relieved looks with the men -- everybody coming down from a tense night. Davies shakes their hands: 
DAVIES Fellas. For once, glad not to be of assistance. 
DUNNIGAN Love it when they cry wolf. 
The men separate in different directions. Dunnigan catches a glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze. 
CLYDE (glances at clock) Your twenty four hours are about up. In return for the phone, I'll extend you another twelve hours. 
NICK If not? 
CLYDE How many more people die while you stand around dithering? How many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in? 
Cantrell closes in, tracking Clyde by voice: 
CANTRELL Motherfucker! Whatever point you had was lost long ago! Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college! Eight! I have to talk to their families. I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead. 
Clyde leans down, right in Cantrell's face, intense: 
CLYDE I've been waiting for my explanation for ten years. So far... (shouts) ...NOBODY'S FUCKING BOTHERED! 
Beat. Cantrell spits in his face, turns away trembling with rage. Clyde calmly wipes it off, rises to address them all: 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       78. 
CLYDE If it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war. As in any war, there will be collateral damage. The question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw. 
DUNNIGAN Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we end this war right now. (looks around) Fourteen people dead! I have to say                  * this out loud? (moving toward Clyde) Prisoners die in custody all the time. Attacking a guard. Trying to escape. Shit like that. 
Clyde, eyes locked, pulls his shirt open -- here's your target. Dunnigan, temper flaring, yanks his revolver and aims. 
DUNNIGAN Don't tempt me. 
GARZA Jesus Christ, man, dial it back... 
CLYDE Do it. It would be decisive. Stupid, but decisive. (off Dunnigan's look) Can you handle the blowback, Detective? The "shit like that?" 
Nick's stunned, seeing the whole situation spiraling out of control. He steps in, seizing the moment back: 
NICK Put the gun away! Are you crazy? 
DUNNIGAN (calmly reholsters) It's an option. All I'm saying. Risk the blowback. Ride it out. 
NICK We're not risking anything. Or letting him tear us down. (to Clyde) You're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. No way. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       79. 
CLYDE I like rules. I've wanted you to follow them from the start. Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family. (re-buttons) So. Rules. A phone buys you another twelve hours. But if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline... 
NICK What? What then? 
CLYDE I'll kill someone in this room. 
That sucks the air out of the conversation -- everybody stares as that sinks in. Glances are traded. 
NICK Who? 
He looks at the room full of people, scans their faces as if trying to pick. He points his finger, starts going from one end of the group to the other... 
CLYDE Eenie...meenie...miney...moe... 
...from person to person, to the end, moving back again... 
CLYDE ...my mother...told me...to pick...a person...and that...person...is... 
He lands on Cantrell. Silence. Cantrell obviously can't see. 
CANTRELL Who's he pointing at? 
126   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY                                      126* 
Everybody on the move, emotions high: 
CANTRELL Fuck him. Let him try. 
NICK That's not helpful! We have fourteen                  * dead! You could ask them what he's capable of, but they're in no position to answer. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                 80. 
CANTRELL (beat, tight) Point taken. 
DAVIES We'll give him his phone. We'll tap in and monitor every call. 
DUNNIGAN Buys us another twelve hours, we could use that right now. That puts the deadline at... (checks his watch) ...about 7:30 tonight. 
CANTRELL Shit. I'll be in front of a room full of lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner. I'm the keynote speaker. 
NICK No way. Find a replacement. 
DUNNIGAN Until his deadline passes, you're in protective custody. Not negotiable. 
Cantrell isn't happy about it -- but nods. 
NICK And have them switch the location of that dinner. 
CANTRELL That's last minute. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       81. 
NICK Exactly. He could have gotten your schedule in advance -- been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else. That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit. (off their looks) We have to get a few moves ahead. Plan for every contingency. 
DUNNIGAN This way, Mr. Cantrell. Garza, you're with Mr. Price. 
ROYCE We in the D.A.'s office are still reeling from the events of this morning, as you can imagine. It's a tragic day for us...for our city... 
133   EXT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY                                 133 
Kell and Emma on the platform, Garza hovering nearby, CROWDS swarming around them as boarding calls come over the P.A. system. Kell is looking around, anxious. 
Nick appears on the platform, hurrying. They see him. Emma runs, throws herself into Nick's arms as he crouches. 
EMMA I wanna see Sarah... 
NICK Hey, hey...she's fine, don't be scared. That's not allowed. And there's no reason for it. 
EMMA This sucks. 
NICK I know. 
EMMA Why do we have to go? 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       85. 
NICK 'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows. You gonna begrudge her that? 
EMMA You're kinda full of shit, Dad. 
Nick's taken aback -- not sure whether to laugh. He trades a look with Kell, who's too tense with worry to care. 
NICK Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a little. But only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. Sarah, us. (directed at Kell) I mean it. Okay? 
EMMA Okay. 
She detaches from her father. Nick rises to Kell, pulls an envelope, hands it to her... 
NICK No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash. 
...then takes her cell, swaps it for Royce's... 
NICK I'll keep this. It can be traced. Use this one instead. Don't answer unless you see it's me.                           * 
P.A. VOICE FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR NEW YORK CITY DIRECT, FINAL CALL... 
KELL Anything else? 
NICK I love you. 
KELL Emma's right. This sucks. 
She embraces him, fears and emotions swirling. 
KELL Be goddamn careful. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          86. 
She breaks the embrace. Nick stands, watching them get on the train. The doors close. The train starts out... 
Nick turns. Garza's been watching -- a look of sympathy for what Nick's going through... 
134   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  134 
Kell and Emma on the train, watching buildings slide by outside the window. Kell troubled, holding her daughter... 
135   EXT. AERIAL SHOT OF TRAIN - DAY                                   135 
WE FOLLOW the train traveling a path through canyons of buildings, leaving the city... 
ANGLE SWAPS TRAIN FOR CAR as we drift over a bridge and find Nick's car racing across the span...                                * 
136   INT. CANTRELL'S HOUSE - DAY                                       136 
Nick and Garza enter. ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal the house swarming with HIGH-TECH FBI FORENSIC TEAMS turning the house upside-down, tearing things apart, X-RAY SCANNING walls... 
Cantrell sits isolated, near tears of frustration, as the place is trashed around him. He glances up, hearing: 
NICK Jesus.                                                 * 
CANTRELL Nick? These guys won't even let me pack a bag. Not even a toothbrush. 
Davies enters frame, accompanied by FORENSIC TECHS -- not the guys from downtown, but people who work serious ops. 
DAVIES We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker... 
He holds up a drinking glass with a few ice cubes, runs a black-light wand behind it -- dark granules become visible on each pass, embedded in the ice. 
DAVIES I'm betting something lethal. 
TECH #1 Like this salt. (pours a small amount) Not sodium chloride. Potassium chloride. It's a neuro-blocker, stops the heart -- they use it in lethal injections. You'd be dead before you got up from the table.                      * 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                 87. 
Nick tosses the others a grim look.                      * 
NICK I'm telling you, Clyde has someone          * working with him. Someone on the outside. 
CANTRELL Who? Who could he have? 
NICK Somebody from his past. Could be            * that spook we met on the stairs,            * for all we know -- he'd know how to         * plant this shit... 
NICK Something like that. 
CLYDE Might solve all your problems. What's stopping you? Afraid of the blowback? 
NICK No. It's to prove a     point. (off Clyde's     look) Just because I have     the power, doesn't mean I have     to use it. 
CLYDE Ah. Nice. Good one. 
NICK One can show mercy. 
CLYDE Mercy. Right. 
NICK Yeah. So why don't you? 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       91. 
We see Clyde's brain bend a little -- trying to wrap his head around it. It's almost painful for him. 
CLYDE I think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, Nick? I mean, what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which way to the execution chamber? 
NICK Don't give me that. Death doesn't scare you. 
CLYDE (smiles "right") Yeah, but...we're in the flow of this now. You cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with                  * it. You don't just stop because                    * someone says hey wait. By then the dogs are dragging you. 
NICK Until one side admits defeat. What if I did that? What if I said... (beat) ...you were right. I was wrong. What if I say I should have prosecuted both men ten years ago? 
CLYDE I'd say you're making progress. You should have, you know. Prosecuted both. 
NICK I'd have lost. 
CLYDE With your head held high. And without any blame from me. 
Nick's CELL RINGS -- he turns away, answers: 
NICK Yeah... (beat) She is? Great news. I'll stop on my way back. And Royce? Put some get- well flowers in her room, they sell 'em in the lobby. Thanks. (hangs up, baleful) Six hours in surgery. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                  92. 
CLYDE But she's okay -- good. Miss Lowell is a fine young woman. (beat) Oh, hey...your wife and little girl get out of town all right? 
NICK (beat, staring) You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose. 
Clyde glances around at the snipers with a laugh. 
CLYDE Just a guess. It's what I would do. Get 'em out, make sure they're safe. (reproachful) C'mon. Like I'd ever have hurt them anyway. 
NICK No? 
CLYDE There are limits. Even in war. I may be many things, Nick. But I'm not Clarence Darby. I'm not Rupert Ames. I'm not that kind of monster. 
NICK What kind are you? 
CLYDE Not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child. Christ, look at me. Mine were my salvation -- then they were killed -- and all I had left was this. Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world. 
Pause. Drawing close: 
CLYDE It hurt to lose them, didn't it? Your family. Even knowing they'd come back. 
NICK Yeah. 
CLYDE Imagine knowing they wouldn't. 
NICK I can't. I can't imagine that.               * 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        93. 
CLYDE Good. I envy you. For me, knowing                     * mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years. If I could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, I would. 
NICK I won't make any more deals with murderers. If hearing that makes a difference...if that was the point of all this...you've won. 
We see Clyde's brain hurting again -- he's trying to believe that, would like to believe that... 
CLYDE Counselor. I have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that. I wish I could. (pause) Are we done? You gonna scratch your nose, or can I go? 
Silence now. Nothing left to say. They turn and walk in opposite directions... 
140   INT. CLYDE'S SOLITARY CELL - DAY                                  140 
...and Clyde is brought in, locked into gloom as the doors SLAM behind him. He stands, staring at the darkness... 
141   EXT. CITYSCAPE - DUSK                                             141 
The sun is setting... 
142   INT. NICK'S CAR (MOVING) - DUSK                                   142

143   INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DUSK                                        143 
(Not Cantrell's hotel, but one close by.) A SIGN reads: "A.B.A. Dinner." PEOPLE are entering, passing a GREETER. ANGLE FINDS Judge Burch arriving... 
144   INT. JUDGE BURCH'S OFFICE - DUSK                                  144 
A SECRETARY answers the ringing phone: 
CLYDE You own the vet, you own the dog. Explosive wasn't even that big. Stuff I use, it didn't have to be. (beat) Hidden in plain sight. That's my specialty. Haven't you figured that out yet? 
Nick sighs, rubs his eyes, can barely even speak. 
CLYDE What's next for you? Mulling career options? I suppose law is out. 
NICK I'm trying to get over my friend being dead. Aside from that, fuck you. 
CLYDE Fair enough. (beat) I'll miss you Nick. It was a good dance. 
NICK Didn't bring your family back, though, did it? (off Clyde's silence) Has it made you feel better? All this? You done making your point? 
CLYDE Just warming up. This is Clausewitz shit, my friend. Total war. 
CAMERA PUSHING IN on Nick, listening, as: 
CLYDE I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on my head. (beat) Stay tuned. It'll be Biblical. 
Click -- line goes dead. Nick sits staring at the phone... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                     102A. 
174   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                        174 
Nick enters, finds Sarah crying. A WALL-MOUNTED TV IS PLAYING A NEWS REPORT of the explosions -- file footage of Jonas Cantrell pops up. Nick drifts over, sits at her bedside, as: 
REPORTER ...going live now to City Hall where Mayor Tilden is about to make a statement...announcing, we're told, among other things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price... 
The IMAGE cuts to the Mayor stepping to the mic. 
MAYOR Thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion... 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                       103. 
Nick MUTES it. He and Sarah don't speak for long moments -- he's waiting for her to pull herself together. 
She finally does, going into professional mode, pulling her laptop and files and reports around her. 
SARAH We got the latest batch of background in. Hansen and the other guy did some good work here-- 
NICK Sarah. Give it a rest. It's over. We're done. (off her look) I'm done. The mayor is nailing my coffin shut. The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can -- see what you can salvage of your career. 
Sarah is staring at him with "fuck you" in her eyes. She picks up a multi-page list of addresses, hands it to him. 
SARAH This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own -- stuff around chemical plants, factories. All are owned by Benson Clyde. Look at twenty-two. 
Nick, not caring, scans down to: 
NICK "Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage." Went out of business in '94. (looks up, irritated) Now why would Joe's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone? 
SARAH (tight, pissed) The garage, not so much. But the address. Look at the location. 
Nick looks down at the list again...staring... 
175   EXT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - DAY                           175 
A shitty garage in a shitty industrial park. Bordering it, on the other side of some fencing, are municipal train tracks. 
Nick's car pulls up. He gets out. It's a ghost town here. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        104. 
He goes to the garage window -- glass thick with dirt. He wipes with his sleeve, but it doesn't help him see in. 
176   INT. GARAGE - DAY                                                 176 
TIGHT ON ROLL-UP DOOR -- a CAR JACK jams in under the lip. We hear CRANKING and the door rises... 
Nick drops down, peering in. He squeezes under the door, stands up. Gloomy in here. He hits the door switch -- it RATTLES up       * on its tracks, flooding the place with light...                    * 
He looks around. Cobwebs. Dust. A CAR under a tarp on the hydraulic floor-lift. Old shelves and pallets of tools. Rust. Grime. The crap of ages. 
He sighs, turns and walks out... 
177   EXT./INT. GARAGE - DAY                                            177 
...and pauses. Something tickling his brain. 
Suddenly, a SHRIEKING COMMUTER TRAIN blasts by -- gone, dwindling. It was a bizarre, distinctive sound...like the one Nick heard during his last phone call with Clyde. 
Nick stands frozen, pieces in his head tumbling and threatening to fall into place. Something about the shape of that car under that tarp... 
He turns, staring at it. Goes back in, drawn to it -- it's long, distinctly old-school, with sharp boxy corners... 
He draws the tarp off -- finds a 1965 Lincoln Continental, midnight-blue, in excellent condition. The last time he saw it, it was parked in a carport at Benson Clyde's farmhouse. 
What's it doing here? More pieces falling into place. Nick leaves the garage again, walking out... 
CAMERA TRACKS HIM across the tarmac, and as we come around the corner of the building, we reveal: 
The County Correctional Annex is right there, a backwater corner of the prison not sixty feet away... 
Nick stares up at it -- a very curious location indeed. 
178   INT. GARAGE - DAY                                                 178 
Far below us, the van emerges from the same door, comes out of the alley and back onto the street... 
VOICE #2 (V.O.) I got a white van...large cube type...think he switched vehicles... moving north again on Hudson... 
189   INT. DUNNIGAN'S CAR - NIGHT                                       189 
DUNNIGAN Five and six, stick with that building in case he's trying to cowboy us. All other units, stay with the van... 
Dunnigan pulls out into traffic, resuming the tail... 
VOICE #3 (V.O.) I have visual on van. Logo on side reads "Nomos Custodial Services." 
NICK Where the hell is he going? 
190   EXT. CITY HALL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                             190 
The glorious old building looms above us. TILT DOWN to reveal a red carpet event brewing -- LIMOS AND LUXURY CARS pulling up, GUESTS in expensive attire getting out... 
The NOMOS VAN STEALS THE FRAME as it drives past and turns to go around the back of the building... 
A LIMO STEALS THE FRAME BACK as it pulls to the curb. The Mayor steps out, waving and smiling for FLASHING CAMERAS... 
191   INT. DUNNIGAN'S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT                              191 
Nick and Dunnigan drive past all the hoopla... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       108. 
NICK You don't suppose Nomos Custodial                    * has a service contract with City Hall, do you? 
Off Dunnigan's look of "oh shit"... 
192   EXT. CITY HALL SERVICE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                         192 
TIGHT ON A CARD SCANNER as a card is swiped. THUNK -- the lock disengages. TILT UP to Clyde as he rolls a loaded custodial cart (with mops and trash barrel) inside... 
193   INT. CITY HALL SERVICE AREA - NIGHT                             193 
A GUARD mans the security desk -- he glances up from a BANK OF LIVE-FEED VIDEO MONITORS as Clyde rolls his cart in. 
SECURITY GUARD Mr. Nomos! Ain't seen you around. 
CLYDE Ted...had to get that vacation in. Visited my sister in the Keys... 
SECURITY GUARD Nice. Good for you. 
CLYDE Hey, what's all that hoopla at the main entrance? 
SECURITY GUARD Mayor's got a big fuckin' thing. Thousand dollar a plate whatever. They say the Governor might come. 
CLYDE (moving on) I'll stay out of their way. 
SECURITY GUARD (calls after him) They're up on six, avoid that floor. They got more security than God... 
194   EXT. AERIAL SHOT LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN - NIGHT                  194 
Far below: The entrance lit up with arriving cars and guests, CAMERAS FLASHING... 
A HELICOPTER DRIFTS through the shot just below us in SLOW- MOTION, rotors thrumming eerily... 
195   INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                   195 
...while Clyde rides up. He stops at five, gets out... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         109. 
196   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                              196 
...and rolls his cart up the hallway. MUFFLED MUSIC from the floor above. He comes to a door, sorts his keys... 
197   INT. EMPTY COURTROOM - NIGHT                                      197 
...and enters in darkness. Moving swiftly, he reaches into his trash barrel, pulls a gleaming STEEL BRIEFCASE from under the shredded papers -- he strides to the judge's dais, lays the case atop it, turns and heads back to his cart... 
198   INT. SERVICE AREA SECURITY DESK - NIGHT                           198 
...as a STREAM OF TACTICAL COPS stampede into the building and up the stairs. ANGLE FINDS Nick, Dunnigan, and Davies looming over the nervous security guard: 
DUNNIGAN What floor? 
SECURITY GUARD I told him to avoid six... (checking monitors) There... 
On a monitor: Clyde rolls his cart from the courtroom... 
SECURITY GUARD That's the main courtroom on five.                     * 
NICK That's right below the ballroom. The Mayor's event. 
199   INT. 6TH FLOOR HALLWAY AND BALLROOM - NIGHT                       199 
Early arrivals are coming up, entering the ballroom. The place     * is crawling with SECRET-SERVICE TYPES in suits.                    * 
200   INT. 5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    200* 
Clyde comes down the hallway B.G., rolling his cart... 
208   INT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - NIGHT                         208 
The garage door rises. The Lincoln backs in, stops on the hydraulic lift. Clyde gets out, throws the tarp over it. 
Briefly checks his clamshell. Still plenty of time... 
He raises the lift a few feet, drops down and crawls under the car into: 
209   THE MECHANIC'S PIT                                               209 
Duplicate controls. He hits the button and the car sinks down atop us, settling to the floor, sealing us into darkness. 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                         113. 
Beat. A BRIGHT LIGHT turns on -- one of those gazillion candlepower flashlights. Clyde aims it and we see: 
A TUNNEL hewn into the wall of the mechanic's pit. Just large enough for Clyde to crawl into. He does... 
210   INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                              210 
Hand-dug, rough dirt held up by two-by-four bracing. A wheeled platform is the transport -- Clyde's on his back, pulling himself along by an overhead rope, hand over hand... 
211   INT. UNDER THE PRISON - NIGHT                                    211 
Clyde emerges in the suffocating darkness of a sub-basement laid into a foundation that dates back to the Civil War. He crawls free, shining his light as rats scurry in shadows... 
He's on his hands and knees at first because the ceiling's so low. He's finally able to rise, moving along at a crouch... 
...and emerging into a proper sub-tunnel. Now able to walk normally, he navigates the tunnels and comes to: 
212   INT. CLYDE'S STAGING AREA - NIGHT                                212 
We're just below the solitary wing. Clyde has it rigged with all his needs: computer, spare cell phones, various kinds of clothing, even a shelf lined with snacks. 
He quickly shrugs off his custodian's outfit, revealing his prison jumpsuit beneath. He gazes up a welded steel ladder (identical to four others in a row -- one for each cell). 
He checks his clamshell one last time, tweaking the bad reception with a relay -- ballroom looks full. He clicks off his lamp and clamshell, sets them on a shelf... 
He goes up the ladder to a hatch in the ceiling... 
213   INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                                        213 
...and enters through a swiveling portal concealed behind the toilet. In deep darkness now, he pulls his cell phone, starts inputting a number -- boop...boop...boop... 
And he freezes. Realizing... 
There's somebody in there with him...a silhouette sitting on the floor by the door. The figure reaches out, pushes open the outer door a bit. Faint light spills in, revealing: 
NICK I came to talk. Guess who wasn't in his cell? Imagine my surprise. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                      114. 
CLYDE Imagine mine. 
NICK Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself tossed into solitary --                  * pre-rigged with exits from all five               * cells. Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered. (faint smile) I thought I was such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you wanted. 
CLYDE That's how you play. Make the other guy think it's his idea. (beat) You came to talk, so talk. 
NICK Been thinking. If I'd done things differently -- made different decisions from the start -- we wouldn't have gotten to this point. 
CLYDE But it happened. And here we are. 
NICK Here we are. (beat) Your decisions put us here too. This mess is on both of us.                       * 
CLYDE You want to hold hands? What's your point? 
NICK We can't change decisions we've made. We can only account for decisions we make from here. I know what mine will be. (beat) What about you? You gonna finish dialing that number, or what? 
Clyde hesitating, thumb hovering over the number pad. 
CLYDE If I don't? What are you offering? 
NICK You looking to deal? 
BLUE   -     9-19-08                                       115. 
CLYDE I'm willing to listen. 
NICK Okay, here's the deal. The deal is...there is no deal. (off Clyde's look) I told you. No more deals with murderers. I'm sticking to that. That's my decision. It's what you                  * taught me. Strange as it sounds,                   * I'm grateful for the lesson.                       * 
Nick rises, steps out -- pauses, turns back. 
NICK Your turn. You make the right decision, I'll see what I can do for you. But the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life. 
The moment stretches. Clyde poised -- all down to this. In        * the end, he can't help himself: Boop-boop-boop -- hits send.      * 
CLYDE I'm sorry. 
NICK Me too... 
Nick pushes the barred door shut... 
NICK ...because like I said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life. Which at this point I figure is... (glances at watch) ...another 35 seconds. 
...and turns the key in the lock -- klatch.

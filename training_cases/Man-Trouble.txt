MAN TROUBLE 
FADE IN: 1   INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT                          1 
A woman's hands descend to the keyboard of an organ, playing the opening chords to a duet from the Bach Cantata #78. 
2   INT. REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON LEWIS (LEWIE) DUART            2 the choral conductor, summoning forth the sound of two women's voices singing the text. 
SOPRANO/ALTO (V.O.) 'Wir eilen mit schwachen doch emsigen Schritten, O Jesu, O Meister...' (etc) 
3   INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON JOAN SPRUANCE AND       3 HELEN DEXTRA The latter on crutches, a cast on her leg. They stand center stage, their texts resting on music stands. Seated off to the side, are two male soloists (VINCENT GALLARDO & KENNETH DOWLER). Behind them a chorus of men and women, waiting, as: 
4   INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON CONDUCTOR               4 He begins to sing aggressively over the duet. He suddenly drops his hands to his side. The organist discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off: 
LEWIE Spruance, would you like to show me where it's marked smearing here... (hitting at the score) ... because I swear, I don't see it. 
JOAN Sorry.   I didn't know I was. 
LEWIE Also, I'd be mildly content if I could have a little less delirious self-appreciation and some small regard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note.

4   CONTINUED:                                                 4 He returns his attention to the score. While Joan grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the chorus (EDDY REVERE) can be seen taking his seat amongst the others: JOAN I wasn't smearing. 
HELEN Sssh, come on now. 
JOAN No, I'm telling you, this is personally motivated. Since I moved out he's been doing this, making remarks and being... incredibly pricklike...                           * LEWIE Now, if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment, I'd like to take it once again. JOAN (under her breath) See what I mean? LEWIE Pardon me? JOAN I said fine, let's do it again. LEWIE (with a cold stare) From the beginning please. 
He signals a down beat and they resume somewhere near the      * top of the duet. ABOVE MUSIC FAINTLY OVER: 
5   INT. CAMPUS PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - ON ADELE "IWO JIMA"      5 WATANABE BLISS - NIGHT 
She speaks emotionally, hoping to solicit sympathy: ADELE He never says, 'Honey I love you, you're doing a great job.' I don't feel he respects me as a person and I'm just not that happy with the stature of our relationship. (CONTINUED) 
5   CONTINUED:                                                   5 THERAPIST (O.S.) Uhm hmm.   I hear you. 
ON POST-GRADUATE MFCC THERAPIST 
seated behind a desk in a large deserted classroom: 
THERAPIST Now I want you to look at Harry and tell him how you feel. 
She turns her gaze to EUGENE EARL AXLINE, alias HARRY BLISS. He sits in an adjacent chair, an abject hostage. 
Discomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to the window where the faint sounds of the CHORAL REHEARSAL can be heard. ADELE I feel like he's not plugged into my needs, and I'm not getting enough positive feedback... 
The living room has been completely savaged. Pictures have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie rumpled and dislocated. A vase of flowers atop a grand piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished surface. 
Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden patio. The glass pane in one of them is broken and the window stands partly open. ON Joan's stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the room. Then she suddenly reaches to the front door, opens it and disappears into the hallway, shutting the door after her. 
15    INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY                    15 A detective (MELVENOS) moves about, glancing at the devastation. Joan, seated on a couch, addresses him: (In the b.g., Helen Dextra stands on her crutches near the piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints around the frame of the broken window.) 
MELVENOS You sure nothing of value has been removed from the dwelling? 
JOAN No, nothing. That's what's so disturbing. I mean, why would someone do something like this...?

(poking his toe at some debris on the floor) It kinda looks like somebody doesn't like you, doesn't it? JOAN What do you mean, somebody doesn't like me? The Fingerprinter interrupts: 
FINGERPRINTER Not much on the window. A few partials and a bunch of smears. MELVENOS Check out the bedroom. As he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom: 
JOAN You think this is someone I know? MELVENOS Let's explore that. Have you had any recent trouble with anyone? JOAN No. 
Helen hobbles INTO VIEW, seating herself in a nearby chair.

MELVENOS (CONT'D) For instance, just the other day we had a homicide concerning a dispute over a parking space. JOAN Who could it be? 
MELVENOS You're not married, I take it. Her mind is still off searching for enemies and she fails to respond: HELEN She's in the process of a divorce. MELVENOS What about him? HELEN What about him? He's our conductor, he's an artist and not someone who'd ever... JOAN You mean Lewie? He'd never do anything like this. 
MELVENOS (shrugs) You never know. 
There is a light knock at the partially opened front door. ANDY (O.S.) Hello?   Anybody home? 
ON ATTRACTIVE RED-HAIRED WOMAN (ANTONIA "ANDY" ELLERMAN) 
stepping into the room: 
ANDY Hi, Joanie...

As Joan gets up and moves over to Andy, he glances at his watch and exits to the bedroom. JOAN Andy, this is not the most opportune time. I happen to have had a burglary in here last night... ANDY Oh really?   That's awful. 
JOAN So could I just call you later? ANDY Well, can't you give   me one minute? I'd like to    know if you got the manuscript I   sent you. (squinting at   Helen) Who's that? JOAN Helen Dextra, you've met her before. ANDY Oh, I have? (then quickly to Joan) Anyway, did you read it? JOAN Read what? I don't know what you're talking about. (CONTINUED)

JUNE HUFF, enters from a door of the rear of the office. Moving past Harry's desk, she picks up a folded newspaper page, continues to an upholstered bench beneath a window, lies down and begins reading. HARRY (moving to his desk) Now don't start lazing around, June. Let's get with it. JUNE (under her breath) You get with it. He sits down at his desk and begins going through his drawers, looking for something. She lowers the paper and looks over at him: JUNE (CONT'D) Do you like my hair this way, or do you like it straight? HARRY It's very nice, Sluggo.   Go hose out the kennel. She goes back to reading. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Where the hell are my nail clippers? The PHONE on his desk begins to RING: 
HARRY (CONT'D) I told everybody to stay out of these drawers.

She gets up and moves over to the desk: JUNE They need people, because that hole is getting... HARRY (cutting her off) Remember, don't say I'm here 'til you find out who it is. She picks up the receiver and speaks into it: JUNE Yeah?... I doubt that he's here at this present time... Yeah, maybe later today sometime... Who are you addressing? Uh, the executive kennel maid... uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, I'll tell him... So long. 
She hangs up. HARRY Yeah?   Who was it? 
JUNE Ferde at something Motors. He wants two payments by tomorrow or he's gonna come an' repop the van. HARRY Bastard. 
He goes back to reading. June returns to the bench, lies down again and starts grumbling: 
JUNE You know, you said you were going to get me a little Honda Elite to tool around in.

JUNE Well, I'm not. HARRY That's not the point I'm making. Suddenly irritated, he begins fumbling through a pile                  * of bills on top of the desk: 
HARRY You know   what's gonna happen if I can't pay   these damn breeders and get some   adult dogs on the premises?    Pretty damn quick, some asses are   going to hit the pavement,   believe me. 
JUNE So?    I'm sick of dog turds anyway. He scowls at her, then looks out the window: 
HARRY Jesus, here   I am, sitting in the center of a   lot of wealth, the escalation   in crime couldn't be better, and   I'm not turning a damn nickel   on it... He catches sight of something outside:                                 * 
HARRY (CONT'D) Oh shit.    There's Lee. 
18A   EXT. STREET/HARRY'S POV THROUGH WINDOW - DAY                     18A Across the street, a van not unlike Harry's can be seen. On the sidewalk beyond it, a man (LEE) stands putting                  * coins in a parking meter. 
ON HARRY 
Moving quickly into the doorway to the reception area: (CONTINUED)

He and the dog disappear FROM VIEW.

20    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY                            20 
Joan is seated at the piano, playing Ravel's "Reverie." She breaks off as she sees a dark young man (BALTO) move past the living room window. She resumes playing until her attention is once again drawn to the window, where a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the opposite direction with a young man, who now carries a suitcase. She rises and crosses to the windows to see them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down the driveway. 
Joan, pacing about in nervous distress. She stops abruptly, throws her weapons onto the bed and moves purposively to her handbag. Rummaging through it, she               * finds the House of Bliss flyer, unfolds it and looks at the reassuring photograph of Harry and Duke. 
23    EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CLOSE ON DUKE - DAY                       23 
Posed in an alert stance, Duke breaks into a run, loping gracefully across the lawn to Harry, where he assumes a sitting position upon the command:

23   CONTINUED:    (A1)                                           23 HARRY Duke, platz! (to Joan) Always the name first, and then the command. 
She stands off to the side, repeating the command and studiously writing it down in a small notebook. (CONTINUED) 
23   CONTINUED:                                                   23 HARRY Now, in regard to any   aggressor seeking to give you a   bad time, I want to show you what   you can expect from a dog of   this caliber. 
He takes hold of the dog's muzzle, lifting the lips to reveal the large scimitar-like canines: HARRY Here we have the dog's arsenal, so to speak. The animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed. (releasing the muzzle) If the attacker is bearing a weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a club, a knife or what-have-you, the dog will, excuse me for saying... ("politely" indicating his crotch) ... automatically go for the testicles. JOAN Oh god, what if I don't want him to do that? HARRY You want him to do that. JOAN No, I just want him to scare someone. HARRY Believe   me, this will scare them, as well   as incapacitate their mind and any   ability to maneuver against   you. 
JOAN You know, I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn't... 
HARRY Let me ask you something. I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I'm working with. (CONTINUED)

HARRY (CONT'D) Are you married, single, living alone or with some other party? 
JOAN I'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and... (suddenly mistrustful) But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends. 
HARRY Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher... 
JOAN No, please, don't tell me about that. HARRY Believe me, I know what you're up against, being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are... (flicking his cigarettte away) But we're going to remedy that situation right now, and get you to feeling as safe as a little baby, alright? (indicating her notebook) What've we got there so far? JOAN (reading her notes) Ober, platz, geh am platz, bringen, komm, sitz, fuss', fahrt and blieb.

HARRY (CONT'D) Now let's do a little work with the assailant. 
24   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/EXPANSIVE GARDEN AREA - ON JOAN AND          24 HARRY 
She holds Duke on a short lead, and as they move along a wooded area of the grounds, he leans in close, directing her in confidential tones: HARRY Alright now, Joan, give him the command, 'Duke, wachen sie.' JOAN Duke, wachen sie. HARRY Good.   The dog is now on alert. 
As they walk, Harry glances about, impressed with the appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds: HARRY This is really a nice piece of real estate you've got here. JOAN (tense and distracted) It's not mine, it's my sister's. 
HARRY Oh, it's your sister's. (pause) And where's she? 
JOAN (looking down at Duke) Am I doing this right? Shouldn't I be prepared for something? 
HARRY Never look at your dog. 
(CONTINUED) 
as Harry unzips the attack jacket: 
JUNE You big flirt. 
HARRY Come on, dumpty, don't start that. (removing the jacket) This is quality clientele. It calls for a certain kind of approach. (nods toward the house) Just soak some of this in, will you? He steps past her and goes to the van: JUNE (giving him the finger) Soak this. As he opens the back panel: HARRY Start to pattern yourself. Breed up. (tossing the jacket inside the van) Observe the woman, for Christ sakes. 
JUNE Oh screw her. He closes the back panel and as he moves past her: 
HARRY You don't screw this type of individual. 
JUNE You would. On his way to the driver's door:

ON JUNE grumbling as she moves to the passenger door: 
JUNE Well I don't, he isn't even your dog.

28    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT                           28 Joan, her mood light-hearted, enters, with Duke following. She crosses to the closet, selects a change of clothes and moves to lay them out on the bed. Noting the message light blinking on her answering machine, she steps over to the night-stand, presses the playback and to a series of TONES preceding the recorded messages, MOVES OUT OF FRAME. 
29    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT                          29 The indistinct sounds of a TAPED MESSAGE OVER: Joan turns the tap on in the wash basin and begins splashing water on her face. Then as she reaches to a towel and turns the tap off, the WORDS of a popular ROCK SONG can be heard. Exhibiting some curiosity, she exits the bathroom. 
30    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT                           30 
Joan stands holding the towel over her   mouth, staring down at the answering machine. Issuing    from it, a MAN'S VOICE in an eerily whispered falsetto,   singing the words, "Every breath you take, Every move you   make, I'll be watching you."

Aware of someone watching her, she turns to look through the window. A MAN in an adjacent car is staring at her, and momentarily addresses her with a peculiar request: 
MAN How about a little smile. She quickly faces front and as the light changes, accelerates through the intersecion.

He lies on the lawn, secured to the base of a tree by a long leash. Eddy moves INTO VIEW and stepping over to Duke, leans down as though he intends to pet him: 
HARRY Sure you can, it's just a matter of degree.

JOAN I'm sorry but this is really getting to me. 
He sits down next to her: HARRY Tell you what. Let me take you out of here, buy you a drink, and               * see if we can't get your mind off these kind of things. JOAN That's very sweet of you, Harry. I'd like to do that.

He lights a cigarette. As she reaches to her glass, his eyes follow the motion of her hands. She looks in front the window: JOAN How long have you been divorced? HARRY Oh, I'd say seven or eight years, around there. 
JOAN And so you  like, well, assuming you live a  single existence, I                       * mean most  men don't seem to enjoy that, I've  read. She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back down: HARRY I have to  tell you the truth... (he  pauses) I've been  observing your hands, and I have to  use the word exquisite. JOAN Really?   Well... (CONTINUED)

HARRY You're probably quite a singer too. (looking back to her) I'd like to come down and catch you sometime. 
JOAN Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music? 
HARRY Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off. Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs. HARRY (CONT'D) I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva. JOAN I'm sorry.     I shouldn't have laughed. 
HARRY Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me. JOAN (looking intensely at him) Uhm hmm.

JOAN You're full of surprises, Harry, you know that? That you've actually read Dante's Divine Comedy I mean... HARRY Well, it was a while back there that I did, yeah... JOAN You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.' He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles: 
JOAN (CONT'D) For some reason, the sublimity of that always touches me.

37B   EXT. YAMASHIRO INN/FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT                  37B Joan and Harry come down the steps of the Inn. The sun has gone down and the lights of the city have come on. Under the following they cross the driveway to a low fence railing off an Oriental garden. JOAN You know, it's very sad. I look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life is in, and I think it's very sad and very bleak that men and women can't manage to be friends. HARRY It depends on the man and woman you're talking about. They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings: JOAN What a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship between men and women. HARRY There I disagree with you. 
He places his hand over hers. She remains silent a moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then: JOAN You know Dante and Beatrice never slept together. HARRY Is that right? (catching himself) Oh yeah, I forgot that part. 
JOAN Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here. 
JOAN My piano tuner. 
HELEN Is he weird or something? JOAN Well everyone appears weird to me                         * right now. So I put every                                 * possible name down, except for one, who happens to be post- burglary.

HELEN I already did. JOAN (annoyed) Helen.

(A portion of the Chorus Membership       are seated in chairs, and some, including Eddy Revere and      Helen, show occasional interest in the intense exchange      taking place at the door:) LEWIE I'm extremely concerned about this situation. I don't want you living alone up there. She regards him suspiciously. He modulates his voice to a more persuasive and intimate tone: LEWIE Now come on, wouldn't you feel much safer if you moved back into our house? JOAN No, I wouldn't feel comfortable about doing that. LEWIE Come here... 
He takes hold of her arm and moves her out into the hall: JOAN Darn it, Lewie.

LEWIE (amorously) Why are you resisting? 
JOAN These are very upsetting, really shitty circumstances I'm dealing with and I... 
LEWIE Do you know how hard all this has been on me? Do you think it's that easy for me to admit I want you back? JOAN Couldn't you spare yourself then? LEWIE Are you seeing anybody?   Just tell me that. 
She rolls her eyes, sighing impatiently. LEWIE Come on, you're not the abstinent type. JOAN Please, don't judge me by your scrotal excesses, Lewie. LEWIE I know you're seeing somebody. 
JOAN (suspicious again) Are you spying on me? 
LEWIE Come on. Be open about it. (kisses her on the neck, then) Who is it? (CONTINUED)

JOAN (back to Lewie) Alright, I am seeing someone, okay? He pulls back, narrowing his eyes at her: 
LEWIE I don't believe you.   Who is it?

Joan begins to pour their coffee, glancing inside the house to see... Socorro turning lights out while the indefatigable Duke tries to mount her. Uttering some impatient complaint, she swipes at him with a napkin and the two move OUT OF VIEW THROUGH the kitchen door. JOAN You know, I hate to mention this but we're having a slight problem with Duke. 
HARRY What? JOAN Well... (hands him a cup) He keeps getting up and trying to ride on one's extremities. 
HARRY Oh don't worry about that. (CONTINUED)

HARRY No, that's just normal in most of your adult males. Some percentage of the time they're gonna attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person. He places his arm on the couch behind her: 
HARRY (CONT'D) You just have to be very firm and stay on top of him. In the sky beyond the hills a helicopter beams its light.

He is doing his best              * to emulate her   posture of thoughtful intensity as she listens, but as   he steals a look at her his adult male impulses causes   him to shift about slightly. She looks over at him: JOAN It's not affecting you too much, is it? HARRY No, it's very nice. JOAN It's Chopin, a nocturne. 
HARRY You know what's affecting me?

He slams the door and steps back, angrily glaring at the car. The hydraulic window opens and Moncrief looks out at him: HARRY You're talking to the wrong godammed party, you know that? 
MONCRIEF I think it's in your best interest to hear me out. HARRY No, you hear me out, friend... He takes note of the driver (STURGE) coming around the front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder holster. 
Harry steps over to the window, leans down and communicates in more politic tones: HARRY Look, I happen to have a very high regard for this party. And maybe I even have some feelings of a personal nature here. 
MONCRIEF Well I don't want to appear to be taking unfair advantage of you... (CONTINUED)

Moncrief reaches into a briefcase, takes out a folder and makes reference to its contents as he speaks: 
MONCRIEF But in developing certain information on you, it's come to our attention that your name isn't Harry Bliss. That in fact, your name is Eugene Earl Axline... HARRY Wait a minute. 
MONCRIEF And that both the I.R.S., and an impressive number of creditors in several Eastern cities... (looks up at Harry) ... seem to be somewhat interested in your whereabouts. Harry stands up, leaving the vulnerable area of his stomach framed in the passenger window. When he leans back down, a deeply conflicted expression is apparent on his face: HARRY You know, that's not necessarily entirely accurate, I mean, I don't know where you come up with these so-called facts, but... (at a loss, he looks off, shaking his head) I can't go sneaking around, stealing this lady's property. 
MONCRIEF I'd like to pose that the name and reputation of this very decent man, is not the property of Mrs. Ellerman, or her sister.                       * He takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file aside:

HARRY What do you mean, 'unpleasant'? MONCRIEF I mean that Mr. Layls is prepared to do whatever it takes to confiscate this document.

HARRY Okay, just let me drive the goddamned car, that's all I ask. 
JOAN Why should I let you drive? HARRY Why? I'll tell you why, because you're a terrible driver, that's why. 
JOAN Oh, now all the ugly little truths are coming out. HARRY You operate this vehicle like it was a cane with a red tip painted on the end of it. 
JOAN Don't talk to me, Harry. I mean it, just don't say another word to me! 
He angrily folds his arms across his chest, assuming a sullen silence for a moment. The traffic has come to a grid-lock stop, raising their anxiety levels: JOAN (CONT'D) I was doing just fine until you started in on me... 
HARRY (gesturing at the ax) Driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car... JOAN And now look at me.   I've got purpose tremors... 
He suddenly opens the door, gets out and moves to the ax handle. Joan watches as he makes several unsuccessful attempts to pull the ax out of the hood of the car.

Joan moves quickly through the parking lot and onto a walkway leading to the hospital entrance. Harry, trailing behind, calls up to her: HARRY Can I at least offer some advice? JOAN No. HARRY Good. Just barge into  the place, honey, and play the big hero. (pauses for a response) When he tells you your sister's not there, what're you going to do, cry? She stops walking and as he moves up beside her, looks defiantly at him: 
JOAN Okay.   What?

As they edge past a laundry cart outside a utility room, Harry releases her hand. She moves ahead, then experiencing a sudden loss of nerve, stops and looks back to see Harry rummaging through the dirty laundry. 
84    INT. M.P. CENTER/HALLWAY - NIGHT                             84 Harry, in a white doctor's jacket, with Joan at his side, move through a corridor. As she glances nervously about, then at him: JOAN This isn't going to work.   You look like a busboy. They approach a nurses' station and Harry steps forward to address one of TWO NURSES behind the counter: HARRY Excuse me, Nurse... 
LONG SHOT ON Harry, Joan and Nurse One. Presently the Nurse ges- tures to a stairwell leading to the second floor. Joan and Harry move in the direction indicated.

Moving into the stairwell.

BACK TO SCENE Harry takes her by the arm and looks amiably toward the Nurse. 
HARRY Which way? 
NURSE ONE                           * (gesturing a direction) That way, Doctor, and thank you very much for your patience. 
HARRY Don't mention it. The Nurse watches briefly as they move away, then extracting a key from her pocket, she steps over to the door and locks it. 
87   EXT. M.P. CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                         87 Harry, outside the Mercedes, glancing around furtively, while inside the car, Andy continues to perseverate about Red Layls as she struggles out of Joan's clothes: ANDY And this man, who wouldn't know the truth if it came up and spit him in the eye, is accusing me of lying... She hands him the skirt out through the window: 
ANDY You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me? 
Harry lays the skirt on the hood of the car and begins getting out of the doctor's jacket. ANDY That I   was a pretty, grudge- bearing   little malcontent, grasping at some   splinter of celebrity for myself   at his expense. Can you believe   that? She hands him out the blouse and he turns politely away from her semi-nudity as he hands her the doctor's jacket. 
HARRY Here, put this on. ANDY I mean, the arrogance... (getting into the jacket) What did she say your name was? 
HARRY Harry. 
ANDY (flirtatiously) Have you got a cigarette, Harry? 
He takes a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from his shirt pocket and hands them to her: HARRY Stay in the car. Don't talk to anybody, and I'll be right back. 
He immediately moves off, rolling Joan's clothes into a bundle and heading back to the hospital grounds.

89   EXT. M.P. CENTER - REAR - NIGHT                              89 Harry rounds the corner of the hospital building and stops: Two male hospital employees are smoking and conversing outside the door he had previously entered with Joan. 
HARRY Fuck! He turns and moves OUT OF SIGHT. 
90   INT. M.P. CENTER/ANDY'S ROOM - NIGHT                         90 
Joan, in a state of extreme nervousness, paces about the room. Her perambulations bring her near the door to the hallway. She reaches to the doorknob, tests it and finds she is locked in. 
JOAN Christ. A soft WHISTLE comes from the vicinity of the windows behind her, followed by Harry's voice, whispering: HARRY (O.S.) Joan?   Are you there? 
She crosses quickly to the windows, looking out through the thick wire mesh at Harry: 
HER POV He stands several feet below, looking up at the window. 
HARRY Is that you?

JOAN Yes, it's me.    Hurry up, will you!

JOAN Don't worry, honey... 
JOAN You have to get me out of here! HARRY Everything's under control, just hang on a few more minutes and I'll be right back, okay? As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open, she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it.

JOAN As a matter of fact, she happens to be on her way to the police right now, accompanied by a close friend of mine... Her bluff is immediately belied by: 
HARRY (O.S.) Honey?    It's me again. Moncrief and Joan look toward the window: 
HARRY (O.S.) I have to tell you something. Joan jumps from the bed and moves to address Harry: JOAN Don't say a word, Harry!       I'm not alone! Moncrief looks at the chauffeur, gesturing toward the door. MONCRIEF Sturge. Sturge exits to the hallway, leaving the door open.

JOAN Just go get Andy and leave, will you! HARRY That's what I'm trying to tell you... MONCRIEF I'm a little disappointed to find you defaulting on our agreement. 
95   INT. M.P. CENTER/ ANDY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                 95 Joan looks from Moncrief to Harry: JOAN What agreement? 
POV - HARRY 
HARRY (to Moncrief) Bullshit! I never agreed to anything! (to Joan) This asshole approached me and tried to bribe me into working for them, and I told him to go to hell! 
ON MONCRIEF

HARRY Honey, don't go by anything this guy says, because I'm the only one who knows what the hell I'm doing. (pulls the envelope from his back pocket) It just slipped my mind, I was going to tell you. (holds it up) See? I never cashed the fucking thing! 
He tears the envelope in half and as he throws it on the ground, a hand the size of a large dictionary reaches INTO FRAME and grabs him roughly by the back of his shirt collar.

In the b.g. the old man can be seen leaning down to the walkway, picking up the stingy-brim hat and returning it to his head. She turns from the window to see a subdued Andy entering, her eyes showing signs of recent weeping. Behind her in the hall, Moncrief can be seen greeting Red Layls. 
Joan moves over to her... JOAN Are you alright? ... And in response to Andy's stoical nod: 
JOAN No you're not. (embracing her) What did that bastard do to you? 
RED Sit down. I have a neck condition and it aggravates me to have to look up at you. 
HARRY Okay.   No problem. As he seats himself in the other chair, Red reaches up and takes a glass of tea offered by Moncrief: 
HARRY (CONT'D) But I want to go on and finish my thought on this, because... (CONTINUED)

RED (holds the glass up to Moncrief) More sugar. 
ON JOAN AND ANDY 
JOAN And furthermore, this 'sensitive' man's lawyer more than implied they were willing to put your feet, as well as probably mine, into a block of cement! ANDY Oh that's just all talk... (calling over to Moncrief) Would somebody please get me my clothes! 
ON HARRY AND RED 
(In the b.g., Sturge exits on another flunky errand.) RED Just put yourself, Harry, for a moment, in the shoes of a man whose sole intention is to leave the world a better place than he found it, only to discover those intentions have been painfully slandered by someone he'd given both his heart and his economic support to, not to mention his trust...

looking over at Harry, protesting loudly: 
JOAN Harry, I can't believe you're sitting there nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks! HARRY I'm not nodding my head, honey, I'm just listening to the man. 
ON ANDY as Harry, in the b.g., resumes his exchange with Red: ANDY Who is this guy, anyway? Isn't he a little sleazy, Joanie, a bit infra dig? I mean Lewie's a bit of a stiff, but... 
JOAN You're going to talk to me about sleaze, when you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon, who was flicking his tongue out at me like some rutting iguana, and groping at his naturalia at three in the morning?! 
ANDY Oh, 'him.' 
She looks to the chauffeur, re-entering with her clothes. JOAN Oh 'him'?!   He came at me with an ax!

I was dealing a couple of dogs to Paul Anka. (shakes his hand) I was about to give you a call. LEE Don't embarrass us both, man. Just give me the dog back, and let's preserve the friendship. 
ON HARRY AND LEE 
as they move over to Lee's van: HARRY Lee, I'm in the neighborhood of getting my hands on the money. I'm about to close a business deal with Vark Zulethian of Zulethian Carpets, you've probably heard of him... LEE Come on, I know these dodges backwards and forwards. I need the dog. He's up for a TV series. They stop beside the van. Harry glances at the printing on the side panel: Lee MacGreevy - Trainer of "Duke," - The World's Smartest Dog. LEE (O.S.)

You sold me the animal, then as a personal favor, I let you borrow him, to demo to some V.I.P.. that probably don't even exist. You haven't been straight with me, man. (hands him the leash) Just go get the dog. 
ON DUKE AND HARRY as they come across the parking lot to Lee's van.    Harry hands him the leash and Lee addresses Duke: 
LEE (CONT'D) Get in. He ignores the command and looks at Harry: HARRY Duke, geh im wagen. Duke jumps into the back of the van. Inside is a large wire travel kennel with another German shepherd inside. Lee removes the leash from Duke and gestures at the other dog: LEE Why don't you take this dog, Harry. He's green, but maybe you could do something with him. He opens the cage and clips the leash to the dog's collar. 
HARRY No, I don't want the dog. 
The shepherd jumps out to the ground, wagging his tail: LEE (giving him the leash) Go ahead, man. Take him. If you don't want him, pick up some change. (closing the van) Sell him for a pet. 
As Lee starts to walk past him, Harry detains him, indi- cating the words on the side panel of the van:

123A   CONTINUED:                                                        123A A frantic free-for-all takes place on the precarious footing of the hillside, with Joan alternately pulling at one and pushing at the other. The intensity and violence of their struggle is such that she is knocked further down the incline. Harry, quickly glances down the hill to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car. 
Harry pursues him, catching him as he tries to get into the car. He pushes him against the door and they begin battering each other with a series of punches. 
The SHEPHERD, wanting to join in the excitement, leaps about them, BARKING joyously. Then finding Eddy's sleeve, he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it vigorously. 
Joan, her hair fretted   with twigs, climbs up over the edge of the hill. In    the b.g. behind her, a HELICOPTER APPROACHES. She looks    toward Harry and Eddy trading blows, then climbs up   the rest of the way, and as she gets to her feet, she   picks up a stone and throws it at them, yelling: 
JOAN You bastards!! The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above: VOICE (from above) What are you people doing down there? 
Joan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations, starts to move toward Joan: 
HARRY Are you crazy?! What are you doing, running around with a guy like this!! 
She raises her arm, ready to hurl the last stone: 
JOAN You maniacs!!    You liars!!   You shits!! (CONTINUED) 
123A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             123A HARRY What are you yelling at me for?! This son of a bitch is probably the Westside Slasher! 
124    INT. HELICOPTER - VIEW OUT WINDOW - NIGHT                     124 
of the circling HELICOPTER: A man, holding onto a life- less body, seems to be stalking toward a woman in a defensive stance, standing on the edge of the hill with a stone in her hand. MAN It looks like a domestic quarrel. Let's get a car up here quick. 
BACK TO HARRY AND JOAN She is yelling at him: JOAN I'm finished wagging my tail and leaving little puddles on the floor...!! HARRY Wait a minute, honey... JOAN And smiling on command, because I don't give a damn whether any of you like me or not!!! VOICE (from above) Are you alright, ma'am? HARRY (yelling up at the copter) Yeah, she's alright!! I've got him!! (gesturing at Eddy) The Westside Slasher, I got him!! 
JOAN He's not the Westside Slasher!! 
VOICE                            JOAN (from above)                 He's a friend of mine!! Just stand where you are, buddy. 
(CONTINUED) 
124   CONTINUED:                                                       124 HARRY A friend of yours! This guy's a friend of yours?! JOAN None of you are friends of mine, you fucker!! 
VOICE (from above) Ma'am, is this guy bothering you? 
They both yell up into the blinding light of the search beam: 
JOAN                                HARRY Will you shut up!!                  I'm not bothering her, godammit, I love her!! Harry lets go of Eddy and leans down to pick up the knife, gesturing it at the helicopter: HARRY Look, you assholes! The guy was holding a knife at her throat!! VOICE (from above) Okay, put the knife down, fellow. Then to Joan again, taking a step toward her: HARRY What were you doing, kissing this guy!? 
JOAN I wasn't kissing him!! VOICE (from above) Stand where you are, and put down the knife. 
ON JOAN Perceiving the danger to Harry: 
JOAN Put the knife down, Harry! (CONTINUED)

124   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             124 HARRY (to the copter) Why don't you go harass someone else!! VOICE (CONT'D) (from above) We've got a bead on you, so just put it down. Terrified that they are going to shoot him, she moves over to Harry: VOICE (CONT'D) (from above) Stay where you are, don't go near him. HARRY (to the copter) I just saved her life, you son of bitches!! JOAN Give me that thing. She grabs the knife out of his hand, throws it away, then places her arms around him, desperately pantomiming to the helicopter: JOAN See? He's not hurting me! He's my friend!! (then, to Harry) This is just for their benefit. VOICE (from above) Don't touch her, buddy. HARRY But that's what I am, honey, your friend, that's what I wanted to tell you, and then I saw you with this guy... 
VOICE (from above) Don't worry, lady, we've got a car on the way.

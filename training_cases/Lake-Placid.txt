ANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND 
clenching around Keough's arm. 
ANGLE WALT'S FACE 
He knows he's done.  OFF Keough's continued horror, we: 
CUT TO: 
BLACK AND WHITE 
A DINOSAUR (T-Rex) is angry and out for blood. 
REVEAL 
INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY 
We're watching an old classic creature feature.  FIND Kelly alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie. As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the popcorn bag and her mouth. 
ANGLE THE SCREEN 
The monster pursues its human victim. 
ANGLE KELLY 
fear on her face. 
ANGLE THE SCREEN 
The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey. 
ANGLE KELLY 
as she screams with fear and delight.  Her scream is only partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers. 
After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.  Wearing gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.  Then from behind a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with the most blood-curdling scream of all. 
All the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE: 
MYRA OKUBO 
Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY 
Kelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater. 
KELLY What do you expect, mugging me from behind? 
OKUBO I tapped you. 
KELLY Well you shouldn't have.  How did you even know where I was. 
OKUBO (sarcastic) Wild guess. 
KELLY I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me. 
OKUBO Kevin told me you were upset. 
KELLY Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else? 
OKUBO (sheepish) Well... he didn't have to tell me that part. 
Kelly freezes.  Stares at her.  Then: 
KEOUGH Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here. 
KELLY You have a thing against museums? 
KEOUGH I got nothing against-- 
KELLY Ever even been in one? 
He stares back.  Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun.  As he loads it-- 
KELLY What is that? 
KEOUGH Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead. 
KELLY (incredulous) And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia? 
A beat. 
KEOUGH You're sort of a rude person. 
KELLY It's just that-- 
Suddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a white fog from a can of Yard Guard.  Keough holds a look at her. 
KELLY (CONT'D) Mosquitos.  I have a thing about mosquitos. 
Upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "Maine Fish And Game".  Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like radar. 
JACK We set? 
KEOUGH Ready. (re Kelly; dry) A museum in New York sent us some additional back up. 
Kelly shoots Keough a look.  Then: 
KELLY Kelly Scott. 
JACK Jack Wells.  A museum sent you? 
KELLY Are we all museum bigots in Maine? 
Jack holds a look, decides to let that pass. 
JACK Did you make anything of the tooth? 
KELLY Yes, it did seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it worked, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body. 
Jack holds another look. 
KELLY (CONT'D) Why are you staring at me? (to Keough) Do I have a smudge on my face, it would be so you not to have told me. 
Keough also lets that pass. 
KEOUGH (to Jack) I'm ready when you are. 
JACK Let's go. 
As they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm. 
KELLY Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a small point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in. 
JACK Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well. 
As JANINE POST, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up. 
JANINE Excuse me?  Is it true you're going to look for some kind of monster in Black Lake? 
KEOUGH We're just going to investigate an accident.  There's no monster. 
KELLY (to Jack) Gee. 
Jack smiles, gets her sarcasm. 
KEOUGH The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up. 
KELLY (what?) We're staying in tents? 
KEOUGH I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp. 
KELLY Yes, camp, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets? 
KEOUGH (seeing something) What the hell? 
Keough's attention has been otherwise arrested.  He sees something in the water. 
KELLY What? 
KEOUGH (slowing the boat) I thought I saw... 
KELLY It looks like a branch. 
He leans over to grab something floating in the water.  Looks like a branch.  He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler. Connected to the severed head of a moose.  Keough, seeing it as he lifts it, screams, throwing it. 
It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD.  Kelly rears back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder. 
KEOUGH Hey!! 
KELLY You threw it at me!! 
KEOUGH (denying) I just let go of it. 
KELLY                       JACK You threw it at me!!       Alright. (to Jack) Did you see that? 
She belts him again. 
KEOUGH                      JACK (CONT'D) Stop hitting me!           Ma'am! 
KELLY Don't throw heads at me, (to Jack) and stop calling me "Ma'am"! 
ANGLE THE HEAD 
RESUME 
A beat.  This head looks ripped off the body. 
JACK What is going on here? 
EXT. BEACHSIDE CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER 
A small tent camp is being set up.  People unpacking.  Two Deputies, BURKE and STEPHENS, present.  Kelly is with Jack. 
KELLY How big do the bears get? 
JACK Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water.  On land maybe.  But... 
KELLY And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow? 
JACK Hank says he's sure. 
Kelly takes in the scenic surroundings. 
KELLY It really is beautiful, isn't it? 
JACK Never been to Maine before? 
KELLY I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. (off Jack) I never believed it. 
KELLY                KEOUGH (flaring)             (frustrated) I have not.           Who is this man? 
HECTOR Hector Cyr, I said it once, let me know when it sinks in, (to Kelly) have you seen it? 
KELLY                      KEOUGH (CONT'D) No.                        Mister... 
KELLY (CONT'D) It couldn't be a crocodile. 
HECTOR They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,-- 
KEOUGH (frustrated) Mr. Cyr! 
HECTOR C'mon, we're losing light, (to Kelly) why does the big one heckle me? 
Kelly yanks him aside. 
KELLY (sotto) Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self. 
HECTOR That hurt my feelings. 
And it did a little.  Hector is a big Teddy Bear. 
JACK (arriving) If we're gonna go we better go. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAKE - SUNSET 
Keough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside in another.  Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar devices.  The calm.  The still.  The beauty. 
HECTOR If he's here, I'll find him. (to Jack, re Kelly) Did she tell you we had sex together? 
KELLY I never had sex with you! 
HECTOR Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage. 
KEOUGH I really don't mean to be discourteous. (patronizing) But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England? 
HECTOR They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time. 
KEOUGH And what would he do come winter? 
HECTOR They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive, (to Kelly) am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name? 
KELLY                    KEOUGH (scolding)          Hey. Hector. 
HECTOR (to Keough) Is this where it happened? 
KEOUGH Around here.  Yeah. 
HECTOR (knows his crocodiles) If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source. 
KELLY But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway. 
HECTOR 'Cept he wasn't before, was he? (then to Keough) You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat. 
KELLY Hector. 
Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty feet away. 
JACK What's that? 
KEOUGH White perch. 
JACK Are they feeding? 
KEOUGH Doesn't look like it. 
Hector gives the toe to Keough, then heads off.  Keough stands there, holding the tow, as we: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT 
Kelly is testing a MACHINE that sends out little SQUEAKY SOUNDS, as Jack approaches.  He stops.  Takes a second to... well, admire her.  She's an attractive woman.  He then approaches. 
JACK Baby crocs? 
KELLY Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there... 
JACK If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible? 
KELLY Because they just consult their little indigenous charts. 
A beat, as she tends to her work. 
JACK Listen... if you really do know crocs, you should know how stealth like they are.  I wouldn't be standing a foot from the water. 
She looks. 
JACK (CONT'D) He could be right there and you wouldn't see him. 
KELLY (still looking at the water) I'd be able to see something. 
Upon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder.  As it makes a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms. Then: 
KELLY (CONT'D) (realizing) Oh that's funny.  That was real funny. 
And she heads off.  OFF Jack, we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HECTOR'S TENT - NIGHT 
Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of his tent.  From within we HEAR MUSIC, the SOUNDS of a PARTY. Keough approaches... looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging. 
BURKE (shrugs) He paid us.  Five hundred. 
Keough continues on toward the tent. 
INT. HECTOR'S TENT - CONTINUOUS 
His tent is on the palatial side.  Stereo, generator, he's got a margarita bar going.  There's a party.  Hector's dancing with Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC. 
HECTOR You're a beautiful woman. 
GARE Thank you. 
HECTOR And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity. 
Upon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees. 
KEOUGH Hey. 
He goes, turns OFF the MUSIC. 
KEOUGH We are here on official business. 
HECTOR Cocktail? 
KEOUGH No!! (then) What's with digging the holes? 
HECTOR They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it. 
KEOUGH Everybody out, back to your tents, now! 
JACK (feels bad now) I'm sorry but you're... 
A beat. He doesn't finish the sentence. 
KELLY (genuine) I do know crocodiles and I won't get in your way. (then) I really do want to be a part of this. 
Jack reads her, he can see that she does. 
JACK Okay. (then) We're up at six. 
KELLY Good. 
JACK (a beat) 'Night. 
There's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny it.  He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book.  She gives one last look, watches him go.  Then she goes back to her book. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LAKE - MUCH LATER 
The lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet. The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT.  CRICKETS.  A LOON.  An OWL.  A courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage.  By the water... a black bear takes a drink. 
ANGLE KEOUGH'S TENT 
He emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his trousers, carrying a revolver.  He walks into the nearby woods. He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the outside world.  Proceeds to URINATE.  Then... he hears something.  The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES.  He STOPS URINATING, we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT.  Then quiet.  Must be his imagination.  He RESUMES his business. 
More RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness. Quiet.  He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it for sure.  Something's RUSTLING TOWARDS him.  With his free hand, Keough pulls out his revolver.  More RUSTLING... Keough points the gun.  Something on the ground is coming toward him. He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.  The RUSTLING is getting LOUDER.  It's almost upon him.  A beat.  CLOSER. CLOSER.  Then Keough peels away a bush revealing: 
HECTOR 
Looking into a gun barrel.  He screams.  Keough screams.  Then-- 
HECTOR Jesus Christ!! 
KEOUGH What the hell are you doing?!! 
HECTOR What are you doing?! 
KEOUGH You're crawling around like a-- 
HECTOR I'm laying a spring trap! 
KEOUGH A spring trap! 
HECTOR I keep telling you, they can come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night-- 
KEOUGH I coulda shot you, you-- 
HECTOR This could end up saving your life,-- 
HECTOR (CONT'D)                  KEOUGH You'll be glad you didn't    Hey look, I'm sure you shoot me then, you'll be     finished first in your tongue massaging my          class but I think you need hemorrhoids, just before     to be retired to the big rubber running off to get your      room, where you can play with sister pregnant, who you     soft stuffed reptiles. probably already call mom. 
And now all the others, awakened, are charging. 
KELLY (arriving) Hey!  What is going on? 
HECTOR                    KEOUGH This man takes a pistol     He's crawling around-- to pee! 
KEOUGH (CONT'D) (escalating) This is an official investigation, and this cuckoo bird is a civilian. I don't care how much money he's got, he's a total mental. 
And Hector storms off.  A beat. 
KELLY You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize. 
KEOUGH Apologize? 
KELLY                   KEOUGH (CONT'D) We're a team here.  It     He's a fruitcake! won't kill you to get along. 
JACK Good. (climbing over) See ya soon. 
KELLY Good luck. 
There was a twinge of real concern in her voice.  He makes eye contact with her.  Then drops over.  Goes under. 
HECTOR (to Kelly) Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count. 
KELLY What? (off Hector's look) Oh as if I'm interested. 
HECTOR As if. (as he's about to go overboard; to Keough) Will you miss me? 
KEOUGH (to Hector) I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck. 
HECTOR No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log. 
And Hector drops overboard. 
KEOUGH (to Kelly) Was that like a homo-sexual remark? 
KELLY (strict) I asked you to be nice to him. 
Keough rolls his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNDERWATER - ANGLE ON JACK - DAY 
Jack, diving.  We HEAR the HIGH PITCH of CROCODILE HATCHLINGS. Visibility is again pretty limited. 
EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON HECTOR - UNDERWATER - DAY 
Hector dives through the dark black water.  Visibility is lousy. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - THIRTY MINUTES LATER 
Jack dives, searched.  Looks ahead, sees something... He moves closer... it's the carcass of the moose, no head. 
EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER 
Kelly and Keough onboard. 
KELLY He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped. 
KEOUGH And that's why he thinks they're Godly? 
KELLY He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes. 
KEOUGH (simple) You like Jack? 
KELLY (thrown) What?  I don't even know the guy. 
KEOUGH Hector thinks you like him. 
KELLY Well Hector's a giant cracker. 
KEOUGH You think Jack's handsome? 
KELLY What is this? 
KEOUGH I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome? 
KELLY Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah. 
A beat. 
KEOUGH Am I? 
ANGLE KELLY 
KELLY Hurry up!! 
Suddenly about thirty feet away... we SEE fish breaking water. 
KELLY (CONT'D) Shit!!  Hank!! 
The boat is zooming toward her.  It arrives.  As Keough and Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising. 
BURKE (screaming) Look out!! 
And Jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow.  Keough and Burke pull them both aboard. 
KEOUGH (back to Kelly) Are you alright? 
KELLY I think.  My hair. (then) Where's Hector?! (to Jack) Where is he? 
JACK We went in different directions. That water is thick, you can't see through it! 
EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
Hector is swimming toward the surface.  Suddenly... a shadow looms over him.  He looks up. 
HIS P.O.V. 
There is no boat.  We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass. 
RESUME HECTOR 
He's scared. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS 
KEOUGH (into headset) Hector!  Hector, we got dragged off position, when you surface, you gotta yell. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
Hector is still charging toward the surface.  The lack of visibility is frightening, something could be six feet away and he wouldn't know it. 
EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS 
KELLY (pointing) There's bubbles over there!  Look! 
Keough quickly maneuvers the boat to where Kelly indicated, under-- 
KELLY (CONT'D) There he is.  Here he comes! 
And Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface. 
And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on Hector as they lean over to rescue him.  On the far right... two eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers. 
Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector, Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see Hector.  If only he knew what he's not seeing.  The eyes come closer.  They're now in the water right below Burke's head.  How can he not see it?  A beat.  Another beat.  Then... suddenly, a mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water-- snap.  And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body hangs over the boat.  Kelly screams in horror. 
In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone.  OFF their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET 
Burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance.  People move in silence, the wake of tragedy.  A few State Troopers are on the scene. 
KEOUGH (giving a statement) Nobody actually saw it.  It happened sudden. 
PAN TO FIND Kelly, staring almost blankly, as Jack, finishing a phone call, approaches.  He measures her expression, she's still in shock. 
She just stares out as if she didn't hear.  And he fixes his own stare on her.  Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at her, he diverts the stare.  She feigns a non-reaction.  A beat. 
JACK (CONT'D) You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion. 
KELLY Excuse me? 
JACK When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's... (a beat) in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie. 
KELLY What are you talking about? 
JACK I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good. 
KELLY Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist. 
JACK Forgive me for trying to be nice. 
KELLY Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good. 
JACK I didn't say it like that. 
KELLY You did, you-- 
JACK I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science. 
KELLY A man just died, you're hitting on me with science. 
JACK Just forget it. 
HECTOR (arriving) Beg pardon?  Sorry to intrude but Hank seems to have gotten himself stuck in a tree. 
EXT. CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER 
Hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly, and Jack approach. 
HECTOR I probably could've accomplished freeing him myself but he had a look of mayhem on his upside down face. 
They arrive.  Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still. 
KELLY Hank? 
KEOUGH (calmly) Yes. 
The three exchange looks. 
KELLY Are you okay? 
KEOUGH (calmly; almost sweet) Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine. (then) Could you cut me down? 
HECTOR Promise you won't kill me, first. 
KEOUGH (calmly) I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector. (again) Could you please cut me down? 
Jack gives Kelly a knife. 
JACK You cut, we'll hold him. 
Hector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the ground.  He rises. 
KEOUGH (calm) Thank you. (then) I lied. 
And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach.  Keough chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him.  And suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging GROWL.  An attack.  Screams all over, a half-second of confusion before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the darkness, right at Hector.  Hector dives out of its path. Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs. Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water the giant jaws of a crocodile. 
In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it, slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water. 
The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only be one outcome here.  In a matter of seconds, both bear and crocodile have vanished.  And the water is calm again. 
ANGLE THE FACES 
KELLY I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. (then) That bear had to be surprised. 
JACK (taking her arm; ushering) Let's get away from the shore. 
She looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self- consious. 
JACK (CONT'D) Sorry. 
KELLY It's okay. 
They hold a look. 
EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT 
We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake.  A four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly unpassable dirt road into the clearing. 
TOM (O.S.) Told you I could make it. 
As the jeep comes more INTO VIEW, we REVEAL its occupants to be six teenagers, including Janine, and TOM, STEVE, DANNY, CAROL, ELLEN.  They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk.  As they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from the branch of a tree that overhangs the water. 
TOM There it is. 
STEVE (stripping) Last one in's a dead man. 
Could be more like first one in.  The teenagers begin to strip off their clothes.  As they giggle and laugh we: 
CUT TO: 
INT. KELLY'S TENT - NIGHT 
Kelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very close to him. 
JACK Ow.  Shit. 
KELLY Just gotta pull it a little tighter. 
JACK Who taught you be be a nurse? 
KELLY Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here. 
JACK No thanks. 
KELLY Keep it dry.  No swimming. 
JACK (dry) Thank you. 
They hold a look.  Then -- 
JACK (CONT'D) You're having the best time of your life, aren't you? 
KELLY (caught) What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would... (off his look; copping) Does it show? 
Jack nods slightly. 
KELLY (CONT'D) This is the first time I've actually... y'know been in the middle of anything.  I've never really even gotten dirty before, with me showers have always been preventative. 
Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and nervous. 
JACK That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something? 
KELLY Maybe.  I've always read about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening. 
Something is happening right now.  A beat. 
KELLY (CONT'D) We should probably go to bed. (quickly) Get rest, get some rest.  Go to our separate beds, get some rest. 
The Freudian slip of her life.  They hold another look.  Then he starts to exit.  He stops at the door, turns back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
Hector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams are on. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON JANINE 
JANINE He just took him in his jaws. 
REVEAL 
EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT 
The teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on. Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting the water.  Lying on the beach, covered... is Tommy.  Alive. And basically unhurt! 
KEOUGH He was in his mouth?! 
JANINE Yes. 
JACK (stunned; to Tommy) You're okay? 
TOMMY (in shock) I think; just cuts. 
DANNY The thing just came up out of the water and kind of spit him at us. 
JANINE You should have signs posted, for God's sake! 
JACK (examining him) You're really okay? 
Tommy nods.  Then-- 
TOMMY I might need a Tetanus. 
Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief. 
EXT. CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER 
Hector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward their tents. 
HECTOR Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know? 
KEOUGH (dismissive) He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear. 
HECTOR Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God-- 
KEOUGH I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me. 
HECTOR That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful. (then) Nightcap? 
KEOUGH Raincheck. 
They're growing on each other.  Jack and Kelly exchange a smile. Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost.  They continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent. 
JACK Well.  Goodnight. 
KELLY We seem to say goodnight a lot. 
JACK We could not say it and... (suddenly a coward) Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to... 
She smiles.  Then: 
KELLY Night. 
He holds another look.  She goes into her tent.  He stands there.  A beat.  Waits to see if she calls him back.  She doesn't.  He then heads off.  Her head pops out.  Watches him go.  Almost calls after him.  Doesn't. 
KELLY Thing we can lift it? 
JACK Maybe.  Don't mush it. 
KELLY (annoyed) I'm not mushing it. 
JACK You're mushing it a little around the-- 
KELLY I'm not mushing it. 
Suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all of them, but particularly Kelly who jumps.  Her foot lands on a long extended branch, and even more suddenly Burke's severed head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin. She screams as they all jump back. 
ANGLE THE HEAD 
RESUME 
They just stare, as Kelly continues to scream. 
JACK (holding her) Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
KELLY That is it!! 
JACK Really-- 
KELLY No.  I keep getting hit with heads! 
JACK (holding her shoulders) Calm down. 
KELLY You calm down! 
JACK Calm down. 
She takes a couple of calming breaths. 
KELLY I'm being very calm.  I'm composed. This is the second time I've been hit with a severed head, I'm entitled to complain. 
STEVENS (re the head) Is that uh... 
KEOUGH I can't recognize him from the back.  It looks like him. 
Keough takes a stick.  Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head, trying to turn it over. 
ANGLE THE HEAD 
It is Burke. 
RESUME 
Keough leans in for a closer look. 
KEOUGH That's him. (re something) What the...? 
Something appears to be in his mouth.  Keough takes a small twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms. 
KEOUGH (CONT'D) Now I'm gonna puke. 
JACK (seeing something) You gotta be kidding. 
KELLY What? 
JACK (pointing) Look. 
THEIR P.O.V. 
About a hundred yards north, Mrs. Bickerman is leading a blindfolded cow to the water. 
RESUME 
GARE (getting panicked) C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't-- 
HECTOR I need to see his habitat. 
As he drops in. 
GARE Please.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water. 
HECTOR He's not gonna hurt me. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Kelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman. 
BICKERMAN Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  No.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile... 
KEOUGH You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest. 
BICKERMAN Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat. 
GARE (O.S.) (through walkie-talkie) Hank!  We got a problem with Hector. 
KEOUGH (into walkie-talkie) What problem? 
GARE (O.S.) 
(through walkie-talkie) He went swimming. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
Hector is underwater, exploring. 
ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER 
Her radar is up, she heard something.  But she doesn't see anything.  She scans the surface closely. 
EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head for the surface.  He swims upward. 
EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS 
Hector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim. The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other way, upon which his face goes rigid. 
HIS P.O.V. 
About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at him. 
ANGLE HECTOR 
ashen. 
HECTOR (weakly) Oh.... my. 
The croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling any spiritual voids.  A beat. 
HECTOR (CONT'D) I suddenly feel a bit foolish. (then) You're different from the others. 
The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  And his deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for. To be judged by this symbol of mythology. 
He backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly, their eyes are locked.  He could snap off Hector's head in an instant. 
HECTOR (CONT'D) (terrified; trying to convince himself) Holy spirit of Sobek.  Holy ghost. (swallows) Holy shit. 
The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  Gare FIRES her REVOLVER.  It might as well shoot BB's.  The croc is undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 
Jack is nearly manhandling Hector, pulling him by the elbow towards his tent.  Kelly and Keough are there too. 
JACK (livid) This time, I'm gonna kick your ass. 
HECTOR Bastard bit my chopper. 
JACK Hey!! 
Jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point.  Hector yelps in pain. 
JACK (CONT'D) You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide? 
KELLY Alright, Jack! 
JACK No! (back to Hector) You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and-- 
HECTOR (flaring) Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe-- 
JACK 'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid-- 
KELLY Jack! 
HECTOR I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority-- 
KEOUGH I can arrest you!! 
HECTOR Then do it!! 
KEOUGH You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker. 
HECTOR So profound and fat. 
Hector, feelings hurt, stomps off again.  Kelly looks at Jack. Then Kelly follows Hector. 
INT. HECTOR'S TENT - A MINUTE LATER 
Hector enters, sits.  A beat.  Kelly enters, goes to sit next to him. 
KELLY (softly) Did you want to be killed by it? 
HECTOR You think I'm that nuts? 
KELLY (softly) Hector. (then) What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on. 
HECTOR Nothing's real. 
KELLY Excuse me? 
HECTOR Nothing's real. (escalating) I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and-- 
He's sounding erratic. 
HECTOR (CONT'D) With crocodiles... everything's even. 
KELLY I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than-- 
HECTOR (pained) I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack-- 
KELLY Oh, bullshit. 
And Hector drops the act. 
JACK So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to-- 
HECTOR We both know what they'll do. 
Silence.  Admission by silence.  Then-- 
JACK Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land. 
KEOUGH Other than to eat us? 
HECTOR He follows anything that moves. You guys can be in the trucks with tranq guns.  If he charges, drive off, plus Hank you've got your hand- held cannon.  We could do this with no safety risk.  If it works, we save a beast that should be saved. 
A beat.  They are sympathetic to the idea. 
JACK And again.  How would you get him on land? 
HECTOR That's actually the easy part. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BICKERMAN'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER 
We HEAR the CHOPPER. 
BICKERMAN (to Keough) I'll sue you. 
KEOUGH Go ahead. 
And up goes Hector's chopper.  And... REVEAL connected to a long cable... a cow.  An airborne cow, dangling from the chopper. 
BICKERMAN (to Jack) You can't take a cow by eminent domain. 
JACK We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am. 
BICKERMAN You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers. 
Jack turns to Kelly. 
JACK Are we crazy? 
KELLY Well... 
JACK We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter. 
She shrugs. 
KEOUGH Let's get back to camp. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
Hector pilots. 
HECTOR Not much drag.  As long as I can keep him from swinging, we're okay. 
EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS 
Hector's chopper is flying the befuddled animal toward the cove. FIND Keough, Kelly, and Jack on the water cruising back to camp. Keough has his gun. 
EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 
Two pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage. Kelly, Jack, Keough.  Riflemen are ready with tranq guns. 
ANGLE JACK 
JACK (into headset) Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim. 
Sure enough... that giant snout breaks the surface.  Ever so calmly... it moves toward the cow. 
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
KELLY (into walkie-talkie) If he gets close, you go up, Hector, don't you endanger that cow. 
KEOUGH She's worried about the cow now. 
HECTOR (O.S.) (through walkie-talkie) He's following.  Here we come. 
ANGLE THE RADAR SCREEN 
Depicting the same. 
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
JACK (to Hector) Nice and slow. (to the others) Let's get ready. 
Hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore. Behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc.  Back on the shore, Keough's men ready themselves for action.  Tranq guns. rifles... the team is mobilized.  We HEAR a DISTRESSED CRY from the COW. 
KELLY He's mooing. 
JACK You wouldn't? 
KEOUGH They're coming right in. 
KELLY Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you? 
KEOUGH That it's about to go wrong. 
JACK (into walkie talkie) Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow. 
HECTOR (O.S.) (sarcastic, through walkie talkie) Thank you, Jack. 
JACK (to the team) You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land. (to Keough) You set? 
KEOUGH Don't worry about me. 
Incredibly... the plan is working.  A giant dragon is following a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline. 
Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  The big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank steak.  The time is now. 
INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
HECTOR We're in about four feet of water now. 
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
JACK Little closer.  Three, two, one... 
The crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping at air.  Hector pulls up with the chopper. 
JACK (CONT'D) Fire!! 
Jack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts. But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to swing like a pendulum.  It rocks the chopper. 
INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
HECTOR Oh, shit. 
The chopper is in trouble.  The cow sways, the helicopter struggles to stay airborne. 
EXT. BEACH - ANGLE KELLY - CONTINUOUS 
KELLY (screaming) Watch out!! 
JACK Keep firing! 
HECTOR And Hank. (to Keough) I know you weren't really trying to hit him. 
KEOUGH (gently) I was aiming for you. 
Hector smiles. 
HECTOR Thanks for the rescue. 
Jack leans down. 
JACK You take care. 
HECTOR You talk to Bickerman? 
JACK She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off. 
HECTOR Women's intuition.  Are there anymore? 
JACK Just those two. 
PARAMEDIC We gotta take him. 
JACK Okay. 
PARAMEDIC We got room for one. 
JACK Well... I got stuff to pack up and... 
He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"-- 
KEOUGH (grudging) I'll go. 
Hector smiles.  The Paramedics board Hector.  Keough turns to Jack. 
KEOUGH Thanks for your help. 
JACK You too. 
Handshake.  Respect.  That's about as much affection as you get from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly. 
KELLY I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch? 
KEOUGH I guess. 
And she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush, boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack. 
KELLY Well... 
JACK You wanna ride in my truck? 
GARE (arriving) Your truck is jammed.  Should we take some stuff out? 
KELLY No, no, I'll be a while anyway. I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake. 
JACK You sure?  I don't mind... 
KELLY No, I actually want to stay for a little while. 
They hold a look.  Then-- 
KELLY (CONT'D) I'll miss you most of all scarecrow. 
And she kisses his cheek. 
JACK If I'm ever in New York... 
KELLY Yeah.

STARLING AND CRAWFORD TURN A CORNER.  PAZZI LOOKING AFTER THEM, HE THEN, RELUCTANTLY, TURNS AWAY, BACK TO THE GROUP HE IS PART OF. 
ANGLE ON STARLING AND CRAWFORD, AS THEY DRAW AWAY FROM THE CONFERENCE ROOM GROUP. 
CRAWFORD (SOTTO) ...how'd you let her get that close to you...? 
IN THE B.G. WE SEE AN AIDE COME UP TO KRENDLER, AND HAND HIM A FILE.  STARLING WAVES OFF CRAWFORD'S QUESTION. 
CRAWFORD (cont' d) ...how'd she get next to you? 
STARLING (AS IF TEARING OFF THE BANDAID ) ...she gave me her baby. 
KRENDLER, AND THE AID WALK TOWARD CRAWFORD.  THE AIDE WHISPERS SOMETHING TO KRENDLER. 
KRENDLER (TO CRAWFORD) She threw a punch at a man on the team. 
CRAWFORD Well, you know, that happens, on the street. 
KRENDLER What is that supposed to mean...? 
CRAWFORD I think its meaning is clear. 
KRENDLER What, you're saying she was overwrought. 
CRAWFORD That could be. 
KRENDLER Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid. 
CRAWFORD She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And... 
STARLING STARTS AWAY, IN DISGUST. 
KRENDLER One moment, I'm not done with you... (TO CRAWFORD, AS KRENDLER MOTIONS HIS AIDE TO HAND HIM A FILE) Give him the file... 
AIDE I thought it was going to go down the line, to.... 
KRENDLER No, no, no, I want the girl to do it... 
THEY GO INTO A HUDDLE, AND STARLING MOVES AWAY, WAITING. SHE LOOKS AROUND, AND SHE AND WE DISCOVER SHE IS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE "LECHTERIANA" SECTION OF THE FBI DISPLAY. THE GUIDE IS ADDRESSING THE VISITING FOREIGN COPS. 
GUIDE Of the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter.  Here we have a WANTED poster... 
AS THE GUIDE SPEAKS WE CUT BETWEEN STARLING, HOPING TO HEAR HER FATE, AND THE MEN TALKING ABOUT HER. 
GUIDE (cont'd) (VO) Offered by an Unnamed Source, Three million Dollars for information leading to the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter. It is, of course, a bounty poster, the only one of its kind, it was never distributed, the contact number was disconnected, and the trail of the person offering the reward was covered so skillfully, that... 
PAZZI (VO) (IN A CULTURED ATTRACTIVE ITALIAN ACCENT) ...would you be so kind...? 
STARLING TURNS TO PAZZI, HOLDING A CAMERA. SHE HESITATES, THEN REALIZES HE WANTS HER TO TAKE HIS PHOTO IN FRONT OF THE POSTER. 
STARLING Yeah, sure. 
PAZZI MOVES IN FRONT OF THE POSTER.  WE SEE THE REFLECTION IN THE GLASS FRONTING THE POSTER, AND STARLING MOVES TO ELIMINATE IT .

His left hand, which had a sixth, vestigial, fully formed sixth finger.  You would think that a man with a mark so easily identifiable, would... 
BRIGHAM LEADS STARLING INTO THE HOUSE. 
HE CLOSES THE DOOR, AND TAKES HER TO THE SOFA. 
SHE SITS, AND PICKS UP A PHOTOGRAPH IN AN EASELFRAME FROM THE COFFEETABLE. 
STARLING (cont'd) Hey, now, what was I afraid of... I'm shooting at shadows... 
BRIGHAM Is that what you're afraid of...? 
ANGLE INS ON THE PHOTOGRAPH, SHOWS A TALL HANDSOME MAN IN WESTERN HAT, WEARING A BADGE, HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF A YOUNG BLONDE GIRL.

BRIGHAM And who is "they?" 
STARLING ...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... (PAUSE)

BEAT. 
THE LIGHT GOES ON AGAIN. 
WE SEE STARLING SWING TO A SITTING POSITION ON THE COUCH. SHE SIGHS.  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR IT, AND SHE PULLS THE HANNIBAL FILE TO HER.  SHE PICKS UP A PENCIL, AND A PAIR OF READING GLASSES FROM THE TABLE, AND BEGINS MAKING NOTES ON THE FILE.

WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE. HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO HIS COLLAR.  HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR.

THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE. 
ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR.  THERE IS A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT.  ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL.  HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS "OKAY" TO THE OLD MAN.  THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS. 
THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR GOES THROUGH. 
EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE. 
A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE. AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS.

ONE OF THEM IS REMOVING A TRAY OF COOKIES FROM THE OVEN, SEVERAL TYKES WAIT HAPPILY NEARBY.  THE COOK WITH THE TRAY OF COOKIES GIVES STARLING A WIDE GRIN.

CORDELL ...they're from Baltimore.... 
STARLING I've never heard that he... 
CORDELL It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does. 
BEAT. 
STARLING I won't take much of his time. 
CORDELL He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand... 
CAMERA TAKES STARLING DOWN A CORRIDOR LINED WITH HUNTINGPRINTS.  AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AN OLD WOMAN SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING. 
THEY HAVE STOPPED.  WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP. STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK "SAMPLER" FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR.  AND OBVIOUS ANTIQUE.  IT READS: 
"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY." 
ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE GLANCES AT THE CARD. 
ANGLE INS THE CARD READS: 
"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY..." 
SHE GLANCES AT IT, AND, DISMISSIVELY, PUTS IT IN A POCKET. 
CORDELL (cont'd) And he has asked me to ask you something. 
STARLING What would that be? 
CORDELL (PAUSE) He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation.  To a charitable institution of your choice. (PAUSE) 
STARLING Now, why in the world would he do that? 
CORDELL I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction.  To his appearance. 
STARLING What reaction? 
CORDELL Exactly. 
STARLING (AS SHE HANDS HIM A CARD) Please, I do not... I don't want to trouble him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's... 
CORDELL Do you know the seller? 
STARLING We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records. 
CORDELL Try Barney Clark. 
STARLING (TAKING OUT A NOTEBOOK) He is...? 
CORDELL He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison. 
STARLING And how would you know that? 
CORDELL Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. (PAUSE.  STARLING MAKES A NOTE. SHE LOOKS AROUND.) 
STARLING You should get the kids a dog... 
CORDELL ....I hardly think so... after "The Incident"... 
STARLING No, no, of course not. 
SHE STARTS TO GET INTO HER CAR. 
CORDELL ...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable... 
STARLING Tell him to give it to an orphanage. 
STARLING CLOSES THE CAR DOOR. 
HOLD.  ON STARLING, WATCHING THE CHILDREN FOR A MOMENT. THEN SHE TAKES THE CARD FROM HER POCKET AND GLANCES AT IT. 
IT READS : 
"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY, DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY. BE AWARE OF FORTUNE'S HABIT--SHE WILL DO JUST AS SHE PLEASES.  NONE OF THIS IS IN YOUR CONTROL.  BE HAPPY.  BE KIND. 
ANGLE 
ON STARLING, AS SHE STARTS TO PUT THE CAR IN GEAR, PUTTING DOWN THE NOTE.  THEN SHE HESITATES, AND BEGINS TO CRY. LOWERING HER HEAD, BEYOND HER WE SEE THE POTATOCHIP VAN, PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND THE CHILDREN ROMPING WITH THE GOAT.

PSYCHIATRIST What does that mean? 
STARLING (PAUSE) I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb... 
PSYCHIATRIST Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution. 
STARLING (TAKES A TISSUE FROM A BOX ON THE DESK) If he could overcome... his need for... for self-ratification... 
PSYCHIATRIST ...would you use a small word? 
STARLING For approval. 
PSYCHIATRIST What's wrong with approval? (PAUSE) You admired that man. 
STARLING Yes. 
PSYCHIATRIST How do you think that made him feel? (AFTER A PAUSE.  SHE CHECKS HER NOTES) What does that mean, "to go beyond the institution...?" (PAUSE) 
STARLING I told that woman I'm an orphan. 
PSYCHIATRIST ...you are an orphan. 
STARLING But... but....but.... you're right.  I used it.  To bargain.  For her sympathy...  I used it--to "whore myself out"-- (PAUSE) 
PSYCHIATRIST Welcome to the human race. (STARLING SHAKES HER HEAD IN NEGATION.  PAUSE) Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people. (PAUSE) Why don't you find them...?

PAZZI They got that kind of money? 
COP ONE Their family owns...

FELL ...yes. 
PAZZI You have taken over his offices, is that not so? 
FELL It is only temporary, until my confirmation by... 
PAZZI Of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?

FELL And you have a new wedding ring on yours? La Vita Nuova?-- (HE SMILES.) 
PAZZI You looked oddly at me, back on the landing. 
FELL Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious? 
PAZZI Why did you look at me that way? 
FELL (SMILES) I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean.  Just dressed--in the middle of the... 
FELL SHAKES HIS HEAD, ASKING TO HAVE THE QUESTION WITHDRAWN. 
PAZZI ...please... 
FELL (SHRUGS, SMILES) I saw a man, somewhat fatigued. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day. (SMILES) An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was fresh--therefore:  a man who dressed at home.  And then I remarked the new wedding ring.  And so:  the story gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved wife.  I wish you joy. (FELL STARTS TO EXIT) 
PAZZI WALKS WITH HIM. 
PAZZI You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations? 
FELL (SHRUGS) I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious. 
PAZZI ...your scar..? 
FELL My scar is a war-wound. 
PAZZI How so? 
FELL Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  History, a hazardous profession.

STARLING STARTS TO OPEN HER BAG, AND SPEAKS INTO IT. 
STARLING I hereby acknowledge that... 
BARNEY And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience. 
STARLING (SMILING) Then why did you chose to inform me of it...? 
BARNEY To show... (PAUSE) in my ability to squander.  What one might deem an advantage... that my strength is greater than yours... 
STARLING Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...? 
BARNEY If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.

BARNEY You almost took down Evelda Drumgo. 
STARLING Well.  Word gets around. 
BARNEY ...what hindered you...? 
STARLING It wasn't my day. 
BARNEY Perhaps you did not have the support you required. 
STARLING It's a poor workman who blames his tools. 
BARNEY Or, perhaps... 
STARLING ...how are things at the Hospital? 
BARNEY It's a growth business. 
STARLING What have they got you doing? 
BARNEY Orderly. 
STARLING I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School. 
BARNEY I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions. 
STARLING (TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK) You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward. 
BARNEY Yes, I presumed it was about him. 
STARLING ...you... 
BARNEY I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not last with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time. 
STARLING (GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS, AS SHE TAKES OUT A PENCIL.) I'm looking for... 
BARNEY He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil. 
STARLING Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you? 
BARNEY He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after you...? 
STARLING LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW. 
ANGLE HER POV 
OUT THE WINDOW, SE SEE THE DOVE CIRCLING THE DEAD DOVE ON THE RATTY PIECE OF GRASS. 
STARLING (TURNING BACK) What...? 
BARNEY I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive. 
STARLING We got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books. 
BARNEY Yes? 
STARLING And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase. 
BARNEY Why me? 
STARLING Waal, because your selling'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand? 
BARNEY ...very good. 
STARLING Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell. 
BARNEY ...why? 
STARLING Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles... 
BARNEY You said "here's what they want you to do..."  Why? 
STARLING Now, whyn't you help us? 
BARNEY That would adversely impact my income. 
STARLING Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income. 
BARNEY We could skip the Gavotte. 
STARLING Say it in English. 
BARNEY Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...? 
STARLING Then who's buying it? 
BARNEY (SHRUGS) There's one or two freaks, and, for a "Pass," I'll rat them out to you... (HE TAKES A PENCIL, AND PUTS A COUPLE OF NAMES IN HER BOOK, LEANING OVER HER) 
STARLING That's the spirit... 
ANGLE, BARNEY AS HE LEANS OVER, LOOMING OVER STARLING. 
STARLING Because you're going to help me plan a party. 
MAPP You're going to do that? 
STARLING I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet. 
MAPP READS THE MEMO. 
MAPP The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you. 
STARLING My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change. 
MAPP PICKS UP THE X-RAY. 
MAPP I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. (OF THE X-RAY.  SHE HOLDS IT UP, SEEKING INFORMATION) 
STARLING Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it? 
MAPP Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?" 
STARLING Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room. 
MAPP (OF THE NOTE) You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your mind cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step slow... 
STARLING I don't wanna go out there at all... 
MAPP What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler. 
STARLING No.  I want to buy a dog. (PAUSE) 
MAPP What broke you free, Girl? 
STARLING I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine... 
SHE EXTRACTS THE SMALL CARD VERGER HAS GIVEN HER.  AND WE SEE IT, AS SHE LOOKS AT IT. 
"DO NOT GIVE IN TO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROPERTY. NONE OF THIS IS IN YOUR CONTROL.  BE HAPPY.  BE KIND." 
INT VERGER'S MANSION--PLAYROOM--DAY. 
HAPPY SMALL CHILDREN PLAYING.  ONE SMALL BOY, SMILING, IS APPROACHED BY A LOVELY YOUNG NURSE, DRESSED IN WHITE.  SHE WHISPERS TO HIM AND HE SMILES AND NODS, AND TAKES HER HAND, AS THEY WALK OFF.

WE SEE THE YOUNG CHILD, FRANKLIN, BEING LED OFF ON A TV SCREEN.  WE SEE HIS PROGRESS ONTO ANOTHER SCREEN SHOWING THE HALL, AND THE OLD WOMAN, ROSIE, KNITTING. 
ANGLE 
CORDELL, STANDING BY VERGER'S BED.  CORDELL HOLDS A FOLDER MARKED "DEPARTMENT OF CHILD WELFARE.  CITY OF BALTIMORE." 
HE IS FINISHED READING IT. 
CORDELL "...and age-appropriate large and small motor skills.  His unfortunate home situation has made it necessary for Franklin to form immediate attachments with adults, which we understand to have contributed to many instances of his abuse." 
SOUND OF A "WHOOSH," AS A DOOR OPENS, CORDELL CLOSES THE FOLDER.  HE LOOKS TOWARD THE DOOR. 
ANGLE 
IN THE BED, VERGER, HIS FACE OBSCURED BY A TELEVISION MONITOR.  WE HEAR THE WHIR OF A TV CAMERA. 
WE SEE THE CAMERA, ABOVE VERGER'S BED, MOVING. 
ANGLE 
ON A TV SCREEN, WE SEE THE CAMERA TRACK, AND TAKE THE FRIGHTENED FRANKLIN, AND THE NURSE STANDING NEXT TO HIM, THE NURSE MOTIONS FRANKLIN FORWARD. 
ANGLE, ON CORDELL, LOOKING DOWN AT VERGER.  (NB THROUGHOUT, VERGER SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN.  HE IS INFERRED THROUGH THE REACTIONS OF THOSE AROUND HIM.  AND HE, AND IN PARTICULAR, HIS FACE SHOULD ALWAYS BE OBSCURED--A TEASE--BY THIS OR THAT INTERVENING OBJECT.) 
CORDELL NODS, AS IF IN RESPONSE TO A SIGN FROM VERGER.  HE LAYS THE HOSPITAL FOLDER ON A SORT OF XEROX MACHINE. 
ANGLE ON VERGER'S ELECTRONIC DISPLAY.  THE VARIOUS TV SCREENS, THE HOSPITAL FOLDER, NOW COMING INTO VIEW ON A SCREEN ON WHICH WE READ THE LOGO OF THE BALTIMORE CHILD WELFARE, AND "JAMES, FRANKLIN, BORN JUNE 5, 1991," AND A PHOTO OF HIM.  ON THE ADJACENT SCREEN WE SEE THE YOUNG BOY COMING FORWARD AT THE URGING OF HIS NURSE.  HIS EYES GROWING WIDE WITH FEAR. 
ANGLE 
FROM BEHIND FRANKLIN, AS HIS BODY OBSCURES OUR VIEW OF VERGER, AND WE HEAR THE ELECTRONICALLY ENHANCED VOICE OF VERGER CONVERSING WITH HIM. 
VERGER Are you Franklin ? 
FRANKLIN ...Franklin. 
VERGER Where do you live? 
FRANKLIN With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean. 
ANGLE SHIFT TO OVER VERGER, ONTO THE FRIGHTENED BOY.  IN THE BG WE SEE THE NURSE BEATING A STRATEGIC RETREAT TO THE DOOR, AND AFTER HER EXIT, WE SEE HER APPEAR ON THE SCREEN WHICH SHOWS THE CORRIDOR, TAKING A CHAIR ACROSS FROM "ROSIE," WE SEE HER SIT AND TAKE OUT A BOOK AND READ.  AS VERGER TALKS WITH FRANKLIN, WE SEE THE INFORMATION ON THE "TEXT" SCREEN SCROLL, WHICH NEW INFO WE SEE REFLECTED IN VERGER'S QUESTIONS. 
FRANKLIN (cont'd) But Stringbean, he in and out. 
VERGER In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin? 
FRANKLIN She my foster. 
VERGER She's not the first foster that you've had.  Is she? 
FRANKLIN No. (THE CHILD LOOKS AROUND, AND, FINDING NO SUPPORT, LOOKS BACK AT VERGER.) 
VERGER Do you like it at your home, Franklin? 
FRANKLIN (FRIGHTENING) We got KittyKat... 
VERGER Yes.... yes... 
FRANKLIN ...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime. 
VERGER Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away. 
FRANKLIN ...who say...? 
VERGER The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the Government says... 
ANGLE XCU ON FRANKLIN. 
VERGER (cont'd) ...or perhaps they just don't want you anymore.  Could that be?  And, do you know what will happen to Kitty Cat?  When you go away.  The police will take her, and they'll give her a shot.  With a shiny needle.  They'll give Kitty Cat a shot.  And it will hurt her.  And then she will die. 
FRANKLIN TAKES THE TAIL OF HIS SHIRT FROM HIS PANTS AND HOLDS IT TO HIS EYES. 
THE STATUE OF THE LION HOLDING THE BIRD.  A COUPLE WALKING PAST. 
PAZZI ...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are expensive...

MRS. PAZZI Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera... 
PAZZI ...whatever is within my power... 
MRS. PAZZI ...and that is what you need to expand. 
PAZZI I don't understand.

PAZZI ...my love... 
MRS. PAZZI ...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot return the... 
PAZZI I am on the track of... 
MRS. PAZZI Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, if you get it, will not buy me a new watch... (SHE STOPS TO GREET ANOTHER COUPLE) 
PAZZI ...what do you expect me to... 
HE STOPS, AND TURNS AWAY, WHEN HE SEES THAT SHE IS ENGROSSED.  HE IS NOW LOOKING AT A TORTURE WHEEL.  HE STOPS AND LOOKS INTENTLY INTO THE GLOOM OF THE ROPED OFF EXHIBIT.

PAZZI, BEYOND THE VELVET ROPE.  PEERING INTENTLY, RETURNING FELL'S GLANCE. 
DOUBLECUTTING:  WE RETURN TO PAZZI, STARING, WE SEE HIM MAKE A QUICK ADDENDUM TO THE SKETCH OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AND THEN RETURN TO PAZZI, LEANING OVER TO PEER MORE CLOSELY INTO THE GLOOM. 
MRS. PAZZI So, the question:  as always, Rinaldo, the question is one of mmm...

GUIDE The exhibit is closing.  The exhibit is closing in Ten Minutes... please make your way to the... 
MRS. PAZZI Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian. 
FELL Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think? 
MRS. PAZZI And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture? 
PAZZI Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo. 
FELL Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you... 
HE HOLDS UP THE ROPE, AS TO LEAD THEM BACK INTO THE EXHIBIT. 
PAZZI But the exhibit is closing. 
FELL How unfortunate. 
PAZZI STARTS TO HELP HIS WIFE ON WITH HER WRAP. 
FELL (cont'd) May I...? 
HE TAKES THE WRAP, AND BEGINS TO DRAPE IT AROUND HER SHOULDERS.

FELL I have had many excellent meals there. 
MRS. PAZZI And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.

ANGLE 
PAZZI IN THE PHONEBOOTH.  WE HEAR A RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT: WE'RE SORRY, THIS NUMBER IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE.  IF YOU FEEL YOU HAVE DIALED IN ERROR.... 
PAZZI HANDS UP THE PHONE.  HE STARTS TO WALK AWAY.  AS HE DOES SO, THE PHONE RINGS, HE GOES BACK TO THE TELEPHONE. 
PAZZI (ON HIS PHONE) Hello....?

And how could I but think of her? I haven't had a bit all day.  The kidney and the liver would be su1table for a dinner tonight.  But the rest of the meat should hang for a week, in these cool conditions.  Wouldn't you say?  Nod once for yes. (PAUSE) If you tell me what I need to know, then it would be convenient for me to leave without my meal.  And Mrs. Pazzi will remain unscathed.  I'll out the questions to you, and we'll see:  I saw at the theatre you had betrayed me. And, when the police didn't come, it was clear you had sold me out.  Was it to Mason Verger?  Blink one for yes.

VERGER (VO) Thank you, Cordell. 
LECHTER (SPEAKING GROGGILY) ...but will that satisfy you? 
VERGER Why should you care? 
LECHTER It is not that I care for you--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you do when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity. 
VERGER ARE YOU DONE?

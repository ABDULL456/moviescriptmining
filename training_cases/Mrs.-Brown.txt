MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT 
Begin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past saplings and plunges on. 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT 
Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome, bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and races on. 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT 
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes forward, never stumbling once. 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT 
BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the wildly swaying trees. 
There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins round, bellows deep from his heart: 
BROWN God save the Queen!! 
And fires. 
Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into empty space.  A pause. 
Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees, waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice: 
FADE TO BLACK. 
CAPTION: "1864" 
FADE IN: 
PONSONBY (V.O.) I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned him, on one or two occasions, as being a most devoted outdoor servant to Prince Albert during his last days there... 
John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
The screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover that we are looking at a black night-gown. 
Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair. 
PONSONBY (V.O.) ... The depths of the Queen's sorrow remain impenetrable.  She has now restricted herself to a regime of such ferocious introspection that we are all at our wits' end... 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk is laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his suits before laying it carefully on the bed. 
PONSONBY (V.O.) ... The Household continues, at her instruction, to observe the rituals now so familiar to her, in a vain attempt to render vivid that which can never be revived... 
Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the widow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is set in a mask of severity. 
JENNER Congratulations, Your Royal Highness! 
BERTIE Thank you, Doctor. 
JENNER A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent. 
BERTIE Yes. (beat) Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What do you think? 
PONSONBY A fine choice, sir. 
JENNER Excellent! 
EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY 
JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans in. 
DRIVER Are you riding up front? 
BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved. 
BROWN I'll stay with the pony, thank you. She's all the way from Deeside and she's not sure she likes you yet. 
The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY 
VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind. 
VICTORIA How many? 
LADY ELY is slightly taken aback. 
LADY ELY The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Just them? 
LADY ELY Yes, ma'am. 
VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps through the door. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY 
Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place. 
She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony. 
It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the same. 
Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence. 
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY 
The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress curiously. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY 
The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat. 
JENNER We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Whom? 
BROWN glances up the corridor. 
BROWN So, is passing wind out of the question or do I need permission for that? 
PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the interview. 
PONSONBY As I am sure you remember from Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty addresses you directly. 
BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY 
BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY waits by the door. 
PONSONBY (O.S.) Mr Brown, ma'am. 
VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter, underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. She carries on working. 
BROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince Albert glimpsed in the corridor. 
Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks up and BROWN bows deeply. 
Silence. 
She stares at him for a long moment without apparently registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black and knotted with tension. 
Finally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy. 
VICTORIA Mr Brown. 
BROWN Ma'am. 
VICTORIA You are here safely. 
BROWN Aye, ma'am. 
VICTORIA You are well? 
BROWN I am. 
VICTORIA And the pony? 
BROWN She's well, too. 
VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is bringing him back.  A beat. 
VICTORIA Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated. 
BROWN I'm glad of it. 
In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike others, seems unaffected. 
VICTORIA My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. (beat) I trust it does not inconvenience you too much. 
BROWN I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters. 
VICTORIA Yes. (beat) You have a brother in service here, do you not? (furrowing her brow) I forget his name. 
BROWN Archie. 
VICTORIA Yes. (beat) That will be company for you. 
ARCHIE It's better than shovelling horse shit. 
BROWN If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones. 
ARCHIE She's hardly a full hamper herself. 
BROWN (beat) It's only grief makes her like she is. 
ARCHIE Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving? 
BROWN She loved him. 
ARCHIE Come on, man.  There's love and there's ... 
BROWN What? 
ARCHIE You know what I mean. 
BROWN I'm not sure I do, Archie. 
ARCHIE There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to. 
Hold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them. 
BROWN Which one of us is she flirting with? 
ARCHIE The good-looking one. 
BROWN Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do. 
ARCHIE You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy. 
A beat.  BROWN stares straight at him. 
BROWN I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING 
The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her entourage are several steps past her before they realize what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions behind. 
Now we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on. 
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Some hours later.  It is now raining. 
A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush around him, laughing and giggling. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING 
Rain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops at the same place as before. 
VICTORIA (as if she had not seem him earlier) Who is that? 
Lady Ely peers through the rain. 
LADY ELY It's Mr Brown, ma'am. 
VICTORIA What is he doing there? 
LADY ELY He appears to be ... standing by his horse. 
A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling his horse.  Suddenly he turns. 
VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her entourage. 
VICTORIA Mr Brown. 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
VICTORIA You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so. 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Then why do you persist in doing it? 
BROWN Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her. 
A beat. 
VICTORIA The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses. 
BROWN And I intend to be there when she's ready. 
Silence.  The two of them stare at each other. 
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY 
The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the distance, the glittering sea. 
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY 
VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in silence. 
EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY 
VICTORIA looks up. 
VICTORIA Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne. 
BROWN It's a fine spot, ma'am. 
VICTORIA He thought so, yes. 
She stares ahead. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) In everything I do and everything I say, I try to think, as much as possible, what he would do, or say, if he were here now.  My Private Secretary wishes me to return to public duties-- 
She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in. 
BROWN If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two. 
VICTORIA Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it. (beat) The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- 
She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not? 
BROWN Aye, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Yes. 
A pause. 
BROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the table. 
BROWN looks up from his soup. 
BROWN Am I the only one eating? 
With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY 
A few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. He runs through the daily itinerary. 
PONSONBY Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two. (finishes, then coughs) The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience. 
VICTORIA Why? 
PONSONBY He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government. 
VICTORIA No.  I shall be out walking. 
A beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs again, nervous. 
PONSONBY Then perhaps Your Majesty might consider it opportune if the Prince of Wales were to meet him on your behalf? 
VICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning. 
VICTORIA On no account. 
PONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up the reins. 
BERTIE Mama, I really do think it's time we made ourselves a little more ... available. 
VICTORIA carries on knitting. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) I think we must accept our position in the country is not entirely unrelated to the continued absence of the Monarchy from public life. (silence) I thought perhaps we might consider a small gesture of some kind? 
VICTORIA looks up sharply. 
VICTORIA Gesture? 
BERTIE I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps? 
VICTORIA (cutting in firmly) No dinners, Bertie. (beat) Why are you dressed for outdoors? 
BERTIE It's so infernally cold in here. 
VICTORIA Cold is good-- (calling across) Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?! 
JENNER I'm sorry, ma'am? 
VICTORIA Cold is good! 
JENNER Excellent, ma'am, excellent. (trying his hand) But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity... 
VICTORIA (becoming very agitated) Why am I being lectured in this way?! 
JENNER Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest-- 
VICTORIA (cutting across him) I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy.... 
BERTIE Mother.... 
STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap. 
STANLEY Have you seen this? 
INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY 
A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and offer their congratulations. 
STANLEY Should we take it seriously? 
DISRAELI The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism? 
STANLEY Well, both. 
DISRAELI The question is, do we need her? 
STANLEY Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense-- 
DISRAELI My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion. 
The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts. 
DISRAELI (CONT'D) Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk. (beat) Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close. 
STANLEY So? 
DISRAELI We'll see which way the wind blows. 
DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers. 
EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY 
BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing. BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing Burns at the sea. 
BROWN My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here!  My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing the wild deer and following the roe! My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go! 
ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns. 
EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY 
A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized. 
BROWN One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys. 
ARCHIE So?  Someone'll send it on ahead. 
BROWN Aye, but will they? 
ARCHIE John, it's not your problem what she eats. 
BROWN The woman's surrounded by fools! (beat) She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight. 
BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his brother. 
ARCHIE She's got an army of people to get her up and out. 
BROWN But I'm the only one she trusts. 
ARCHIE stares at him.  A beat. 
ARCHIE She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful. 
A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS, DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone knows everyone. 
DISRAELI Ah, the greasy pole. 
MARY ANNE Don't be facetious, dear. Remember your position. 
DISRAELI It's my position I'm thinking of. 
Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of acolytes. 
STANLEY I see the Prince of Wales is here. 
DISRAELI I hope he got his mother's permission. 
STANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and raises his hand, already working the room. 
DISRAELI (CONT'D) Lord Salisbury! 
INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY 
The society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES. 
SOCIETY LADY 1 (ridiculously pleased with herself) Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound foolish?  Because she looks after the Browns and lets the sovereigns take care of themselves! 
A peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up. 
DISRAELI And in your opinion?  Is she foolish? 
The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back. 
SOCIETY LADY 1 Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's hardly right, is it? 
DISRAELI What? 
SOCIETY LADY 1 Well, the Queen and -- (appalled whisper) Mr Brown. 
DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead. 
DISRAELI La superstition met le monde entier en flammes. 
SOCIETY LADY 2 (thick as shit) I beg your pardon? 
DISRAELI (changing tack) Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown? 
STANLEY He is her personal servant, I believe. 
SOCIETY LADY 1 (knowingly) Follows her wherever she goes. 
DISRAELI He would hardly make a very good personal assistant if he did not. 
INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY 
BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS GRANT nervously prattles on. 
MRS GRANT ... it's not my best china.  I mean, it is my best china now, but the family set got stolen last summer. 
VICTORIA Oh, I'm so sorry ... 
MRS GRANT Of course it was no-one on the Estate. More likely one of the lads from Braemar.  Or further even. (beat) I'll fetch the salt. 
MRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries on. 
JENNER Your Majesty!  Thank goodness you're safe!  I'll have a bath prepared immediately.  I recommend Macdonald's African Embrocation -- 
BROWN (cutting in) Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine. 
VICTORIA We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable. 
PONSONBY We were expecting you to return by six. 
VICTORIA And now I am back. 
BROWN cannot resist one more little dig. 
BROWN We took a nip of whiskey. 
VICTORIA To keep out the cold. 
BROWN Aye. 
VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says... 
VICTORIA Thank you, John. 
BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up, he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and leads the horse back to the stables. 
JENNER (under his breath) She's drunk. 
PONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very closely. 
JENNER (CONT'D) A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you. 
PONSONBY No, she wasn't. 
Silence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY. 
JENNER Surely not ... 
PONSONBY's face is set hard. 
PONSONBY Don't even think about it. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT 
A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of the annual Ghillie's Ball. 
The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall. 
PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly. 
JENNER Pandora's Box ... 
With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence. A King and his Queen. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT 
Later that night. 
We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and snoring loudly. 
EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY 
A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a stony path, armed with telescopes. 
BROWN (CONT'D) What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised! 
BERTIE'S VALET We -- 
BROWN You'll talk when I'm finished! 
BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns back to the table. 
BROWN (CONT'D) That kind of disloyalty will not be tolerated in this house, is that clear? (beat, yelling) I said, is that clear?! 
There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY 
A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his copy of Punch. 
JENNER "Court Circular, Balmoral." (beat) "On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a display of sheep-dipping by local farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a seance where he was pleased to listen to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr Robert Burns himself ..." 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY 
BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same journal. 
JENNER (O.S.) "... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked on the slopes, accompanied by family and friend ..." 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY 
BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door. 
JENNER (O.S.) Mr Brown retired early. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY 
BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled. 
BROWN If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked. 
PONSONBY I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty. 
BROWN Don't think I can't persuade her. 
PONSONBY I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor. 
BROWN This is a slur on her good name. 
PONSONBY In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you. 
BROWN Nobody has any rights over me. 
PONSONBY We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you. 
BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat. 
BROWN You'll regret saying that. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
CAPTION: "1867" 
FADE IN: 
INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY 
DEAN WELLSELLY (completely lost) I beg your pardon? 
DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read. 
DISRAELI (as Wellselly reads) One of our madder brethren in the house was calling for disestablishment of the monarchy. 
Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified. 
DEAN WELLSELLY Good Lord. 
STANLEY (playing the soft glove) I'm sure it won't come to that. 
DISRAELI (the hard glove) No.  But it has now become a matter for our consciences. (beat) I was just telling Stanley how vital it is that the nation should feel the visible influence of the Sovereign. As a reminder that Parliament, indeed my own ministry, depends on the will of the Queen. 
DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder, STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the party political maneuver into a moral imperative. 
DEAN WELLSELLY I couldn't agree with you more, but I am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't understand what ... 
DISRAELI interrupts. 
DISRAELI We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is interesting Her Majesty in some of the forms of worship associated with ... low-church Presbyterian. 
Silence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian. 
DEAN WELLSELLY What can we do? 
DISRAELI Oh, several things. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY 
Some days later. 
Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands in front of her, holding a copy of The Times. 
VICTORIA Read it. 
PONSONBY Again? 
VICTORIA Read it! 
PONSONBY coughs once and begins again. 
PONSONBY "The Times wishes to join the rest of Her Majesty's loyal subjects in expressing its deep joy at the news that the Queen is soon to come out of her mourning." 
VICTORIA glowers at him. 
VICTORIA Who told them that? 
PONSONBY I have no idea. 
VICTORIA Why not? 
PONSONBY I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself. 
Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him. 
VICTORIA No-one should think themselves wiser than me! (beat) It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely! 
PONSONBY Your Majesty -- 
VICTORIA (cutting right through him) Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! (a pause, more quietly) I am not a fool. (beat) I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. (beat) And now they attack Brown too. 
BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised. They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the QUEEN closely.  She stops. 
VICTORIA I would like to get down. 
Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her horse. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) John? 
BROWN Yes, ma'am? 
VICTORIA I was told you were in a fight. 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Has someone seen to those bruises? 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
A beat. 
BROWN (CONT'D) Ma'am? 
VICTORIA Yes? 
BROWN Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign. 
VICTORIA I do not accept. 
A beat. 
BROWN I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside -- 
VICTORIA (cutting in) The Queen forbids it. (beat) I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please. 
She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then looks at him, utterly helpless. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Promise me you won't let them send me back. 
A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight. 
BROWN I promise. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
CAPTION: "1868" 
FADE IN: 
EXT. LOWLANDS - DAY 
A few weeks later. 
A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland landscape. 
DISRAELI (V.O.) Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three hours on the Irish Church Bill ... I am as guilty as the rest of underestimating his reforming zeal. Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy there yet remains one last hope of deliverance.  Wheresoever the blame lies, we must now close ranks and defend Mrs Brown's England.  As for my interminable journey to the land of Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur ... 
EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY 
DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain. 
DISRAELI (O.S.) ... no Prime Minister made greater sacrifice than attempting to run the country six hundred miles north of civilization. 
DISRAELI A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier. 
VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares. 
BROWN What do you know about the Highlands? 
DISRAELI I am a blank sheet. 
BROWN Do you hunt? 
DISRAELI Occasionally. 
BROWN Dare say you can be taught. 
DISRAELI To shoot perhaps, but not to kill. 
BROWN If you hunt, you kill. 
DISRAELI counters effortlessly. 
DISRAELI Well then, I'll do my best. 
EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY 
Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud, crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly cold. 
Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front. 
Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them ARCHIE. 
Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts. 
He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can. 
As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN. 
EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY 
The stalking. 
Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill. 
DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes on his man, trying to make no sound. 
Suddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI rides alongside and sees ... 
A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside. 
Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his shoulder and fires. 
EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY 
The kill. 
A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ... 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY 
BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his side. 
BROWN (demonstrating with his rifle) Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone. 
ARCHIE What's this? 
BROWN It's a diary. 
ARCHIE Be careful who sees it. 
BROWN What do you take me for? 
ARCHIE turns back to BROWN. 
ARCHIE You should have someone look after you. 
BROWN I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit. (feeling everything spin) The room ... You don't have to stay. 
BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches over him. 
ARCHIE The place is a mess. 
BROWN I can't move to tidy. 
ARCHIE It's what the maids are for. 
BROWN I'm not having some prattler going through my things. 
A beat. 
ARCHIE Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her. 
BROWN She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face. (his hands come up to cover his eyes) How can I stop now? 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY 
Dawn the next morning. 
BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the stairs. 
EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY 
BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed -- to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket. 
BROWN You sent for me. 
DISRAELI I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar. 
BROWN stares straight back. 
EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY 
An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt. 
DISRAELI Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God. (beat) You must miss such magnificent views. 
BROWN I don't think about it. 
They reach the top and continue along the high ground. DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp. 
DISRAELI Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting. 
BROWN I'm fine. 
DISRAELI You're injured. 
DISRAELI The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense. 
BROWN Her mind is set.  She won't change now. 
DISRAELI She trusts you, John. 
DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice. 
BROWN They don't see it. 
DISRAELI See what? 
BROWN The threat. (beat) I tell them, but they don't see it. 
DISRAELI They aren't as watchful as you. 
BROWN Too busy looking after themselves. 
DISRAELI The greasy pole. 
BROWN No loyalty. 
DISRAELI No love. 
Silence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone else has said that. 
BROWN I promised to protect her from people like you. 
DISRAELI For once in my life, I am not the issue. 
BROWN She'll never understand it. 
DISRAELI In time, she will. 
BROWN She'll think I betrayed her. 
DISRAELI But others will know that you acted for the greater good. 
BROWN stares off into the distance. 
EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY 
The next day. 
BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES wait on the shore. 
VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them carefully through the water. 
VICTORIA I received a letter today from Mr Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for my return to public duties. (beat) Why won't they let us be? 
BROWN does not answer. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) He insists that the country expects me to preside over the opening of the new session.  I refuse to offer sustenance to enable his weakening grip. Besides, you know how much I should hate it.  It frightens me. 
She notices that BROWN has said nothing. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) John? 
BROWN does not look at her.  Finally: 
BROWN We can't always have what we wish. 
VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. VICTORIA frowns. 
VICTORIA Where is my son? 
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Why is he not here? 
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA He is sick, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Then why are you not with him? 
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral. 
VICTORIA What is the matter with him? 
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA He has typhoid fever, ma'am. 
VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER. 
VICTORIA No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son. 
JENNER The same, your Majesty. 
VICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table. A long pause. 
VICTORIA Why was I not informed? 
JENNER I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves. 
VICTORIA How ill is he? 
No answer. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) (to Alexandra) Alex? 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) He is not well, ma'am. 
A beat. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) I must go to him. 
Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone leaps to their feet. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) We must leave at once. 
Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts into activity. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY 
BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the servants and Householders hurrying about in every direction. 
EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY 
Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders rushing to be ready in time. 
Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time - yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and take her place.  She ignores him completely. 
BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him. 
INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY 
The others raise their glasses in unison. 
EVERYONE Victoria Regina! 
VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door. 
DISRAELI (O.S.) The people of England have expressed in a manner which cannot be mistaken, that they will uphold the ancient monarchy of England ... 
INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY 
DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of Tory delegates. 
DISRAELI ... If the first great object of the Tory Party is to maintain the institutions of the country, the second is, in my opinion, to maintain the Empire of England ... the hereditary, the traditionary policy of the Tory Party.  Go to your homes, teach them these truths, which will soon be imprinted on the conscience of the land ... 
FADE TO BLACK. 
CAPTION: "1883" 
FADE IN: 
INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT 
The sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is sitting at his desk, writing in the diary. 
The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in. 
BROWN (V.O.) We should not live in expectation of contentment.  Fifteen years of vigilance will not guarantee peace of mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again reported in the South Wing.  I believe my prompt arrival may have averted any crisis, but it was a timely reminder. It is a great comfort to me that my efforts in securing the Queen's safety over the years have not been in vain. Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel sure that if she were unhappy she would have found the occasion  to speak to me in person, as she has so often done in the past. 
A knock at the door. 
BROWN (CONT'D) What is it? 
We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running. 
PAGE North woods, sir. 
BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out. 
EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT 
BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his hair and clothes. 
Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm. 
A coin flips through the air to be caught by an outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins. 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT 
BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest. 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT 
And now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated, severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack to his left, he spins and plunges on. 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT 
Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on. 
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT 
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length.

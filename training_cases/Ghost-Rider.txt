EXT. HIGH PLAINS - HILLSIDE - DAY 
A COYOTE lopes through shimmering heat waves. The sky above is a cloudless blue. 
WOMAN (V.O.) My Father used to say that the only way Evil came into your life was if you invited it. I'm not sure about that, at least not anymore. What I cLQ know is this: we are born alone, and we die alone, and what happens in between is all that matters. The choices we make, the people whose paths we cross -- these are the things that determine our fate. The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link fence, weaves through the rusted ruins of a -- 
DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK Broken-down rides, weed-clogged machinery, sideshow trailers bleached bone-white. 
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) Most stories start with a beginning. His began with an ending. I never knew where he really came from. I guess it's not important anymore. All I know is that he'd been running his entire life. Running for so long that he no longer knew whether he was running away from 
SOMETHING -- The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks out over a patchy Southwestern town. 
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) -- or towards it. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. BAD IRON BIKE REPAIR - DAY 
Sparks, noise, metal and grime. JOHN BLAZE (30s, ruggedly handsome) is running late. He sprints across the workshop floor, shedding his welder's kit as he heads for the time clock. CLUNK! He punches out -- but LITTLE MIKE (50s, trailer trash fast) has caught him in the act. 
LITTLE MIKE where do you chink you're going, Blaze? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAZE Sick, cutting out early. 
LITTLE MIKE The hell you are! Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered BSA. 
LITTLE MIKE (CONT'D) Get back to work or your ass is fired! 
BLAZE Aaa n? You say that every time. Blaze kicks-starts the bike. It ROARS thunderously. 
LITTLE MIKE (over the noise) Well I mean it this time! 
BLAZE (gunning the throttle) See you tomorrow, Little Mike! The bike HOWLS, hauls up on its back wheel. Screams out the shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears. The other workers WHOOP and HOLLER, especially when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT- CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the fly. 
EXT. BAD IRON SHOP YARD/DIRT ROAD - DAY 
Blaze skids out of the yard, matching speed with a pickup which is just passing by. COOP is driving. JED and MURPHY are LAUGHING in back. Clearly, they're friends with Blaze. 
JED 
(SHOUTING) Skin of your teeth, man! 
MURPHY (tapping his watch) Yeah, we're on a tight schedule! 
BLAZE So what are you waiting for? Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY 
A FREIGHT TRAIN thunders across the landscape. To the East Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course. Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to the tracks. Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his saddles bags -- -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia. Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away -- -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He jams the front brake on at the last possible moment -- The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three- sixty up into the car -- 
INSIDE THE CAR -- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS his exhilaration. And if you don't believe this, watch extreme motocross as we CUT TO: 
THE OPPOSITE DOOR being wrenched aside, revealing Coop's pickup holding steady alongside the train. Jed and Murphy ride the cargo bed like surfers. Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck. Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em. We get glimpses of the loot: CD Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage -- 
JED Christ, Mickey was right on the money! 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Blaze enters. The apartment is dark- TV flickers. Roxanne is sleeping on the couch. On the coffee table: Chinese leftovers, fortune cookies. 
BLAZE Hey. She's sound asleep. He crouches, touches her face. 
BLAZE (CONT' D) Hey. Roxanne barely stirs, deeply groggy. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) Everything's cool. 
ROXANNE 
(SLURRED) You're going to jail. 
BLAZE No. No. Everything's okay. Jed and Murph just got a little boisterous at The Prairie Dog last night. Cops wanted to read us the riot act, that's all -- She yawns, curls up, starts to drift away again. 
ROXANNE I was worried about you. And I don't like your friends. But Blaze won't let her go back to sleep. He jostles her. 
BLAZE Listen, I want to show you something -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ROXANNE I'm sure you do. But I'm half-asleep and you're an ass-hole. 
BLAZE I'm serious, Rox. This is important. He drags her up off the couch. Makes her stand up. She MOANS, scowls, but he gets her on her feet. 
ROXANNE John, I have to go to work tomorrow 
BLAZE (offers her coat) Put your coat on. You'll be glad you did. Promise. It'll be an adventure. A mystery tour. 
ROXANNE This better be good. She stomps to the bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals a fortune cookie from the left-overs, snaps it open -- The fortune is blank. Both sides. He tosses it away. 
CUT TO: 
COYOTE EYES glittering black, watching. 
ROXANNE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Alright, I'm here. Now what? 
EXT. DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 
Blaze and Roxanne creep through a hole in the outer fence, making their way to -- 
BLAZE Keep going. It's just up there. 
A BROKEN-DOWN CAROUSEL Must have been magnificent in its day. 
ROXANNE I'm not riding one of those stupid horses. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAZE You don't have to ride, just climb up. She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him. 
ROXANNE You're going to have to grow up one day, Johnny Blaze. 
BLAZE Not if I can help it. He follows her up onto the ride. She weaves through the wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this secret adventure. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) Keep going, keep going -- She comes around the other side, catches her breath. The whole valley is spread out before her -- a glorious scatter of diamonds on velvet. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) Uh-oh. 
ROXANNE 
(TURNING BACK) What? 
BLAZE Ever hear of a carnival wedding? Roxanne shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new dollar bill, folding it, making something. 
BLAZE Fuck. 
BLAZE'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR POV: The cop car is turning, heading back in their direction. 
ROXANNE 
JOHN -- Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer leaps. 
EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT 
The EL Camino screams through the rain, with the cop car in dogged pursuit. TWO MORE POLICE CARS fall in behind them. 
INT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT 
Blaze fights to keep it together. The road ahead is dangerously winding. Tires SQUEAL as he hauls a sketchy turn. Roxanne gasps, fearful, bracing herself. The police are gaining. FLASHING LIGHTS flood the interior. 
ROXANNE Slow down, John -- Another sketchy turn. Blaze spins the wheel, brakes, hard. Too hard. The car hydroplanes, finds purchase -- 
ROXANNE (CONT ' D ) 
SLOW DOWN! LIGHTNING flashes, and suddenly, there's a 
COYOTE or, the road, right in their path. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Blaze jerks the wheel. Roxanne SCREAMS. The car skids, slews off the road, CRASHES through a guard rail -- It plunges down a washout, flips end over end, shedding glass and wreckage, finally SLAMMING to a dead stop at the bottom of a rocky arroyo. 
INSIDE THE EL CAMINO Blaze stirs, blood streaming down his face. The windshield is blown open. Rain pours in. 
BLAZE Roxanne --? He struggles to free himself from his seat, SEES a torn seat belt hanging beside him -- the passenger seat mr)ty. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) Roxanne?! 
EXT. ARROYO - NIGHT 
Blaze scrambles out through the broken windshield. Falls off the wreck onto the steep, muddy incline. He tries to stand, can barely manage to crawl. 
BLAZE (terror seizing him) 
ROXANNE!!! 
ON ROXANNE lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe dead. Blaze scrambles to her, rolls her over. He hauls her into his arms, SOBBING, the two of them covered in mud and glass and God knows what. 
TROOPERS are coming down the incline, guns drawn, FLASHLIGHTS beaming. They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of Roxanne. 
BLAZE (O.S. ) (CONT'D) Let me see her! God-Dammit! I have a right to see her -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON Blaze, grief-struck, handcuffed, thrashing about as Troopers try cc restrain him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAZE Get your fucking hands off me! Lucas Cole, the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier, approaches. Blaze SEES him and calms down a little. 
BLAZE (CONY' D) Please. Just let me see her. Cole nods to his men, who ease up on Blaze. He guides Blaze over to an observation window -- 
THEIR POV Roxanne lays in a surgery bay, DOCTORS and NURSES milling around her. 
DOCTOR (O.S.) Mr. Blaze --? Blaze turns, SEES a nervous DOCTOR standing behind him. 
BLAZE Is she going to make it? 
DOCTOR (blinks, stutters) Mr. Blaze, I -- 
BLAZE )_a ch= going r4 make i r? 
NOMI It's too much, baby. Put it back. I don't have enough money for that. Rain stares right at Nomi -- and brazenly slips the doll into her coat pocket. Nomi glances at the Clerk. He didn't notice. 
EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN/DEADFALL GAS STATION - DUSK 
It's pouring rain. Nomi and Rain hurry across the muddy lot towards a ratty pickup. 
CARRIGAN (O.S.) Yeah, I found her. Came back to be with her dying grandpappy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT BILLY-RAY CARRIGAN (30s) paces under an tire bay awning, talking on a cell-phone. He's handsome, charming, but there's evil lurking within that slick exterior. A pencil- thin scar runs just under one eye. 
CARRIGAN (CONT'D) Don't worry. She's got the kid with her. Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup. The pickup chokes to life, carves out of the lot. Carrigan nods 
TO -- -- LANDSDALE ( 40s), a stone-faced criminal, who motions to five other thugs lounging nearby -- FUSCO, ALBRIGHT, CHUDACOFF, LLOYD and ODELL. 
CARRIGAN (CONT'D) (listening, impatient) I remember the deal. Just make sure you bring the money. He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting nearby -- a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan. Carrigan pulls a Glock from his waistband, chambers a round. 
CARRIGAN (CONT'D) Who wants to be a millionaire? Landsdale smiles back, an awful smile. 
WOMAN (V.O.) Some people are born bad. That's just the way they come into the world. Something goes wrong. Something breaks inside of them -- The trucks pull away, tires ploughing muddy tracks, passing two STRAY DOGS fighting over a bloody road-kill carcass. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - BEDROOM - DUSK 
Blaze sweeps aside a curtain, studies the slowly darkening landscape outside with tired resignation. 
WOMAN (V.0.) -- and they spend the rest of their lives trying to make up for it. CLICK' Blaze Curns on the TV, watches a weather snippet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PAN OVER Blaze's belongings on the bureau -- a duffle bag, old photographs of his previous life with Roxanne, a collection of blank postcards. Tucked amidst the photos is a sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child. 
WEATHERMAN -- scattered thunderstorms firing along a stalled frontal boundary. Damaging winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes will be possible across the Dakotas and Upper 
MIDWEST -- Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it. The map is crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city, along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations. Blaze traces his finger down to his present location: DEADFALL. 
EXT. ROAD - DUSK 
A lonesome service road threads through bleak wild-grass prairie. Nomi's pickup appears on the horizon. 
INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - DUSK 
Nomi glances at Rain, who clutches her new skeleton toy. 
NOMI Seatbelt. Rain dutifully fastens herself in. 
NOMI (CONT'D) Hey, bug. You hungry? Rain shakes her head- 
NOMI (CONT'D) Want to listen to music? (off Rain's sullen shrug) Look, we won't have to keep moving around forever, okay? I'll figure something out. I promise. Rain looks at her mother. She's heard it all before- WHAM! Somebody rams the truck from behind. Rain SCREAMS. 
INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK 
Blaze reaches for a pack of cigarettes, lights a match. He stares at the match flame for a moment -- for the flame is behaving strangely, bending towards Blaze as if it were drawn -o T>; m. Blaze shakes out the match, then retrieves -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE COYOTE/EAGLE COIN He stares at it ruefully, then places it on the map and sets it spinning. We get the sense that this is a ritual he has performed many times before. As we MOVE IN on the coin -- 
EXT. ROAD - DUSK 
CRASH! The Tundra rams Nomi's pickup again. Nomi fights to keep control. Aims for a turn-off up ahead. She hauls the truck into the turn, fights the roll-over, barely makes it -- -- but it's not fast enough. The Tundra and the Bronco make the turn too. Their HEADLIGHTS blaze into the cab. Nomi floors the gas. The pickup judders. The road here is bumpier, cracked and pocked. The Bronco swings out, pulls up alongside Nomi. She glimpses Landsdale, LAUGHING, urging Carrigan on. Carrigan cuts right, SLAMS the Bronco into Nomi's side. 
INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK 
On Blaze, watching the coin with a growing sense of fatalism. Spinning. Spinning. But starting to slow now -- 
EXT_ ROAD - DUSK WHAM! The Bronco collides with Nomi's door again. Glass shatters- Rain WAILS, terrified. Wind and rain rush in -- BLOWOUT! Front offside tire. Nomi loses it, careens right, carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert, SMASHING over rocks, sagebrush, fence posts and barbed wire -- After a few dozen tortured yards, the pickup shudders to a stop. The Bronco and the Tundra haul up nearby, engines CHUGGING like hungry beasts. 
CARRIGAN I'm not a psychologist. She's a fucking freak, alright? Always has been. Sooner I get her out of my sight, the better. 
THE COYOTE approaches the phone booth situated beside the rental office. Inside the booth, the man is half-seen. 
MAN She's the most important thing in your life, Carrigan. Make sure she arrives safely. 
(BEAT) And be careful. She'll kill if she gets the chance. The man hangs up, turns to look at the coyote staring up at him. Once again, we meet -- 
AMBROSE STARKE Same sky-blue eyes flecked with metal. Starke and Coyote stare at each other, indifferent to the storm raging around them- He starts towards the rental office. 
INT. LONE STAR RENT-A-CAR - DAY 
Windows RATTLE. The storm HOWLS. A portly rental agent, JIM PETROWSKY, is closing up shop. He gathers his papers, turns out the lights. A TV on the counter is on: 
WEATHERMAN -- experiencing extraordinary conditions. Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas, with reports of extensive damage and gusts of up to seventy miles per hour -- As Pecrowsky turns off the TV, we hear the door CHIME. Starke enters, bringing a strong gust of wind with him. 
PETROWSKY Sorry, guy, I'm just closing up. Starke looks to a clock on the wall -- it's 4:55. 
STARKE According to the hours posted outside, you're still open. 
{_.:D, NT7NI,=D) 
CONTINUED: 
PETROWSKY 
(EXASPERATED) Look, Mister, in case you hadn't noticed, there's a storm coming -- tornadoes, whatever. I'm trying to get out of here. Starke fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze. 
STARKE I would like to rent a car -- (reading Petrowsky's name tag) -- "Jim" . Something in Starke's tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances to the window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the coyote out there, watching from across the way. 
PETROWSKY 
(RELENTING) Okay, alright, have a seat. Starke sits. Petrowsky moves behind his desk. 
PETROWSKY (CONT'D) Now, Mr. --? 
STARKE Starke. First name, Ambrose. 
PETROWSKY (typing in the name) Starke, okay. What kind of car were you looking for? Starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various cars. 
STARKE What about the Cadillac Deville? I noticed you had one in your lot outside. 
PETROWSKY Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a full-size car? I can give you a Chevy Malibu, Ford Taurus -- Starke deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow stronger. Petrowsky shifts in his seat, trying to mask his impatience. Were he observant enough, he might also notice that the wall clock has stopped. 
(C:ï¿½ VT=`7:,'-') 
CONTINUED: (2) 
PETROWSKY (CONT' D) You want the Taurus? Give you a good deal, mid-size price. $37.99 a day, can't beat that. 
STARKE I had my heart set on the Cadillac, Jim. 
PETROWSKY 
(ANNOYED NOW) Caddy's taken. Now look, I'm trying to be accommodating here, but I really am in a hurry. So what's it going to be? Another beat as Starke stares Petrowsky down. Gradually, the lights in the office begin to dim. 
STARKE The Taurus, then. 
PETROWSKY Great. Can I see a driver's license? Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license. Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him. 
PETROWSKY (CONT' D ) How many days do you need it for? 
STARKE Two, three -- 
PETROWSKY Any other drivers? 
STARKE No. 
PETROWSKY And you'll be paying by --? 
STARKE Cash. 
A HAND slips under the body of the car.Butit's not a human hand. It's the hand of a beast -- blackandtwisted, taloned. With a sudden movement, the hand flipsthecar up, sending the enter vehicle spiraling into theair.The Boy lies there, exposed like a bug beneath an upturned rock. He looks up -- 
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) And what seems like cruel fate is really only Nature, red in tooth and claw. 
THE BOY'S POV We see a BRIEF FLASH of Starke. No longer a human silhouette, but a SNARLING, lupine beast. The Trickster. The Black Dog. Rushing towards us with open jaws as we -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BADLANDS - DAWN 
A HUMMER races along a desolate stretch of highway, passing through an inhospitable landscape of buttes, mesas, and cacti. 
INT. HUMMER - DAWN 
Carrigan drives. Landsdale rides shotgun, dozing. Odell is in back with Rain, her hands tightly bound. She keeps to herself, clutching her skeleton doll, stares out at the passing landscape. Odell offers her a bag of chips. 
ODELL Want some food, kid? Rain doesn't respond. Odell rustles the bag. 
ODELL (CONT'D) C'mon. Eat a chip or something. 
CARRIGAN She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up and get some sleep. 
ODELL I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the face of that thing, Lloyd 
BURNING -- (shaking his head) -- Christ. 
CARRIGAN Just put it out of your head. 
ODELL If I could put it out of my head, I wouldn't be awake now, would I? Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren landscape. 
CARRIGAN Look out there, what do you see? 
LANDSDALE Dick. 
CARRIGAN That's right. Miles and miles of nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing. How many people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten? Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn paper at the supermarket. You believe that shit, the whole country's being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers. 
(CAN":NC,'.-) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDSDALE (nodding, eyes closed) Probe you in the ass, they get the chance. 
ODELL What's your point, Mr. Serling? 
CARRIGAN My point is; everybody's seen somethina. Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever -- 
ODELL This wasn't no freaking Bigfoot! You see what it did to Albright? Punched his head clean off! 
CARRIGAN Look, I don't know what that thing was. All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt- load of money to deliver the kid to him. We were told we'd see things and we were told to look the other way. You want to cut out? I'll pull over right here. 
LANDSDALE Keep your shirt on, B. We didn't come this far just to limp home with nothing. Right, Odell? Odell settles back into his seat, uneasy. 
ODELL I guess. But I'd still like to know what that thing was. 
RAIN He's the Ghost Rider. Everybody looks at her. It's the first thing she's said. 
CARRIGAN 
(CHUCKLING) "The Ghost Rider"? Get that off the back of an Oakridge Boys album or something? You think that shit scares me? 
RAIN It should. He's going to kill you all. 
ODELL 
(FREAKING OUT) See? SiE? ! 
(MORE) (CO.JT N =i) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ODELL (CONT' D) That's what I'm talking about! Fucking Chatty Cathy sitting back here with me! Carrigan glances in the rear-view mirror, makes eye-contact with Rain, does his level-best not to be spooked. 
NOMI Never thought I'd be back here. They pass cautiously through the front yard. Nomi's pickup is parked nearby. The front door bangs back and forth. Nomi pulls a revolver from her waist-band. 
BLAZE I think they're gone. Off Nomi's look, Blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) Dual tracks. Looks like your old man switched to a Hummer. 
INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - DUSK 
Window panes RATTLE. The lights don't work. Blaze and Nomi pick their way through food containers and discarded detritus. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) Guess the boys camped out for a while. 
THE LIVING ROOM Dead leaves twirling. One whole side of the room is burned open, blackened and charred, the remaining timbers sealed with plastic sheeting. Nomi opens a drawer, rifles through singed papers -- finds an old PHOTO of her and Carrigan. 
NOMI Listen, those things Vince said -- 
BLAZE You don't have to explain yourself to me. 
NOMI Some of them are true. 
BLAZE Doesn't make you a bad person. 
CONTINUED: Nomi nods, but she's clearly agitated. Blaze crouches, traces his fingers over a stain on the wall. He can FEEL something. He shuts his eyes, opens them -- 
BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST) The room, many years earlier. Carrigan backhands Nomi across the face. The silent moment is caught in motion so slow it's virtually a tableau. 
BACK TO THE PRESENT 
BLAZE (CONT'D) He used to hit you. A statement, not a question. She nods. 
INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Nomi is reluctant to enter. Blaze is inside, SEES her hesitation -- she's staring at the bed. 
NOMI You can see the past? 
BLAZE Just echoes, sometimes. 
(BEAT) Tell me about Starke. Nomi hesitates, not wanting to relive this. 
NOMI I was dying. I'd shot myself full of Billy's best gear. Figured I'd teach him a lesson and go out in style. Blaze nods, but he doesn't see Nomi now. He SEES -- 
BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST) -- Nomi as she waS. An inch away from eternity. She is lying on the bed, staring upwards, shallow breaths- Above her, a MOTH flutters by a light, casting distorted shadows. 
BLAZE (V.O.) But it felt like a mistake. 
NOMI ON THE BED 
(WHISPERS) I don't want to die. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The lights begin to dim. We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching, muted and distorted, A SHADOW falls across Nomi -- 
STARKE stands above her. There are OTHER SHADOWS drifting in behind him. Things better left half-glimpsed. Coyotes. Beasts. 
NOMI (V.O.) He smiled and said -- As Starke starts to speak, we hear: 
BLAZE'S VOICE "You look like -- 
BACK TO THE PRESENT Blaze finishing the phrase, knowing the punch-line too well. 
BLAZE -- you could use some help." Nomi nods, hugs herself. 
NOMI And I took it. What else was I going to do? I don't know what happened after that. I'm not sure I ever want to -- (beat, struggling) All I know is, nine months later, Rain was born. 
FLASHBACK IMAGES Silent, disjointed. The moth. Nomi's face, terror-stricken. Starke, eyes alight with malice and mischief. 
BACK TO THE PRESENT Nomi turns away, trying to banish the memory. 
NOMI (CONT'D) Billy-Ray hated her from the moment she was born. He knew she wasn't his, knew she was different -- (re: the charred timbers) If I didn't leave he would've killed us both. 
INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Rodenburg buckles his pants, goes to the doorway, peers cautiously into the passage beyond. 
RODENBURG'S POV: Flaming leaves burn and twirl at the far end. Firelight flickers. The SCREAMS still come, sporadic and terrible. Rodenburg's mind is racing. He motions to Pennebaker, who drags Nomi off the bed and strong-arms her to the door. 
INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Rodenburg leads, gun ready. 
RODENBURG Doyle? Smoke and CRACKLING NOISES are building rapidly. The SHRIEKS persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere. Then -- --- movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting, fearful, eyes darting. He speaks in a strained whisper. 
WEINGROD What's going on, man? Where's Oswalt? GUNFIRE! Outside! CRASH! Something hits the house. Then more SCREAMS, more GUNFIRE, and a RUMBLE so deep it's deadly. Pennebaker panics, pushing past Rodenburg. 
PENNEBAKER I want out of here, I'm getting out! 
RODENBURG Keep your fucking voices down! 
WEINGROD He's burning the house, man! He's 
BURNING THE-- RED-HOT CHAINS whip viciously around Weingrod's head and torso. Then he's wrenched backwards, hauled straight through the plastic sheeting -- 
THE GHOST RIDER bursts through the melting plastic, hauls his red-hot monster bike up on its back wheel -- Rodenburg and Pennebaker run for their lives, falling into the fire-lit passage. The Ghost Rider screeches across the living room, setting the place aflame as he passes through. Nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where she was, SEES the fiery monster crash straight through the wall -- Rodenburg and Pennebaker run through the flames, stumbling over Doyle's charred body -- 
EXT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
They burst out the front door, clothes alight, racing across the yard towards their vehicles. Rodenburg looks back -- The Ghost Rider EXPLODES through the front of the house, skids to a halt, flicks out a chain -- and snags Rode burgs ankle. He falls, SCREAMING. The chain retracts -- Pennebaker reaches his vehicle, struggles with the door - TheGhost Rider thrusts a clawed hand outwards,clenchesthe air and hauls it back in. Like an explosion in reverse, 4,11 fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being. A frozen moment. All terrified eyes on the Ghost Rider Then he lets rip. Hurls the energy back out as a torus of white hot fire that expands across the yard, BLASTS Rodenburg's shirt from his back, SMASHES Pennebaker against his vehicle -- The vehicles EXPLODE, gas tanks rupturing. Pennebaker is blown to pieces. Rodenburg SCREAMS, shields his face. Fire and debris rain down in every direction. The Ghost Rider looms over him. More accurately, it's -- 
GHOST BLAZE Half man, half monster, his pitiless skull-face hazing and flickering between human and inhuman states. 
GHOST BLAZE Where are they taking the girl? Rodenburg whimpers. Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg's hair, wrenches his head back. 
GHOST BLAZE (CONT'D) Where. Are_ They. Taking. Her? 
RODENBURG 
(BEYOND TERRIFIED) North! They're headed North, into Oregon, oh, god, fuck -- 
GHOST BLAZE Where? 
RODENBURG I don't know exactly, Jesus, I don't know! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Blue-white fire floods down Blaze's arm and engulfs Rodenburg. The poor man screams, struggles to break free -- aze simply crrows Otte ana ac and the Ghost Rider's evil countenance submerges every trace of Blaze's humanity. Then it's over. The flames evaporate. Rodenburg's corpse crumbles to dust. Wind HOWLS. The Ghost Rider is gone. 
ON BLAZE He SEES the corpses, the burning vehicles, tries to deny the horror. But it's always the same -- another swath of destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity. 
NOMI He told you everything he knew. She's ten yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer. 
NOMI (CONT'D) Told you everything -- 
(BEAT) -- you didn't have to do that. 
BLAZE You asked for my help. I warned you what you were getting into. More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE SIRENS on the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT 
A sub-par motel 6. Nomi's battered pickup is parked outside. We HEAR Blaze's tortured MOANS coming from within. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Blaze sits in a chair, shirt off, Nomi at his side. She's trying to help him patch up his wounds, but the enormity of the damage and the sheer amount of blood is daunting. 
NOMI I don't -- I don't know what else to do for you -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NOMI (almost afraid to ask) What about the baby? Blaze just shakes his head. 
BLAZE It's funny. That kid was supposed to be my second chance. Rox and I used to talk about it -- how things'd be different after she was born. Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability. 
NOMI Maybe that's why we have them 
BLAZE What, kids? 
NOMI 
(NODDING) So we can make amends for all the royal fuck-ups we've perpetrated on the world. God knows I've had my share. (beat, pained) I just don't want her to have to pay for the things I've done. You know? Blaze nods. He knows all too well. He and Nomi drive on in silence for a beat, their thoughts turning inwards. 
NOMI (CONT'D) Can I ask you something? Honestly? (off Blaze's nod) What're you going to do when you find Starke? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BLAZE Make him pay, somehow -- 
(UNCERTAIN) I don't know. How do you beat the Devil? Walk up and bitch-slap him? Pretend you're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka up his hind ass? I'm basically making this up as I go along. Nomi smiles. 
NOMI I'm sure you'll figure something out.

INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - NIGHT 
-- Rain looking out through the truck's moon roof, watching stars passing overhead. As the sky above slowly brightens in time-lapse, Rain's eyes grow lidded. She sleeps, clutching her skeleton toy and -- 
INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - DAY 
-- waking sunlight floods the cabin. New shift. Odell drives. Rain rides shotgun. Carrigan and Landsdale are sacked out in back. The radio drones, laced with STATIC. Tedium. No one slept well. Carrigan stares out at the passing plains, expertly cutting a deck of cards one-handed. He SEES a scarecrow go by, standing ragged in the middle of nowhere. Then his cell phone RINGS. Carrigan flips it open -- 
CARRIGAN Yeah? Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow. 
CARRIGAN (CONT'D) Rodenburg's dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all those other inbred losers too. (off Landsdale's look) Looks like my ex-bitch has hooked up with the fire guy -- In the rear-view mirror, Odell's eyes grow wide. 
ODELL No fucking way -- Carrigan ponders, nods to Landsdale. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIGAN We're going to need reinforcements, some kind of escort to the meet. 
LANDSDALE I know a guy. Got some boys given over to wickedness and such. 
CARRIGAN (tosses him the phone) Make the call. 
RAIN (0.5.) He'll find me, you know. Her voice makes Odell jump. He thought she was asleep 
ODELL (fretful, pleading) 
BILLY-RAY -- 
CARRIGAN (to Rain, leans forwards) Hey, kiddo, you're worrying my boy here. So shut your goddamn mouth -- 
RAIN You can't tell me what to do. You're not my father. Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan settles back, but he's pissed. 
CARRIGAN You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm just the dumb-ass that financed your whole fucking life. You and your mother both. And what did I get for that selfless act of stupidity? She burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by. He's referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away. Huddles against the door. 
LANDSDALE Believe me, I could care less what Starke wants with you. Make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to. It's not like you came springing out of my loins. Only thing I care about now is getting what's mine, and that's -- 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LANDSDALE (CONT'D) (counting on his fingers) -- payment and retribution, got it? She's not listening. Her bound hands are secretly pushed down into the tight gap between the seat and the door. 
Blaze and Nomi crest a rise in the field, hunker down: 
THEIR POV: We can see the main compound of the quarry from here. Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the guardhouse. 
NOMI You think she's in there? Blaze nods. 
NOMI (CONT'D) Then let's go -- Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back. 
BLAZE No. We'll wait. 
(POINTEDLY) Dawn's less than an hour away. 
NOMI (taking out her gun) You wait. I'm heading in. 
BLAZE Look, they're not going anywhere. 
NOMI You don't know that. This is probably the best chance we'll get. They're sitting ducks. We can do this if you -- 
BLAZE If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their spirits? 
(DRAWING CLOSER) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAZE (CONT'D) You still get it, do you? The Ghost Rider whales on whoever's got it coming, but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to remember their faces. And I Lb remember them. Every last one. Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES. Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up the service road on ratted-out Harleys. 
NOMI They know we're coming, don't they? Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him. 
NOMI (CONT'D) I'm going in. You with me or not? 
EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Landsdale opens the main gate. The bikers THUNDER into the compound -- low-rent Hell's Angel types culled form the shallow end of the gene pool known as the Gray Gargoyles. ARLO SKINNER, the Gargoyle's CEO, climbs off his hog, adjusts his nut-sack. As he approaches Landsdale. GUNT and CHESTER PULSIFER, his identical twin lieutenants, fall in behind. 
ARLO Brotherman. 
LANDSDALE Arlo. 
ARLO 
(GRINNING) I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers, Chester and Gunt? 
EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT 
Blaze and Nomi scramble over a fence, then drop down, crouch- running to avoid a security camera. They hug the shadows. At least a dozen of the Gargoyles are in view, lounging around, shooting the shit. 
BLAZE I'll find her. You stay here. Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAZE (CONT'D) If things go South and the Ghost Rider takes over, I can't guarantee he won't -- 
NOMI I know. I'm on my own. (beat, more plaintive now) , Just bring her back to me. That's all I care about. 
BLAZE 
(NODDING) Start disabling the bikes. Last thing we need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks on our tail. Rip out all the coil wires --- Blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him. Nomi rolls her eyes and pulls out a switchblade, deftly slicing through a fuel line. Gasoline leaks onto the ground. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) 
(CHAGRINED) -- or you could do that. As Blaze creeps away: 
NOMI 
BLAZE -- (as he turns back) Whatever happens -- 
BLAZE You're welcome. Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes. 
LANDS DALE He's telling the truth, Arlo. The guy ain't human. Saw him torch Albright and Chudacoff with my own eyes. 
(CONTINUED) 
- CONTINUED: 
BACK IN CORRIDOR Blaze presses against the wall, desperately trying to rein the Ghost Rider in -- but FOOTSTEPS are coming. A Gargoyle is round; c the corner! 
INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT 
Gunt rips open his shirt, shows a chest covered in tattoos. 
GUNT Well, I say bring him on. You see this ink? That's a hundred hours under the needle. A motherfucking canvas of pain. He and Chester here, we're not afraid of fuck-diddly! 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
The Gargoyle passes the doorway, lights up a smoke. Or tries to. The flame from his Zippo is bending sideways. He tries a couple more times. Same thing. Weird. 
ON BLAZE hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to contain himself. If the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him. The Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an OPEN WINDOW nearby. He shuts it, lights his cigarette, turns back -- b= Blaze has moved on. 
INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT 
Arlo settles back in his chair. 
ARLO If this guy's as lethal as you say he is, I want fifty for me, another fifty for the club. Only you can't let the boys know we're takin' a 50K rake off the top, see? 
CARRIGAN How `bout sixty and I'll throw in a kilo of coke? 
ARLO 
(INCREDULOUS) Coke? That's like selling snow to Eskimos. You think I'm some kind of crack-smoking foolio or something? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIGAN 
(SIGHING) Seventy, then. Arlo reaches into his shoulder-holster, whipping out a mean looking nickel-plated Colt 44 Anaconda. 
ARLO Ninety, and not a nickel less, you fucking pillow-biter. 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Blaze continues, agitated. Where the fuck is the kid? He looks through a doorway, SEES -- 
TEN OR MORE brutish gargoyles drinking beer and cleaning their weapons. Blaze drops back. His snarling face contorts, starts to assume that awful skullish quality. The Ghost Rider wants out. mow. But Blaze fights, shoves it back down and deep. SOMETHING moves to Blaze's right -- a TINY WHITE FIGURE, lolling and flopping at the far end of the passage. 
EXT. QUARRY - COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Nomi slices through another fuel line, inadvertently drawing the attention of a Gargoyle who was taking a leak. He zips up his jeans, starts towards her -- 
INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT 
Carrigan grins, trying to calm the situation. 
CARRIGAN E a sy, gentlemen. No need to get all truculent on me. 
ARLO Truculent? You get that out of a Scrabble dictionary or something? What the fuck does "truculent" mean? (grabbing Carrigan by his shirt) I'll tell you what it means. It means 
FUCK YOU! 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Blaze stares, hypnotised, his face flickering from skull to flesh and back again. The tiny figure is Rain's SKELETON DOLL, held upright, unsteady, by some unseen force. 
THAT MOMENT, ELSEWHERE - RAIN'S FACE Extreme mental concentration. Temples pounding. Her eyes are fluttering, rolled to white. 
BACK TO BLAZE as he starts towards the toy skeleton. He's in agony now, each breath a cough of fire, each footstep igniting the floorboards. He SEES a storage room up ahead -- 
INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT 
A juggernaut trajectory crashing through wall after blazing wall. The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, HURLS Gunt to the floor. Senses SOMEONE behind him -- 
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER, blasting the Ghost Rider's head. The Ghost Rider SQUEALS and for a split-second, the demon's flames are actually snuffed out. The cloud clears. The Ghost Rider glimpses 
ODELL rushing into another room, SLAMMING a steel door behind. 
INT. QUARRY - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 
Odell pauses in the darkness, hyperventilating. Outside, we hear the heavy FOOTFALLS of the Ghost Rider approaching. 
INT. QUARRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The Ghost Rider places a skeletal hand against the steel door. His hand GLOWS WHITE HOT, like an acetylene torch. The steel door begins to bubble and melt. 
INT. QUARRY - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 
The door to the storage room liquefies, flowing apart like molten lava. The Ghost Rider steps through and -- -- in the light cast by .he demon's owing hand. Odell realizes that the room is stacked with high explosives. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Nomi's pickup races into the night. A distant FIREBALL ERUPTS hugely, engulfing the quarry, setting off a chain reaction of smaller explosions -- BA-BOOM-BOOM-B-B-BOOOOM! 
EXT/INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - NIGHT 
Rain clutches at Nomi, frantic, looking back. 
RAIN What about the Ghost Rider? We have to go back for him! 
NOMI Are you crazy?! Sit down! Then Nomi glances in the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God. 
THE GHOST RIDER is coming after them. HOWLING, plowing through the inferno on his hellcycle. Nomi floors the gas. But the pickup is already maxed out. The Ghost Rider easily gains on the truck, leaving a wake of burning asphalt. He lashes out with his chains, snags the back bumper. The chain-links slice deep into the steel bodywork. The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel -- Nomi slams on the brakes. The truck fishtails. The Ghost Rider rear-ends the pickup. Bike and demon cartwheel crazily into the cargo bed, SLAMMING explosively against the back window of the cab. Hot glass showers Nomi and Rain -- The Ghost Rider is pinned, SQUEALING, entangled with his bike. Nomi floors it again. The truck leaps ahead -- -- but the Ghost Rider hangs on as his bike slides backwards. He reaches into the cab, clutching at Nomi. The pickup thunders up a rise -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Ghost Rider's skeletal fingers clamp Nomi's shoulder. She HOWLS in pain, her clothing beginning to smoke. Rain tries to help, imploring -- 
RAIN No, no, no -- 
EXT/INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - DAY 
The truck makes the rise -- and there's THE SUN, dawning huge and white. flaring mightily over the distant horizon. 
THE GHOST RIDER recoils, blinded by the dawn. He releases Nomi, collapses backwards. His fire extinguishes, his skull-face fades -- -- and Blaze lies in the pickup bed, shaking. Nomi glances back through the shattered cab window, her face a mask of fear and sympathy. Blaze looks to Gunt's bike, which has also reverted to its original state, then SEES -- 
BLAZE'S POV: The bad guys coming on battered bikes -- Arlo, Chester, plus FOUR OTHER GARGOYLES. And bringing up the rear, a seven ton Mack dumper driven by Carrigan. Landsdale rides shotgun. Blaze looks to Nomi, SHOUTS over the wind: 
BLAZE Give me your gun! Nomi passes it back. The Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt's cycle off the pickup bed The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the first Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debris 
EXT. INTERSECTION/HIGHWAY - DAY 
Nomi runs a stops sign, slews across a rural intersection, pounds the HORN, swerving to avoid the crossing cars -- 
AN ONCOMING TANKER TRUCK brakes, jack-knifes. Four gargoyles make it past, the fifth is flattened. The Mack comes last, SMASHING a passing minivan into a spin -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANGLE ON A GAS STATION A STATE TROOPER, hidden from view, hits his SIREN, gives 
CHASE -- 
BACK TO ARLO AND THE OTHER GARGOYLES Gaining, riddling the pickup with BULLETS. Blaze is pinned in the bed, can't get off a shot -- 
ON CHESTER PULSIFER, hanging back and riding one-handed. He hefts a 66mm LAWs rocket on his shoulder, LAUNCHES it -- Near miss. But the impact lifts the pickup's rear axle into the air. Nomi SCREAMS. Blaze hangs on for dear life. 
ON CARRIGAN, hauling the Mack alongside Chester -- 
CARRIGAN (yelling from the cab) The hell you doing? I need the kid alive!!! 
Simple and clean. Rain locks the door, goes to the window and opens it wide -- a beautiful day outside, hills rolling down to a busy town a mile distant. Nomi drops her bag, sits wearily on the bed, peels her jacket open -- revealing a nasty shoulder wound. Burned to the bone, the impression of fingers clearly evident. Rain hurries to help, rummages antiseptics and bandages from Nomi's bag. Together, they clean the wound. Nomi's pain is clear, but she keeps it quiet. 
RAIN Are we safe now? Nomi regards her sadly. She's never been one to tell lies. 
NOMI Honey, I don't know if we'll ever be safe. Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about her look -- far too fatalistic for a child her age. 
RAIN He talks to me sometimes. 
NOMI Who? 
RAIN My father -- (beat, hesitant) -- when I'm dreaming. 
NOMI 
(FEARFUL) What does he say? Rain starts to cry now, suddenly overwhelmed. Despite her eerily calm demeanor, she's still a child. And a frightened one at that. 
RAIN I don't want to be like him, mom. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NOMI You won't. 
RAIN 
(SOBBING) You don't know that. 
NOMI Yes, I do, baby -- Nomi hugs her, desperate, as if the world were ending. Outside, across the land, the sun shines gloriously bright. 
NOMI (CONT'D) -- yes I do. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. COUNTY JAIL - BLAZE'S CELL - DAY 
On Blaze, immobile. Waiting for nightfall. Shadows lengthen around him in TIME-LAPSE as the day begins to die. He starts to shake. Tears streak from his eyes, burn his cheeks. 
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CARRIGAN'S CELL - DAY 
On Carrigan, in his cell at the end of the corridor. He's nervous, cutting a deck of cards. 
EXT. LANDSCAPES - VARIOUS - DAY/DUSK 
Ants feed on a praying mantis. An owl pulls at a recently killed mouse. Day TIME-LAPSES to dusk. Thunder RUMBLES.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DUSK 
Rain sleeps. Storm fingers scratch at the window. Nomi steps out of the shower. Towels off. Checks on Rain. She contemplates her sleeping child a moment, then taps a pack of Camels, realizes she's out. 
EXT. MOTEL - WALKWAY - DUSK 
Nomi quietly closes the door. Walks to the far end where the vending machines are HUMMING. CLUNK. A fresh pack of smokes. She tears it open, then notices --

A MOTH fluttering by an outdoor light, casting distorted shadows on the stucco wall. Nomi stares, uneasy, something tugging at- her memory as we SEE -- 
A BRIEF FLASH OF THE PAST Nomi back on the bed, ODing. The SHADOW of Starke falling over her. The moth fluttering above. 
BACK TO THE PRESENT as Nomi turns to the parking lot, SEES a coyote slouching out of the gathering darkness. And she knows. 5-ba fucking knows. 
WOMAN (V . 0 . ) My father used to say that the only way evil came into your life -- 
INT. COUNTY JAIL - BLAZE AND CARRIGAN'S CELLS - DUSK 
Blaze waiting, internal. Carrigan manically cutting his deck of cards. Over and over. Blaze suddenly CRIES OUT, throwing himself onto the floor. He begins to writhe as the other prisoners jeer at him. 
INT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT 
FADE IN from white. Another aftermath. A circus of PARAMEDICS, POLICE, FIREMEN and REPORTERS. Every corner is blackened, every bar twisted and melted. Charred CORPSES are scattered like matchsticks. 
BOOTS are coming. We've seen them before. These boots belong to -- 
STARKE navigating his way through the bedlam. He passes between rushing emergency personnel, steps over a writhing VICTIM -- -- but no one seems to notice his presence. And as he progresses to the far end of the cell block, the cacophony fades, leaving only his FOOTSTEPS as he turns into -- 
CARRIGAN'S CELL Carrigan is terribly burned, but still clinging to life. Frantic paramedics are running an IV, struggling to stabilize him. His fear-filled eyes grow dim, then abruptly snap into focus as he SEES -- 
STARKE (O.S.) You look like you could use some help. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: -- Starke standing over him, his gaze stoic and pitiless. 
STARKE (CONT' D) You lost her, Carrigan. What happened? 
CARRI GAN (a choking sob) -- you didn't tell us -- what he was Carrigan starts to slip away. The SOUNDS of the outside world begin to intrude once more. Starke kneels, touching a hand to Carrigan's chest. The world ebbs away again. The paramedics continue their work, oblivious. Carrigan MOANS. 
CARRIGAN (CONT'D) -- please, I don't want to die -- Starke's arctic eyes gleam bright with mischief. 
STARKE If I could save you, would you be willing to make a deal? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT CEMETERY - DAWN 
Blaze sits against an old grave marker, gun in hand. Thousand-yard stare in his eyes. He contemplates the gun 
SILENT MEMORIES assault him -- good times with Roxanne, happy times, making the onrush that much more unbearable. We INTERCUT -- 
ROXANNE, radiant at the beach. Flickering sunshine makes her squint. 
BACK TO BLAZE, here and now, cocking the gun, turning it back on himself. 
ROXANNE folding clothes, seen through a sunny doorway. 
BACK TO BLAZE, fingering the trigger of the gun, edging closer to the unknown, the terrors that the afterlife holds for him.

ROXANNE Her laughing face, loving Blaze from across a dinner table. 
BACK TO BLAZE suppressing a sob. The pain is too much. It's overwhelming -- 
ROXANNE and Blaze at the obstetrician's. On the sonogram monitor, w e SEE unborn child shifting positions within Roxanne's womb, PUSH IN on the eerily beautiful image and -- 
BACK TO BLAZE Fuck it. He presses the barrel against his forehead. Squeezes his eyes tightly shut, compresses the trigger -- -- but he can't do it. He lowers the gun, weeping with frustration and -- freezes, head cocked like he heard a voice. He scans the cemetery: graves, trees, nothing. Then he spins around --- 
RAIN stands behind him, waif-like. Big, melancholy eyes. They stare at each other for a long time, not knowing what to say. 
RAIN My mother is dead. The statement hangs. Another death. Another failure of Blaze's part. 
BLAZE How--? 
RAIN My father found us, just like she knew he would. Rain looks down at Blaze's hand -- the gun resting there. Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed. The wind picks up. Rain looks to the graves. 
RAIN (CONT' D) What do you think happens when you die? Do you think there's a heaven? 
BLAZE I don't know. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
RAIN 
(INSISTENT) But what do you think? Blaze studies Rain. This kid is hurting. What she needs now, is reassurance. And try as he might, Blaze just can' t seem to harden his heart against her. 
BLAZE Look, you must have a cot, something. The kid's hungry -- 
RHYMER (O.S. ) I'm sure we can figure something out. JOE RHYMER, 50s, approaches, silences Tolbein with a look. He's down to earth, capable, wearing a black shirt, cleric's collar, oily jeans, and muddy work boots. 
RHYMER (CONT'D) (offering his hand) Joe Rhymer. I'm the Padre. 
BLAZE This is Rain. 
RHYMER Rain? That's a pretty name. 
(TO RAIN) You hungry, Rain? Would you like something to eat? Rain nods. Rhymer ushers them inside. As he moves to follow, Tolbein stops him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TOLBEIN Bottom line, Father. There's something wrong with those two. Especially the kid. 
RHYMER Duly noted, Richard. 
(POINTEDLY) And overruled. 
ANGLE ON A RAGGEDY FIGURE jutting into frame in the foreground. Blaze pauses at the threshold of the chapel, looks back, uneasy -- but it's just a SCARECROW being buffeted about by the wind. 
INT. MISSION - CHAPEL - DAY 
Rhymer leads Blaze down the central aisle. The chapel is dark, lit by candle-light, crowded with scaffolding and drop- sheets. As Blaze walks, the flames of the candles bend in his direction -- as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force. 
BLAZE Those men outside -- 
RHYMER Most of them are on a work-release program. We're a halfway house for ex- offenders. We try to get people on their feet, reintegrate them into society. Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive. 
RHYMER (CONT'D) (misreading Blaze's look) Don't worry, you're perfectly safe here. But of course, that's not what Blaze is thinking.

BUILDERS working. Men carrying provisions. There's a small vegetable garden in the center of the courtyard. Rain helps the GARDENER pull carrots. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Blaze watches from a distance, cleaned up, clothes laundered-- Rhymer approaches, gestures to the garden. 
RHYMER It's turned out beautiful, hasn't it? We try to be as self sufficient as we can, back to the earth and all that. He notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun. 
RHYMER (CONT'D) You any good with diesel engines? 
BLAZE I know my way around a flywheel housing. 
RHYMER Well I've got a generator out back that's been on life support the last few weeks. Mind helping me try to resuscitate it? Blaze looks at him curiously. 
BLAZE Sure. 
INT. BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Blaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old generator. There are a number of vehicles stored around them, including a pair of dusty motorcycles. 
RHYMER So how long have you been running? 
BLAZE What do you mean? 
RHYMER You know what I mean. You spend as much time around lost souls as I have, you learn how to read a man's face. 
(NODDING) You want to hand me that crescent wrench? Blaze hands Rhymer the wrench, who then makes an adjustment. 
RHYMER (CONT'D) Take the girl, for instance. She's not your daughter, is she?

Blaze rolls the Norton to a stop. Kills the engine. Sits back in the saddle and drinks in the night. The moonlit landscape is profoundly silent, the starry sky clear and awesome. Nothing stirs.

CONTINUED: Not a cricket, not a lizard. Just the moonlit expanse of ocean below. Then we hear THUNDER, like distant artillery. Blaze looks back over his shoulder -- 
BLAZE'S POV Distant thunderheads. LIGHTNING flickering. CLOSE ON Blaze, trying to drive Rain from his mind. We can SEE on his face that it's a losing battle -- for poor, cursed Johnny Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth.

INT. MISSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Claws and jaws and razor-beaks tearing frenziedly through wood and plaster and lathe. Rhymer, Rain, Nunez and Tolbein struggle to repel the monsters, beating them back with whatever is at hand -- -- but the jaw-beasts and razor birds are winning, forcing their way into the kitchen -- Nunz is snagged. Slashing claws swarm all over him. The others try to pull him free -- Rhymer wastes two more precious SHOTS, but Nunez is lost. Dragged SCREAMING into the storm of mouths and claws. The survivors fall back as the door gives and -- 
THE SCARECROW pitches through the opening, lurching forward. Jaw-beasts fall in behind him. Razor birds whirl around his head. The survivors scramble for the far exit. Rain opens every gas burner on the grill as she passes by -- but the far exit is locked. And Rhymer doesn't have the key! BOOM! Rhymer shotguns the lock! The lock fractures, but the exit still won't open. Tolbein starts kicking. Rhymer aims 
AGAIN --

RHYMER What?

SHOOT THE GAS! Rhymer hears the ranges HISSING and FIRES. CHOOM! The gas fireballs, catches Scarecrow full-on sideways. He squeals, reels. Burning jaw-beasts writhe and howl. Rain falls to the floor, dropping the coyote coin. It spins furiously as we --

Blaze. Coming back. Ninety_ One hundred. Wind tears wildly at his hair, jacket. The bike shudders. The tachometer edges upwards -- One twenty. One twenty-five. Nitrous booster. The Norton SCREAMS. One thirty. One forty. One fifty -- HEAT streams off Blaze. FLAMES wisp from his nostrils. One sixty. One seventy. The tachometer SHATTERS. The engine smokes. The bike SHRIEKS, pushing the edge of mechanical reason. FLAMES explode from Blaze's mouth and eyes. His hands ignite. He CRIES OUT in agony. His body alters violently. His face warps. Bones crack and shift. Flesh shrinks and tightens as the skull-visage emerges. The bike changes too, red heat spreading throughout. Tortured metal SCREECHES. Straining machinery pops and bulges. Shafts lengthen into skeletal "bones". The saddle slouches. The tank distends -- WHOOMPF! The wheels ignite, then the whole bike. HELLFIRE streams, an extension of Blaze's rage. Blaze SCREAMS from the pit of his soul as the Ghost Rider claws itself into being, more manifest that ever before -- And that's when the bike really accelerates - -- so fast that its air wake churns the dust on each side.

THE GHOST RIDER erupts through the wall in DEEP SLOW MOTION, sending forth a majestic tsunami of fire and debris. The monster bike skids, carves floorboards like matchwood -- 
JAW-BEASTS AND RAZOR BIRDS hurl themselves out of its scorching path -- The Ghost Rider vaults from the saddle, sends the bike spinning at the scurrying monsters. It ninepins a few, takes out the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke -- 
THE CROW-THINGS are vanquished, squealing and flopping like living cinders. 
BUT THE JAW-BEASTS RECOVER, still aflame but very much alive. If anything, they seem emboldened by the fire. They circle the Ghost Rider, more and more of them joining the pack.

Lupine skulls burn. The Ghost Rider tears the monsters limb from limb. The room becomes the Seventh Circle of Hell, and at the heart of the Inferno, the Ghost Rider exults in the slaughter -- The whole mission is ablaze now, fire and churning smoke consuming everything in its path.

ON RAIN AND RHYMER Desperate for escape, the flames closing in on them. There's nowhere to go. Except a small HATCH, high up in the ceiling -- 
BACK TO SCENE Ghost Blaze HOWLS, in agony as the Scarecrow's superior evil dominates. He feebly extends a hand towards the flames nearby, trying to compel the fire to him. The flames twist, briefly bend in his direction. The Ghost Rider HOWLS with frustration. He needs the flames. He will die without them. He tries again, reaching, reaching -- 
THE FLAMES surrounding the two foes are starting to bend in earnest now, streaming towards Ghost Blaze's bony, begging fingertips The Scarecrow is oblivious. Just keeps pouring more misery into Ghost Blaze's body as -- 
EXT. MISSION - NIGHT 
-- the entire mission, which was only moments ago completely aflame, is now extinguishing itself. An inferno in retrograde, roiling inward -- 
INT. MISSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT 
-- raging flames bend and draw long -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: -- clouds of embers are pulled into coursing streams-.-- -- roiling fireballs are dragged wildly from walls, floors and ceilings -- -- flame and fury funneling thunderously into SCORCHING FIRE- SPOUTS that cyclone up and up and up into -- 
INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT 
-- Ghost Blaze from every direction. Suddenly Scarecrow finds himself at the heart of a back- drafting firestorm, a sustained implosion feeding straight into Ghost Blaze. Then -- Nuclear silence. An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch -- An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom -- Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now he's more than the Ghost Rider. He's a white-hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating with volcanic heat. And he DETONATES. An apocalyptic release that -- obliterates Scarecrow -- sends Rhymer ducking for cover -- bulges the dormitory's fractured walls and ceiling, lifting the ATTIC FLOOR mightily. HURLING Rain into the air! 
A FLAME TSUNAMI steamrollers through every room and passage, destroying everything in its path, consuming itself. 
INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT 
Ghost Blaze lies GROANING at blackened ground zero. He's almost human now, spent. Charred timbers CREAK and GROAN around him. The entire structure is on the verge of collapse. 
ON RAIN emerging from the smouldering bathroom, ghostly white. She picks her way cautiously across the teetering floor. Kneels alongside Ghost Blaze -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Blaze's eyes are black pits, gaunt and skullish_ Rain casts --- - about, finds a BURNING EMBER, cups it in her hands, holds the flame close to his mouth -- Ghost Blaze senses the fire, breathes it in like a drowning man. Draws the flame deep into his lungs, keeps drawing until the ember is gone, internalized. Their eyes meet. 
RAIN Are you going to die? 
GHOST BLAZE 
(WEAKLY) Not today. He pushes up on his elbows, tiredly rises to his feet and -- 
THE MISSION Topples. Ghost Blaze and Rain run -- but they're not going to make it. The whole room is dropging away at their heels! Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain, DIVES through a widening split in the wall even as -- 
EXT. MISSION - NIGHT 
-- the dormitory folds up and slides away from them, pitching over the hillside. Breaking into TONS OF PLUNGING DEBRIS that CRASH SPECTACULARLY onto the highway far below. 
ON GHOST BLAZE AND RAIN, clutching precariously to a muddy hillside. Ghost Blaze looks up, SEES -- 
DAWN APPROACHING, first light bleeding in over the distant mountains. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - MISSION RUINS - JUST BEFORE DAWN 
Ghost Blaze strides over the smoking ruins. Finds what he was looking for -- 
CARRIGAN, back to human, hopelessly trapped deep in the wreckage. He's barely alive, just a face in the rubble. Carrigan blinks. 
CARRIGAN (a ragged whisper) who -- the fuck -- are you, anyway? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GHOST BLAZE Vengeance. And Ghost Blaze raises his hand, HELLFIRE trickling down the length of his arm, swirling around his hand like a building static charge even as --

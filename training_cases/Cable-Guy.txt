1	FULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE 
Credits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly image. 
The camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch television. 
The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote control. The hand changes channels frantically. 
The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception. Unfortunately for him  his cable is not hooked up. 
STEVE (looks at watch) Jesus, where's the cable guy already? 
END OF CREDIT SEQUENCE 
1A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
It is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just moved in. The phone rings. 
STEVEN (into the phone) Hello. 
2	NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS 
We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television set. 
ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update." 
RICK How's the move going? 
3	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations. 
STEVEN Horrible. The cable guy is missing in action. Apparently he's going to be here sometime between eight AM and my death. 
RICK You haven't called Robin have you? Please tell me you didn't call her. 
STEVEN (sarcastically) No, I'm giving her space. (beat) I can't believe she's doing this. 
RICK You never should have asked her to marry you. You're the mad smotherer. 
STEVEN All she had to do was say no. She didn't have to kick me out. I feel like Felix Unger. 
RICK You forced her to evaluate the relationship. If you didn't propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was. 
STEVE I don't want to talk about it. So what time are you going to come by? 
RICK I can't. I'm working double shifts the rest of the week. 
STEVEN It's my first night here. Don't do this to me. 
RICK The other camera guy pulled out his back. Besides, I spent the last two weeks with you on my couch. Isn't that enough? 
STEVEN Fine, fine. 
RICK One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie channels for free. Even the dirty ones. 
STEVEN I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff. What if he says no? I'll feel like an idiot. 
RICK None of them say no, believe me. I'll talk to you later. 
Steven hangs up, and waits. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
4	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Steven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his ex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it back in the box. 
4A	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck pulls into a gated side garage. 
5	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER 
STEVEN Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath place, but now it's closed. CABLE GUY 
(turns to leave) Maybe I shouldn't have come at all  jerk off! (turns back smiling) I'm just joking. Let's do this. (looks around) Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought they'd get the floors clean after what happened here. 
STEVEN What happened? 
CABLE GUY (long beat) They had a lot of cats. 
They walk into Steven's living room. 
CABLE GUY Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a comment card. 
He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him. 
CABLE GUY Please mail it in when I am done. 
STEVEN These go to your boss? 
CABLE GUY No, they go to me. I'm a perfectioniss perfectioniss (he strains to lose his lisp) perfectionisst. Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with. 
The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space. 
CABLE GUY Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me baby. Tell me where you like it. That's it baby. 
He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner. 
CABLE GUY Here's your sweet spot. 
He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling. 
CABLE GUY So your lady kicked you out. 
STEVEN What? 
CABLE GUY In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me. 
STEVEN I really don't want to talk about it with you. Could you please just install my cable? I'm going to get dressed. 
CABLE GUY No sweat. 
Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him. 
CABLE GUY Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I can access the floorboards. Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you. 
STEVEN Okay, whatever. 
Steven walks toward his bedroom. 
CABLE GUY Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be channel surfing in no time. 
The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke. 
13	INT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION 
RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio. 
RIKKI KLIEMAN (to camera) So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four. 
A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad. 
We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs. 
RIKKI KLIEMAN (to camera) Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called "The Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of "Twin Envy." 
ANGLE ON 
Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television. 
STEVEN How's it going? 
The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV. 
CABLE GUY Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope they fry this bastard. 
Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation impossible. 
STEVEN (looks around) What happened? 
(End Revision - Pink) 
14	INT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks impressed. 
Steven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex. 
STEVEN There are twenty-four classrooms; each can be converted into a 1400 square foot home. The facility has two tennis courts, an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform "Oklahoma." 
Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job. 
STEVEN The kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure. If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this thing. 
There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up. 
MR. DANIELS Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling good? 
STEVE Yeah. 
MR. DANIELS Did I hear something about you having some troubles at home? 
STEVE Robin and I have been having a difficult time. I moved out, but I really think it's only temporary. 
MR. DANIELS Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a big mother. Know what I mean? If it fails, corporate's going to have my ass. I've got confidence in you, but you hear where I'm coming from, bro? 
STEVEN Absolutely. Now I've got more time than ever. It's a good thing. (laughs) I know I can pull this thing off. 
MR. DANIELS (playfully) Then what are you doing talking to me? You've got a lot of work to do. Get to it! 
STEVEN Thank you. I will. 
Hal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, JOAN. 
STEVEN I'll be right back. 
14A	INT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY 
Steven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office. 
15	OMITTED 
16	INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY 
ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine." Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has written. 
Steven peeks his head in her door. 
STEVEN Hello. 
Robin's face drops. 
ROBIN Steven, what are you doing here? 
STEVEN I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush article come out? 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 
ROBIN They liked it. (beat) I thought we agreed we weren't going to see each other for a month. 
STEVEN I know, it's just Daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse. 
ROBIN That's wonderful, congratulations. 
STEVEN I know I'm breaking the rules, but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate. 
ROBIN I don't think we should. 
STEVEN Come on, this is the biggest day of my career. 
ROBIN Don't put me in this position. 
STEVEN What position? I want to share this with you. 
ROBIN (feeling pressured) I love you, but I need to take some time on my own to see how I feel. You agreed to this. I mean this is exactly why we broke up, because you never listen to me. 
STEVE What? Now we're broken up? What happened to 'trial separation?' 
ROBIN I can't get into this now. If you haven't noticed, I'm at work. 
CABLE GUY See, I knew the moment I met you that you would appreciate this. 
The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it. 
CABLE GUY (with wonder) The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam. There's no end to the possibilities. (waves to Steven) Come on up! What are you waiting for?! 
22	INT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT 
The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky. 
CABLE GUY Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that there are billions of bits of information surging through me. 
STEVEN I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I guess I've always taken it for granted. 
CABLE GUY When I was a kid my mom worked nights. Never met dad. But the old TV was always there for me. 
STEVEN I know what you mean. My dad was there, but he might as well have been gone. My mom is a stewardess. She was always out of town. 
CABLE GUY (moved) That's tough. You must have a lot of abandonment issues. Reality isn't "Father Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right? 
STEVEN (tentative) You know my brother's a speech therapist. 
The Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry. 
CABLE GUY So? 
There is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react. 
STEVEN Never mind. 
The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it. 
CABLE GUY (beat) So, you're pretty love struck about your lady, huh? 
STEVEN I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and she asked me to move out. 
CABLE GUY I hate that. 
STEVEN She said she felt pressured. Can you believe that? 
CABLE GUY Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I don't think you listen to her. I think you try to tell her what she wants to hear. She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is. All the complicated splendor that is woman. When your love is truly giving, it will come back to you ten-fold. 
STEVEN You're right. That is remarkably insightful. 
CABLE GUY Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final thought on Friday's show. 
23	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER 
The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building. 
CABLE GUY You know what? Women are suckers for "Sleepless in Seattle." It's on HBO this month. That's your bait right there. 
STEVEN Robin loves that movie. 
CABLE GUY They all do. Next time you talk to her tell her you're cooking yourself dinner, and watching it by yourself. Sound like you're happier than a pig in shit. She'll come running. Betcha. Then just play it cool. 
STEVEN Maybe I will. 
Steven gets out of the car. 
STEVEN Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I don't know your name. What is it? 
CABLE GUY (touched) You really want to know my name? You do? Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my friends call me Chip. 
STEVEN I'll see ya' Chip. 
Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes. 
CABLE GUY Let's just remember right now. You know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend. (long pause) I guess we're the lucky ones. 
(End Revised - Pink) 
STEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once. 
STEVEN Uh good-bye. 
CABLE GUY Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the flip side. 
Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable. 
JEFF I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just play. 
CABLE GUY Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up. 
The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone stares at him until he finishes. 
CABLE GUY Let's get it on! 
STEVEN Are you any good? 
CABLE GUY Feed me under the boards and you'll find out. 
Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands. 
CABLE GUY (doing the traveling hand signal) Traveling! That's traveling! 
RICK Yeah, whatever you say Chip. 
Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him. 
CABLE GUY All right, so we're playing that type of game. Prison rules. I get it. 
Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss crosses all over the court. 
CABLE GUY Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm open! 
Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the process. The ball goes in. 
CABLE GUY (does the foul hand signal) And one! That's definitely a foul! (to Jeff) You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants. 
STEVEN (to Cable Guy) What are you doing? 
CABLE GUY Don't play from fear Steven. We can take these guys. 
MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V. 
a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down. b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including Rick. c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with Rick. d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down hard. 
CABLE GUY Take it to the hole! 
Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in. 
CABLE GUY Hey, are you okay? 
He pulls Steven up. 
STEVEN Yeah. I'm fine. 
CABLE GUY Let's switch. I'll cover Rick. 
The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare. 
Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball. 
RICK (enraged) What the hell was that? That's it. I've had enough. 
Everyone begins to exit the court. 
JEFF Thanks for bringing your "friend". 
The Cable Guy runs up to Rick. 
CABLE GUY Good game. (slaps Rick on the butt) You were tough out there. Your play brought me up to a higher level. I mean that. 
RICK (dismissive) Yeah. 
He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players. 
STEVEN What are you doing? 
CABLE GUY It was payback time. I was protecting you. 
(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) 
STEVEN You ruined the game. 
CABLE GUY I don't appreciate your tone Steven. That's not the way friends speak to each other. 
STEVEN What are you talking about? I don't even know you! 
CABLE GUY Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total robo-babe. 
STEVEN Are you serious? 
CABLE GUY Don't look. 
STEVEN I've got to look. 
CABLE GUY Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like you are looking for the waitress. 
Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the cable Guy, annoyed. 
CABLE GUY Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind. But you fell for it man. You are one horny Indian Chief. 
STEVEN (not laughing) You got me. 
CABLE GUY So what did you want to rap about? 
The trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins. 
CABLE GUY Hold that thought. Show's on. 
The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena. 
32	ON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN "ROBIN HOOD" SPEAKS TO THE CROWD 
HOST Welcome to a magnificent journey into the past. This is Medieval Times! 
The entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds. 
HOST Are you prepapred for a night of feasting and sport the likes of which ye will never forget?! 
The audience applauds. 
HOST I charge you to stand up on your feet and cheer for your section's knight! 
ON THE STANDS - Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight. The Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match. Steven remains seated. 
CABLE GUY Let the games begin! The Red Knight rules! Blue Knight! You're going down! Going down! 
An embarrassed Steven applauds politely. The Cable Guy sits down. 
33	INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER 
ON THE FLOOR - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on horseback. 
ON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands while watching the show. 
STEVEN (to the Watiress) Could I get a knife and fork? 
WAITRESS There were no utensils in Medieval Times, so there are no utensils at 'Medieval Times.' Do you want a refill on that Pepsi? 
STEVEN There were no utensils, but there was Pepsi? 
WAITRESS Look, I have a lot of tables to get to. 
The waitress exits. 
CABLE GUY (stands up - yells to the competitors) Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no mercy! 
The two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins. 
The crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy. 
CABLE GUY (to Steven) Come on, get into it, we won! 
Releuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds. 
STEVEN (halfheartedly) Way to go Red Knight. Good job of killing. Good work. 
Steven and the Cable Guy sit down. 
CABLE GUY So, what were you saying before? 
STEVEN (tentatively) How do I put this? I've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but... 
CABLE GUY That's why I became a cable guy. To make friends like you. Every time I walk up to a new door, that door is a possibility for friendship. When I walked in your apartment I knew there was something there. I just knew it. 
STEVEN (sotto) Oh lord. (tries to get back on track) I want you to know -- 
Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection. STEVEN (looking down) Jesus. 
The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick. 
The show's host runs up to Steven. 
HOST Quickly, muster a top your steed. (Steven doesn't move - the host drops character) Get on the god damn horse! I don't think he's kidding! 
Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy. STEVEN Don't do this! CABLE GUY Jim, we have no choice! STEVEN Oh my god. 
They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick. The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet. STEVEN (concerned) Are you okay? 
The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him. CABLE GUY Well done good sir. You are the victor, but we shall meet again. 
The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms in triumph, and smiles. DISSOLVE TO LATER: 35	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT They are walking up the stairs. CABLE GUY You've got a real warrior's instinct. STEVEN I've got to admit there's a real feeling of power holding that jousting stick. CABLE GUY If Robin saw you tonight, she would be begging you to take her back. I'm telling you these knights get laid all the time. STEVEN We should go again next week. CABLE GUY Easy there Lancelot. 
Steven opens the door to his apartment. 36	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine. MACHINE You have zero messages. CABLE GUY Nobody loves ya. (grabs a beer from the fridge) Hey, I think I left my staple gun in the living room the other day. Could you be a pal? 
Steven walks to the living room. 36AA	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Steven turns on the lights. CABLE GUY What do you think? 
Steven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line. STEVEN What is this? CABLE GUY I took the liberty of updating your in home entertainment system. I got you the big screen, plus THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants. STEVEN You went in my house when I wasn't home? CABLE GUY How else was I supposed to get the stuff in here? Magic? STEVEN How much did this cost? CABLE GUY Practically nothing. I have a connection. Preferred customer. I hook him up, he hooks me up. STEVEN Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't feel right. CABLE GUY Yes but you give me something so much more valuable friendship. STEVEN And you've given me friendship, so we're even. (beat) Really, don't take it personally, but you've got to take it back. CABLE GUY (sadly) Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck works all week. Is it all right if I leave it here till Saturday? STEVEN (guilty) Sure, no problem. And don't get me wrong. I really appreciate the gesture. CABLE GUY Mm-hmm. (beat) Staple gun? STEVEN Oh, right. 
Steven picks up the staple gun. The Cable Guy pulls out a leather pouch. Steven drops the staple gun in the pouch. The Cable Guy never touches it. 36A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY Steven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads "HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY." STEVEN (into the phone) Robin, it's Steven again. I'm still trying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work. Call me. 
He hangs up. He is getting frustrated. The door opens. Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not enter. MR. DANIELS How's it going? STEVEN Good. MR. DANIELS (long beat) Good good? STEVEN Great. MR. DANIELS Good. Keep it up. 
He leaves. The phone rings. SECRETARY (through the intercom) Robin on line two. 
Steven lights up. He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone. STEVEN Hey, I had the best time the other night. When am I going to get you on my couch again? 
36B	INT. VAN - DAY The Cable Guy is driving around. He speaks on a cellular phone. CABLE GUY Well tonight's not looking too good. How about tomorrow? STEVEN Chip? CABLE GUY I knew I'd get you on the phone that way. Listen, that equipment will be history the day after tomorrow. It sure would be a pity to leave that karaoke machine a virgin. STEVEN What do you mean? CABLE GUY Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a few butts. Later gator. 
37	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SATURDAY NIGHT CLOSE UP - AN OLD MAN'S FACE INTENSELY SINGING "AMERICAN WOMAN." We pull out to reveal we are in Steven's living room. It is populated with about twenty odd looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music. Among them we see Rick looking very uncomfortable. 37AA	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Steven is on the phone. He is dressed up. Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the fridge. STEVEN Hey Robin. What's up? Did you get my message? 
37A	INT. - ROBIN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT The scene intercuts between the two locations. Robin is dressed up, and on her way out. ROBIN Yes. You left me five messages. It king of freaked me out. STEVEN Sorry. I've been trying to reach you 'cause I'm having a party. You've got to come over. ROBIN (listens for a beat) I can't. I'm going to dinner with someone. STEVEN Dinner? What, like a date? ROBIN Not really a date. STEVEN You've got a date?! I thought things were going well between us. ROBIN They are. STEVEN So why are you going out on a date? ROBIN I made it before we got together the other night. I knew you would freak out. STEVEN I'm not freaking out. ROBIN Yes, you are freaking out. STEVEN I'm not. I just can't believe you would do this. ROBIN I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed to date. It's not like we're back together. We had a good time the other night, and you're already pressuring me. STEVEN (pissy) Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun. ROBIN I will. STEVEN Fine. Bye. 
Steven hangs up the phone. The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer. CABLE GUY This is just a sign that you need to live a little. She's having fun, and you should too. 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) STEVEN You're probably right. CABLE GUY Damn right I'm right. STEVEN Oh, I got you a little something. 
He hands a box to the Cable Guy. CABLE GUY I thought you said we were even. You're breaking the rules. STEVEN So shoot me. 
He opens it. The box says, "Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days." The Cable Guy is so moved he cannot speak. STEVEN My brother said it might help with your lisp. 
The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard. CABLE GUY Words cannot express (he is too moved to finish his sentence) STEVEN It's no big deal. CABLE GUY Yes it is. 
He stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable. CABLE GUY Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be the best party ever! Let's rock. 
37B	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS They walk into the living room. A sad looking OLDER MAN is singing "Superfreak." Everyone's having fun. We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd. (Revision Ends - Blue) STEVEN You've got plenty of friends. CABLE GUY These people are acquaintances. They're not ride to the airport friends, like us. (sees something) Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A real barn burner. Don't look. STEVEN You're playing with me again. CABLE GUY No sirree Steven. This woman is all over you like a lamp-shade. STEVEN Shut up. 
He turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits. When he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back. CABLE GUY Did it just get hotter in here? (grabs his crotch) Oh, that hurts. STEVEN Who'd she come with? CABLE GUY I don't know, but she looks pretty available to me. I'd strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates, masturbates, know what I'm saying? 
ANGLE ON A nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick. ODD MAN He sure can throw a party. Chip's an incredible man. I really admire him. RICK Where do you know him from? ODD MAN He hooked up my cable. Didn't charge me either. That's the kind of guy he is. 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) ANGLE ON Steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman. STEVEN Hey. I'm Steven. WOMAN Heather. STEVEN Can I get you something to drink? HEATHER Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila if you will. STEVEN Coming right up. 
37C	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER AT THE KARAOKE AREA - Steven and Heather are singing "You're the One that I Want" from "Grease." They are both drunk, and having a great time. The Cable Guy walks over to Rick. CABLE GUY I'm glad you accepted my invitation. RICK Steven invited me. 
The Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather. CABLE GUY Look at him. Have you ever seen him so alive? He's changing, Rick. You've got to learn to live with that. RICK I don't know what your story is "Chip Douglas," but I'm going to find out. CABLE GUY Oooh. How dramatic. 
The song ends. Rick walks away. He waves to Steven as he heads out. Steven runs over to him. RICK I'm getting out of here. STEVEN (drunk) Why? This is a great party. This girl is really into me. RICK You're whacked man. That guy is bad news. STEVEN You don't even know him. You're just mad 'cause he kicked your ass in basketball. RICK I can't even deal. I'm outta here. 
ON THE CABLE GUY - At the karaoke area. He speaks into the microphone. 
CABLE GUY Hello everyone. First of all I'd like to thank Steven for being such a terific host. 
Steven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud. 
CABLE GUY Don't forget to kick in some spinach for the beer. Steven ain't made of money. And I expect some of you to join in the clean up crew. 
OFF DUTY COP Sing something! Do a song! 
CABLE GUY (false coyness) No I really couldn't. 
ODD MAN Come on! Do your song! 
CABLE GUY Okay, just to stop that guy from begging. This number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house. 
He puts on a Janet Jackson type microphone, then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song "Bust A Move," accompanied by elaborate dance moves. 
He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain. 
CABLE GUY She's clean I assure you. I tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not a drip. She's the best, ask any of my friends. 
Steven cringes. 
STEVE You've got to be kidding? Please tell me she's a friend of yours. You're just playing with my mind again, right? 
CABLE GUY I wish I had friends like that. 
STEVEN Get out of my house! 
CABLE GUY Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she was a working girl, but she kind of liked you. You might have been able to get a freebie. 
STEVEN Out, now! I don't ever want to see you again. (to himself) Robin is never going to forgive me. 
CABLE GUY I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't tell her. You want to get her back, I'll help you get her back. 
STEVEN I don't want your help. I want you to leave. (gestures to the TV) And take that stuff out of here. 
CABLE GUY (calmly) Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see ya'. 
The Cable Guy exits. 
42	OMITTED 
43	EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
P.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant. 
We move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street. A moment later he heads inside. 
44	INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The Cable Guy enters the restaurant. The HOSTESS walks over to him. 
HOSTESS May I help you? 
CABLE GUY No, I'm meeting someone here. 
He looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table. They are on a date. The Cable Guy looks angry. He walks to the restroom. 
45	INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT 
An OLDER BATHROOM ATTENDANT stands in front of the sinks. On the counter sits a variety of toiletries. A MAN washes his hands. The bathroom attendant hands him some paper towels. The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits. 
BATHROOM ATTENDANT Most appreciated. 
The Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant. He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar bill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose. 
CABLE GUY You've been working hard. Take a break. 
46	INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER 
Robin is talking to her date RAY. He is handsome, and somewhat goofy. They have empty salad plates in front of them. 
RAY My brother and I wanna start our own sun block company. But the twist is, it's only for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki. We haven't decided yet. Maybe BlockSki. Do you think that sounds good? 
ROBIN BlockSki? That sounds right. 
RAY So, Gail told me you're just coming off a relationship. 
ROBIN Well, not really. We're kind of in a holding pattern. He wants more of a commitment, but I don't think I'm ready. I just want to have a good time for a while. 
RAY Then we got to get you on a Skidoo! 
ROBIN Skidoo? 
RAY High powered snow mobile. It'll blow your mind. It flies over powder like it's glass. 
Their waitress passes by. 
RAY (impatiently) Hey, how are you doing on that chicken? Have the eggs hatched yet? Thanks. 
Robin is mortified by his behavior. 
RAY So, how's your work going? 
ROBIN It's been crazy. They just hired a  
Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut experiencing heavy G-Force. 
CABLE GUY from this angle you look just like Neil Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I believe you have the "right stuff." 
The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket. 
CABLE GUY Don't worry about the tip. But I've got one for you. (whispers into his ear) Stay away from Robin. She's taken. 
He tosses him out the door. 
47A	INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS 
The door opens, and Ray falls to the floor. 
47B	INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS 
Robin sits alone at her table. She looks at her watch. In the background the Cable Guy slips out. 
48	OMITTED 
49	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Steven is watching television while eating a TV dinner. 
ON THE TV - LOCAL TELEVISION NEWS 
ANCHOR MAN Here's a bizarre story from downtown, where a man was beaten in a restroom by an assailant disguised as a bathroom attendant. The victim has been unable to speak since the unmotivated attack. 
We see the image of a shaken up RAY being led out of the restaurant by two police officers. 
ANCHOR MAN A police sketch artist put together this drawing from witnesses' descriptions. 
We see a drawing which looks a little like the Cable Guy. In it he has a moustache and appears to be Hispanic. Steven looks carefully. Does he know that man? Nah. He changes the channel. 
ON THE TV - the FOX logo flies up, followed by a slick promo for a FOX Movie-of-the-Week on the Sam Sweet trial. 
ANOUNCER (V.O.) Tonight on Fox, the true story behind the trial that's captured the nation. 
We see ERIC ROBERTS holding a shotgun, pointed at another scared ERIC ROBERTS. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The jury may still be out, but the chilling facts are in. Eric Roberts, in his dramatic debut is Sam and Stan Sweet. "Brother, Sweet Brother: The Killing of Stanton Sweet." Tonight on Fox. 
49A	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The Cable Guy walks over to a FEMALE NEIGHBOR. 
CABLE GUY Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris? 
FEMALE NEIGHBOR (points) It's right upstairs. 
50	INT. ROBIN'S HOME - NEXT DAY 
There is a LOUD KNOCK. Robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain. 
ROBIN Who is it? 
The Cable Guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible. 
CABLE GUY It's the Cable Guy. 
ROBIN There's no problem with my cable. 
CABLE GUY I've got an upgrade order for one Robin Harris. The Rainbow package, that's every pay channel available. 
ROBIN I didn't order this. 
CABLE GUY Apparently you've got a secret admirer. 
She unlocks the chain, and the Cable Guy quickly steps inside. 
ROBIN Was it a man named Steven? 
CABLE GUY I can't tell you. 
ROBIN Come on. 
CABLE GUY No, I promised Steven I wouldn't say. 
He gave it away on purpose. They both laugh. 
ROBIN Yes, your friend came by. 
STEVEN My friend? 
ROBIN The Cable Guy. I liked him. He was kind of goofy, but nice. Thank you so much for doing that. 
STEVEN I'm glad you liked it. I've wanted to do something nice for you, but I've been trying to give you your space. 
ROBIN Well, I don't think we should make rules anymore. 
STEVE Okay. 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 
ROBIN Call me later if you're around? 
STEVEN Sure. I'll call you as son as I get home. Bye. 
Steven is elated. He can barely contain himself. 
RICK (O.S.) Steven, are you ready to go? 
Steven turns and sees Rick wearing a "Soundgarden" T-shirt. 
STEVEN (pained) The concert. Oh Jesus. 
RICK What? 
STEVEN Robin just called. I think we're getting back together. 
RICK (pissed) So you're blowing me off? I can't believe this. 
STEVEN This is the first time she asked to get back together. 
RICK You do this every time. You only call me after a girl breaks your heart. "Oh Rick can I stay on your couch? Let's talk all night about how mean girls are." Then as soon as a relationship starts again it's bye-bye Rick. I don't know why I fall for it anymore. 
55	OMITTED 
56	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
It is raining. Rick pulls up, and drops Steven off. 
STEVEN Can't you get someone else to go? 
(Revision Ends - Blue) 
RICK Maybe I'll take MY cable guy. 
Steven gets out of the car. Rick drives off. Steven walks up the steps to his apartment. The Cable Guy appears from behind a corner. 
CABLE GUY Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you knock 'em down. 
STEVEN What? 
CABLE GUY Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced her up. 
STEVEN How do you know we're back together? 
CABLE GUY Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac. 
STEVEN I don't want you messing around with my life. You've caused enough trouble as it is. 
CABLE GUY I know. I felt bad about the other night, so I wanted to make it up to you. So what are you doing? Do you want to catch a bite? 
Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye. 
STEVEN (sincerely yet curt) Look, I appreciate you helping me out with Robin. But you have to understand, I'm going to have to work extra hard to not screw this relationship up again. You're a great guy, but I just don't have any room in my life for a new friend. Do you understand? 
CABLE GUY I appreciate your honesty. You're a real straight shooter. 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 
STEVEN So, you're okay? 
CABLE GUY Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal. Whatever. 
STEVEN All right well, take care. 
CABLE GUY Have a good one. 
Right then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking concerned. 
POLICE OFFICER Is there a Steven Bartowsky here? 
STEVEN Uh I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going on? 
POLICE OFFICER You are under arrest. 
MR. DANIELS On what charge? 
POLICE OFFICER Receipt of stolen merchandise. 
STEVEN What? I never  
POLICE OFFICER Please put our hands on the table. 
Steven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his club. Steven groans, then leans over in pain. 
POLICE OFFICER Please follow my instructions. Hands on the table. 
Steven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of everyone. It is pure humiliation. 
POLICE OFFICER Hands behind your back. 
The other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around. 
POLICE OFFICER #2 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Do you understand? 
STEVE This is all a mistake. I didn't accept any stolen goods. 
Just then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head. 
CABLE GUY (V.O.) (with echo) you're getting THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants  cream in his pants. 
He pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He tries to break the tension with a joke. 
STEVEN Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to jail. 
Nobody laughs. He exits. 
59	EXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER 
Steven is walked to a police car, and put inside. 
We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. Apparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly watching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable guy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose. 
60	INT. POLICE STATION - LATER 
Steven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his LAWYER. 
EARL I can't believe you did this. 
STEVEN I didn't do anything. My cable guy gave me all that stuff as a present. 
EARL A stereo system and a big screen TV as a present? You expect me to believe that? You know you're killing your mother with this. 
STEVEN I swear it's true. 
EARL Why would you accept such extravagant gifts? 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 
STEVEN I don't know. I shouldn't have. 
EARL What is really going on here Steven? Are you on something? 
STEVEN I'm fine! I didn't do anything! Please call my cable guy, his name is Ernie Douglas. 
LAWYER Steven, the police looked into it, nobody named Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable Company.' 
EARL You want to tell us the truth now 
STEVEN (falling apart) That's got to be a mistake. Oh, this is not happening. 
EARL Yes it is, and it's killing your mother. Did you deliberately want to ruin our fortieth anniversary party on Monday, Steven? 
STEVEN Yeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan. (to the lawyer) When can you get me out of here? 
LAWYER Unfortunately it's too late to get a bail hearing today. You're going to have to spend the weekend in county lock up. 
CABLE GUY (as he buttons his shirt) I was just messing with your mind. That was from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome film. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for the screenplay. 
STEVEN Guard! Guard! 
CABLE GUY Don't you worry about Robin, I'll make sure she's well taken care of. 
STEVEN You go near her, I'll kill you. 
Steven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit. 
STEVEN Hey, this is the guy who framed me! 
The Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door. 
CABLE GUY (warmly) Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun when it's Free Per View. 
They both laugh. The door closes behind them. 
65	EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DAY 
The Cable Guy is sitting at a table wearing a Walkman. People look at him funny as he speaks out loud to his lisp tape. 
(Revision 11/13/95 - Blue) 
CABLE GUY (over-pronouncing) Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon. Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious. Suspicious. Sensational. Sensational. 
Robin is brought over to the table by a hostess. The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands up to be polite. He sits down in perfect synch with her. 
ROBIN Hello. 
CABLE GUY Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under these circumstances. 
ROBIN Me too. Believe me. 
CABLE GUY I know we don't know each other very well, but we do have one thing in common, our concern for Steven. 
ROBIN Well, you were right. Something's happening with him and he won't even acknowledge it. 
CABLE GUY If he refuses to admit he has a problem, we may have to let him hit bottom. He's gonna need some tough love. 
ROBIN (tentatively) You know his lawyer said that nobody named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company. 
CABLE GUY (chuckles) Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work under a pseudonym so the customers won't harass me at home. Kind of like a stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry Tate. 
ROBIN And he's saying he received all the stereo equipment from you. 
CABLE GUY (I know, and I'm not mad. He's been cornered, so he's telling some wives tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me. 
ROBIN I just feel like I triggered this with him. It's not that I don't want to get married, it's just I felt like he wanted to get married just to get married. I don't deal well with pressure. 
CABLE GUY Hey, welcome to the human race. We're not perfect. We all think we have to look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a break. 
ROBIN God I could go for turkey and mashed potatoes now. 
CABLE GUY Comfort food. Bring it on. 
ROBIN Exactly. 
She laughs. 
CABLE GUY You've got a great laugh. Can I make a small request? I'd like to hear it a little more often. 
She blushes. 
66	INT. PRISON ADMINISTRATION - NEXT DAY 
ON THE TV - Hard Copy's BARRY NOLAN, sits behind his desk giving a news update. 
BARRY NOLAN The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into chaos as a result of a videotape made a month after the killing. In this "Hard Copy" exclusive an apparently intoxicated Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his friends at a party. The judge has not decided whether this tape is admissible as evidence. 
We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror. 
SAM SWEET (to camera) Hey everyone. Look it's me and (gestures to his reflection) my brother Stan. (waves at reflection) Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How are you feeling? (to camera) Look, he's alive. 
Sam punches the mirror, shattering it. 
SAM SWEET (angry) Now he's dead. 
Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile. 
CABLE GUY (whispers) The password is vagina. 
Steven winces. 
STEVEN I really don't want to play this game. (looks to his mother) Woman. Woman. 
STEVEN'S MOTHER Uh man? 
STEVEN No. 
CABLE GUY (to Robin) Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis. 
Robin concentrates hard, but she can't figure it out. 
CABLE GUY Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis. 
ROBIN Vagina? 
CABLE GUY (pumps his fist) Yes! 
He high fives Robin. Everyone laughs. 
EARL (blurts out) I thought it was going to be schlong! (covers his mouth - embarrassed) Whoops. 
Everyone laughs. They are all having a great time, except Steven. The Cable Guy looks at the next word, shows it to the family privately, then whipsers to Steven. 
CABLE GUY The password is nipple. 
STEVEN Can I pass? 
EARL Come on Steven, don't be a stick in the mud. 
STEVEN Breast. Breast. 
STEVEN'S MOTHER Tit? 
Everyone laughs. Steven's face is red. 
CABLE GUY Hard (gestures like there is another word after it) Hard 
ROBIN Erection? 
Everyone laughs. Steven looks like he might kill the Cable Guy. 
STEVEN Center. Center. 
STEVEN'S MOTHER Nipple? 
Everyone cheers. 
STEVEN'S MOTHER I can't believe I got it. I was going to say areola. 
Everyone laughs except Steven, who is mortified. 
CABLE GUY I wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead. 
The Cable Guy shows the word to everyone, then whispers in Steven's ear. 
CABLE GUY The password is I'm not sure how to pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or clit-oris. 
STEVEN (snaps) I can't say that to my mother! 
EARL Hey, she's a grown woman. She can handle it. 
ROBIN Come on Steven. We're just having fun. 
STEVEN No, I've had enough. I can't do this. This guy is ruining my life, I won't sit here and play X-rated party games with him. 
EARL Steven, I really think you're over- reacting. 
STEVEN I am not over-reacting. You're all being fooled by this guy! He's a felon for Christ sake! (to the Cable Guy) I hate you! Get out of my life! 
CABLE GUY I'm sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance, I will leave. I would never stay where I am not wanted. 
ROBIN (to the Cable Guy) You're not a nuisance. Please don't go. (to Steven) Steven, you're being an asshole. 
EARL Yeah, Steven it seems like you're the one with the problem. 
STEVEN What? You have no idea what this guy is really like. 
RICK You bet your ass you've been blowing me off. 
STEVEN It's just, this guy is really doing a number on me. 
RICK I told you not to hang out with him. 
STEVEN You're the one who told me to offer him money so I could get free cable. 
RICK You didn't tell me he was a psychopath. (beat) I'll see if I can get my friend in research to track him down. What's his name again? 
STEVEN Ernie Douglas. 
RICK Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? Why does that sound so familiar? 
81	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY 
Steven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television. 
On the TV - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman. 
Joan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN DERSHOWITZ regarding "the abuse excuse." 
BACK TO SCENE 
Steven walks over to Joan. 
STEVEN (to his secretary) Did anyone notice I'm late? 
JOAN What are you talking about, you've been here for an hour. 
STEVEN Thank you. 
Steven walks to his office. 
81A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Steven walks behind his desk. He notices something which disturbs him. His computer is on. He clicks a button and a message comes on the screen. 
ON THE SCREEN - "GOOD MORNING STEVEN. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. HERE'S AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE." 
Then an image comes on the screen. It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the computer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before they watched "Sleepless in Seattle." 
STEVEN Work's good. 
ROBIN How's Hal? 
STEVEN Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless. 
ROBIN It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up. 
STEVEN I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done. 
The sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this. 
81B	OFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS 
Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down. 
STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office. 
BACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can. 
81C	INT. HAL'S OFFICE 
Steven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and sees Steven. 
HAL Don't worry. I didn't see it --- 'cause I have no vision. 
Steven knows what's coming. 
82	OMITTED 
82A	OMITTED 
82B	OMITTED 
82C	INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER 
Steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings. He has been fired. Suddenly a car alarm beeps. It's headlights flash. Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear. 
RICK (VO) He was fired for beating up a customer who yelled at him for being late. A company in Denver thinks they might have a lead on who he really is. If I were you I'd lock down tonight. I'll call you when I get some more info. 
98	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Steven is watching television. He struggles to stay awake. 
ON THE TV - Court TV. The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking. 
PROSECUTOR (ON TV) Don't let your memories of these cute twins distract you from the fact that this funny star of a situation comedy killed his own brother in cold blood, then called the police and said he was killed by an Asian gang. There was no laugh-track on that night. 
The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep. 
99	ON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP	HE SLOWLY WAKES UP. 
The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar. 
ON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We reveal that it is the Cable Guy. 
CABLE GUY This man killed his own brother. Some people don't even have a brother... 
The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face. He looks to camera. 
CABLE GUY ...do they Steven? Are you listening to me? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it -- 
ON STEVEN - He shuts off the TV, and walks out of the room. 
100	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The entire apartment appears much larger. Steven walks down the hallway. He looks into the living room and sees Rick. 
RICK Why do you keep icing me man? 
100A	INT. ELONGATED BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
He opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom. The shower is steaming. The two eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky. He quickly closes the door. 
100B	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
He continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he sees Robin's bedroom. 
100C	INT. ROIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Robin is in bed. A man wearing a cable installer's uniform is smothering her with a pillow. The man turns -- it is Steven. He quickly closes the door. 
100D	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
He hears someone pounding on the front door. He opens the door. Nobody is there. Then the Cable Guy pops into frame holding a cut cord. 
CABLE GUY You owe me! 
Steven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole. 
101	P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE 
The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and more distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from frame. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs again to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the door. 
102	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Steven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him. 
Steven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks back another time and the Cable Guy is gone. 
He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides. 
CABLE GUY I just want to hang out. No big deal. 
Steven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room. 
103	OMITTED 
104	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Steven runs in. The television is on. He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do. 
He puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger. 
CABLE GUY Steven, you're just like me. We're cut from the same cloth. We're one and the same! 
Then it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television. 
109	INT. RICK'S NEWSROOM - NIGHT 
Rick sits at his desk. The PHONE RINGS. 
RICK Hello. 
109AA	INT. MOVING VEHICLE - NIGHT 
Super Close Up - What the audience will think is Steven's mouth (actually the Cable Guy) speaking on a cellular phone. 
STEVEN Hey Rick. I need to meet with you right away. I've got some information about this crazy cable guy. 
RICK Me too. I've got the whole story. 
STEVEN That's great. Let's meet at the old school at nine-thirty. 
RICK Why all the way out there? 
STEVEN I think he's been following me. Don't be late, buddy. 
109AB	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Steven's car screeches to a stop. He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking. Her FEMALE NEIGHBOOR opens her door. 
STEVEN Be home! Be home! 
FEMALE NEIGHBOOR Go away! I remember you. You're her obsessive boyfriend. She said you might come here. I'm calling the police. 
She closers her door. He runs off. 
109A	EXT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - NIGHT 
Rick drives up, then walks into the building. 
110	INT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 
Rick walks through the school looking for Steven. 
RICK Steven? Steven? 
In the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows. 
STEVEN Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear what you found out about this nut. 
RICK I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply troubled. Only child. His mother was arrested for prostitution, and phone solicitation. Apparently she was some phone sex pioneer. 
STEVEN No way. 
RICK And get this, he was discharged from the Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two using a Radio Shack computer. And that's not the half of it. 
As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp). 
CABLE GUY Really? Tell me more. 
Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away. 
CABLE GUY I'm very interested in learning everything I can about that wacked out cable installer. 
He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy. 
The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not see Rick yelp, and fall. 
CABLE GUY It sounds like he might hurt somebody. 
110A	INT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Steven is driving in his car. His cellular phone rings. He picks it up. 
STEVEN (panicked) Hello. 
CABLE GUY (VO) (talks like a game show host) Nosey friends for two hundred. This supposed pal of Steven's is currently residing in the intensive care unit of Good Samaritan Hospital. 
STEVEN Rick. 
CABLE GUY (VO) I'm sorry, you didn't answer in the form of a question. 
He hangs up. 
111	OMITTED 
The Cable Guy and Robin are now standing on the edge of the dish. 
CABLE GUY The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play a game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam. 
117	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
The chase continues. 
Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the police cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way. 
117A	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT 
ROBIN This is really fascinating, but I really think we ought to go now. 
CABLE GUY I knew you'd appreciate it. I took Steven here once, and he didn't give a rats ass about my interests. 
ROBIN I'm worried about Steven. 
CABLE GUY Maybe Steven should be worried about you. (beat) So, where was I? 
118	OMITTED (NOW PART OF SCENE 109AB) 
119	OMITTED 
120	OMITTED 
121	OMITTED 
122	EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
Steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs. 
The horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat. 
CABLE GUY (chuckles) Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed it all last month. 
The Cable Guy rides toward him again. 
CABLE GUY (like the Vegas announcer) Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!! 
(Revision Ends - Blue) 
This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face. 
STEVEN Where's Robin?! 
CABLE GUY This isn't about Robin, this is about you and me. 
Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy. 
STEVEN Where's Robin?!!! 
Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head. 
STEVEN Tell me! 
CABLE GUY (nonchalantly) I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question? 
Steven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams into the ground. 
CABLE GUY Steven you've changed. (beat - then impressed) I like it. 
The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him. 
They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of his belt and turns it on. 
CABLE GUY I think it's time to make you cable ready. 
He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large branch and bats the Cable Guy off him. 
The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight. 
CABLE GUY Last time we fought I let you win! Best two out of three! 
MUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music. 
CABLE GUY (crazed) You treat me like the TV! You use me, but you can't live without me! 
The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch.

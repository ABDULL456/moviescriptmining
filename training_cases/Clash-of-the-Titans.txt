FADE IN: 
EXT. ALLEYWAY (VILLAGE) - DUSK 
Gloomy, last light. From out of the shadows comes            -- A DOG. A dog of war. Big, mangy, muscular, scary. As he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly choked with fallen structures. and signs of tumult. 
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DUSK 
TRACKING WITH THE DOG as he comes onto a battlefield. The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY -- 
SERIES OF SHOTS as the Dog traverses a landscape of -- BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the horizon. The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes are sad, his expression weary and disgusted. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - NIGHT 
The entrance is patrolled by a dozen PALACE GUARDS. They don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace wall and disappear inside. 
INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT HALL - NIGHT 
Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to -- KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands the room -- 
KING ACRISIUS Now we end the debate about tactics... and begin to plan for victory. 
AT THE BACK OF THE HALL The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away. 
INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - NIGHT 
Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs. 
INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - ROYAL APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - 
NIGHT The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the shadows. 
INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - BEDCHAMBER - DOG'S POV - 
NIGHT In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of QUEEN DANAE as a LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen's perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting leaves. The Dog's eyes. He moves forward. 
FLOOR-LEVEL TRACKING WITH the Dog's legs as they MORPH INTO HUMAN LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure, who roughly pulls a curtain aside. In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased. 
QUEEN DANAE My King! Has the strategy been set so quickly? 
REVERSE ANGLE The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius, including the distinctive scar. He regards her hungrily. 
QUEEN DANAE Come to your Queen, my King. 
INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - SUNRISE 
The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with AIDES and Guards. Suddenly, the King stops. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged creature -- and now it appears: The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power. Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others raise their weapons. The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the shadows below. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE SEA - ROCKY PROMONTORY - CLOSE ON KING ACRISIUS' 
INT. ATRIUM                                                 (OLYMPOS)   - DAY 
THOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging -- -- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter... THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled and lose count. Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic, bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm. 
THOTH My lord. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ZEUS (rumbles, like 
THUNDER) We have debated, we have voted, and it is decided. We offer the Humans peace. Thoth, you will take them the terms of a treaty -- 
TIAMAT                                                     (O.S.) 
(SCORNFULLY) A treaty! Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog. In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made visible, and -- -- TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, the only God fearless enough to challenge Zeus' rule -- 
TIAMAT We don't negotiate with them! We dictate to them. Their place is to beg. They have forgotten their role and have denied us the sustenance of their prayers. 
APHRODITE Our mercy will give them reason to be grateful. They will bow down and whisper our names with more passion than before. 
TIAMAT They will bow down when we snap their backs! Mercy? We are Gods! Some of us remember that and are not afraid -- Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage. 
ZEUS Silence! Or learn what it is to be afraid! The debate is over, the votes cast... Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ZEUS We guarantee an armistice, we shield the bridegroom and the Joppan royal family. (turning again on 
TIAMAT) And we do not interfere in their actions. We leave them undisturbed unless-invoked by name to enter their affairs. 
SET And if they refuse our terms? 
ZEUS They have suffered terrible losses. They will not pass up a chance for peace. 
INT. ATRIUM - MAGIC HOUR (LATER) 
Only Tiamat and Set now. Tiamat regards Zeus' throne. 
SET This is your rightful place to take. 
TIAMAT Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown weaker than I knew. Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks up the two black shards representing their votes. He hands one to Tiamat. 
SET So have they all. They no longer see clearly. 
TIAMAT 
(DISDAINFUL) They're beginning to think like Men. But you and I shall not. Set agrees, his eyes searching her face. 
TIAMAT We will manage these thick-witted Humans to our own ends. (off his look) Yes, we will be bound by great Zeus' rules... until their fragile membranes tear. We dare not interfere with these insects... 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TIAMAT                                                   (CONT'D) but we may be invited to intervene. Tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool -- the whole pool darkens and choppy waves crash over the sides... a tiny tempest. 
EXT. THE AGORA                                           (MARKETPLACE) OF JOPPA - DAY 
The long war with the Gods has wounded this city, but life goes stubbornly on. Among the war-torn buildings is a bustling market. CITIZENS eye the wares. MERCHANTS, PERFORMERS, noise, and MUSIC. 
SUPERIMPOSE: JOPPA, CAPITAL OF THE DOMINION OF ILLYRIA Suddenly the market falls SILENT. Fear grips the crowd. An occurrence rare in the world of Men -- AN OLYMPIAN 
APPROACHES. The clouds stop dead. The crowd stops. TIME STOPS. A PRESENCE WE DO NOT SEE moves to the BASILICA, the royal residence and assembly hall. 
INT. THE BASILICA - THRONE ROOM - DAY 
SPYROS Learning, science... love. 
PERSEUS 
(PASSIONATE) self-determination! Those things that give Man dignity and independence. 
MARMARA But what of the Gods, who had protected and guided us so long? They must breathe our prayers to survive. They hunger for 
WORSHIP -- 
SPYROS -- as lions hunger for blood. 
MARMARA Spyros! 
(TO TEKLA) Your father's mind is closed on these matters. 
SPYROS The Gods were desperate to claim our awe again. 
TEKLA Desperate... the Gods? 
SPYROS Yes, even the Gods. If they could not earn our faith with love, they would demand it with fear. Whatever was necessary to ensure              L their continued existence. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Marmara and the wide-eyed Tekla sit down. 
MARMARA And that is how war broke out between Man and Gods. (turning to serve 
PERSEUS) Now eat your dinner, which the Gods -- and your father -- have provided. 
INT. HOME OF SPYROS - PERSEUS' ROOM - NIGHT 
Middle of the night. Perseus lies wide awake in his tiny space. He stares, thinking about his friend. Suddenly, a KNOCK at the door. 
INT. HOME OF SPYROS - DOORWAY - NIGHT 
Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is oddly faded, washed-out. 
PERSEUS You... I saw you watching our boat at the cliff. 
WILTING GIRL It was not the boat I was watching. 
PERSEUS Can I be of service? 
WILTING GIRL Yes, of service. I need you to come with me on a journey. Perseus gives her a look. 
PERSEUS Right now? (as she nods) It wouldn't take much persuading to get me to leave this village, but tonight is impossible. My family can't wake and find me gone. Where do you want me to go? 
WILTING GIRL It's not what I want. I am in the service of others. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Perseus can't get over her beauty, the dulcet sound of her voice. Even so -- 
PERSEUS Come back in the morning and we can talk about it. 
WILTING GIRL I'm sorry. 
PERSEUS For what? Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a swarm, racing toward him. He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and falls. 
PERSEUS' WOOZY POV The Wilting Girl standing placidly in the doorway watching him. 
BACK TO SCENE He blacks out. 
EXT. SMALL SAILBOAT                                         (OPEN SEA)   - DAY 
A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering. 
CLOSER We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be healing as we look at them. Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting Girl. 
PERSEUS How long have I been out? 
PERSEUS Who, me? 
WILTING GIRL Zeus himself has chosen you. A demigod may be less than a God, but he's more than a Man. One foot in Humanity, the other in Divinity. Your marriage will be a symbol of accord between our races. 
PERSEUS Forget it. 
WILTING GIRL Such a union could save millions of souls. Perseus is struck by that. He looks off across the sea. 
PERSEUS And just who exactly am I supposed to marry? 
INT. BASILICA                                             (JOPPA)                                                   - SCULLERY CLOSET - DAY 
CLOSEUP: A hot embrace. In the blur of movement our first good look is at the GIRL, a beauty -- PRINCESSA 
ANDROMEDA,                                                18. The BOY is AGENOR, a kitchen helper -- ripped and sexy. It's hard to tell who's the aggressor here. Gasping, Andromeda holds him at bay -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANDROMEDA Do you think you can manhandle a Princess this way? (as he kisses her) As though she was hungry and needy as you, a mere servant? Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispers 
HOTLY -- 
ANDROMEDA very mistaken... a woman of my station... never be attracted... They go at it again. 
EXT. BASILICA - COLONNADE - DAY 
A NIMBLE GIRL hurries past SERVANTS hanging laundry in the atrium. She's PESHET, handmaid to Princessa Andromeda. She has a feline quality -- eyes, grace, agility. She raps on the scullery door. 
PESHET Princess... Princess! 
ANDROMEDA (O.S.) (muffled from inside) The Princess is not here. 
(A SQUEAL) Find another... Princess. 
PESHET The Queen approaches! 
ANDROMEDA (O.S.) I don't care! 
PESHET Andromeda! You'll care enough if you're caught! Remember last time... From inside we HEAR complaining, more kissing and moaning. 
CASSIOPEIA                                                 (O.S.) Peshet! Startled, Peshet spins to see the Queen approach. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CASSIOPEIA Where is the Princess? 
INT. SCULLERY CLOSET - SAME TIME 
Andromeda freezes at her mother's voice, stops Agenor, finger to her lips. He ignores her, starts again. Andromeda does something below the frame that jolts him off. The girl can take care of herself. 
EXT. COLONNADE - SAME TIME 
Peshet faces the Queen. 
PESHET Is she not in her chambers, ma'am? 
CASSIOPEIA She is not. You are expected to know her -- A SQUEAL and WHISPERING from the closet stops Cassiopeia. She throws a perturbed glance at the door. Peshet looks guilty. 
CASSIOPEIA 
(LOUDLY) Tell the Princess -- should you find her -- her father and I want to see her at once. She stalks away. Urgently, through the door -- 
PESHET Princess, it's the King as well! 
INT. BASILICA - ROYAL PARLOR - DAY 
A lavish room. Cassiopeia and Kepheus sit in golden chairs, looking off. Andromeda ENTERS FRAME, furious. with conviction -- 
IRRITABLY) What is she? 
CASSIOPEIA 
(EMBARRASSED) I'm sure she's preparing herself to make the best possible impression. Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple. Kepheus paces with mounting impatience. 
KEPHEUS 
(LECTURING PERSEUS 
AGAIN) -- and all so she could be thrust into a momentous conflict... of which she knows nothing at all. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PERSEUS She's not the only one, sir. I don't know much about the events for which I've been drafted. 
KEPHEUS (disarmed, but tough 
GUY) I take no comfort in that, young man. In fact, I find little to take comfort in here. You are a stranger from a distant place, and I am asked to entrust the welfare of my daughter to you. 
(LEANING INTO 
PERSEUS) If you are not kind and patient with her, if any harm of any kind should come her way, I will have your head on a stake. Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts his hand on the hilt of his sword. 
KEPHEUS Is this amusing to you? 
PERSEUS Not even a little, my lord. It's just that I myself was waylaid -- snatched also, as you say, from my happy springtime... Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him. 
PERSEUS I've been told I'm to play a part in events which serve a higher purpose... of which I'm not at all convinced. 
KEPHEUS Does a truce in the war between Men and Gods not strike you as a higher purpose? 
PERSEUS With all respect, I have never seen a God. On my island, they're no more than a story. 
KEPHEUS You will learn there is more to this universe than is found on your island. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KEPHEUS                                                  (CONT-D) 
(TO CASSIOPEIA) This is supposed to be the son of a God, yet he doubts their existence! 
CASSIOPEIA 
(TO PERSEUS) They exist, young man. But if you doubt their power, I join you -- 
KEPHEUS 
(ANGRY) Cassiopeia! We have agreed such talk has no place in this palace. 
CASSIOPEIA 
(DEFIANT) Have we? 
PERSEUS I can only proceed based on what I have experienced, not on a faith I do not possess. 
KEPHEUS Where does a young person get such ideas? 
PERSEUS Perhaps from my adopted father, sir. I admire him greatly, and he believes in little he cannot hold in his hand. 
KEPHEUS Is he a scholar? 
PERSEUS No, Your Highness, a fisherman. 
AMOUN (O.S.) I know this mentor who so influences young Perseus. Amoun has silently entered the chamber. Perseus reacts in amazement. 
EXT. OCEAN TERRACE - MAGIC HOUR 
Perseus follows the MUSIC and the sound of LAUGHTER to a crowded terrace overlooking the sea. Upper class YOUNG PEOPLE are partying en masse. Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl, testing his instincts. Suddenly, he stops in his tracks, looking off -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends. Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane. A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN embraces her. She gives him a deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the crush. 
EXT. BALUSTRADE - MAGIC HOUR 
Andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset. The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture stops him cold. 
PERSEUS                                                     (O.S.) Very beautiful. Andromeda spins, petulant. 
ANDROMEDA Will you please give me some 
PEACE -- The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause. 
ANDROMEDA What did you say? 
PERSEUS I said, 'Very beautiful.' 
ANDROMEDA Do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family? 
PERSEUS I meant the sunset. She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder. 
ANDROMEDA Do you always start a seduction with an insult? Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks at the sea. 
PERSEUS I know nothing of seduction. I'm a simple fisherman. My home is across that water. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANDROMEDA What brings you here? 
PERSEUS To Joppa? I was kidnapped. 
ANDROMEDA I mean here, tonight. He looks over at her a long moment. 
PERSEUS I've come to see my future wife. Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad mix of emotions crosses her face. 
EXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT 
Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays close, attracted to him. 
ANDROMEDA It's not personal. You're not a bad-looking boy. (as Perseus laughs) I'm too young. I don't want to be married. 
PERSEUS Me either. 
ANDROMEDA Then why are you doing it? 
PERSEUS No one asked me. And now that I've met you, I don't know if I can go through with it. (off her look) It's not personal. Seeing you makes it real. I think a man should make his own decisions. I won't be the pawn of a King or a God. She looks at him with new interest. 
ANDROMEDA Since we agree, it's settled. No marriage. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PERSEUS I don't think it's going to be that simple. Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer. 
ANDROMEDA That doesn't mean we can't be friends. Get to know each other. I want to show you something. She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze. 
EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT 
Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at her excitement. 
PERSEUS I'm already lost. 
ANDROMEDA I'll take care of you. They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed. 
KALIBOS. 
TIAMAT (V.O.) (to the monster) My Servant, your lonely solitude now ends... It's time to leave. 
EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - SUNRISE 
Perseus wakes on the bed of foliage, looks around. Andromeda is gone. He thinks, smiles. Then he remembers his situation. The smile fades. 
INT. THE BASILICA - GREAT HALL - EVENING 
Perseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor, moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her. 
ANDROMEDA You're late. 
PERSEUS I didn't know how to get this outfit on. 
ANDROMEDA I want to thank you for seeing me home. I was so flushed with wine I can't recall much of the evening. Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd. 
PERSEUS Me either. 
PERSEUS' POV - THE WILTING GIRL watches from the back of the hall. When they make eye contact, she quickly looks away. 
BACK TO SCENE Perseus is surprised by his feelings. Andromeda has seen her, too. He has a guilty moment and averts his eyes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANDROMEDA At what point do you plan to tell them we're not getting married? 
PERSEUS Tell who? 
ANDROMEDA (a sweeping gesture) Them... 
FROM BEHIND THEM We see the ecstatic crowd of thousands, all celebrating the union. MUSIC STOPS and the crowd begins to settle. 
ROYAL HERALD (0.5.) The Queen will speak! The room QUIETS as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of the dais with a cup of wine, not her first. 
CASSIOPEIA I won't be long-winded. You all know I am a modest person, no matter my rank. Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus, watching from his throne. 
CASSIOPEIA 
(WITH EDGE) This is not a celebration of a betrothal... (as Kepheus is on 
ALERT) not the celebration of the happiness of two parents, or of our good people. Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal Entourage. 
CASSIOPEIA This union represents new hope for a lasting peace! That is the only cause for celebration. The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause. Amoun wills her to stop. Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks over at the Princess. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CASSIOPEIA 
(MOIST-EYED) My sweet Andromeda... grown into a fine young woman, confident and sure. Look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would end. Cassiopeia raises her glass. 
CASSIOPEIA To my beautiful daughter... more beautiful than all the women of Joppa. More beautiful than the Gardens of Nineveh... Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a spiteful glance. 
CASSIOPEIA More beautiful than the turquoise ocean and its sublime Goddess of the Deep... Tiamat herself! My daughter is a beauty even a Goddess must envy. Amoun reacts in dismay. A distressed MURMUR roils the crowd. Andromeda goes to her mother. 
CASSIOPEIA I've gone on too long -- She stops with a look of sudden dread. The Great Hall DARKENS. The torch flames TURN BLACK. The temperature drops. The statues lining the hall shut their eyes and the doors burst open. TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first Olympian. Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her knees. 
TIAMAT You have blasphemed powers beyond understanding... You, a stupid braying goat before the unfathomable galaxies. You dare put this frivolous, scrawny slut... 
(AS ANDROMEDA 
FLINCHES) above the infinite Goddess of the Deep! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS NAKED. Her body, made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent -- sexy and terrifying. Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in the streets, is in the throng. His reaction is a mix of religious ecstasy and outright lust. The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't. She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes her frame -- 
INT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT 
Tiamat's storm is pounding Joppa. LIGHTNING stabs through the dark clouds. RAIN POUNDS the tiles outside Andromeda's lavish bedroom. Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed, distressed. 
PESHET You must sleep. (off no reaction) Princessat You must take care of yourself. A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her, thinking. 
ANDROMEDA My father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster. 
PESHET I'm sure that is not so. 
ANDROMEDA I saw it. I heard the words. My loving father, his beloved child. Only Perseus stayed his decision. 
(TEARS COME) And do you know the worst part, Peshet? He was right. Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING. 
ANDROMEDA The city is besieged, the people suffer. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANDROMEDA (CONT'D) Because of me, because he did not offer me up. Is that right? 
PESHET Go to sleep, my lady. 
ANDROMEDA (wiping her eyes) Sleep? Sleep will come soon enough for me, faithful one. In one month... at the latest. The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER. 
EXT. THE VIA DAHLIA - NIGHT 
The sound of that same DISTANT THUNDER as the Expedition follows the road. To the south behind them, LIGHTNING FLASHES over faraway Joppa. 
SUPERIMPOSE: THE VIA DAHLIA, NORTH OF JOPPA... 28   DAYS REMAINING 
Perseus and the Wilting Girl ride side by side. Perseus looks back at the distant storm. 
PERSEUS Joppa is pummelled by the Dark Goddess. 
WILTING GIRL 
(WITHOUT LOOKING) It will not stop. Tiamat knows no mercy. 
The moonlight illuminates a crumbling, limestone arch on which time-worn letters read: "VIA DAHLIA." 
PERSEUS By what name may mortals call you? 
WILTING GIRL I have no name. 
PERSEUS Who do your worshippers pray to? 
WILTING GIRL I can't remember. 
PERSEUS Perhaps that is why they are falling in number? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Wilting Girl flinches, and Perseus feels guilty about his jest. 
PERSEUS I have to call you something... 
(THINKING) Since we're naming you on this road, what about 'Via Dahlia'? She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He's defensive. 
PERSEUS That's a pretty name. Wait, better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's that... 'Vidalia'? That's more than pretty, beautiful really, just as you are. She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road ahead. 
PERSEUS You don't like it? (as she murmurs) What's that? I missed it -- 
WILTING GIRL (just loud enough to 
HEAR) I do not object. She picks up the pace, moving her horse a little ahead. He smiles. 
EXT. FOREST CLEARING (VIA DAHLIA) - NIGHT 
ICOS Perseus. How long do you think you could stay on one of those? Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look. 
BOREAS Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man can ride a Pegasus. 
ICOS Did not Bellerophon tame the Great White Pegasus? 
BOREAS You're right. But he was a demigod... 
PERSEUS 
(EAGER) Then this will be a good way to find out just what I am. 
DRACO Stop it, rogues. One of our own has disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief. What if Perseus is bucked to his death from a thousand feet up? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOREAS Don't worry, Commander, the boy won't even get on its back. With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him back down. 
DRACO Don't do this. If we go back to camp right now, we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight. A true leader will not be distracted. 
PERSEUS I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun is. I'm too young to start avoiding trouble. Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings, buffeting Perseus with gusts. The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus face-first into the dirt. Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the clearing. 
BOREAS I'll collect him right now, Commander. Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL. The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air, homing in on Perseus. 
DRACO Perseus, get out of there! Icos, fetch the others. Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus does the same. 
DRACO I told you to run, boy. You'll make things worse. 
EXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - DAY 
Hearing the ROARS, the Expedition is already up. Icos arrives. 
ICOS A Humbaba! Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the woods; the others follow. 
EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY 
The reinforcements arrive to see Humbaba pin Boreas with its talons. 
DRACO Boreas! Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips off Boreas' head and swallows his body. Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword swinging. 
AMOUN No, Perseus! 
VIDALIA Get back! Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling- bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT 
HOOK. Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire and metal. The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one leg, but has it ripped from his hands. 
VIDALIA A delusion is planted in its mind. It thinks it's starving and it wants to feed on -- 
(SUDDENLY 
UNDERSTANDING) 
-- YOU! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's mouth with his saber. 
VIDALIA I can't reverse the powerful curse. But if the monster's hungry, I can feed it. Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake them away, Mongke is thrown clear. 
VIDALIA 
(TO DRACO) Now! The belly! Slash the belly! Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES 
TO THE GROUND. The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake the viscera from their feathers and take flight. 
EXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - STREAM - DAY 
Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him, furious. 
CLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands beside it -- completely different. TILT UP TO: Kalibos. Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters. Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs the air around Perseus. 
VIDALIA 
(WHISPERING) Lotophagi. Lotus-eaters. We should leave... now. 
PERSEUS I won't do anything rash. I've learned my lesson. 
VIDALIA This time you must do something rash. We all must. Kalibos leans close to Perseus. 
KALIBOS Tosharicana... demigod... expulsotat... Zeusl 
PERSEUS No... Perseus. PERSEUS WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD. The whole Expedition comes to life as                                                 -- THE LOTOPHAGI ATTACK, swift and brutal. Long arms thrash and rip at the Praetorians. Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES. Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a leather sack of sand. 
AMOUN Muster to me! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting. 
AMOUN Come on! You can pass through! Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo, killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks back at Kosmo in horror. Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him, sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside. Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over the corpse into the protected circle. The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the barrier of insects to no avail. 
AMOUN Only humans can penetrate the shield! Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm, thinking. 
PERSEUS Only humans... He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there, alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way toward the barrier. 
PERSEUS Drop the barrier!                                          r 
AMOUN No! It's too late for her! 
PERSEUS Drop it, Amoun! At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PERSEUS Take the barrier down or I'll go through it! 
AMOUN Have you learned nothing? If you break out now, we're all at risk. On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh. Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love. 
PERSEUS I've learned one thing for certain! Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian. 
PERSEUS Get down! Perseus backs away three steps. To the others               -- 
PERSEUS Get ready to defend yourselves! Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around the humans. They have only a moment to react as the stunned Lotophagi come to their senses. 
DRACO Let's kill these freks! Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia. Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a look: "You're the one that I want." They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges, thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape. Perseus rolls out of the way. Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO! Bloody spittle flies from his tongue. Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia and careens toward her, head bloody. Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back with both feet, knocking him over the edge. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES. He slams into the dust, dead. Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the bloody puncture wounds. 
VIDALIA 
(SOOTHING) Okay... sshh... I've got you. A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans the horizon. 
DOWN BELOW Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long. The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted, looking around nervously. Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions. Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking all but their blue eyes. They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing SCIMITARS to cut them down. 
ATOP THE ROCKS in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing in. 
PERSEUS Vidalia... we need to help them... He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what 
SHE SEES: The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace -- King Acrisius. 
EXT. SIROQUE MOUNTAINS - DJINN CARAVAN - NIGHT 
A STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs. 
INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT 
Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he cannot hear her -- 
FORESIGHT) Yes. They have to take turns. If they all could see at once, they would be invincible, which one cannot risk in beings so grotesque. 
EXT. CAMP                                                   (SKOLOTHIA)                           - NIGHT 
The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle. WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus. OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a strike. 
SPYROS Stay away from my boy! Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman over his head, where he lands hard with an "UMPH!" Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another charge. Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood; eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the 
WHISPERING. 
PERSEUS Spyros, he means me no harm. The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt. The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels before Perseus, head bowed. 
PERSEUS I hear you and I understand you. But I don't know how. 
SHAIKH SULEIMAN Moi ne epos ae'prositi, mene daeva. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PERSEUS You are praying to me? There must be a mistake. The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade, honoring Zeus. 
PERSEUS An offering'? I thank you and take it humbly, as agift from a friend, not an offering. He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the Shaikh. 
SHAIKH SULEIMAN Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr. 
PERSEUS You honor my father? You honor Spyros? 
SHAIKH SULEIMAN Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus... Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this mysterious stranger. 
EXT. MOIRAI PILLAR - NIGHT 
The Expedition ascends the sheer pinnacle via rain-slick stairs and GROANING ROPE BRIDGES. 
EXT. SUMMIT OF MOIRAI PILLAR - SUNRISE 
In a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE- STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around: regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby bones. A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human- sized owls with the gray faces of old crones                (Strix). Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and pop it in to study the arrivals. 
URD (low, hoot-owl) Amoun... So sorry to see you again. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AMOUN Likewise, Urd. I seek your counsel. 
VERDANDI 
(SHRIEKING) You want us to tell you about Leviathan. 
AMOUN You know already... of course. 
VERDANDI We know this -- the Kraken cannot be defeated. 
SKULD 
(PIERCING) You've wasted a journey. I trust it was not a taxing one. The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing irritation. 
AMOUN Surely the beast from the sea has some weakness. You owe me this answer at least. 
URD The Sisters owe nothing to you or any Man! She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention on Perseus. 
VERDANDI There's something wrong with that one. I don't like having him here. 
SKULD Let me take a look. Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH. Perseus goes to the precipice. 
PERSEUS Tell us what we want to know or your Eye has seen its last. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers. 
(NODS) If ever I should meet him. (turns toward the 
VAULT) I need a light. The Shaikh holds a branch near his eyes until the end bursts into flame and hands it to Perseus, who disappears into the blackness. 
INT. VAULT OF THE NORN SISTERS - DAY 
Perseus fights through cobwebs and hanging roots. The torch REVEALS piles of armor, bones, and broken weapons. A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A SHIELD, TARNISHED AND DENTED. Unsure why it attracted him, he shoulders it and leaves. 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
The STORM RAGES around a FLEET OF SHIPS, manned by armored CREWMEN, that rises and falls on hundred-foot mountains of water. 
EXT. DECK OF LEAD SHIP - NIGHT 
The FIRST MATE shouts to the stalwart CAPTAIN. 
FIRST MATE Captain, the storm is too great! 
CAPTAIN Joppa is under siege! King Kepheus needs these supplies! Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints through the rain... and sees the GIGANTIC SCUTED TAIL of Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving the fleet untouched. But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon. The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at impossible speed -- TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS THROUGH the other ships without noticing, obliterating them in seconds, sending all hands to the depths. 
EXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON - PROW - CLOSE ON TIAMAT'S 
FRIGHTENING VISAGE - NIGHT Lit by FLASHES OF LIGHTNING. The Goddess smiles in satisfaction at the devastation. 
EXT. JETTY (THE TETHYS SEA) - DAY 
A bleak shore. A boulder jetty juts into the cold pewter sea and fades into the fog. Chunks of ice bob on the lapping waves. 
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TETHYS SEA...   12 DAYS REMAINING 
The Expedition, miserably wet, waits for passage around a campfire on the frigid beach. Perseus, polishing the shield he got from the Norns, looks to Amoun, who sits smoking. 
PERSEUS Tell of the Gorgoneion. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AMOUN The Rape of Medusa? Everyone falls silent. The soldiers shift, suddenly nervous. 
THAD With respect, Magi, do not recite that black tale. You'll bring the sky down upon us. 
SPYROS Does a fairy tale frighten you, soldier? Thad looks at him, sharply. 
DRACO Tell the story, sir. My men fear only one thing -- to let fear in their hearts. Mongke says something that means, "Go ahead already." 
AMOUN Medusa was a tender young woman once -- a mortal creature of such rare beauty as to tempt even the Gods. One night, on the road home, she caught the eye of the God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set the Void. 
FLASHBACK - EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 
A stunning beauty, YOUNG MEDUSA, carries a water pitcher. Suddenly, frightened, she turns, sees something, drops the pitcher and runs. 
AMOUN (V.0.) She hastened to hallowed ground, thinking the Goddess Tiamat would protect her in her temple. But the God Set followed. A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in pursuit. 
INT. TEMPLE OF TIAMAT - NIGHT 
In the center of the dark hall, SET overtakes Medusa,        L. forcing her down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: His cloak ripples as SHAPES PUSH THROUGH THE SPECTRAL FOLDS -- the girl's reaching fingers, her screaming face. 
AMOUN (V.0.) He ravished her on the cold floor. She felt the heartless passion of a God. 
SAME SCENE - LATER Alone, Medusa crawls with bloody fingernails toward the altar. 
AMOUN (V.0.) Despoiled and broken in the shadow of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for comfort and pleaded for courage... But the Goddess of the Deep regarded Medusa with disdain. The prayers of such a frail and filthy mortal angered Tiamat. A bust of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her BLAZING eyes, THROWING A LONG SHADOW OF MEDUSA onto the wall. 
AMOUN (V.0.) The Goddess twisted young Medusa into a loathsome new thing... The contorting shadow shows the transformation. Legs twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads wriggle from her skull. 
L 
EXT. GALLEY - UPPER DECK - DAY 
Spyros is at the rail, looking over the ocean of ice. Perseus, troubled, arrives. Spyros looks at him closely. 
PERSEUS What? 
SPYROS Nothing. 
PERSEUS What do you see? 
SPYROS A look I know well. 
PERSEUS From me? 
SPYROS Never before. 
PERSEUS Then where? Spyros smiles, puts his huge, calloused hand on Perseus' shoulder. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SPYROS In my own mirror, son. 
PERSEUS When does it go away? 
SPYROS If we're lucky... never. 
EXT. COAST OF TARTAROS - DAY 
A landscape of volcanic rock. Lava pouring into the sea raises VEILS OF STEAM, through which the Expedition disembarks from the galley. 
SUPERIMPOSE: COAST OF TARTAROS...                          10                                                          DAYS REMAINING 
EXT. TARTAROS - DAY 
The Expedition crosses the black terrain, lava vents here or there. 
EXT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - LAVA FIELD - DAY 
In the distance, dark ruins -- an ominous tilted facade, half-sunk in the dried lava flow. 
SHAIKH SULEIMAN Jaggous temploi Tartaros de Gorgoneion maitress. 
AMOUN The Temple of Tartaros... Medusa's lair. Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words and point. They all 
LOOK -- TWO STONE STATUES flank the entrance: a pair of enormous CENTAURS -- NESSUS and IXION, their eyelids sewn shut. Icos and Krikor exchange distressed looks. 
AMOUN Medusa must have turned them to stone. Perseus swings his sickle, measuring its balance, and adjusts his shield. He checks a canvas sack on his belt. 
PERSEUS I'm going into the Temple. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DRACO I am with you. 
SPYROS 
(STEPS FORWARD) I go with my boy. Perseus, Spyros, and Draco split off toward the temple. Suddenly, the two "statues," Nessus and Ixion, shake off their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE. They GALLOP down the ridge, hooves shaking the ground. They raise fearsome spiky maces of jagged iron. Vidalia readies her sling. The Shaikh draws his scimitar. Mongke and Tamburlane load their handgonnes, the others draw swords. 
EXT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - PORTICO - DAY 
The Temple group arrives at the steps. Draco speaks to 
PERSEUS 
DRACO Are you afraid? 
PERSEUS Of what? 
CONTINUED: 
KEPHEUS 
(SKEPTICAL) From your lips, I pray, to his true father's ear. Andromeda has appeared. All are shocked to see her. She addresses the others with an authority we've never seen. 
ANDROMEDA I would speak with the King in private. 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE Princess, let us find a protected 
PLACE -- 
ANDROMEDA We can speak here, in the elements our subjects endure. The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away, leaving father and daughter alone. Andromeda looks down at the tent city. 
KEPHEUS They take refuge from the Lower Wharf. A sight I wish you'd never seen. 
ANDROMEDA You've sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world. 
KEPHEUS I would have it no other way. 
ANDROMEDA And I thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth. But now, with Mother so... (turns to him) It's time I shared this burden you've carried so long. Filled with emotion, he puts an arm around her. 
KEPHEUS You make me proud, but you are only a child... my little one. 
ANDROMEDA No, no longer. Your protection of me has brought hardship to our people... 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANDROMEDA (CONT'D) and to me, perhaps, new understanding. I must ask you something, Father. She turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city. 
ANDROMEDA If you could end this siege with just one unselfish act, would you do it? 
KEPHEUS To save my people, yes, of course. 
ANDROMEDA Such an act is within my power. He studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed. 
KEPH EUS Stop itl I forbid you to entertain such thoughts. 
ANDROMEDA Perseus and the others were willing to give everything. 
KEPHEUS (turns her to him) Listen to me. By the time this is over, your mother and I may well be gone. But I guarantee the day is coming when Joppa will know glory under Queen Andromeda. She embraces him, head upon his shoulder, where he can't see her resolve. 
ANDROMEDA Be at peace, Father, I will not cause you any more sadness than I already have. 
EXT. OLIVE GROVES (ILLYRIA)   - MILESTONE - DAY 
An ancient walled road curves over the pastoral orchard hills. 
SUPERIMPOSE: MILESTONE, HILLS OF ILLYRIA... 3 DAYS 
REMAINING The exhausted Expedition is now six: Perseus, Vidalia, Amoun, Spyros, Mongke, and Tamburlane. They've stopped at a well beside a MILESTONE. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Spyros studies the ancient words carved into the milestone: "Polis of JOVE PATER : XI stadia S." 
SPYROS Eleven stadia to the South... What is 'Polis of Jove Pater'? I'm ignorant of this. 
AMOUN Jove the Father is another name by which Zeus was known. This milestone dates from when city states were named for their patron deities. Perseus, filling his canteen, peers at the marker as Amoun uses one hand to cover the letters "-VE" and the other the letters "-TER." 
AMOUN 'The Polis of Jove Pater' is the ancient name of -- 
PERSEUS -- Joppa. 
AMOUN Yes, Joppa... once the most sacred site in the worship of Jove. 
PERSEUS (dawning on him) Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take hostage. (as Amoun confirms 
PERSEUS I was mad with fear. I was no hero. I just didn't want to die. Perseus turns toward the altar. 
PERSEUS What is this? A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced. Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring. 
VIDALIA When the war began, Men ranged through the hills, stamping out any trace of God-worship they found. (touching the tablet) My true name was carved here. When it was obliterated, my worshippers lost faith and my last season began. 
PERSEUS How long do you have? 
VIDALIA Only days. 
PERSEUS What will happen? 
VIDALIA I will vanish, quick as dew evaporating at dawn. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VIDALIA (CONT'D) No one will notice the moment because all thought of me will be gone. 
PERSEUS What about me? 
VIDALIA Nothing can save me. 
He takes her in his arms. Vidalia is riven by anguish and desire. 
PERSEUS I don't believe that. Will love not buy another day, Vidalia? 
VIDALIA 
(TEARS FLOWING) I was cut free of earthly longing. Why did you have to give me a name? The light is almost gone now. They kiss. The wilted blossoms in her crown slowly open with color. They begin to make love. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. UNDERGROUND SHRINE - NIGHT 
Perseus and Vidalia lie together, listening to the SOUNDS of nightingale, cricket and owl. 
PERSEUS When you vanish, I'll find you. 
VIDALIA Close your eyes.                                            1 
PERSEUS I'd rather look at you. 
VIDALIA Do what I tell you. (as he does) I'm going to give you a spell. 
PERSEUS Don't give away your secrets. You still have need of them. 
L 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VIDALIA Let me give you this sliver of magic. I'll write it on your instinct. When the time comes, you'll know how to use it. She takes his head in her hands, pressing her forehead to his. Gently, her fingers slip into his mind. A TEAR runs down her cheek. 
PERSEUS' POV In QUICK FLASHES: A white lid opens to a black eye. Reflected in the eye -- clouds roll over a stormy sky. 
THEN: Feathered WHITE WINGS beat the air. Then: Racing over the surface of a blue SEA, and then down, down, to SMASH THROUGH the surface, into the depths. 
INT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - NIGHT 
Tiamat and Set the Void stand over the corpse of Medusa. Baby snakes and beetles spill out of her neatly-sliced neck. Tiamat is furious. 
TIAMAT How did he do this? They were not even to reach Medusa. 
SET Fate has begun to shift. The future ripples with uncertainty. 
TIAMAT Spare me your pitiful maundering! There is no Fate beyond my actions and no uncertainty in the face of my will. 
FANTASOS We invoke thee, Queen of the Deep. We attend thee only to listen and obey. Fantasos moves through smoke to an altar, on which is a fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation we've seen. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FANTASOS We serve your will so that we may be absorbed into your perfection... Holy of holies... Tiamat! The Sanctuary is suddenly filled with the VOICE of -- 
TIAMAT                                                      (V.0.) Loyal servants... it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it breathes. 
TIAMAT (V.0.) You have sown the seeds of revolt. Now comes the harvest. My legions stand ready at the gates. Only one rite of consecration remains before the Ascension. Fantasos, closest to the Idol, flinches, buffeted by an unseen draft. 
TIAMAT                                                      (V.0.) The hour of sacrifice is upon us. Offer up the Princess Andromeda to Leviathan. 
INT. THE BASILICA - ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT 
A GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia. 
INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT 
The GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly where she is. 
EXT. THE BASILICA - BACK GATE - NIGHT 
The GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her palm and hurries inside. After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open gate. 
INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS.- NIGHT 
L Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign of Andromeda. 
PESHET My lady? Princess Andromeda? She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off, 
ALARMED -- Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony, preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound, teetering. Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid. 
ANDROMEDA Peshet, stop! I know what I am meant to do. 
PESHET My lady, please -- 
ANDROMEDA I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me. 
PESHET Princessa, give me your hand. Andromeda, please. Please. 
ANDROMEDA (looks at the drop) I'm not afraid anymore. I will do what I must. I will die so that they may live. 
R She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING on the marble. 
PESHET I won't allow it, my lady. Today, you are only a Princess. One day your people may need a Queen ready to die for them. Peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it. 
PESHET                                                      C Come, we have to hide you... right now. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She stops, picks up Andromeda's knife and hands it to       s her. Andromeda accepts it with resolve. 
PESHET Good. 
EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT 
Peshet leads Andromeda out. 
ANDROMEDA We must get to my mother and father. A VOICE from the darkness: 
AGENOR (O.S.) Your father is dead and your mother has been relieved of her suffering. The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance. 
AGENOR The Princessa is coming with us. She has a rendezvous to keep. Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet. Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda. 
PESHET Come and get her. Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To the Second Rebel -- 
AGENOR Take the Princess -- alive! The Second Rebel circles around Peshet toward Andromeda. 
PESHET Run, Princess! Save yourself. Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel. Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily closes the gap. 
SPYROS The sacrifice has begun. 
PERSEUS I must get to the cliffs! 
SPYROS How? They all look at what separates them from the city -- 
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY 
The MONSTER ARMY OF TIAMAT surges forward with savage 
BATTLE CRIES. The GATES OF THE CITY swing open. Out march the giant mechanical AUTOMATA, followed by streaming legions of JOPPAN INFANTRY. The two armies slam together -- The battle is joined. THEY FIGHT. 
EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY 
GONG! The wind rocks Andromeda on her CREAKING CHAIN. She watches... A mile offshore, a BULGE OF WATER SWELLS and plows toward the coast. The Onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races closer. Leviathan explodes from the surface, too huge to be seen whole. It shoots straight up, up, up the three-hundred- foot cliffs. The Kraken's jaws hurtle up at Andromeda. Onlookers recoil. Fantasos stumbles in panicked retreat. The creature's BELLOW is deafening. At the apex of its surge, it SNAPS ITS JAWS SHUT with a booming THUNDERCRACK... just millimeters from Andromeda's dangling head -- and FALLS BACK. Churning surf surrounds its endless SLIDE back down. 
ANDROMEDA'S POV The Kraken slips underwater and its vast shadow immediately begins to circle wide for another attempt. 
EXT. WOODED RIDGE                                           - DAY 
Spyros, Mongke and Tamburlane mount their nervous horses. PUSH IN ON Perseus, who does not mount up. From his saddle, he takes the bloody canvas bag with Medusa's head inside and slaps his horse away. Be MURMURS the INCANTATION Vidalia planted in his mind. 
FLASHES OF WHAT PERSEUS SEES A white lid opens to a black eye... Feathered WINGS beat the air... The rippled flanks of a WHITE CREATURE. 
BACK TO SCENE Perseus HEARS the BEATING OF THE WINGS and looks toward the forest. PEGASUS WHOOSHES over the treetops, BANKS and LANDS in front of Perseus. It bows, inviting Perseus aboard. Perseus climbs on and rides up to the others, who are flabbergasted. 
PERSEUS May we all have a good ride today! He spurs Pegasus. it beats its wings, launching from the ridge with astounding power. 
MONGKE AND TAMBURLANE Qi chin yang hung xian! 
SPYROS No shit. They raise their weapons and spur their horses down the slope to war. 
EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY 
CLICK-CLACK-CLICK-CLACK. The chain lowers Andromeda toward the sea. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Andromeda manages to get herself swinging back and forth until she builds enough momentum to reach up and grasp the links above her. With effort, she climbs the very chain she dangles from, leaving a slack loop beneath. Leviathan's eyes break the surface below, watching Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES UPWARDS, jaws wide. 
FROM ABOVE - ANDROMEDA Leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her. UP, UP, UP. The JAWS SNAP CLOSED... just below her climbing feet. So close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN! The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its jaws. The Princessa plummets with it. 
UP ON THE PLATFORM The chain unreels wildly, pulls tight... and rips the platform from its anchors. It careens over the edge, taking Fantasos, Agenor and their Thugs to their screaming death. A SHADOW glides over the shocked onlookers. One by one, they tear their gaze from the sea and look up, GASPING 
AT -- PERSEUS AND PEGASUS descending. Perseus sees Andromeda splash down and get pulled under. The winch platform SLAMS into the cliff face, pulled by Leviathan. 
PERSEUS' DIVING POV Exactly the image he saw when Vidalia first planted the spell in his mind -- down, down toward the dark sea. 
BACK TO SCENE Perseus and Pegasus arrive a moment before the crashing winch. Perseus dives off with the bloody Medusa bag in hand. With his free hand, he catches the chain just ahead of the winch and goes under. 
EXT. UNDERSEA - DAY 
Leviathan hurtles downward. Andromeda flails, bound to the chain. 
FAR ABOVE Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand. Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles. Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both sinking. Perseus goes after the sack. Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her. Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her entire body. The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor. The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the harpoon. Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked toward the maw. Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip. LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the harpoon in the Kraken's tail -- -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious Andromeda. Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits Andromeda out. The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus. Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The monster thrashes, tries to turn -- but unbending stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves -- the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent hook. Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a mountain range, picking up speed as it plunges into the 
ABYSS                                                       -- Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it 
DROPS -- -- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above it, creating a giant opening to the sky. 
EXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON                                (OCEAN)                                                     - PROW - DAY 
Tiamat's face contorts, sensing her beloved Leviathan is dead. She turns at the sound of GHASTLY CREAKING -- the immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the ocean. As the towering masts drop below wave-level, Tiamat raises her arms to the sky -- 
TIAMAT I damn you, Zeus! You will hear my curses forever in the crash of 
SURF                                                        -- Walls of water collapse, burying the Goddess, her ship, and her malediction deep in her realm. We HEAR a world- rocking ROAR, which booms off toward --

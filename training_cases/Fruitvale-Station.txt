2     INT. OSCAR'S APARTMENT- BEDROOOM- NIGHT                       2 
We open on an expensive looking flip cellphone sitting on a dresser. Next to it, a large zip lock bag of marijuana. We stay here. 
OSCAR (O.S.) What's your resolution? 
SOPHINA (O.S.) I'm gonna cut carbs. 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                      2A. 2      CONTINUED:                                            2 
OSCAR (O.S.) You trippin. You look fine. Plus you Mexican. You cut carbs and you can't eat nothin yo grandma cooks. 
(CONTINUED) Goldenrod (7/19/2012)                                      3. 2      CONTINUED:                                                2 
SOPHINA (O.S) FUCK YOU...You just gotta help me stick to it. It only takes 30 days to form a habit. Then it becomes second nature. 
OSCAR (O.S.) Really? Who told you that? 
SOPHINA (O.S.) ... Oprah 
Oscar laughs hard at this. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) What's yours. 
OSCAR I'm gonna quit selling trees. 
The PHONE VIBRATES and RINGS "MARCUS CALLING" shows on the outer screen. 
Oscar's moves towards the cellphone. 
SOPHINA (O.S.) Osc. 
Oscar stops in his tracks. 
SOPHINA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Don't go out there tonight, stay home. 
(CONTINUED) Goldenrod (7/19/2012)                                        4. 2      CONTINUED:                                                  2 
OSCAR (O.S.) You gonna give me a reason to? 
Sophina doesn't answer. The phone rings again. Oscar's hand quickly picks it up and flips it open. We follow the phone to his face and we see him for the first time, a 22 year old Black man with a warm smile. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) (into phone) Aye bruh it's bad tonight. I gotta catch you tomorrow. 
He closes it before the guy on the other end can respond. He takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with SOPHINA MESA, a curvy 24 year old Mexican American woman. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Look, I'm not going out, you happy now? 
Sophina nods. Oscar moves closer to her and kisses her on her neck. She kisses him back a bit, then scoots away. 
Oscar kisses her again. Puts his hand in her hair. 
SOPHINA Osc. Osc, hold up. 
Oscar stops. Sophina scoots away even further. 
(CONTINUED) Pink (6/25/2012)                                              5. 2      CONTINUED:                                                   2 
OSCAR Man, wussup? I been home hella long... 
SOPHINA I don't know...Every time you touch me, I can't help to think about how you was touchin that Bitch. 
Oscar shakes his head at this, sighs. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) You know what? You right, go. 
SOPHINA Don't argue T. 
Tatiana pouts. Sophina downs a cup full of orange juice, grabs both lunch bags, Tatiana, and heads for the door. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) Com'on Osc. We gotta stop and get gas too. 
OSCAR We got enough to get yall there. 
Sophina shoots Oscar a look. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Go start the car up. You got your keys? 
(CONTINUED) Pink (6/25/2012)                                           8. 4      CONTINUED:                                                4 
Sophina nods. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Go. I gotta grab my beanie. 
Sophina and Tatiana leave. Oscar watches them go for a beat. He turns to the cabinet.

6     EXT. FIRST FRUIT LEARNING CENTER- DAY                         6 
Oscar and Tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two story house. A picture of an apple tree is painted next to the door. Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a frizz in her hair. He looks back at the car. 
We see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down mirror. 
Oscar turns to Tatiana. He then takes her hand, and places something inside of it. 
Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger over his lips. 
Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile. She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. He stands up and knocks on the front door. 
MRS. STACY a motherly looking Black woman in her 50's opens the door. 
MRS. STACY Good morning Tatiana! 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                           9. 6      CONTINUED:                                                6 
TATIANA Good morning Mrs. Stacy. 
Tatiana heads into the house. 
Oscar smiles at Mrs. Stacey, and she nods back. He watches Tatiana run off into house.

8     INT. SOPHINA'S CAR- WALMART PARKING LOT- DAY                 8 
Oscar and Sophina look on at the WAL MART Entrance. 
OSCAR See? Told you we'd make it. The light aint even on yet. 
She looks at the dashboard where there is a PICTURE of Oscar holding Tatiana tucked in the glass. The fuel gage sits almost under E, but the light still isn't on. 
She stares at the store entrance. 
SOPHINA You gonna go home and sleep, right? 
OSCAR Naw, Imma go up to the job. Get some stuff for tonight. 
SOPHINA Ugh. I'd rather die than come here on my day off. (beat) What time we supposed to be at your grandma's? 
OSCAR Prolly like seven. 
SOPHINA We gonna go to Frisco again? Catch the fireworks? 
Oscar nods. Sophina smiles at the idea of Frisco, for a beat. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) Let me get in here. 
(CONTINUED) Pink (6/25/2012)                                             10. 8       CONTINUED:                                                   8 
She quickly sits up. Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead. 
Sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car. 
OSCAR Grandma... 
GRANDMA BONNIE Oscar? What's going on Baby? 
OSCAR I'm at my job, and this girl here- 
GRANDMA BONNIE You say you're at work? 
OSCAR Well, yeah.... 
GRANDMA BONNIE Boy you know better than to be talking on the phone while you're at work! Bye! 
OSCAR Grandma, Grandma, I'm off today. I'm just shopping for the party. 
GRANDMA BONNIE Oh, I thought you were up there playing on the phone. 
OSCAR Naw grandma. But I got this girl here, she wants to fry fish for her boyfriend, but she don't know how. You think you could tell her what she needs to know and everything? 
(CONTINUED) Pink (6/25/2012)                                          19. 13      CONTINUED:                                               13 
GRANDMA BONNIE Oh no problem, baby. What kind of fish does she want to fry? 
OSCAR (to Katie) What type of F--, wait.. (into phone) She don't know. 
GRANDMA BONNIE What you mean she don't know? Put her on the phone. 
OSCAR (into phone) Hold on. 
Oscar holds out the phone for Katie. She reaches out apprehensively. He gives her a reassuring look. She takes it. 
KATIE (whispering) What's her name? 
OSCAR (whispering back) Grandma Bonnie. 
(CONTINUED) Goldenrod (7/19/2012)                                     20. 13      CONTINUED:                                               13 
KATIE (into phone) Hello, Grandma Bonnie, it's Katie, Nice to meet you. 
Katie smiles and blocks her other ear to hear better. 
CATO (O.S.) Pssst! 
Oscar snaps his head to Cato, who motions for Oscar to look down the aisle. 
Oscar looks over and sees, EMI, a thirtysomething Hispanic man wearing a white collared shirt and a name tag. He checks the shelves with a barcode scanning device. 
Oscar slowly heads over. 
OSCAR Good morning, Emi. 
EMI Oscar, what's going on?? 
OSCAR Had to grab some stuff for my Mom's birthday. 
EMI I hope you found everything that you need. 
Emi turns and starts for the next aisle. 
OSCAR Emi, hold up man, I wanted to talk to you. 
EMI It's a little nuts right now, holiday and all. But what's up? 
Long beat. 
(CONTINUED) Pink (6/25/2012)                                          21. 13      CONTINUED:                                               13 
OSCAR I just want... (beat) I need my job back. I need my job back. 
EMI Position's been filled. Take care man. 
Emi turns to head down the aisle, Oscar reaches out and grabs Emi by his sleeve. Emi stops and turns around. 
OSCAR Look, I was going through some shit, trying to get back on my feet. But I need this job man. I'll show up early every day. You can start me back off with one shift a week or whatever. I'm here. You can work me 40 hours a week and pay me for 20. I'm here. 
EMI Oscar, dude. I hired somebody else. For me to hire you back, that means I have to let someone else go. Someone with no felonies. Who's never showed up late once. I like you man, but I can't do that. I'm sorry. If something else opens up, maybe I'll let you know. Take care of yourself. 
Emi walks away. Oscar watches him. 
CHANTAY No it's not. Double time and a half. 
OSCAR C'mon Chantay. 
CHANTAY Hey, gotta do it. Moms understands. But I need you to get her a card and sign it for me. 
OSCAR Aight. 
CHANTAY And Osc, don't get me a fake ass card with white people on it. I want a black card. And not one of those joke cards either. 
OSCAR Aight. I got you. 
CHANTAY Thank you Oscar, love you. 
OSCAR Love you too, scrub. 
CHANTAY Bye. 
Oscar closes his phone. Thinks to himself for a beat. He opens his phone back up and punches some numbers. Calling Marcus flashes across the screen. 
INTERCUT WITH 
16     INT. BARBER SHOP- DAY                                       16 
MARCUS, a tough looking Asian- American man about Oscar's age sits in a barber's chair, A Black BARBER cuts his hair. His phone vibrates in his pocket, and the Barber steps back to let him answer it. He pulls out an iPhone and talks into it. 
MARCUS Wussup wit it, Osc? 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                  25B. 16      CONTINUED:                                        16

OSCAR Shit bruh I can come to you. 
MARCUS Okay... Meet me over there by the water bruh. Right off of 80. I'll be over there in like a hour. 
OSCAR Aight, bet. 
MARCUS Bet. 
Oscar hangs up his phone. Green (7/5/2012)                                           26. 
17     INT. OSCAR'S BEDROOM                                       17 
Oscar quickly walks over to his closet and grabs the bag of weed. He neatens up the room a bit, and takes off. 
18     INT. HALLMARK STORE- DAY                                   18 
The store is small and brightly lit. Oscar is reading a card from off the BIRTHDAY FOR MOTHER rack. 
We see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking on the beach holding her son's hand. Inscribed over it are the words to the religious poem "Footsteps" by Anonymous. 
Oscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before. Oscar opens the card, and looks inside for a beat. He looks up, moved by the words. He stares off into space. 
19     INT. VISITING ROOM- SAN QUENTIN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY-     19 TEN MONTHS EARLIER 
We look through a foggy window at Wanda sitting at one of several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around them. There are a few VISITORS already sitting at tables with inmates. Several Corrections Officers stand by. 
We see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking through the glass window of the search room. A Corrections Officer is conducting a search. Oscar's face is bruised under his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the left side of his face. He turns around, bends over and coughs. He turns back around, and the officer hands him his Blue shirt and pants. Oscar puts them on and- 
BUZZ. The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room to Wanda's table. As he approaches she stands up. 
OSCAR Hey Ma. 
Oscar gives her a hug, leaning across the table.

OSCAR You look nice. 
Wanda shakes her head. 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                         30. 19      CONTINUED:                                              19 
Woman passes the child to Cale over the table. 
Oscar looks on with malice. 
WANDA Oscar, Calm down. 
Wanda's voice snaps the anger off of his face. 
He looks back to Wanda, and his anger subsides. 
WANDA (CONT'D) What happened to your face? 
OSCAR Dark butter huh? She always listening. 
Wanda stares at Oscar. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) She too smart for her own good man. The preschool said we should think about starting her in school early. Phina tell you that? 
Wanda doesn't respond. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Yeah, we're gonna put her in private school. I was lookin at St. Bede the other day. It's this other school that starts them off learning Spanish, then it gradually gets them back going on English. It's like a new thing- 
WANDA I'm not coming to see you anymore. 
Oscar stops in his tracks. 
OSCAR What you mean? 
WANDA I'm not coming here, to these visits anymore. This is the last time.

OSCAR I know I know I know. This is my last time too. I told you that. I ain't goin down no more. 
WANDA You want to keep putting Sophina through this... go ahead. But Tatiana doesn't deserve this. She didn't have a choice. 
Oscar takes this in. 
OSCAR She too young to know what's going on right now. 
WANDA I guess that's why she asked me why you love taking your vacations more than being with her. 
Oscar cut his eyes from Wanda. 
OSCAR She aint say that. 
WANDA So I'm the liar now. 
Oscar takes a beat to think about this. 
OSCAR Tell her that I love her more than anything in the world. And that I- 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                          32. 19      CONTINUED:                                               19 
WANDA Tell her yourself. Next time you call. Tell your daughter how much you love her over the phone. Or better yet, just let her come visit you? 
OSCAR I don't want her to see me like this. 
WANDA Like what? 
OSCAR In a box. 
WANDA But this is how you are right now. 
OSCAR I don't want her to be exposed to this. 
WANDA You've already exposed her to it! 
Wanda leans back in her chair- she's done. 
OSCAR So you really not gonna visit me no more? I got four more months!! 
Oscar leans in. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) (whispering) Ma, this shit aint like Rita. It's crazy in here. I don't know if I can make it without you seeing you that long. 
CLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog, places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes off running towards the street. 
OSCAR Shit! No, No, No Stop! 
SCHREECH... BAM! We hear it before we see it. A sickening sound. An animal YELPS, a car SPEEDS OFF. Oscar runs into the street chasing a car going too fast for us to see. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) (at the car) Hey! Stop you bitch ass Muthafucka!! 
He stops, turns around, and runs over to something lying in the street. It's the dog, and he's in bad shape. Oscar picks the dog up out of the street, and places him on the sidewalk. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) (whispering) Come'on boy. Come on. 
The dog's breathing grows more struggled. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) (to himself) Shit. (shouting) Somebody help! Somebody fucking Help! 
(CONTINUED) Pink (6/25/2012)                                          37. 22      CONTINUED:                                               22 
Oscar continues to pet his head. The dog starts to violently shake... 
He becomes unnaturally still. 
Oscar stares at the Dog for a long beat, shaken up by this. He looks around, no one seems to have noticed. 
He bends down, closes the Dog's eyes, and heads for his car. 
23     EXT. POINT EMERY- PARKING LOT- DAY                        23 
It is an empty parking lot next to a beautiful view of the Bay. Oscar's car pulls up. After a short beat. A Lexus pulls up along side of it. Marcus hops out of the Lexus and walks over to Oscar's car. 
24     INT. SOPHINA'S CAR                                        24 
Oscar leans over and opens the passenger side door for Marcus to get in. 
MARCUS Shit bruh I didn't think we was ever gonna link up. You been good? 
Oscar stares out of the window. 
OSCAR I got good news and bad news my nigg. 
MARCUS Awww naw, Osc bruh, don't tell me you aint got it. 
OSCAR Sold it to a white boy bruh. 
MARCUS Awww Osc. For how much? 
OSCAR Gave me a rack for it. 
Marcus makes a face. 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                          38. 24      CONTINUED:                                               24 
MARCUS No way I was goin that high. Shit bruh. I needed that though... What's the good news? 
Oscar turns to Marcus hands him a brown pre- rolled joint. 
OSCAR For your troubles. 
MARCUS Right on Osc bruh. 
He pulls out a wad of money. 
OSCAR It's good bruh. Take it. 
MARCUS You sure? 
Oscar nods. 
MARCUS (CONT'D) Right on bruh. 
Marcus pulls out a lighter. 
MARCUS (CONT'D) Burn one with ya boy right quick. 
Marcus lights up the joint, takes a hit, holds it out for Oscar, but Oscar just stares out of the Window. 
OSCAR I'm good, that's all you bruh. 
TATIANA Bisabuella! 
MARIANA Hola Tatiana! 
Tatiana runs to Mariana and gives her a hug. 
Oscar gives her a kiss on the cheek. Sophina gives her a hug. The three take a seat at the kitchen table. 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                          41. 30      CONTINUED:                                               30 
Mariana continues to cook. 
SOPHINA Grandma, can you watch T tonight? We gonna go to Frisco. 
Mariana shakes her head. 
MARIANA Ask your sister. 
SOPHINA But Rose got hella kids to watch. 
MARIANA But what's the difference between watching six kids, and watching seven? 
Sophina think about this. 
MARIANA (CONT'D) (to Tatiana) Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos? 
Tatiana nods. Sophina sighs, pulls out her cell phone, and heads out of the kitchen. Mariana turns to Oscar. 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                          41A. 30      CONTINUED:                                                30 
MARIANA (CONT'D) (to Oscar) How's work? 
OSCAR You know... it's work. 
MARIANA Hmm. 
Oscar thinks on this, exits the kitchen in the direction of Sophina. Only Tatiana is left at the table. Mariana smiles. At her. She puts some pollo on a fork, and takes it over to her. 
31     INT. SOPHINA'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER            31 
As Oscar enters, we see Sophina is in her bra and panties, talking into her cellphone. She lays several different outfits out on the bed. Oscar closes the bedroom door, leans on it. 
SOPHINA (into phone) Alright... We'll be through there at like 10.. 
She hangs up her phone, and tosses it on the bed. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) Rose gonna watch T. 
She looks through the clothes on her bed and lifts up a checkered hoodie, puts it to her chest. Looks at herself in a full body mirror, sighs at her reflection. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) What you think? 
OSCAR (disinterested) It's cool. 
(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                          42. 31      CONTINUED:                                               31 
Sophina turns around and looks at Oscar, senses something is eating at him. She puts the hoodie down, and walks over to him. 
SOPHINA You okay? You been hella weird today. 
OSCAR Naw, I'm smooth. Just a little tired. 
Sophina's not buying it. 
SOPHINA Osc. Wussup? 
Oscar looks at her for a beat. Cuts his eyes. 
OSCAR (to himself) Fuck it. (to Sophina) I lost my job. 
Sophina looks at him like he's speaking another language... for a long beat. 
SOPHINA What the fuck you mean? Did they lay you off? 
Oscar doesn't say anything. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) They doing cutbacks or some shit? 
OSCAR Naw. We gonna keep it low key. Probably just catch the fireworks, and then roll around after that. 
WANDA Roll around?

SAMMY I'm all closed up, besides, I don't even have a rest room for customers.

Sammy shuts the gate and pulls out the key. 
Oscar sees this. He turns to Sophina and Vanessa who look as if they are both about to explode. 
Oscar nods at this. Pete looks at Oscar's hand for a ring, doesn't see one. 
PETE (CONT'D) You thinking about it? 
Oscar nods. 
PETER What's stopping you? 
OSCAR Money. 
PETER Shitty reason. When we got married, we had nothing. Lived in the back of her parent's house for the first two years. 
OSCAR For real? 
PETER Shit you not man. I wasn't working at all and she's a teacher, which might as well be the same thing as far as money goes. 
OSCAR How'd you get the ring? 
Peter looks around for a beat. 
PETER I stole it. 
Oscar looks at him like he is crazy.

PETER (CONT'D) Yeah man, I told you, I had nothing. I used to be good with credit cards if you know what I mean. I wouldn't go that route if I were you though man. 
OSCAR Yeah, I'm straight off that. 
PETER Yeah. I ended up getting locked up for a bit. My wife had to sell the ring to bail me out. Got my business going about a year after I got out, and got her the one she wears now. 
OSCAR What you do? 
PETER I own a web design company. We do a lot of business with companies in the valley. 
Peter pulls out his wallet and hands Oscar a card. Oscar looks at it. 
OSCAR Peter? (beat) Oscar. 
They shake hands. 
PETER Hit me up if you ever need anything man. But about that ring bro, it doesn't matter. If she loves you, any ring'll do. 
OSCAR What about the wedding though? 
PETER Shit man. Find whoever's got the nicest backyard. Tell all your boys over there to each bring a dish.

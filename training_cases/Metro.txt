SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
CLOSEUP OF SCOTT ROPER 
He's listening to the stretch call of a horse race, and he's into it. 
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) ...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing... 
ROPER Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl... 
The CAMERA GRADUALLY pulls back to reveal that Roper is driving his Trans Am across the Bay Bridge. HELICOPTER SHOTS give a soaring view of the San Francisco skyline. 
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) At the eighth pole it's Cozy Girl by half a length... Backtrack closing... 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Roper's police radio SQUAWKS. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) One-one-four to Roper. 
He picks up the radio. 
ROPER Dig in, Cozy Girl... (into the radio) Roper go. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) One-four, Roper. Code 2.C.P. 4th and Grand. 
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack... 
ROPER I'm en route. E.T.A. in five. 
He tosses the radio down. Punches the accelerator. 
ROPER Stay up there, Girl... 
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head... 
EXT. TRANS AM - DAY 
Weaving through traffic on the bridge. 
ROPER (V.O.) Where's the damn wire?! 
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second. 
ROPER (V.O.) SHIT! 
The Trans Am streak off toward the city. 
EXT. BANK - DOWNTOWN - DAY 
A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars, ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out, weaves through the spectators and past the barriers. 
A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him. 
KIMURA Hi, Roper. 
ROPER Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post? 
Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him... 
KIMURA The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for... 
ROPER ...a car. 
KIMURA That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't... 
ROPER ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... 
KIMURA That's right. 
ROPER What's the suspect's name? 
KIMURA Earl. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper saunters in. 
ROPER Hello, guys. 
BAFFERT Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us. 
Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing. 
ROPER Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl? 
Baffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it. 
BAFFERT This guy is no genius. 
Roper scans the profile. 
ROPER They're not usually graduate students. 
BAFFERT SWAT wants to go in. 
ROPER What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week? 
Roper refers to the folder. 
Baffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his pocket. 
BAFFERT Floor seats. 
ROPER You're my hero. 
BAFFERT Dinner's on you. 
ROPER Deal. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING 
A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. He goes into the Captain's office. 
INT. CAPTAIN SOLIS' OFFICE - RAINING 
CAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down. 
SOLIS He just walked into my office. (looks over at Roper) The Chief says, "Good work this morning. Congratulations." 
Roper smiles as he sits down. 
ROPER Tell him to give me a raise. 
SOLIS (into the phone) He says, "Thank you very much." (a beat) I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief. 
Solis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause. He knows he's got leverage. 
SOLIS Roper. 
ROPER What? 
SOLIS Are you going to make this hard for me? 
ROPER Depends. What's up? 
SOLIS There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up. 
ROPER Define concern. 
Solis dumps his cards on the table. 
SOLIS What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it? 
ROPER Your concern is heartwarming. 
SOLIS It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you. 
ROPER Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside? 
SOLIS His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed. 
Roper grabs McCall's folder off the desk. 
ROPER Let me see that. 
Roper scans it. 
ROPER Tested high on his intellectual aptitude... Not as high as me but... National marksman finalist... Attended N. Y. C... Went to college. Very impressive. F.B.I. sniper school... Mayorial commendation. 
INT. HALLWAY - SAME - RAINING 
McCall turns around in his chair. He can see Roper and Solis through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear their voices. 
INT. SOLIS' OFFICE - SAME - RAINING 
ROPER "Additional Skills": Biathelete, marathoner, lip-reading, speaks Spanish... 
Roper throws the folder back on the desk. 
ROPER Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks. 
SOLIS You let us worry about that. 
ROPER Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation? 
SOLIS (gloomily) What kind of appreciation are we talking about? 
ROPER The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress... 
SOLIS What do you think would be in order? 
ROPER Like ahh... I don't know... (boldly) Five thousand dollars. 
SOLIS (calmly) Okay, I think I could swing that. 
Uh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short. 
ROPER (quickly) And a car. 
SOLIS Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own. 
ROPER You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound. 
SOLIS Impound isn't a rent-a-car company. 
ROPER (firmly) The car is part of the deal. 
SOLIS What happened to your Trans Am? 
Solis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come in. 
ROPER Repoed this morning. 
SOLIS (relenting) I'll provide you with transportation. 
ROPER And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background... 
BAFFERT Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things. 
Roper bends over like an old man. 
ROPER Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up. 
They arrive at their destination. A parking space with a 1957 DODGE PICKUP. 
BAFFERT This is it. Space 742. 
Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief. 
ROPER Then he didn't say 742. He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right. 
Baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who is crossing to the truck. 
ROPER Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not riding in this shit. I can't roll in no shit like this. 
He takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the passengers side. He opens the door. 
BAFFERT Where's the stereo? 
ROPER Fuck the stereo. What's that smell? 
BAFFERT Come on. Just get in. We gotta go. 
EXT. MARKET STREET - NIGHT 
The pickup in traffic. 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
EXT. KORDA'S BUILDING - NIGHT 
It's a four story twenties style walk-up. It's evening now. The pickup pulls to a stop out front. 
INT. PICKUP - NIGHT 
Baffert pulls out a slip of paper. 
BAFFERT Apartment 306. 
ROPER You want me to go up with you? 
BAFFERT Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him. 
ROPER Good. I don't want to be late. 
Baffert gets out. Roper grabs his cell phone. 
ROPER You want anything on the game? 
Baffert turns back around. 
BAFFERT What's the line? 
ROPER It was Warriors plus 6 this morning. 
BAFFERT I'll take half of your action. 
Baffert goes into the building. Roper dials his cellular phone. Beep! Beep! 
DETAIL SHOT 
A message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY. 
Roper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He gets out of the truck and crosses to it. 
INT. BUILDING - NIGHT 
Third floor hallway. Nice, middle class place. Well kept up. Baffert walks over to room 306. Knocks. 
INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT 
Jazz is playing. MICHAEL KORDA sits motionless in a chair listening to the music. There's a KNOCK. Korda responds as if pulled from a trance. He rises and moves to the door. 
KORDA Who is it? 
BAFFERT (V.O.) It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department. 
A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door. 
KORDA What happened? Is there a problem? 
BAFFERT May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions. 
Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the music. A smile grows on his face. 
BAFFERT Count Basie? 
Korda smiles back. Another jazz aficionada. 
KORDA Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 
BAFFERT Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it. 
Korda goes to the stereo, turns it down. Duke Ellington plays low. 
BAFFERT Where did you find an old recording like that? 
KORDA Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson. (searching for the name) Memories... Memory Lane or something... 
BAFFERT I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci? 
KORDA You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street? 
Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay. 
KORDA God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now. 
CLARENCE I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town. 
KORDA Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!... (a beat) They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want. 
Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add up in his head. 
CLARENCE Did you kill him, Mike? 
Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper again. 
CLARENCE I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry... 
We're talking major fear here... 
Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against his chest. 
KORDA It's not your fault you're stupid. 
Tears of relief from Clarence. 
INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling. 
A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in Hostage Situations". On the desk in front of him is the bottle with the pen cap still in it. 
ROPER (to Kimura and Glass) What do you got on Korda? 
KIMURA We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out. 
ROPER (rapid fire) Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration? 
KIMURA Being faxed over now. 
ROPER How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits. 
KIMURA Roper... 
ROPER And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents. 
KIMURA Roper, we're into it... 
Suddenly Solis appears at their side. 
SOLIS We've had this conversation once, Roper. You're not active on this case. 
Roper looks at him icily. 
SOLIS It's in everyone's best interest. 
McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely. After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis heads back to this office. 
ROPER (softened) You guys are doing good work. 
He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him coming. 
MCCALL I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be. 
ROPER I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that. 
McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda bottle. 
ROPER I don't see much progress here. 
McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water. He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle. 
CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE 
The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without touching or moving the bottle. 
ROPER Very nice... You get an "A". Notice... No force required. No damage. 
Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom. 
SERGEANT Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 6th Street. Possible hostage situation. 
McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk, then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the trash can. He and McCall head out. 
EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY 
The pickup is weaving through traffic. 
INT. PICKUP - DAY 
Start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging from the rear view mirror. PULL BACK to show a police bubble flashing on the dashboard. 
Roper weaving through traffic. McCall is sitting calmly as ever. 
ROPER So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco? 
MCCALL They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement. 
ROPER Recruited you from where? 
MCCALL National Marksman Competition. 
ROPER With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here? 
MCCALL Furthest point I could find from New York. 
ROPER You don't like New York? 
MCCALL Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while. 
holds it up so Raymond can see it. 
ROPER Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why? 
RAYMOND I ain't interested in your life story. 
ROPER Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. 
RAYMOND She's the one to blame. Not me. 
EXT. ROOF ACROSS THE STREET - ON MCCALL 
In prone position. Rifle in hand. Eye to scope. 
POV THROUGH SIGHT 
of Raymond's open window. 
INT. RAYMOND'S APARTMENT 
Everyone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter sincerity. 
ROPER Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything. 
RAYMOND What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed. 
And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not that coherent. 
RAYMOND I'm down at Consolidated and I'm begging. I'm saying I'll take half my pay. Eight years, man. I don't even have to work the loading docks anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're cutting back. We're streamlining, Ray. West Central's running things now. It's out of our hands" Fuck them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM! (deep sigh) I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna live anymore. 
Roper reaches out to him. 
ROPER Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job. 
RAYMOND Doing what? Cleaning toilets? 
ROPER I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work. 
RAYMOND And why the fuck would you do that for me? 
ROPER Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count. 
RAYMOND Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa? 
ROPER My name's Scott Roper. 
Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... Then... 
RAYMOND I need my coat. 
It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns and goes to get his coat. 
He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. The wife runs out of the room, screaming! 
ROPER NOOOO!! 
He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds down the stairs... down another flight... 
EXT. APT. BLDG. 
McCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his path. 
ROPER WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? 
McCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues into the building. 
INT. APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
Roper follows, screaming his head off. 
ROPER Do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle, it makes you God! What the fuck goes on in your head? 
McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow "crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under the tape. Roper follows. 
INT. APT. - DAY 
McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms. Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special" variety. McCall looks up at Roper. 
MCCALL SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? I just saved a life. Yours. 
Roper doesn't miss a beat. 
ROPER (still angry) You think I've never had a gun pulled on me?! You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it?! 
McCall gets to his feet. 
MCCALL Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide. 
ROPER (fiercely) Not the ones I'm at. 
McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat. McCall's face softens just perceptibly. 
MCCALL Sorry. My mistake. 
He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses the sheet over Ray's dead body. 
INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT 
Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked "Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the floor. Waiting. 
The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on the back. 
INVESTIGATOR Looks like a clean shoot. Go home and get some rest. 
McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled off considerably. Even a tad friendly. 
ROPER Come on. Let's go for a drink. 
ROPER First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, (addressing the mannequin) "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you." (turns back to McCall) Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that? 
MCCALL No. 
ROPER It'll come. Try again. 
INT. TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
ANGLE ON THE DOOR. McCall comes in. The room has the same set-up. McCall takes a look around. Launches immediately into... 
MCCALL My name's McCall. I'm a hostage negotiator. I'm here to help you. 
Roper's voice crackles back at him hostilely. 
ROPER (V.O.) How are you going to help me? 
McCall's confidence is growing. 
MCCALL Tell me what you need. 
ROPER (V.O.) I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts. 
Now he's stumped. 
MCCALL (hesitantly) I can't do that. 
ROPER (V.O.) Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit. 
McCall looks up to his right. 
MCCALL Is all the name calling necessary. 
Roper re-enters the training area. 
ROPER Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it. 
MCCALL (exasperated) So what do I say to this guy? 
ROPER You could say something like, (addressing the dummy) "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out." 
MCCALL What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off? 
Roper turns to McCall. 
ROPER If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie. 
MCCALL I'm not good at lying. 
ROPER Get good at it. 
MCCALL It's against my nature. 
Roper gives him an amused smile. 
ROPER You know the ten commandments? 
MCCALL Yes. 
ROPER What's the first commandment? 
MCCALL Thou shall have no other God before me. 
That's not the answer Roper wanted. 
ROPER Okay, forget that. What's the main one. 
McCall is tired of guessing. 
MCCALL You tell me. 
ROPER Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right? 
MCCALL Yes. 
ROPER Why? 
MCCALL To save lives. 
ROPER So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives? 
McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back to the side door. 
ROPER Let's try it again. 
INT. TRAINING ROOM - LATER 
McCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the floor. 
MCCALL My name's McCall. I'm unarmed. 
ROPER (V.O.) Okay, stop. 
Roper comes through the side door. 
ROPER Close your eyes. 
McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper turns him away from the hostage scene. 
ROPER What did you see? 
MCCALL (rapid-fire) A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine. 
McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed. 
ROPER Very good. You've got good eyes. That's important. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
McCall sits like a wax figure. 
MCCALL (cynically) The 6 horse is still last. 
ROPER He'll be running at the quarter pole. 
ON THE TRACK 
The horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses with every stride. 
ROPER (V.O.) There he goes. 
IN THE STANDS 
McCall sits forward slightly. 
MCCALL They need to run first and second? 
ROPER Yeah, first and second. 
Roper gets to his feet. 
ON THE TRACK 
The horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in front and the SIX is coming on from behind. 
IN THE STANDS 
Roper is on his feet screaming. 
ROPER Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell. 
McCall jumps to this feet and joins him. 
MCCALL COME ON RUSSELL!... (to Roper) Who the fuck's Russell?! 
ROPER The jockey! 
MCCALL COME ON, RUSSELL! 
Roper and McCall cheer together. 
ON THE TRACK 
The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second... He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the wire and... It's too close to call. 
IN THE STANDS 
McCall, really excited, turns to Roper. 
MCCALL We won! 
ROPER (disheartened) We lost. 
MCCALL (confidently) We won. 
ROPER How much you wanna bet? 
MCCALL You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick. 
ANGLE ON TOTE BOARD 
As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on... 4-6-8. They won. 
IN THE STANDS 
ROPER Yes! 
High fives. 
ROPER That's eight hundred bucks. 
INT. BET/CASH WINDOW - DAY 
Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece, not bad. McCall pockets his money. 
MCCALL How long you been coming here? 
ROPER About six years. My partner took me. 
MCCALL Is it always like this? 
ROPER Occasionally you lose. 
Suddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a cellular phone and dials. 
ROPER (into the phone) Roper here. (he listens) I'm on my way. 
He hangs up and turns to McCall. 
ROPER We gotta go. 
EXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY 
Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door. Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation in full swing. 
INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY 
It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's talking to the suspect. 
SOLIS We're working on that, Joe. These things aren't quite that simple. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding. 
MCCALL This does not look good. 
KORDA In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece. I assume there are no "misunderstanding". 
Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him. 
ROPER I understand you completely. 
Korda disappears back behind the door. 
EXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY 
Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis, McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for his report. 
ROPER (flatly) We're going to have to take this guy out. 
That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely says. 
SOLIS Can't we wear him down? 
Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis eyes it with dismay. 
ROPER I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques. (a beat) So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out? 
McCall calmly offers his opinion. 
MCCALL Let him come out. Too many unknowns in there. 
Solis nods. That'll be the plan. 
MCCALL When we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb. (to SWAT Captain) Put our best man "highground", Twenty degree down angle. 
The SWAT Captain motions and turns to one of his UNDERLINGS. 
SWAT CAPTAIN Have Anderson prep it and notify us when he's on line. 
The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at Roper dejectedly. 
SOLIS I feel this thing going sideways on us. 
Roper tries to buck him up. 
ROPER There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages... (big pause) Yet. 
INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda. His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The guard and one of the jewelers. 
Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies. 
KORDA Drag them behind the counter. 
The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality. Her eyes are a bit far away. 
Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction. 
WOMAN CUSTOMER I'm not staying here another minute. 
SALESGIRL #1 (panicky) No, Mrs. Dotson. 
Korda rushes around the display case. 
KORDA Come here, hag. 
He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a step toward Korda. 
MANAGER Leave her alone! 
Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager. 
KORDA You're a brave one, aren't you? 
The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks about making a run at him. 
SALESGIRL #2 (pleading) Sit down, Doug. 
A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old woman. Korda looks down at her. 
KORDA If she's not conscious when it's time to leave, I'll have to kill her. 
Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of the gems. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Cops clear spectators out of the way as a green FORD EXPLORER RUMBLES through the barricade and heads down the deserted street. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY 
Roper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store. The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store. Parks at a slight angle. The uniformed police officer gets out, leaving the engine running, and walks off back to the barricade. 
ROPER Okay. Time to give this fucker a call. 
Roper picks up the phone, waits. Everybody tensely watching the store.

Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. BUILDING - SAME 
A sniper team watching the store from a third floor window. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME 
Roper holding the phone. It's still ringing. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - DIFFERENT BUILDING - SAME 
Another sharpshooting team. Poised. Waiting. 
The Explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested traffic of a side street. HONK-SCREECH! A Toyota swerves to miss it and broadsides a parked car. The Explorer fishtails off down the street. 
INT. VAN - DAY 
The salesgirl is terrified. Korda checks the rear view mirror. No one on his tail... At first. Then the Cadillac comes speeding up behind... 
INT. CADILLAC - DAY 
Roper and McCall have the Van in sight, about a block ahead. Roper picks up the radio. 
MCCALL Suspect heading west on Sutter now passing Jones. Can we get an intercept? 
A voice comes back. 
VOICE (V.O.) R-32-David. We are proceeding south on Hyde. Will intercept. 
INT. VAN - DAY 
Korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view mirror. The Cadillac is making up ground. 
UP AHEAD 
a squad car SCREECHES into the intersection and smokes to a stop. Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a SCREAMING right turn and heads up the hill. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van... Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit. 
THE VAN 
hits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back down to the pavement. 
INT. VAN - DAY 
Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the windshield as they head straight downhill. The salesgirl is beyond petrified. 
THE CADILLAC 
reaches the top of the hill. Going fast. 
INT. CADILLAC 
As it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against the pavement. McCall sees the van ahead. Hammers the accelerator. No fear. 
VAN 
Korda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a hard left. 
THE VAN 
cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk... shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through the air... The van speeds off down a one-way street... 
THE CADILLAC 
arrives at the intersection a few seconds later... Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through the corner. 
THE VAN 
Wrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in every angle. Frantic HONKING. Salesgirl SHRIEKS. Tires SMOKING... No way to avoid collision... Except Korda pulls a left an instant before impact... The van speeds back up the hill. 
THE CADILIAC 
Down the same one way street... Comes up on the head-on traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near collision with Korda... 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
The Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill. 
INT. VAN 
Korda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short distance behind. Attention still focused behind, Korda enters an intersection, running a red light... CROSS-TRAFFIC... Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel 
THE STREET 
The van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal... SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car... 
BRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a dizzying roll... 
THE VAN 
...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend. He heads toward it... 
INT. CABLE CAR 
As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the passengers view him uneasily. 
THE CADILLAC 
hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to see Korda leap onto the moving cable car. 
CABLE CAR 
other passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back... 
Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is making up ground on the cable car. 
Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a couple of shots at the Caddy. 
INT. CADILLAC 
A bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves. 
BACK ON THE CABLE CAR 
That makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap off the cable car. 
Pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks through... 
THE CABLE CAR 
Roper hammers Korda into unconsciousness. Outside McCall is honking and yelling like crazy. Roper looks over... McCall points ahead... 
ROPER'S POV 
The cable car. 
ROPER 
Leaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it. 
ANGLE UNDER THE CABLE CAR 
The clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes... Then disintegrates before our eyes. 
THE CABLE CAR 
Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy... 
INT. CADDY 
He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car... McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the steering wheel hard right... 
EXT. STREET 
The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac... But it's working. The cable car is slowing. 
BOTTOM OF STREET 
The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on them. General hysteria as they flee. 
THE CABLE CAR 
Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs the satchel and bails out of the cable car... 
STREET 
...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs into an underground garage. 
THE CABLE CAR 
Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in astonishment. 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position. He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the garage... Footsteps maybe. 
Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun... 
INT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE 
Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans beneath the cars... No sign of Korda. 
Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward the window. 
A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth... Roper moves on. 
NEW ANGLE 
As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution. 
Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat. 
ROPER Sorry, go. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives off. 
INT. GARAGE 
Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might have escaped. 
He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield. 
The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it. 
GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL 
As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and piles into a parked car. 
Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck. 
Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his gun right up between Korda's eyes. 
ROPER Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here. 
Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't kill him in cold blood... 
What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about those rules at this moment. 
ROPER You know Sam Baffert was a friend of mine. He had a wife... and he had a daughter. 
Korda stares past the barrel of the gun. 
KORDA I don't give a shit about you or your fucking friends. 
And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night. 
He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing this guy. 
KORDA You can't kill me like this. 
ROPER What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off? 
INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The lovemaking is over. Roper is gazing at the ceiling, thinking. Ronnie is cuddled around him. A comfortable moment... 
ROPER What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him? 
RONNIE It's okay. We broke up. 
ROPER (surprised) When? 
RONNIE Just now. 
INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY 
Clarence Teal, Korda's cousin sits in front of the plexiglass wall. He's edgy, fidgety. Clarence doesn't like to make visits to jail. 
Korda, wearing prison clothes, is led in by a guard. Korda takes a seat at the other side of the plexiglass wall and picks up the receiver. Clarence picks up his receiver. 
CLARENCE How ya doin', man? 
Korda grips the phone, leans forward and stares through the wall. 
KORDA You gotta do something for me... this fucker, Roper, he's gotta girlfriend. She works at the newspaper. I want you to take care of her. 
Clarence is totally unnerved by this request. 
CLARENCE Hey, Michael, that's not my thing. 
Korda glares at him murderously. 
KORDA You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you. 
CLARENCE Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job. 
KORDA (exploding) Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!... 
Korda starts to draw the attention of the guard. He controls himself, lowers his voice. But the viciousness is still there. 
KORDA He held a gun to my head and said he should kill me right then... He made me... 
He doesn't finish that thought. 
KORDA You do this for me Clarence. 
Clarence is getting very upset. 
CLARENCE Don't make do it, Mike. 
KORDA Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail? 
CLARENCE I won't get away with it. 
KORDA Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery. 
Clarence holds back tears, because he knows he's going to have to do this.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT 
Roper on his cell phone. Paco is on the seat beside him. 
ROPER Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner for some wine. 
Roper notices the rain, searches for the windshield wiper switch. 
INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
RONNIE How's Paco doing? 
INT. PICKUP - NIGHT 
ROPER He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend. 
Paco sits there panting. Roper pulls the pickup over in front of the store. 
INT. KITCHEN - STORE 
RONNIE Okay, dinner will be ready when you get here. 
She hangs up. 
EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Through the window we watch her cross back to the stove. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Ronnie lifts the lid on the sauce. Stirs. It spatters on her blouse. She regards the stain with dismay. Puts the lid back on and leaves the kitchen. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the... 
Dave listens to his head. 
WALTER He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me back in. 
MCCALL You see, the particles are gone, they can't punish you anymore. 
Dave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes. 
DAVE Tell my dad. 
MCCALL Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him? 
DAVE Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch. 
MCCALL I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now. 
Dave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns to a frown: 
DAVE I hate fucking Springfield. 
MCCALL Is that where you're family lives? 
Then with sudden swiftness. 
DAVE I still hear them, man. You can't jam them. They've got the technology, man. They've got the satellites, Jack. They keep shooting beams off those satellites. What power do I have? 
Dave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls. 
MCCALL NOOOO! 
WALTER AND HIS WHEELCHAIR 
freefall down toward earth in SLOW MOTION. The wheelchair turns end over end. People SCREAM as Walter IMPACTS with the pavement. The wheelchair CRASHES down nearby. 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
EXT. ROOF - DAY 
McCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below. Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands behind his back. The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out to restrain. 
INT. LOBBY - DAY 
The crowd is dispersing. Roper is talking with some of the other cops. McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down the stairs. Roper moves toward him. 
ROPER McCall! 
No response. McCall gets into his ND Sedan car and fires it up. 
ROPER McCall! 
Roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car screeches away from the curb. 
BAY BRIDGE - DAY 
McCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in the car with him. He drives. Stone-faced. Roper studies him for a beat. 
ROPER Where are we going? 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Moving POV thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign that says "Golden Gate Racetrack." 
EXT. RACETRACK 
Establish grand stands.

INT. BETTING AREA - DAY 
McCall pounds over to the betting window. Roper leans up against the window beside him. Watches. 
MCCALL Give me a twenty dollar four-six exacta. 
TELLER The six is scratched. 
This throws McCall for a beat. 
MCCALL Then give me a fucking four-seven exacta. 
The teller punches out the ticket. McCall takes the ticket and pounds over to box seat area. Roper follows a couple of steps behind, giving him some space. 
EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY 
McCall sits down in the same box as the last time. Roper sits down next to him. 
EXT. TRACK - DAY 
The horses go into the gate. 
EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY 
McCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call plays over the scene.) 
MCCALL Come on four horse! Come on Seven horse! 
Roper isn't watching the horse. He's watching McCall. Watching him redirect all his pent up emotion. Understanding exactly how he feels. 
McCall is screaming his head off. 
MCCALL Come on four-seven... Come on... Come on... Come on... 
The horses cross the wire. The four and seven finish mid- pack. McCall hangs his head in despair. He didn't give a shit about the race. He looks inconsolable. 
ROPER Oh you thought I was going to ask you... 
Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed. 
ROPER Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out... 
Roper picks up his menu and peruses it. 
ROPER I assume you're having your usual -- the "air dried venison". 
INT. HALLWAY JAIL - DAY CLOSE ON 
The wheels of a laundry cart, moving slowly down the hall. A white metal door slides open, and the cart passes through. 
INT. PROPERTY ROOM JAIL - CONTINUOUS 
As the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see 
KORDA 
pushing the cart. He stops. A GUARD (guard #3) stands with his back to Korda. He's on the phone. 
KORDA Got another load. 
JAIL GUARD #3 Rack 'em up. (into the phone) Look, man, if it doesn't make it down here by five it's not my problem. 
As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags, zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing. 
KORDA All done. 
Korda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The guard, still on the phone, buzzes open the door. 
ON THE GUARDS BACK 
We hear Korda wheeling the cart out the door. 
CLOSE ANGLE 
on the door sliding shut. 
ON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE 
Hold a beat. PANNING SLOWLY around the room to FIND -- suit bag's moving on the trolley. BOOM DOWN to FIND Korda's feet just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the bags. 
ANGLE ON KORDA 
hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then down through an opening in the floor and into... 
INT. BASEMENT JAIL - CONTINUOUS 
as it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for another pair... 
CUT TO: 
INT. LONG HALLWAY JAIL - LATER 
Korda appears around a corner, dressed in street clothes, holding a CLIPBOARD -- moving steadily toward camera. 
KORDA'S POV - DOWN THE HALLWAY 
A female civilian EMPLOYEE heading in his direction. As they pass he nods and she nods back. Then Korda passes through a door at the end of the hallway and into... 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS 
The door closes behind him and locks with the loud SNAP of metal. 
Slowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor toward the door at the other end, past the first GUARD (guard #3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass. 
TRACKING - KORDA'S FEET 
step by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick glass. 
CLOSE ON KORDA'S FACE 
trying to stay cool, his heart pounding. Then... 
A VOICE (O.S.) Hey! 
Korda FREEZES, then slowly turns to FIND... A prison GUARD (#1) moving toward him. 
THE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA 
KORDA ...Yeah? 
The guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand. 
JAIL GUARD #1 You dropped your card. 
Korda takes THE CARD given to him by the bail bondsman. 
JAIL GUARD #1 You guys are the scum of the earth. 
KORDA Just tryin' to make a living. 
Korda turns and walks out the door into... 
INT. SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
It's the final step before getting out of the building. A small room with another GUARD (Latino; guard #2) behind glass, and several TV monitors. A BLACK WOMAN (forty-five) is arguing with a LATINO GUARD. 
JAIL GUARD #2 I don't know what to tell you, mam, your brother ain't here. Try San Bruno. 
WOMAN I just came from San Bruno -- they sent me here! 
Roper untenses. Puts away his gun. 
ROPER Korda escaped. 
RONNIE And you think he'll... 
Her voice trails off. He can see she's worried now, too. 
ROPER Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's relax. I'm sure he's just going to try to get out of town. Anyway we leave tomorrow. 
He puts his arms around her waist. 
ROPER Why don't we do some of that European movie stuff. 
She puts her arms around his shoulders. 
RONNIE I don't think you're old and fat enough for me. 
ROPER Use your imagination. 
EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
ANGLE looking up at her window... The light goes out. 
EXT. RONNIE'S DOORSTEP - DAY 
A suitcase THUMPS to the ground. Looks like somebody packed for a six month trip around the world. 
ANGLE WIDENS 
McCall grimaces as he lugs the bag toward the truck. 
MCCALL You sure you packed everything? Maybe you forgot your bowling ball. 
Ronnie stands on the doorstep. 
RONNIE I sent that ahead, wise guy. 
Paco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree. Roper calls to Ronnie from the stairway. 
ROPER (V.O.) Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie. 
RONNIE I think I'll stand out here in the sun. 
INT. STAIRWAY - DAY 
Roper is still very edgy. 
ROPER It's better if you stay inside. 
She climbs up the stairs toward him. 
RONNIE You've got to calm down --

Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - SAME 
Roper reaches the top of the stairs. 
ROPER Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go. Time to get movin'. 
INT. RONNIE'S APT. - SAME 
Roper moves into the room, listening. There's no response. 
ROPER (continuing) Ronnie? 
She doesn't answer. He calls out again, moving through the living room. 
ROPER (continuing) Ronnie, where are you? Time to go. 
No answer, the room is very quiet. Roper eases his PISTOL out from under his shirt, moving more urgently now, checking out the bathroom, bedroom... 
ROPER (continuing) Ronnie. 
Then he HEARS Paco, WHINING. He moves around the entrance to the kitchen. The back door is open, Paco standing in the doorway. Roper rushes forward, quickly looking outside, the alley way empty. He senses a presence behind him, spinning... McCall standing in the doorway to the kitchen. 
Roper's lowers the weapon... 
ROPER (continuing) She's gone. 
McCall sees on the kitchen table, a folded piece of GLASSINE PAPER, just like the one Korda gave Roper at the jewelry store. 
MCCALL (nodding) Scott... 
Roper sees it, approaching, barely able to unfold the edges, a momentary tremble in his hand. 
ROPER That son of a bitch. If he... 
We PUSH IN as his fingers open the paper... revealing inside a MICRO CASSETTE TAPE. 
ROPER (continuing; to himself) He's fucking with you, Scott, be cool... keep your head. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON a TAPE RECORDER, Korda's VOICE heard over the speaker. 
KORDA (V.O.) (filtered) I got your lady, Roper. (laughs) 
Roper and McCall are listening closely to the tape. 
KORDA (V.O.) (continuing) You got something that belongs to me, and I want it back. (beat) Twelve-fifteen, Mare Island, North Entrance off Dixon. Building twenty- eight, by the dry docks. (beat) I so much as smell another cop, I'll be sending you parts of this bitch for a month. 
Roper punches off the tape. 
LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK 
McCall supported under the frame by a makeshift HARNESS around his waist and legs. 
KORDA (O.S.) All right, move it. 
McCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness, lowering himself to the ground. Quickly he moves the SMOKING LEATHER GLOVES he was wearing, burned by contact with the hot exhaust pipe. 
ROPER 
Reaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK, easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long. 
At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice. 
KORDA (O.S.) (continuing) Throw in and your piece. 
Roper tosses his PISTOL into the dry dock. 
KORDA (O.S.) And your back up. 
Roper removes the PISTOL from his ankle HOLSTER, tossing it. Korda's VOICE cuts the eerie silence. 
KORDA (O.S.) (continuing) Walk under the cranes and down the alleyway. At the end, turn right. Building thirty-six. 
The RADIO CLICKS OFF. 
Roper walks towards the megalith CRANES, passing under them, then heads down the alleyway created by the tall buildings. 
EXT. ROPER'S TRUCK - DAY LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK 
McCall, his RIFLE CASE on his chest, watches as Roper turns the corner and heads down the alley way. 
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK 
McCall rolls out, scrambling for the cover of the building. Slinging the case over his shoulder he finds a LADDER leading up the side of the building, beginning to climb. 
EXT. ROPER - DAY 
Walking down the alley way, nearing the end. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY 
McCall moving along the edge, looking down. He spots Roper, moving fast to keep him in sight. 
He comes to the edge of the building, having to walk across a narrow RAMP to get to the next building. 
He looks down, Roper turning the corner, McCall moves on, removing the RIFLE from its case as he goes. 
EXT. ROPER - DAY 
Leaves the alleyway, a complex of hanger-like buildings revealed. To his far right is a building, a SIGN reading: BLD 36. He clutches the satchel, heading towards it. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY 
McCall negotiating another precarious crossing between buildings. He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof tops and buildings for the sniper's position. He sees it, across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper is now walking. He heads out. 
EXT. ROPER - DAY 
Walking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the roof tops of the buildings around him. 
ROPER (to himself) Where the hell are you, McCall? 
As Roper passes a set of partially open ROLLING DOORS to the glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's VOICE from within: 
KORDA (O.S.) Right there, Roper. 
Roper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away. 
ROPER Shit. 
Roper stops, slowly turning towards the doors. 
KORDA (O.S.) Come on in, there's someone just dying to see you. 
Roper hesitates. He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching. 
ROPER (loudly) Where are you? 
EXT. HIGH VANTAGE POINT - DAY 
POV TELESCOPIC SIGHT: Focusing on Roper, his lips moving... McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the glass fronted building. 
MCCALL Right here, Scott. 
He touches the LASER SIGHTING attachment to his scope, a red beam activated... 
ROPER - DAY 
From inside the building Korda's VOICE: 
KORDA (O.S.) Get your ass in here, Roper. 
Just as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind him. Roper moves inside. 
MCCALL - DAY 
Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE, looking through the scope. 
TELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the room cast in HARD SHADOWS. 
He MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now just inside. 
MCCALL Stay cool, real easy... 
INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY 
Cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge MACHINES, LATHES and EQUIPMENT once used in the design of nuclear submarines. 
Korda reacts in mock surprise. 
KORDA Oh, shit, in all the excitement I almost forgot. She right here... 
A LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming ON, illuminating a massive FLAT BED CIRCULAR LATHE. Roper's eyes in horror go to... 
RONNIE 
Tied to the lathe bed spread eagle. Some distance from her body a CUTTING DEVICE is positioned over the lathe bed. 
Roper looks into Ronnie's terrified eyes. 
ROPER Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you out of this. 
He turns back, Korda grinning at him. 
KORDA No shit, this I gotta see... 
Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held down with TAPE. 
Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN, very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade. 
(PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie. 
Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it. 
We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at this point. 
KORDA (continuing) Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the switch. You see, you have to keep your finger on the button or the little lady gets cut... 
He releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting device. He stops it again, holding the button. 
KORDA (continuing; grins) Right in half. 
He eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control box, holding the button down. 
EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY 
Through the SCOPE, he can see Korda as he steps into view. 
The CROSSHAIRS settle on Korda's upper forehead. 
MCCALL Hold it right there... 
His finger tightens on the trigger... 
INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY 
Korda holds the control box towards Roper. 
KORDA But then, that's not my problem. 
He releases the button and the box, the lathe turning, Korda grinning at Roper... 
EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY 
The RED DOT centered on Korda's forehead... 
MCCALL (O.S.) Light's out, fucker... 
And then Roper's HEAD fills the scope, the red dot GLOWING on the back of his head. 
In shock, McCall releases his finger... 
MCCALL Jesus! 
INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY 
Roper moving to the control box, pressing the stop button, stopping the lathe... 
KORDA You see, it's out of my hands. 
Roper looks at the box, Ronnie's life literally in his hands...

Sequence omitted from original script. 
EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY 
Through the SCOPE, Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda. 
MCCALL Roper, move... 
EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY 
But Korda bends down, picking up the BAG, stepping back away from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire. 
KORDA Well, hate to run but I've got a plane to catch. You take good care of the little lady, hear? 
As Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop, we now SEE a CAR parked near the end facing us. Korda suddenly stops, turning, gesturing to the car. 
KORDA (continuing) How careless of me. You see, there's only one way out of here, and you're standing right in the way. (grins) You could move, but then... 
He shakes his head at Roper. 
KORDA (continuing) Sure hate to be in your shoes. 
He turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING, to himself. 
Roper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the .45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the button. 
EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY 
He can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else. 
MCCALL What the hell's going on? 
THE LATHE 
The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper hauls her away, holding her in his arms. 
EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV OF CAR 
Korda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a DRAIN PIPE attached to the side of the building. 
INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY 
Roper holding Ronnie, easing her away from the still turning lathe. 
RONNIE Scottie, Scottie... 
ROPER It's all over, babe, it's all over. 
EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY 
McCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but... 
KORDA'S CAR 
Korda is not quite dead... 
The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall. 
He OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as BULLETS hit the wall around him. 
McCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE ensuing. 
INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER 
HEARING the shots outside, hauls Ronnie out of the way, keeping her low to the ground. 
ROPER Stay here, don't move. 
RONNIE Scottie... 
ROPER Do it! 
He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the cavernous, machine-choked building. 
EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL 
FIRES a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car, runs from his cover into the opening... 
KORDA 
Leaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and runs alongside the machine shop. 
ROPER 
Exits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping to his side. 
ROPER McCall, you all right? 
MCCALL (in pain) I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building... 
ROPER Stay put. 
Roper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it, catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the other end. Roper charges on... 
EXT. MACHINE SHOP - REAR - DAY 
Korda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner of the next building. 
KORDA 
Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it, jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view. 
ROPER 
With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES, two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand. 
KORDA 
Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging on for dear life. 
ROPER (shouting) Give it up, Korda, you got away with nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! It's all fake! 
Korda can't help but look at the OPEN BAG beside him. 
ROPER (continuing) Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! It's all shit! A hundred dollars worth of glass! 
Korda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the COSTUME JEWELRY. He can't believe it, it's all fake! 
KORDA You fuck!!! 
Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on. 
Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to avoid the obstacles. 
Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING, PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the cab... 
ROPER 
In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH. 
KORDA 
Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS hysterically... he knocked him off! 
ROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK 
Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching the dry dock area. 
In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the 2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, pinning it to the floor.

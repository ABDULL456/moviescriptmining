The script to Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas 
NARRATOR 'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems, in a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.  For the story that you are about to be told, took place in the holiday worlds of old.  Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from.  If you haven't, I'd say it's time you begun.

MAYOR No, thanks to  you, Jack.  Without your brilliant leadership - 
JACK Not at all Mayor. 
VAMPIRE (fat) You're such a scream, Jack 
ZERO bark 
JACK All right.  [giving Zero a rib from himself]  Here ya go boy. 
[Zero gets rib and shows off his nose] 
[Back to Halloweentown] 
MAYOR Morning gents [to the band] 
[humming This Is Halloween, walks up to Jack's front door and rings bell] 
MAYOR Jack, you home? 
[getting worried, switches face and knocks with desperation then switch back to happy face] 
MAYOR Jack?  I've got the plans for next Halloween.  I need to go over them with you so we can get started. 
MAYOR (with worried face) Jack, please, I'm only an elected an official here, I can't make decisions by myself.  Jack, answer me!! 
[falls down steps] 
ACCORDION PLAYER He's not home. 
MAYOR Where is he? 
SAX PLAYER He hasn't been home all night. 
There's frost on every window Oh, I can't believe my eyes And in my bones I feel the warmth That's coming from inside 
Oh, look What's this? They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss Why that looks so unique, inspired They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this? 
What's this? In here they've got a little tree, how queer And who would ever think And why? 
They're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now, correct me if I'm wrong This looks like fun This looks like fun Oh, could it be I got my wish? What's this? 
Oh my, what now? The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them Or ensnare them, only little cozy things Secure inside their dreamland What's this? 
The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems to be Good feeling all around 
Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere 
The sights, the sounds They're everywhere and all around I've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough 
I want it, oh, I want it Oh, I want it for my own I've got to know I've got to know What is this place that I have found? What is this? Christmas Town, hmm... 
SANDY CLAWS Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho 
JACK hmm.. 
[Halloweentown] 
CLOWN This has never happened before. 
Witch It's suspicious. 
SALLY Coming....lunch 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Ah, what's that?  Worm's wart, mmm, and...frog's breath. 
SALLY What's wrong?  I-I thought you liked frog's breath. 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it I won't swallow a spoonful. 
SALLY I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon]  Oops! 
DR. FINKELSTEIN You want me to starve.  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it is.  Me, to whom you owe your very life. 
SALLY Oh don't be silly.  [eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see.  Scrumptious. 
[Dr. Finkelstein eats soup] 
[Halloween] 
MAYOR Did anyone think to dredge the lake? 
VAMPIRE Ah, this morning! 
ZERO barks 
Witch Hear that? 
Witch (little) What? 
This is a thing called a present The whole thing starts with a box 
DEVIL A box? is it steel? 
WEREWOLF Are there locks? 
HARLEOUIN DEMON Is it filled with a pox? 
DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON A pox How delightful, a pox 
JACK If you please Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow 
WITCHES A bow? But why? How ugly What's in it? What's in it? 
JACK That's the point of the thing, not to know 
CLOWN It's a bat Will it bend? 
CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS It's a rat Will it break? 
UNDERSEA GAL Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake 
JACK Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas land 
Now, pay attention We pick up an oversized sock And hang it like this on the wall 
MR. HYDE Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot? 
[Dr. Finkelstein's castle] 
DR. FINKELSTEIN You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl. 
[locks Sally away] 
[dingdong] 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Oh my head...the door is open. 
JACK Hel-lo 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Jack Skellington, up here my boy. 
JACK Dr. I need to borrow some equipment. 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Is that so, whatever for? 
JACK I'm conducting a series of experiments. 
DR. FINKELSTEIN How perfectly marvelous.  Curiosity killed the cat, you know. 
JACK I know. 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up. 
SALLY Hmm.  Experiments? 
Simple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though I do not have the key Something's there I cannot see What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? Hmm... 
I've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as I've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on 
Or perhaps it's really not as deep As I've been led to think Am I trying much too hard? Of course! I've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me 
It's simple really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because I cannot see it Doesn't mean I can't believe it 
You know, I think this Christmas thing It's not as tricky as it seems And why should they have all the fun? It should belong to anyone 
Not anyone, in fact, but me Why, I could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason I can find I couldn't handle Christmas time 
I bet I could improve it too And that's exactly what I'll do Hee,hee,hee 
JACK Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours! 
MAYOR Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.  Dr. Finkelstein to the front of the line. 
VAMPIRE What kind of a noise is that for a baby to make? 
JACK Perhaps it can be improved? 
VAMPIRES No problem! 
JACK I knew it!  Dr. thank you for coming.  We need some of these. [showing picture of Santa and sleigh] 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Hmm.. their construction should be exceedingly simple.  I think. 
OOGIE BOOGIE Sandy Claws..hahaha 
[city hall] 
JACK It goes something like this.  [Jingle bells] How about it?  Think you can manage? 
PERSON INSIDE BASS a one, and a two, and a three, and a. . . 
[Jingle in a flat key by the band] 
MAYOR Next! 
JACK Fantastic!  Now why don't you all practice on that and we'll be in great shape.  Sally, I need your help more than anyone's. 
SALLY You certainly do, Jack.  I had the most terrible vision. 
JACK That's splendid. 
SALLY No, it was about your Xmas.  There was smoke and fire. 
JACK That not my Xmas.  My Xmas is filled with laughter and joy and this--my Sandy Claws outfit.  I want you to make it. 
SALLY Jack, please, listen to me--it's going to be a disaster. 
JACK How could it be--just follow the pattern.  This part is red, the trim is white. 
SALLY It's a mistake, Jack. 
BARREL we went through the door-- 
JACK Which door?  There's more than one.  Sandy Claws is behind the door shaped like this. 
[shows Xmas cookie in shape of tree] 
SHOCK I told you! 
[LS&B start fighting] 
JACK Arr!!  [making scary face at LS&B] 
JACK I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.  Take him home first  and apologize again.  Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.  Treat him nicely. 
LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL Got it.  We'll get it right next time. 
[Dr. Finkelstein's castle] 
DR. FINKELSTEIN You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. 
IGOR Master, the plans. 
DR. FINKELSTEIN Excellent, Igor. 
[throws him a dog bone]

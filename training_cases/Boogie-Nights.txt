JACK 
The idea is this: Amber is a director 
of porno films and she's down on her luck. 
She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's 
desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her 
out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right? 
COLONEL 
Yes. Good dilemma. 
JACK 
Yes. So she calls up all the agencies 
in town and says: "Send over your best 
actors, I'm casting a porno picture." 
Well, the story goes and develops with 
Amber auditioning various men and 
women . . . the whole thing wraps up with 
the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if 
he's still in town to play the part -- 
he comes in -- the landlord says: 
You better pay rent or you're through. 
Well, Amber does one helluva suck job, 
ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing 
and fade out - the end. 
COLONEL 
That's great.

There's a kid, a young man, I met him 
last night: His name is Eddie Adams. 
He's here, he's at the party. He's something 
special and I want to cast him. 
COLONEL 
What films has he done? 
JACK 
This would be his first.

JUDGE 
Hello. You must be Maggie? 
AMBER 
Yes. 
JUDGE 
I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge. 
AMBER 
Yes. 
JUDGE 
You have a lawyer with you? 
AMBER 
No. I don't. I do not. 
They sit in silence. The Judge looks over a couple of files. Moments later, Amber's ex-husband, THOMAS (late 30s) steps in with his LAWYER. They all take seats. 
LAWYER 
Hello, Judge. 
Introductions happen, etc. BEAT. The Judge looks over some files; 
JUDGE 
You've been divorced for six years. 
AMBER 
Yes. Since 1977. 
JUDGE 
(to lawyer) 
And the agreement on the money settlement 
was taken care of? 
LAWYER 
Yes. 
JUDGE 
So. What we're talking about then 
is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew? 
AMBER 
Yes. 
JUDGE 
What was decided during the divorce? 
LAWYER 
Initially, Andrew went with his father, 
and visitation was given to his mother on -- 
(looks at a paper) 
from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven. 
With his mother entitled to bring Andrew 
to her home or any reasonable place. 
JUDGE 
(to Amber) 
Was that the understanding? 
AMBER 
Yes. 
JUDGE 
And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored? 
THOMAS 
Well, it was for a time -- 
AMBER 
I only saw him twice. 
THOMAS 
It said, "reasonable place," and I didn't 
think a house of drugs and prostitution 
and pornography was that. 
JUDGE 
I'm sorry, what is it that you -- 
THOMAS 
My ex-wife is involved in the pornography 
business -- I didn't think that environment 
was a safe place for my son. 
AMBER 
This is not right. My son was never 
exposed to pornographic material or 
drugs or any of these things, my husband 
just assumed -- 
THOMAS 
I saw it with my own eye. 
PAUSE. Amber has no response. The Judge looks down at the file. 
JUDGE 
Did you register this as a complaint? 
LAWYER 
My client didn't officially register, 
but I think the circumstance called 
for something immediate -- for the 
safety of the child. 
JUDGE 
How old is the boy now? 
THOMAS 
He's twelve. 
AMBER 
He'll be thirteen next month. 
JUDGE 
Where do you live now? 
THOMAS 
We live in Long Beach. I have a job 
there and my new wife is home with him. 
(pause) 
You see, the problem is, Judge, is that 
my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick 
person and she needs help. She deals in 
drugs and sex for a living -- 
AMBER 
I don't do drugs. 
LAWYER 
Your honor, she has been in and out 
of trouble with the law on quite a few 
occasions regarding this sort of thing. 
AMBER 
No. No. Not anymore 
CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches the Judge. OC there's the sound of papers shuffling. 
JUDGE (OC) 
He used to come into Party Boys 
once in a while. Mutrix introduced me -- 
DIRK 
And how would we do it, exactly? 
I mean, how would it all go down? 
TODD 
It's like this: I call him up, 
tell him I got half a key of quality stuff. 
REED 
Do you have his phone number? 
TODD 
Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price. 
DIRK 
How much? 
TODD 
Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks. 
Split it three ways -- 
DIRK 
That's enough to get my Vette fixed. 
TODD 
That's right. So we set up the deal, 
dump half a kilo of baking soda in a 
bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM. 
Right there -- this could be a nifty bit 
o' hustle-bustle. 
REED 
Do you have his address? 
TODD 
Fuckin', Reed, yeah I have his address, c'mon. 
DIRK 
What if he tests it out? 
TODD 
He won't. 
DIRK 
How do you know? 
TODD 
I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me. 
REED 
It's a pretty good idea. 
DIRK 
I think we should go for it. 
Scotty J. comes over to the table. 
SCOTTY J. 
You guys should be careful with this.

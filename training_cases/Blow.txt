ON BLACK: 
"A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY." 
FADE IN: 
EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH. 
CLOSER 
We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect the harvest. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY 
Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized bales speed along the narrow road. 
EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY 
The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire. The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel ashes into the pot to cool the solution. 
INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY 
A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash. 
INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags. 
EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY 
A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel bags and the plane takes off. 
EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT 
The Cessna touches down. 
EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers, working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long way from being the boss. 
INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
George stands in line to register for college, wearing his Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair. The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees. Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy. 
REGISTRATION WOMAN Next. 
It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own reflection. 
GEORGE (V.O.) I was standing there, and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didn't match, you know?  And then I looked around the room and it hit me.  I saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna live, what type of car I'd drive, who my neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I didn't want it.  Not that life. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a lunch box. 
GEORGE There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it. 
FRED That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family. 
GEORGE I know. 
FRED Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. 
GEORGE No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... 
It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like him. 
FRED What are you going to do? 
GEORGE I'm going to California. 
EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968 
George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags. Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA GONZALES, 21. 
GIRLS You guys need some help? 
George and Tuna stick out there hands. 
GEORGE George. 
TUNA Tuna. 
DEREK Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie, he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll. Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect. Alright, girls, give me five minutes. 
Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter. 
DEREK (CONT'D) Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I want to talk to the boys alone. 
After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now. 
DEREK (CONT'D) What can I do for you guys? 
GEORGE We want some grass. 
DEREK I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops? 
GEORGE No. 
DEREK Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment. 
GEORGE We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop? 
DEREK I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you. 
Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out from under a sink and sets it down in front of George. 
GEORGE What the fuck is that? 
DEREK It's your grass. 
TUNA Wow.  That's more than we had in mind. 
DEREK I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or not? 
George and Tuna look at each other. 
GEORGE We'll take it. 
EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
Summer on the beach.  It's one big party.  George and Tuna are on the beach.  They are the new kings.  They smoke pot and drink brews. George and Barbara get close as do Tuna and Maria.  Slowly, George's clothes and hair start to look better, cooler. 
George and Tuna hanging out with the SURFERS.

EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - SUNSET 
George and Barbara sit by the water, watching the waves crash into the sand.  The sky is streaked with purple and red. 
GEORGE This is it for me. 
BARBARA What is? 
GEORGE Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right. 
BARBARA You happy, baby? 
GEORGE Yeah.  I am. 
EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers, working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long way from being the boss. 
GEORGE It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? 
TUNA We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything. 
BARBARA You can't sell this to your friends. 
TUNA Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical. 
BARBARA Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy. 
EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door. 
GEORGE Are you sure this guy is cool? 
BARBARA You'll see for yourself. 
TUNA A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty queer. 
They walk in. 
INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS 
George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures, manicures. 
GEORGE Nothing like this back home. 
BARBARA Derek! 
DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate, especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut and runs to embrace her. 
DEREK Barbie! 
Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all around. 
DEREK (CONT'D) So, this is the new man, huh?  He's cute! 
George and Tuna stick out there hands. 
GEORGE George. 
TUNA Tuna. 
DEREK Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie, he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll. Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect. Alright, girls, give me five minutes. 
Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

George and Tuna look at each other. 
GEORGE We'll take it. 
EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
GEORGE The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag. 
DEREK You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week. 
GEORGE Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight. 
BARBARA We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic. 
GEORGE I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell. 
DEREK I don't know... 
GEORGE Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound. 
DEREK Come on, George, no one is going to pay that. 
GEORGE It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting. 
Derek looks at Barbara.  She nods. 
DEREK Goodness. 
GEORGE Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear. 
DEREK And I only deal with you? 
GEORGE Barbara and me.  No one else. 
Derek thinks about it. 
BARBARA It's gonna work, Derek. 
DEREK I don't know.  East coast.  Airplanes. It all sounds pretty risky. 
GEORGE She's a flight attendant.  They don't check her bags. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - 1968 - DAY 
George drops Barbara off in her uniform curbside.  They kiss and she walks away with two big, red Samsonites.  She checks them with a SKYCAP and tips him. 
EXT. SKY - 1968 - DAY 
A huge jet goes right to left through frame. 
INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968 - DAY

BARBARA Any message? 
KEVIN Keep it coming. 
INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - BOSTON - 1968 
We see Barbara's two red Samsonites being taken off the belt by Kevin. 
INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968 
Same scene repeated, except different clothes on all.  Maybe Kevin is dressed a little better. 
KEVIN More. 
INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968 
The same scene repeated, same things changed again; now Kevin is definitely dressed a little better. 
KEVIN I need more. 
BARBARA What do you want me to do?  I can only take two bags, and I can't fly back here everyday. 
KEVIN I know, but I've got a feeding frenzy on my hands.  Tell George this is small potatoes.  We're missing out on some serious cash.  You tell George.  He'll think of something. 
EXT. WINNEBAGO - 1968 - DAY 
MUSIC CUE: 
Tuna drives the big Winny.  Maria rides shotgun.  Barrelling cross-country, it's a party on wheels. 
EXT. WHITE OAK LODGE - AMHERST - 1968 - NIGHT 
Kevin and his girl, RADA, are the welcoming committee as the RV pulls into the parking lot.  They wave, slap the sides of the Winnebago, and greet the prodigal sons with hugs and handshakes. 
FRED Killjoy? 
George looks to Barbara, whose nose is bleeding. 
GEORGE Honey, your nose! 
BARBARA Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry. 
ERMINE Barbara, here, take my napkin. 
BARBARA Thanks.  I'll be okay. 
GEORGE You wanna split? 
BARBARA Yeah, I don't feel so well. 
GEORGE Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check. 
EXT. THE BUGGY WHIP - WEYMOUTH - 1972 - LATER 
George and Barbara exit the restaurant. 
GEORGE Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale. 
BARBARA I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds. 
GEORGE I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments. 
BARBARA Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you? 
GEORGE No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest. 
BARBARA Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents. 
GEORGE Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself. 
BARBARA Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute. 
GEORGE Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that. 
BARBARA Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us. 
INT. POLICE STATION - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE 
MUG SHOTS of George.  Left, right, center.  George sits handcuffed to a chair.  Piles of marijuana bricks roll past him. 
GEORGE (V.O.) I had a little problem in Chicago. Something about trying to sell a truckload of dope to an undercover officer.  So I applied the three rules of the game under if and when arrested. 
INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY 
George and his COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY stand before the JUDGE at the arraignment. 
GEORGE (V.O.) Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and the jury will chop off your balls and hand them to you on a platter. 
JUDGE George Jung, you have been accused of possession of six-hundred and sixty pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute.  How do you plead? 
GEORGE (V.O.) Rule two: plead not guilty and get bailed out of jail. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Your honor, I'd like to say a few words to the court. 
The court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands. 
JUDGE By all means. 
GEORGE In all honesty, I don't feel like what I've done is a crime and I think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison.  None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars.  I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do?  Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief? 
George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot.  The court officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles. 
JUDGE Those are very interesting concepts you have, Mr. Jung. Unfortunately for you, the imaginary line you crossed is real, the plants you brought with you are illegal, and what you did constitutes a crime. 
The judge slams his gavel. 
JUDGE (CONT'D) Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars. 
EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - NIGHT 
George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for him.  She doesn't look so good. 
BARBARA Surprise. 
INT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER 
The bottle is dwindling.  George and Fred are feeling it. 
FRED You alright? 
George nods. 
GEORGE Just low. 
FRED You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her. 
GEORGE Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do? 
FRED Tough spot. 
The glasses are refilled. 
GEORGE You mad at me? 
FRED Not mad. 
GEORGE Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me. 
FRED I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you. 
GEORGE I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great. 
FRED Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything. 
Something outside catches George's eye.  A light.  A reflection.  A movement.  George is up and on the move. 
FRED (CONT'D) Where are you going? 
EXT. JUNG HOUSE - NIGHT 
The front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house. 
INT. JUNG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
George is up the stairs in a flash. 
ERMINE George! 
INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
George slams the door behind him, moves over to the window, and opens it.  Cops everywhere.  He's trapped.  Out of options, he folds.  He moves to the corner and sits down, turns on the train set.  A KNOCK on the door is heard.  FBI Agent, JAMES T. TROUT. 
TROUT George Jung, you are under arrest. 
FRED Open the door, son. 
EXT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER 
They lead George outside in handcuffs.  Ermine and Fred watch. 
ERMINE I had no choice. 
George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time realizing her betrayal. 
ERMINE (CONT'D) Don't look at me like that.  What was I supposed to do?  You're in our house. What, was I supposed to be an accomplice? 
As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows. 
ERMINE (CONT'D) You don't think people know you're a drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no secret.  How do you think that reflects on me?  Every time I go out, I'm humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear the whispers.  How do you think that makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop and think of me? 
George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car. He looks up at his mother. 
ERMINE (CONT'D) So you go to jail.  It's for your own good.  You need to straighten your life out. 
INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - 1974 - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE: 
George is being led through a series of gated corridors. 
GUARD Prisoner in. 
As he walks, he takes in the faces of the other inmates.  He arrives at his cell and notices he has a ROOMMATE. 
GUARD (CONT'D) Prisoner in. 
INMATE #1 Shit, I'm in for life. 
INMATE #2 I'm a criminal.  I ain't getting no motherfucking job. 
GEORGE We can learn some criminal shit, too. Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if half the time, we learn about George Washington, and the other half, I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs? 
INMATE #2 Man, you don't know dick about smuggling no drugs. 
GEORGE I was arrested in Chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I think that qualifies me. 
Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested. 
INMATE #1 How did you get a hold of six-hundred and sixty pounds of dope? 
GEORGE Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal or not? 
They react.  They're in. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Alright, the first thing you need to know about smuggling drugs is that it's easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers. They couldn't find their dicks in a whorehouse.  They don't know what the fuck they're doing... 
Diego watches George winning over the room.  He listens intently to George's every word.  His wheels are turning. 
INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
Lights out.  Diego and George lay in their cots.  George is tired.  Diego is not. 
DIEGO George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what you say to the class today about the smuggling.  You are a magico, ah? 
George doesn't respond. 
DIEGO (CONT'D) I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit. 
GEORGE I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed. 
DIEGO You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah? 
GEORGE Good night. 
DIEGO In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George? 
GEORGE I would if I could get some sleep. 
DIEGO Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why? 
GEORGE Because I got caught. 
DIEGO No, my brother. 
GEORGE Because they caught me? 
DIEGO You failed because you had the wrong dream. 
Diego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye. 
DIEGO (CONT'D) George?  What do you know about cocaine? 
INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY 
GEORGE I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive. 
DIEGO No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty. 
George's interest is piqued. 
GEORGE That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo. 
DIEGO And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand. 
GEORGE Oh my G-d. 
DIEGO Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions. 
GEORGE Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ. 
DIEGO Now do you see what I am saying? 
GEORGE Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get? 
DIEGO Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine. 
INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
CESAR Whose cloths?  Your clothes? 
GEORGE My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter? 
CESAR I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important. 
GEORGE What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes. 
CESAR I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know. 
GEORGE It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos. 
CESAR The coca is my responsibility! 
GEORGE You're a fucking amateur! 
DIEGO Gentlemen, please.  There is no need to be impolite.  Cesar, this will be fine. You have my word.  George, Cesar is just being thorough.  That's all. 
CESAR Very well.  But just remember, Mr. Jung. I will be with you the whole way.  And I will be watching. 
INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - 1976 - DAY 
George carries the two Samsonites over to customs inspections.  It's a long walk.  George's heart beats hard. The sound is audible and grows with every beat.  BA-BUMP.  BA BUMP.  Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel. 
GEORGE (V.O.) When you're carrying drugs across the border, the idea is to remain calm.  The way I do it is to think of something pleasant, a fun party, a moment of triumph.  A sexual encounter.  I actually project myself to that place. Anything to keep your mind off the fact that you're going to jail for a very long time if they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases. 
George stands in front of the customs agent.  He tries his best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents. 
CUSTOMS AGENT On vacation? 
GEORGE Yes. 
CUSTOMS AGENT On vacation for only one day? 
BA-BUMP.  BA-BUMP.  The heartbeats are very loud. 
GEORGE (weak smile) My brother's wedding.  Imagine that, huh? 
George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex doesn't seem to be working.  Cesar passes through, eyeballing George the whole time. 
CUSTOMS AGENT Open your bags, please. 
George opens the Samsonites.  Super dry mouth.  BA-BUMP.  BA BUMP.  The beats are deafening now.  Cesar nervously monitors the situation from the payphones. 
CUSTOMS AGENT (CONT'D) Whose clothes are these? 
GEORGE Mine. 
The customs agent holds up a woman's undergarment.  Cesar throws up his hands in frustration. 
CUSTOMS AGENT And this? 
GEORGE What can I tell you?  Different strokes. 
George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before finishing the inspection. 
CUSTOMS AGENT Alright, go ahead. 
EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - PAYPHONES - CONTINUOUS 
George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases, and pretends to make a call.  Not inconspicuously, Cesar grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal. 
INT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - 1976 - DAY 
Diego, Cesar, George and JACK STEVENS, a silver haired executive type, lounge around the mini-suite.  Cesar still has that crazy look in his eye. 
DIEGO Three-hundred kilos it is, then. 
A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and Cesar.  Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not. 
DIEGO (CONT'D) Has everyone met Inez?  This is George. I've told you about him.  And this is friend, Jack Stevens. 
The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like ants before sitting down next to Diego. 
DIEGO (CONT'D) Try to be more respectful, darling.  My apologies.  But she is mistrustful of Americans.  Shall we proceed?  Let's hear it again, Mr. Stevens. 
STEVENS I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the Bahamas, and then to Medellin. 
INEZ Friday? 
Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only.  She speaks in Spanish. The conversation is about "Why Friday?"  Inez has some problem with it.  Diego explains.  And Inez is reassured. 
DIEGO (CONT'D) This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia. 
GEORGE What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me. 
DIEGO I need you to go to Miami. 
EXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY 
George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN hanging around outside an apartment.  He checks the address and moves over to the men. 
GEORGE I'm George.  Friend of Diego's? 
The Colombian men are not impressed.  They grab George and pull him inside. 
INT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS 
George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one who speaks English. 
ALESSANDRO QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego? 
GEORGE I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George. 
ALESSANDRO Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George. 
George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth. 
ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing me? 
George nods. 
ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) You see this? 
He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of cocaine. 
ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that? 
GEORGE Um-hmm. 
INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY 
George sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked away in the closet.  Ermine pokes her head in. 
ERMINE You have a phone call. 
George picks up the phone. 
DIEGO (O.S.) George. 
GEORGE Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money. 
DIEGO (O.S.) Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia. 
GEORGE Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on... 
George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway, eavesdropping. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Hi, Mom. 
George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get your ass up here. 
INT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS 
It's a South American prison.  Diego is on the pay phone. 
DIEGO It's a little hard to get away right now.  I'm afraid you're on your own. 
INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT 
George and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie ish looking professor.  On the table sits various paraphernalia.  Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box. George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate. 
MR. T What we're doing is measuring the purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety degrees.  Cutting agents melt much lower.  About a hundred degrees. Quality product starts melting at a hundred and forty degrees.  That's what I'm hoping for. 
Mr. T turns the dial.  120.  130.  140. 
MR. T (CONT'D) Good. 
MR. T (CONT'D) Jesus Christ. 
MR. T (CONT'D) Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me running!  Where did you get this shit! 
LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr. Jung alone.  You are to wait here. 
George hesitates. 
DIEGO It's alright, George.  You go. 
LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN This way, please. 
The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he is led away. 
ESCOBAR So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day? 
GEORGE Actually, it was three. 
ESCOBAR The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George? 
GEORGE It would be my pleasure. 
ESCOBAR Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country. 
Escobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands. 
ESCOBAR (CONT'D) The man in the garden.  He was full of courage. 
GEORGE Un sapo? 
ESCOBAR Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die. 
GEORGE Yes. 
ESCOBAR But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems. 
GEORGE With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him. 
Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks across Pablo's lips. 
ESCOBAR I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George? 
GEORGE Yes, it is. 
ESCOBAR So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George? 
GEORGE Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me. 
ESCOBAR As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about. 
Diego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo waves them away. 
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY 
Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before them is a stunning panorama. 
ESCOBAR I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature. 
GEORGE It's beautiful. 
ESCOBAR People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George? 
Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to respond in full. 
GEORGE What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know. 
ESCOBAR Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George? 
GEORGE I want money. 
ESCOBAR Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George? 
GEORGE Freedom. 
ESCOBAR Power? 
GEORGE Yeah, maybe. 
ESCOBAR Family. 
GEORGE Sure. 
ESCOBAR Beautiful girls? 
GEORGE Keep them coming. 
GEORGE We've got to do something about this. 
INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE: PANAMA CITY, PANAMA 
George and Diego watch as their money is hauled into a huge wall safe.  Armed Panamanian soldiers stand guard.  The Panamanian officials and the BANK PRESIDENT oversee the proceedings. 
GEORGE Are you comfortable with this? 
DIEGO George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it. 
GEORGE And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks. 
DIEGO Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us? 
INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
George and Diego sign papers.  The bank president congratulates them and hands them documentation. 
GEORGE I love it. 
BANK PRESIDENT I'm sorry. 
GEORGE I give you thirty-million dollars and you give me this little book. 
MORE STILL PHOTOS 
Diego and Inez's wedding.  The ceremony.  The ring.  The kiss.  The lineup with all of the bridesmaids.  George is the best man, and the only American. 
INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
A huge reception.  All the pomp and circumstance Colombian money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly throws his arm around George's shoulder. 
DIEGO I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George? 
GEORGE You're a lucky man, Diego. 
DIEGO I love you, my brother, do you know that? 
GEORGE I love you too, man. 
George notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'll be right back, Diego. 
INEZ Look, honey, a power boat. 
DIEGO Great, baby, great! 
They kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly towards Mirtha. 
GEORGE Hello. 
MIRTHA Hello. 
GEORGE Do I know you? 
MIRTHA I don't think so. 
GEORGE Why are you smiling? 
MIRTHA Why are you smiling? 
GEORGE I don't know.  My name is George. 
MIRTHA I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George. 
GEORGE What is your name? 
Cesar arrives. 
CESAR Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee, Mirtha. 
He kisses her. 
GEORGE Mirtha. 
CESAR Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito. 
They leave.  George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more teeth.  George arrives at the table.  Various greetings. 
MIRTHA Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I? 
GEORGE Put that shit away, they're here. 
INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - LATER 
Mirtha and George lead Fred and Ermine from room to room, showing off the house.  The decor is, well, eclectic.  It doesn't match the architecture. 
ERMINE It's all so beautiful. 
MIRTHA What do you think, Dad? 
FRED Yeah.  Nice. 
ERMINE Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune. 
GEORGE (quickly) It's a family heirloom. 
ERMINE I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap. 
GEORGE Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family. 
ERMINE Oh, I see. 
MIRTHA Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the house. 
George and his father move outside. 
EXT. GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS 
George and his father walk. 
GEORGE So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments... 
FRED Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time. 
They move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the driveway. 
FRED (CONT'D) You come from my body, remember?  You're my baby boy.  The same kid who would jump off a mountain if someone told him he couldn't do it.  You haven't changed much.  I know the things you do.  Not everything.  But I get the picture and I don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not what I would have chosen for you, but it's your life.  It doesn't have anything to do with me. 
He turns and looks at his boy. 
FRED (CONT'D) You're like your mother.  You love money. 
GEORGE Dad. 
FRED No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son? 
GEORGE Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now. 
INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY 
Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a cigarette. 
DIEGO Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough? 
GEORGE Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate. 
DIEGO I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me. 
GEORGE What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it? 
DIEGO What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle. 
George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind. But Diego won't get off the soap box. 
GEORGE Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy. 
DIEGO I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream? 
A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside. It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down, their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English. No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined. The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in Spanish unless otherwise indicated. 
TONY Algun problema? 
GEORGE No no no... no problema, amigo.  El dinero esta todo aqui. Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo contaremos.  Okay?  No problem. 
TONY Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos. 
The pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap. George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it. 
DIEGO (English) You embarrassed me, George.  You make me look very bad. 
Augusto lets out a big laugh. 
AUGUSTO Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home. 
GEORGE What? 
Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder. 
AUGUSTO Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip. 
GEORGE Motherfucker works fast. 
AUGUSTO The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point. 
GEORGE He what? 
AUGUSTO Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long. 
GEORGE That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing? 
Augusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times Square.  10, 9, 8, 7... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Oh, no. 
Happy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I wearing lipstick? I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because when I'm getting fucked, I want to make sure my face is pretty.  You're buying directly from Diego, aren't you, you son of a bitch? 
INTERCUT 
Derek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party hat. 
DEREK I don't want to get caught in the middle of this.  That's between you and Diego. 
George's face scrinches in pain. 
DEREK (CONT'D) It's nothing personal, George.  Just business. 
GEORGE Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you. 
The song ends, and George is left standing there screaming. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I bring you in, and this is how you repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek? Derek? 
INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - DINING ROOM - 1979 - LATER 
It's late.  The family is all there.  Fifteen, twenty strong. Cuban coffees all around. 
MIRTHA Que va hacer? 
AUGUSTO Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada. 
MARIA Alguna cosa tiene que hacer. 
FAMILY MEMBER #2 De otra manera, es un marica. 
FAMILY MEMBER #3 Un hijueputa 
FAMILY MEMBER #1 Maricon. 
FAMILY MEMBER #2 Mira, vos sos responsable por el exito de Diego. 
FAMILY MEMBER #3 El se esta burlando de vos.  Debes hacer algo, hombre. 
MARIA No Puedes hacer ni un culo. 
AUGUSTO El no va hacer nada.  Hay un problema. Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos ha arreglar. 
BLANCA No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo le importa la plata. 
Blanca reaches into her purse, pulls out an ice pick folded in a piece of linen cloth, and puts it down in front of George. 
BLANCA (CONT'D) Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo. De lo contrario vas a quedar como un marica sin horror. 
FAMILY MEMBER #3 Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado. 
FAMILY MEMBER #1 Maricon. 
BLANCA Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones. Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del Diego. 
AUGUSTO Blanca, por favor. 
ESCOBAR Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher. 
GEORGE I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up! 
ESCOBAR I'm sorry, George. 
GEORGE Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good? 
ESCOBAR Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George. 
Escobar embraces George for a moment, and then George starts to move away. 
ESCOBAR (CONT'D) And, George?  The vengance?  It is best served cold. 
INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mirtha is sleeping.  She's so big, she looks like she's gonna explode.  George sits on the bed and rests his hand on Mirtha's face.  He looks like the Elephant Man. 
MIRTHA George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you. 
GEORGE Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out. 
MIRTHA Pablo said no? 
GEORGE Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now. 
EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY 
Fred, Ermine and Mirth are waiting for George in the car. Mirtha's water has broken.  Ermine honks the horn from the back seat and screams out the window. 
ERMINE George, it's time!  George!  George! 
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
George is high and in a panic.  He races around, trying to get a suitcase packed and find his keys. 
GEORGE Coming! 
He finally gets it together, but before he runs out the door, he does one last blast. 
INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - MATERNITY - DAY 
Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain.  She's crowning.  George wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask. He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort.  The baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts the cord.  Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs hysterically.  But something is wrong with George.  The color drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him. 
GEORGE (V.O.) Watching my baby girl born did something to me. They talk about religious experiences, I didn't believe in religion.  But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this world, something in me changed.  I looked at her and I knew right then that I could never love anything but my daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy, but it was like, click, I knew what I was put on this planet for.  It was the greatest feeling I ever had followed by the worst feeling I ever had. 
NURSE He fainted. 
MIRTHA George! 
The doctor grabs George's wrist. 
DR. BAY He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs? 
GEORGE Coke. 
DR. BAY Cocaine?  How much? 
GEORGE I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams. 
DR. BAY In how long?  A week? 
GEORGE Today. 
DR. BAY Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack. 
INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - LATER 
George lies in the recovery room, sedated, tubes everywhere. He's hooked up to IV's, monitors, and machines.  Dr. Bay enters. 
DR. BAY I've reviewed your toxicology report three times, George.  I've never seen anything like it.  Eighteen grams. The lethal dose is a gram and a half. You should be in the Guiness Book. 
George cracks a faint smile. 
DR. BAY (CONT'D) It's not funny, George.  You should be dead right now.  Absolutely.  I cannot come up with one logical explanation for why you're still breathing.  I'm not here to give you lectures, I've got no moral interest in what you do.  But, take it easy, George.  Stay with us a while.  You've got a daughter now. 
INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY 
Kristina is crying.  Daddy George to the rescue.  He picks her up, cuddles her.  Gives her a bottle and she quiets. 
EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1980 - DAY 
GEORGE There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya. 
MIRTHA Fuck you, George, just fucking drive. 
GEORGE Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem? 
MIRTHA My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy. 
GEORGE What? 
MIRTHA That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me. 
Mirtha grabs nuts. 
GEORGE Those are my nuts! 
George tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is pulled over. 
EXT. I-95 - CONTINUOUS 
Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied. The policemen step from their car. 
MIRTHA He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker to jail! 
George sits behind the wheel.  He knows it's over. 
INT. M.C.I. WALPOLE - VISITING AREA - 1989 - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE: FOUR YEARS LATER 
Visiting day.  Inmates sit across from their families. Mirtha is sitting at the glass.  George walks to his seat. 
MIRTHA I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting custody of Kristina.  And when you get out next week, you're going to pay support and that's the end of it. Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm sorry. 
George just looks at her.  His face is stone.  But he is moved. 
MIRTHA (CONT'D) You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something. 
GEORGE What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here. 
MIRTHA Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself. 
She moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the room. Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here. 
GEORGE My baby.  She's so big. 
Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the phone and speaks, every word an accusation. 
KRISTINA I thought you couldn't live without your heart. 
She drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - MIAMI STREETS - DAY 
George puts in the quarters.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MIAMI - DAY 
Nine-year old Kristina Jung leaves school.  George, fresh out of prison, moves across the street to meet her. 
KRISTINA What are you doing here? 
GEORGE Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you. 
KRISTINA Well, here I am.  See? 
GEORGE How are you doing? 
KRISTINA George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay. 
GEORGE Dad. 
KRISTINA What? 
GEORGE You can call me Dad if you want. 
KRISTINA I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone. 
GEORGE Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on... 
GEORGE How's he doing? 
ZIGMOND Well, he's out of the hospital, but there's not much anyone can do for him. It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I brought a tape recorder in case you wanted to say something to him.  That way he could hear your voice. 
GEORGE Right. 
Zigmond sets the tape recorder down and leaves the room. George stares long at the machine.  He pushes the record button and looks at the red light. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Hello, Dad... 
EXT. JUNG HOUSE - DAY 
A sixty-nine year old Fred shuffles from his house to the blue LTD.  He gets in, turns the key, and puts his son's tape into the deck.

Six-year old George runs through the leaves to the truck and rides to work with his father.

INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - 1973 - NIGHT 
James J. Trout pulls a handcuffed George's boots over his socks as Fred and Ermine watch.

George's eyes well up and he sparks a cigarette, as he keeps trying to tell his father goodbye. 
GEORGE (V.O.) And that time you told me that money wasn't real?  Well, old man, I'm forty two years old.  I finally learned what you tried to tell me so many years ago.

Tears come crashing out of the old man's stoic face.

EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY 
A vision of Fred Jung sits on the ground before his fifty-two year old son. 
GEORGE I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George. 
FRED That was a beautiful message. 
GEORGE I meant every word of it. 
FRED Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape? 
GEORGE Yes, I do. 
PROSECUTOR Do you see him here in the courtroom? 
GEORGE Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table. 
PROSECUTOR Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado. 
The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage style... 
PROSECUTOR (CONT'D) Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado? 
GEORGE Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) The first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the United States via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly into North Carolina, we'd meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego Delgado was my only connection to cocaine from Colombia... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a close relationship with Manuel Noriega. In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) There was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours. Initially with my LA connections, we invented the marketplace.  In 1977, there was no other real competition. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) The first year we made about 100 million dollars between us.  It was an expensive operation.  Eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth. We were like a corporation... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) he was very anti-government.  He talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money.  I was just looking for money. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) He disliked the United States, thought it was a police state.  He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection, I met him back in 1968 when I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It was Foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only a matter of months before he'd cut me out. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'm not sure how my relationship with my daughter and ex-wife have anything to do with this trial.  I mean we're here to talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we? 
CALIBANOS Yes, we are Mr. Jung. 
We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning. 
CALIBANOS (CONT'D) Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct? 
GEORGE Yes, I am. 
CALIBANOS Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony? 
GEORGE No, I cam here out of my own volition. 
CALIBANOS Excuse me? 
GEORGE Something about vengance being best served cold. 
CALIBANOS Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung? 
GEORGE Excuse me? 
CALIBANOS Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case? 
GEORGE I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen. 
CALIBANOS So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct? 
George can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury, the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable. He feels suddenly sleazy. 
CALIBANOS (CONT'D) I thought so.  No more questions. 
Silence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos laughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks by Diego.  They look at each other. 
GEORGE You shouldn't have taken the 30 million, Diego, I was out. 
George is lead away. 
CLERK The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens. 
Jack Stevens is lead to the stand.  WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CAR - 1999 - DAY 
The green of the New York State countryside drifts by as a brown Mazda moves along Highway 19.  Behind the wheel is a beautiful 20 year old woman wearing dark sunglasses.  She drives absently, her mind somewhere else.

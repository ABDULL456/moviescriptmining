THE PRESTIGE 
Written by 
Jonathan Nolan & Christopher Nolan 
FADE IN: 
TOP HATS. Clustered in a small glade. As we SUPER TITLES, a BLACK CAT slinks its way through them. As TITLES END- 
BORDEN (V.O.) Are you watching closely? A SECOND BLACK CAT races into frame, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the woods beyond and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLUTTERED WORKSHOP -- DAY 
Moving along a row of CANARIES in CAGES. 
CUTTER (V.O.) Every magic trick consists of three part, or acts... Stop at a cage. Weathered HANDS envelope the canary. Hands and voice belongs to a man in his 60's- CUTTER. 
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) The first part is called the Pledge... A LITTLE GIRL pershes on a chest in the workshop, watching. 
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the magician shows you something 
ORDINARY- Cutter moves to a small ORNATE CAGE resting on a prop table. 
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) A deck of cards, ar a bird... 
INT. SCALA THEATRE, LONDON -- NIGHT 
A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air. 
CUTTER (V.O.) ...or a man. A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Bearded Man from the aisle. He shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed. 
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) He show you this object, and pledges to you its utter normality... Bearbed Man and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down towards the stage... 
On which stands the magician, leaning on his cane, smiling. This is ROBERT ANGIER, 35, an American. Looming over him is a large and complex ELETRICAL MACHINE. 
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Perhaps he asks you to inspect it... 
Bearbed Man, FASCINATED, and other Volunteers look over the vast machine. As angier GESTURES theatrically at the various features of the metal and glass apparatus. 
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...to see that it is indeed real... 
As the Assistant leads the Volunteers off the stage, Bearded Man slips through the gap at the side of the curtains- 
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...unaltered... 
INT. STAGE THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
-looks around, DISORIENTED, then darts for some stairs leagind below stage where he runs into a burly STAGEHAND. 
CUTTER (V.O.) ...normal. 
STAGEHAND Where'd you think you're going?! 
CUTTER (V.O.) But, of course, it probably isn't... 
Bearded Man pulls off his beard, revealing the face of ALFRED BORDEN, mid 30's. 
BEARDED MAN I'm part of the act, you fool! 
The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside. Borden RACES down below the stage. Cutter approaches the Stagehand. 
CUTTER Who was that? 
INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
As the machine GROANS to life. SPARKING and CRACKLING, Angier gazes at it, forgettig his audience. Entranced. Possessed. 
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the 
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY 
Cutter gently places the canary into the ornate cage. 
CUTTER (V.O.) The second act is called the Turn... 
INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT 
Angier, facing the audience, steps into the machine. 
CUTTER (V.O.) The magician takes the ordinary something... 
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
Borden lights a MATCH. In front of him is a LARGE GLASS TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITs LID PROPPED OPEN. Borden frowns. 
CUTTER (V.O.) ...and makes it do something extraordianry. 
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY 
Cutter places a SILK SHAWL over the cage. Then SLAMS his hands down on the shawl, which FLATTENS- The Little Girl FLINCHES. Then STARES, FASCINATED. 
CUTTER (V.O.) Now you're looking for the secret. 
INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT 
Bolts of electicity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball of light which CRACKS- 
CUTTER (V.O.) But you won't find it... 
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
The ROOM fills with light as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a 
EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY 
OWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN of the guard walks out to greet him. 
CAPTAIN I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets. 
Owens raises his eyebrows. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air- he's convinced he'll try an escape. 
Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet. They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms over them. A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS. The other INMATES begin cattle-calling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if I leave him out with the others immates. 
At the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a thick eye hook set into the ground. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) 
(TO WARDERS) Check the locks. Twice. 
They check the locks. Then retreat to allow privacy. The Captain marches away. Borden looks at Owens. Bored. 
OWENS My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor. 
Borden says nothing. 
OWENS (CONT'D) I represent Lord Caldlow, and accomplished amateur magician and historian of magic- 
BORDEN How much? 
OWENS Lord Caldlow is interested in- 
BORDEN 
(COLD) How much for my tricks? 
OWENS Five thousand pounds. 
BORDEN Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him. 
OWENS I did. He offered to sell all of your tricks... except the most valuable one - The Transported Man. 
BORDEN I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick. Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him. 
OWENS Even for your daughter? Borden looks up. Owens moves closer, quietly assertive. 
OWENS (CONT'D) If the newspapers are right, and you're for the drop, your daughter's going to need looking after 
BORDEN Fallon can take care of- 
OWENS Bernard Fallon? A man with a past even more obscure than your own? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his "care". No, the girl is to be an orphan. I've been to the work house... Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs. 
OWENS (CONT'D) It's better than this. Borden looks at Owens, hard. The Warders unlock Borden. 
OWENS (CONT'D) I'm offering you a way to warp up your affairs with dignity, and I'm offering your daughter a future. As Lord Caldlow's ward she will want for nothing. Ever. (hands him a card) Think it over. 
Borden absently VANISHES the card as a REFLEX. 
OWENS (CONT'D) Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this- (produces a leather 
BOUND JOURNAL) As a show of good faith. He thought it might be of interest. 
A SULLEN WALDER TALKS the journal, flicks through it. 
OWENS (CONT'D) Robert Angier's diary... It includes the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick... 
Sullen hands the journal to Borden. Borden takes it. 
BORDEN Angier never learned my trick. 
OWENS Really? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better, even... 
(WITH RELISH) Than your original. 
BORDEN 
(ACID) If you want Angier's secret you can dig him up and ask him for yourself. 
Borden TURNS, dragging the Warders with him. 
OWENS I want your secret, Mr.Borden... 
(LOUDER) Consider your daughter! 
INT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY 
Borden, on the bed, opens Angier's JOURNAL. Starts to read... 
ANGIER (V.O.) A cypher. An enigma... 
CUT TO: 
LETTERS ON A PAGE. IN MEANINGLESS COMBINATIONS. GIBBERISH. 
INT. TRAIN, MOUNTAINS -- DUSK 
Aniger, with a SIGH, closes a CARDBOARD-COVERED NOTEBOOK. OPENS his LEATHER-BOUND JOURNAL. Starts to write. 
ANGIER (V.O.) ...Borden's cypher is simple- unraveled by a single word. Now it takes only patience. And a passion to know his mind. 
Angier lloks up at his own reflection in the train window. 
EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DUSK 
No platform, no office, no sign. Just an electric streetlight which, as Angier watches, FLICKERS ON. Angier, leaning heavily on his cane limps over to the light and stares up at it as he's never seen one before. 
VOICE (O.S.) Mr.Angier? Welcome to Colorado Springs. 
INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING 
Sarah lingers at the top of the stairs to her flat. Borden tries to KISS her, but she pushes him back. He tests the LOCK of the open door. 
BORDEN Enough to keep me out? 
SARAH I think so. Wil I see you again? 
Borden SHRUGS and turns to go back down the stairs. Sarah looks after him, about to change her min. Hesitates. 
INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- CONTINUOUS 
She closes the door and LOCKS it, smiling. After a moment she pads through living/kitchen area, draws back the curtain to her bedroom and SHRIEKS: 
Borden is there, smiling. Sarah moves towards him, giggling. 
INT. TENLEY THEATRE -- NIGHT 
Onstage, CHUNG LING SOO, 60's, wearing a long silk robe, HOBBLES painfully to the center of the stage. Clearly CRIPPLED. In the audience, Borden and Angier watch intently. 
Soo lays a silk SHAWL and a BARE TABLE. He WHIPS it up, revealing a BOUQUET OF ROSES. So repeats the trick again and again, producing a different object each time. 
Finally, with a drum roll, Soo whips the shawl aside to reveal a MASSIVE GOLDFISH BOWL, complete with GOLDFISH. 
To THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, Soo bows and HOBBLES off the stage. Angier, clapping, shakes his head, utterly baffled. He turns to Borden. Who has a small, knowing, smile. 
EXT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 
Borden and Angier watch Soo being helped down from his carriege by HANDLERS who treat him with great gentleness. 
ANGIER You're wrong. It can't be. 
BORDEN It is. He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance. 
ANGIER but look at the man! 
BORDEN 
(POINTS) This is the trick. This is why no one detectes his method. 
Soo hobbles into the restaurant, frail, and fragile. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Total devotion to his art... (looks at Angier) Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only way to escape this. 
Borden SLAPS the bricks of the wall behind them. 
INT. BEDSIT -- NIGHT 
Julia, in bed, watches Angier, SHEET wrapped around him like a robe, HOBBLING. He pulls up the sheeyt- between his knees is a goldfish bowl. 
ANGIER I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox. 
JULIA 
(INCREDULOUS) He's been preteding to be an cripple for years? 
ANGIER Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable. 
Angier puts the bowl down with a flourish. Climbs into bed. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) Borden saw it at once. I couldn't fathom it- living your whole life pretending to be someone else. 
JULIA You're pretending to be someone else. 
ANGIER I don't think changing your name compares. 
JULIA Not just your name- who you are, where you're from... 
ANGIER I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors. Angier cuddles up to Julia. 
JULIA I came up with a name for you... "The Great Danton" 
(ANGIER FROWNS) You don't like it? It's sophisticated. 
ANGIER It's French. 
INT. BEDSIT -- DAY 
Sarah unlocks the door, but has to PUSH against MAGICAL PROPS stacked against it- the bedsit is FILLED with DEVICES. 
SARAH Alfred?! 
Sarah surveys the confusion- spots Borden across the flat deep in conversation with another man. Borden spots her- 
BORDEN We have our routine for Ackerman! 
The other man turns- it is Fallon. 
SARAH 
(COLD) We haven't had the pleasure. 
Fallon nods. Borden comes over, holding a DUELING PISTOL. 
BORDEN Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur- 
SARAH Where did yo get all of- 
BORDEN Begged, borrowed and don't ask. Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul. 
SARAH I need talk to you. 
Fallon slips past Sarah with a nod to Borden. Exits. Sarah looks at Borden. TENSE. 
SARAH (CONT'D) We can't afford to pay him- 
BORDEN We'll start making money once we have our audience- 
The Judge follows Cutter, approaching a collection of magical apparatus, including a MASSIVE CRATE. Cutter looks up at it with AWE, touching the side where it says "COLORADO SPRINGS". 
JUDGE What's in there? 
Cutter OPENS it, revealing metal and glass MACHINERY within. 
CUTTER Angier's machine. 
JUDGE You built this, Mr.Cutter? 
CUTTER 
(SHAKES HEAD) Oh no. This wasn't built by a magician... it was built by a wizard. 
(OFF LOOK) A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to... 
Cutter closes the crats. The JUDGE turns to other props. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) your honour, what will happen to these things when the trial is over? 
The Judge is staring at a large glass tank. 
JUDGE They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case. 
CUTTER Don't let him take this. 
The Judge looks over. Cutter is touching the crate. 
JUDGE Why ever not? 
CUTTER It's dangerous. 
JUDGE I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick. 
CUTTER The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real. 
The Judge looks at Cutter. Smiles indulgently. Turns. 
JUDGE This is the tank Angier drowned in? 
Cutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank. Nods. Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is a PADLOCK. Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid- 
CUTTER This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock... 
-a small section POPS open. 
JUDGE A standard magical apparatus for escapes? 
CUTTER With one important difference... 
Cutter grabs the PADLOCK. Rattles it. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) This isn't a trick lock... it's been switched out for a real one. 
The Judge stares at the tank, appaled. 
JUDGE What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths? 
CUTTER These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock. 
JUDGE Even without and audience? 
Cutter stares at the tank- 
INSERT CUT: ANGIER SCREAMING BUBBLES. 
CUTTER There was and audience. (looks at Judge) See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men... 
INT. THEATRE -- EVENING 
Onstage, A SIMILAR TANK FILLED WITH WATER. 
CUTTER (V.O.) A particular awful significance... 
Julia stands next to the tank. Milton adresses the audience. 
MILTON Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman? 
Milton gestures to Julia- the crowd goes wild. Julia makes a show of deciding. She picks up Angier and Borden, who are made up to look different from the last performance. As they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter in the wings- Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE. 
As Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just under her toes- she KICKS him in the chin. 
Borden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a particular fashion. Stops. Reconsiders. Julia NODS at him, encouring. Borden starts RETRYING the knot. 
Cutter watches. His hand checking for the axe handle. 
Borden tests the rope- it is tight. Julia gives him the sign with her eyes- he steps back. Angier rises to his feet, grinning at Julia. As she raises her arms to the hook, she can't quite hide her smile back at him. 
Milton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air. Cutter slips his STOPWATCH out of his pocket as Milton moes the tank under Julia's bare feet. 
Angier looks up at Julia. Proud. She stares out over the audience, preparing herself. Looks down at Angier, smiling... 
Julia PLUNGES into the tank- Milton SLAMS the lid shut- Cutter checks his stopwatch, hand caressing the axe handle... 
Milton raises the curtain around the tank, then circles it, working his "magic". Angier shifts a little. Time passing... Milton looks at Cutter- TOO MUCH TIME... 
Cutter GRASPS his axe and SPRINT at the tank- Milton RIPS the curtain down- Julia, one arm free, is CONVULSING... 
Angier and Borden look on in HORROR as Cutter SWINGS his axe into the glass- which CRACKS... cutter SWINGS again and again- the web of crackes GROWING, Julia's convulsions SLOWING, her eyes PLEADING with Angier's, until- 
CRASH- the glass gives way, FLOODING the stage- Cutter and Angier GRASP at Julia- FULL her onto the stage- Cutter ELBOWS Angier out of the way to POUND on Julia's chest- Borden wacthes, stunned, as Julia FLOPS, LIFELESS, onto the boards. Cutter looks up at Angier, stricken. 
Angier takes Julia in his arms, looking down at her staring eyes. He desperately BRUSHES water from Julias cheeks and forehead. Borden looks on, shen. 
BORDEN (V.O.) How often I've fought with my self over that night .. one half of me swearing bling that i tied a simple slip knot... the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double. I suppose I'll never know for sure- 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY 
ALLEY Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people, but he would never talk about it. 
ANGIER I understand discretion. I just want the machine. 
Alley looks at Angier. Thinking. 
ALLEY Finish your drink. You'll have a special appreciation for our work. 
ANGIER I thought it was a secret. 
ALLEY 
(SMILES) You're a magician. Who's going to believe you? 
EXT. FIELDS, COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT 
The storm has abated. Angier's cane into the muddy ground as he follows Alley through the moonlit field. 
There are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if planted all around them. They stop in the middle of the field, looking down at the electric LIGHTS of the town. 
ALLEY We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone. 
Alley checks his wacth by the moonlight. 
ALLEY (CONT'D) Not long now. 
As they watch, the lights of Colorado Springs DISAPPEAR. 
ALLEY (CONT'D) Our equipment requires a great deal of current. Tesla eletrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need to. 
The field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT. Angier laughs out in surprise- the field is full of a thousand large LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together. Alley bends down and picks up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does, the light in it extinguises. He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the size, it's a normal lightbulb. 
ANGIER Where are the wires? 
ALLEY Exactly. 
Angier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random spot in the wet soil. The lightbulb FLICKERS on again. 
ANGIER Where's the generator? 
ALLEY You saw it last week. 
ANGIER But that must be ten miles from here. 
ALLEY Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed. (turns to leave) I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.Angier. 
Angier bends to pick up his lightbulb. As he does, the light FADES in all of them, and the lights in town come back on. Angier is alone. 
INT. BATHROOM, LONDON -- DAY 
Angier has his head SUBMERGED in a sink full of water. He BURSTS FREE, GASPING- COLLA`PSES to the floor, SOBBING. 
INT. BATHROOM -- LATER 
Angier lays out MAKE-UP SUPPLIES. He takes out a BULLE. Places it on the sink next to a FALSE MOUNSTAGE. 
EXT. PRINCE'S ARMS BAR AND THEATRE 
Rough. Unwelcoming. Crowded. A small "stage" at one end: Borden works his way through the Chinese rings. The crowd is JEERING. 
VOICE Get out your gun, Professor! 
Someone BURLS a bottle at the stage- it narrowly misses. Borden GLARES out into the audience. Pulls out his GUN. 
BORDEN A volunteer. 
The crowd SURGES forward with EAGER VOLUNTEERS. Fallon scans the crowd, passing over too-eager and too-drunk before settling on a MOUNSTACHED MAN and bringing him up onstage. 
Borden LOADS the pistol, hands it to Moustache and steps backwards, pulling his coat apart, CHALLENGING. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Are you man enought, sir? 
MOUSTACHE 
(QUIET) Yes. 
Something in Moustache's tone makes Borden looks closely- behind the moustache... Angier. QUIVERING WITH TENSION. 
Borden looks at the trembling gun. Then at Angier. Spreads his hands, inviting. 
BORDEN 
(SMILES) I think not. 
Angier purses his lips, straining to pull the trigger. 
INSERT CUT: JULIA'S FACE, SCREAMING BUBBLES... 
Angier's eyes are almost closed as he SQUEEZES the TRIGGER- 
Fallon HITS Angier JUMPS to Borden's side, GRABBING his BLEEDING HAND. The DROWS is SCREAMING, PUSHING for the door, os STRAINING for a closer look at Borden. 
Aniger, SHOCKED, melts into the crowd. 
INT. PUB -- DAY 
Angier sits at the bar. Staring. He raises his pint glass. Downs it, then STOPS, looking at the bottom- there is a PLAYING CARD. He loos around. Cutter is sitting at a table with two fresh pints in front of him. Angier heads over. 
ANGIER Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass. 
CUTTER Hasn't stopped you looking. 
(ANGIER SITS) I heard about a booking. Nice little theatre. Good up-and-coming magician. 
ANGIER Who? 
CUTTER You. 
CUTTER (holds up cage) Put your hands on the sides... 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY 
A heavy, disinterested man slouches in the third row of the empty theatre with a newspaper- MERRIT, the stage manager. Onstage, Angier energetically YANKS coloured handkerchiefs from a hat and TOSSING them into the air. Olivia, in the glamorous, revealing costume of Magician's Assistant, darts back and forth PLUCKING the handkerchiefs from the air. 
Angier finishes with a flourish. Merrit shrugs. Angier places an ORNATE CAGE onto the table. 
ANGIER I need a volunteer. 
Merrit rolls his eyes. Climbs to his feet. Angier produces a DOVE. Places it in the cage. 
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY 
Now Angier is wearing the harness. He places a dove in the cage and picks it up. 
Close on: HOOKS concealed on Angier's palm slip into CATCHES on the bars of the cage. 
CUTTER Hang on, hang on... 
Cutter reaches in and slips a NOOSE around the bird's ankle... 
CUTTER (CONT'D) There we go. Now you tell the volunteer to put his hands here... 
Cutter pleases his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the cage... 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT 
Merrit places his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the bird cage. Angier's hands are on the sides. Olivia reaches around Merrit to place her hands on the remaining two sides. Merrit looks up at Angier over his glasses. 
MERRIT You'd beat not be intending to hut this animal, Mr.Angier. 
ANGIER Of course not. 
Angier raises and lowers their hands in a rythm... 
ANGIER (CONT'D) And one, two... THREE! 
The bird cage, and the dove, VANISH. 
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY 
Angier and Cutter have their hands on the bird cage. 
ANGIER 
...THREE! 
The bird cage BREAKS APART, WHIPPING UP ANGIER'S FOREARMS. WHERE SLEEVES WOULD BE, YANKED BY THE HARNESS. Angier smiles. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) Bloody marvelous, Cutter. 
CUTTER And the best part... 
Cutter reaches to Angier's armpit... pulls up the DOVE, 
HANGING BY ITS ANKLE, ALIVE. 
ANGIER Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty. 
CUTTER Someday, perhaps you will. I needed to know that you can. 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY 
Merrit nods, impressed, stepping backwards. Angier REACHES into Merrit's pocket. Removes a dove. 
MERRIT Very nice. Very nice indeed. 
Olivia packs up the props. Cutter approaches from the wings. 
ANGIER 
(SMILING) I haven't had a chance to compliment you on your beautiful theatre yet, Mr.Merrit. 
MERRIT A lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr.Angier. 
ANGIER Don't worry. 
MERRIT You all say that. Why sould I worry? If your tricks don't get 'em in, someone else's will. Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape. 
CUTTER cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one, too. What would that do for your business? 
MERRIT 
(SHRUGS) You've got a week. 
EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING 
A line a PATRONS runs from the box office to the street. The marquee above the theatre reads: "THE GREAT DANTON PERFOMS 
FEATS OF MISTERY AND IMAGINATION" 
INT. THEATRE -- EVENING 
Angier is perfoming to a good crowd. He steps forward. 
ANGIER You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief? 
A MAN in the audience STANDS and pulls a HANDKERCHIEF from his pocket. He stares at it, CONFUSED. The audience LAUGHS. 
MAN This isn't mine. 
ANGIER Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours. 
Another man stands and pulls out a handkerchief. APPLAUSE. Angier dows and walks quickly off the stage, past the squad of DANCING GIRLS who run on to entertain in the break. 
INT. BACKSTAGE -- EVENING 
TICKET HAWKER Would you like to know the future, sir? The man who kill change the world is speaking right now. Continents divided no more. Free, clean power. The mysteries of the world solved. 
The posters show a tall, handsome man bathed in lightning and standing astride the world like colossus. In bold print 
IT SAYS: 
THE WONDERS OF "ALTERNATING CURRENT"...NIKOLA TESLA 
INT. AUDITORIUM, ALBERT HALL -- CONTINUOUS 
The hall is completely darkened, but bright blue FLASHES illuminate ANGIER as he pushes his way to a seat. 
On the stage, a tall rod capped with a steel ball is transmitting a steady, sparking stream of electricity onto a matched ball across the stage. 
A FIGURE walks around from behind the machine and the audience GASPS as a shower of sparks bounce off of his immaculate evening wear. This is TESLA- but Angier is too far from the stage to get a good look at him. 
TESLA With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years. 
The audience breaks into LAUGHTER. The spell is broken. Tesla must be a lunatic. 
TESLA (CONT'D) Mr. Edison's direct current system is flawed and dangerous. With my alternating current devices- 
Someone from the audience chimes in: 
AUDIENCE MEMBER 
(YELLS) Fraud. 
Angier turns to look. The man who called out is leaving he's not alone. Angier FREEZES, staring down at aisle- 
Borden is sitting there, RAPT, lit by FLASHES from the machinery on stage. As tesla continues his demonstration, Angier STARES at Borden. 
EXT. STREET -- DAY 
Borden walks down the street. Angier is following him. Borden meets Sarah, pushing a PRAM. Borden looks down at the baby then up at Sarah. 
BORDEN I love you. 
Sarah smiles. 
SARAH See? Today, it's true. 
Angier watches Borden kiss wife then his baby. 
ANGIER (V.O.) I saw hapiness... 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- NIGHT 
Angier writing in his leather-bound journal. 
ANGIER (V.O.) ...hapiness that should have been mine. But I was wrong. 
Angier glances at Borden's notebook sitting on the desk. 
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Reading his account I realize that he never had the life I envied. 
Angier flips open the notebook. Staring at the coded writing. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) The family life he craves one minute he rails against the next, demanding freedom. His mind is a divided one... 
INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY 
Borden sits on his cot. Reading Angier's journal. 
ANGIER (V.O.) His soul restless. His wife and child tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature... 
Borden is crying. He puts the journal down and jumps to his feet BANGING on the cell door. 
BORDEN Guard! Guard!! 
The viewing slot slides open. 
GUARD What do want, Professor? 
BORDEN Paper and pencil. Please. 
INT. PRISON LIBRARY, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY 
Te library is long and titled, with two long tables. It looks as if it used to be a latrine. 
Borden sits at a table. Writing on a stack of notepaper. His arms have been unbound, but long chains runs from his ellbows to where Sullen Gaurd sits smoking, craning his nek to read Borden's writing. 
SULLEN Let me see? 
Sullen SNATCHES up the papers. Borden makes no move to stop him. The top sheet is a sketch of a cabinet. 
SULLEN (CONT'D) I'm going to know all of the Professor's secrets. 
BORDEN 
(SMILING) Only if I teach you how to read. 
Sullen mashes the papers into a ball and drops them. 
SULLEN Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here- 
(TUGS CHAINS)) Have they? Or can't you open real locks, Professor? 
BORDEN Perhaps I'm just biding my time. Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my 
HAND- Borden produces a RUBBER BALL in front of Sullen's face. Sullen stares. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) -get you attention. Then quietly 
SAY- 
(WHISPERS) "are you wacthing closely"... perhaps say a magic word or two... then I'll be gone. Borden VANISHES the ball, but FUMBLES it, it drops to Borden's feet. Sullebn LAUGHS as Borden SCRABBLEs around his ankles to retrieve the ball. 
(SHAKES HEAD) It's not that simple. This is a complex illusion. 
CUTTER You think that because you don't know the method. It's a double who comes out at the end. It's the only way. 
ANGIER I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the 
SAME MAN- 
CUTTER 
IT'S NOT- 
ANGIER The same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you. 
OLIVIA It is the same man. They both turn to look at Olivia. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but if you look closely you can tell. Angier looks at Cutter. 
ANGIER He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do. 
CUTTER 
(NODS) It would give us our climax. 
ANGIER The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick. 
CUTTER We'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage. 
ANGIER He doesn't use a double- 
CUTTER 
(IMPACIENT) I don't know how Borden does it, Robert. So either you wait for Borden to retire and buy his secret, or you can listen to how I would do this trick. 
(ANGIER NODS) Ang the only way I know is to find you a bloody good double. 
Angier smiles. Turns to Olivia, pointing to his face. 
ANGIER Take a good look- let's get out there and find me. 
EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING 
Angier, swinging his cane, walks slowly up the mountain road. 
EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS 
The lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower. 
Angier stops, fearful. 
ALLEY It's perfectly safe. 
As Angier stares, a MAN begins to emerge from the very center of the CONFLAGRATION. 
Bolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks, in SILHOUETTE, towards Angier. 
TESLA So this is the Great Danton. 
Tesla emerges from the ball of electricity, dressed as if he were on his way to the opera. He brushes SPARKS from the sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier. 
TESLA (CONT'D) Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Something you did with pockets? 
Angier returns the handshake. 
ANGIER I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me. Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand. 
Angier, confused, does so. Alley hands him a lightbulb, which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) What's conducting the electricity? 
TESLA Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy. 
Tesla release Angier's hand. The bulb goes out. Alley takes it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands. 
TESLA (CONT'D) Have you eaten, Mr. Angier? 
EXT. DECK, LABORATORY -- MORNING 
Angier, Alley and Tesla are seated around a table on a decl overlooking a spectacular view. They are eating sandwiches. 
TESLA Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device. 
ANGIER I need something impossible. 
TESLA You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'? 
(MORE) 
TESLA (CONT'D) (off his look) It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. The only limits on scientific progress are these imposed by society. Tesla looks out at the mountains. 
TESLA (CONT'D) The first time I changed the world I was hailed as a visionary. The second time I was asked politely to retire. The world only tolerates one change at a time. And so here I am. (gestures at laboratory) Enjoying "retirement". (looking at Angier) Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive. Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table. 
TESLA (CONT'D) Alley says you are a stage magician. If a built you this device, you would be presenting it only as an illusion? 
ANGIER If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half. Tesla nods. Considering. 
TESLA Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine- 
ANGIER Price is not an object. 
TESLA Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost? 
ANGIER I'm noit sure I follow. 
TESLA I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice... 
(POINTED) Go home. Forget this thing. I can recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley could tell you, I myself an given to one now and then. It will not do you any good. 
Olivia looks at him strangely. 
OLIVIA You went and saw his show again? 
Angier looks away, embarrassed. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) You becoming obsessed, Robert. 
CUTTER (O.S.) Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Robert. 
Angier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door. 
INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Angier and Olivia sit in the front row. Cutter beckons Root onstage. He's been clened up and dressed in Angier's stage costume. he TRIPS on his way across the stage. 
ANGIER All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference. 
CUTTER A little faith, sir. Could you favor us with a perfomance. Mr. Root? 
Root picks himself up and dusts himself off. 
Suddenly, ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER. he is channeling everything from his facial expressions to his walk. Angier nods, starting to believe this might work. The illusion is PERFECT -- till he opens his mouth. 
ROOT You would drink, too, if you know the world half so well as I do. 
Angier hops up onto stage, examining Root from different angles. Root starts APING his every movement. Olivia starts laughing. Angier is getting uncomfortable. 
ROOT (CONT'D) Did you think you were unique, Mr. Angier? I have been Cassar. I have been Faust. How difficult could it possibly be to play 'The Great Danton?' 
CUTTER You can go back to being yourself. Root. For free.. Root looks challengingly at both men. 
ROOT I'd rather be him, for now. I find it amusing. Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia. 
CUTTER Root has to keep a low profile-- anyone sees him the game's up. 
ANGIER 
(WATCHING ROOT) I don't know how you do these things, Cutter. I'm not sure I want to know. 
CUTTER Have you thought about what we should call the trick? 
ANGIER No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'? Cutter nods. 
EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE -- EVENING 
The enormous MARQUEE of the Empire Theatre: 'The Great Danton perfoms THE NEW TRANSPORTED MAN' Beneath it, a CROWD. Fallon amongest them. STARING up at the sign. 
INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING 
Angier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses them to the crowd. APPLAUSE fills the theatre. 
The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage. Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor. 
ANGIER Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform. 
Angier puts on a TOP HAT. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) Alas, I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully- you will see no trickery, for no trickery is being employed. Merely a techique familiar to certain citizens of the orient and various holy men of the Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe... 
Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold. 
Then strolls through crossing the stage- 
-to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its solidity, then walking trough the frame. 
Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air. It sails back down to him and he catches it. 
Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear it's not coming back down. 
LAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped back down to him. He catches it. 
Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door- steps behind it... 
The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and 
ANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT. 
BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat. 
The AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS. 
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
Angier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards. 
Smiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING 
Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess. Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table. 
OLIVIA 
(TOAST) To our achivement. They drink. 
CUTTER The manager said he's never seen a reaction like it. Angier smiles, rueful. 
ANGIER At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side. 
OLIVIA I care about the man in the box. Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass. 
ANGIER Thank you. 
(TO CUTTER) Maybe we could switch before the trick. That way I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below stage. 
CUTTER 
ANGIER I don't understand- 
Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with CONCENTRARION. Alley pulls Angier away from the pit. 
ALLEY Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week? 
Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door. 
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY 
A small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools, cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills. Borden is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe. Fallon enters, Olivia behind him. Borden looks back at her, turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves. 
OLIVIA 
(LOOKING AROUND) Interesting workshop. 
BORDEN We make do. 
OLIVIA My name is Olivia Wenscombe. 
BORDEN I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show? Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the shop: "THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING 
NEW TRICK" 
OLIVIA No. I'm here to give your show what is missing. 
BORDEN And what might that be? 
OLIVIA Me. 
BORDEN 
(TO FALLON) Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard? A woman's touch. Fallon leaves, closing the door. 
OLIVIA I've left Angier. I want a job. Borden sits there. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) I know you have no reason to trust 
ME- 
BORDEN Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy. 
Olivia is taken aback. Chanes tack. 
OLIVIA Mr.Borden- 
BORDEN Alfred. 
OLIVIA Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth. 
BORDEN Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe. 
OLIVIA I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret. 
BORDEN What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk. 
Borden rises, moves closer to Olivia. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage? 
Olivia meets his gaze. 
OLIVIA No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his. 
BORDEN He has no secrets from me. 
Borden stares at her, unsure. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) And this is the truth? 
She gives Borden a challenging smile/shrug. 
INT. BACKSTAGE -- DAY 
Cutter is fixing a prop mechanism. Angier approaches, in his undershirt, looks over his shoulder. Cutter glances up. 
CUTTER Best be getting changed for the martinee, sir. - Angier nods. Cutter REALIZES. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) ROOT! You're late. 
(SNIFFS) And even more drunk than usual. Get yourself below stairs, right away! 
ROOT No. 
CUTTER No?! Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice. 
ROOT We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- DAY 
Angier is applying his makeup. Cutter enters. Angier looks at him through the mirror. 
ANGIER We have a problem, Cutter. He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement: 
PANTAGES THEATRE- FROM NEXT WEEK- THE PROFESSOR WILL 
DEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN- ACCEPT NO CHEAP 
IMITATIONS!!! 
ANGIER (CONT'D) He'll be perfoming right across the street. 
CUTTER We have a bigger problem. Root. 
ANGIER Don't tell me he fell over again. 
CUTTER Worse. He realized he can make demands. 
Angier takes his time, confident, MILKING IT. He throws his HAT into the air, catches it. 
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
Angier DROPS ten feet to the concrete floor. But there is NOTHING to break his fall- 
He SMASHES painfully to the ground. CLUTCHING his leg in AGONY, he looks up and sees SOMEONE standing on the lift twenty feet away... BORDEN. 
INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
The first door slams shut. The audience turns their attention to second door. 
The door remains closed. The HAT falls gently to the floor. SILENCE, broken by a COUGH in the audience. 
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
BORDEN bows to Angier- the LIFT ROCKETS BORDEN UP THROUGH 
THE STAGE FLOOR. 
INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
The second door OPENS, and BORDEN steps through, looking all around, CONFUSED, as if he doesn't know where he is. He looks back at the door, then picks up the HAT... 
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
Angier looks at his leg- a nasty COMPOUND FRACTURE. As he chokes on pain he can hear LAUGHTER from the AUDIENCE. 
INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
As Borden mugs with the hat, trying it on and finding it too small, something is LOWERED from the flies above: 
ANGIER/ROOT, BOUND AND GAGGED, HANGS from a chain. A sign around his neck reads: "OPENING AT PANTAGE- THE PROFESSOR" 
Borden looks up behind him. 
BORDEN Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages! 
The Great Danton comes to rest three feet above the stage. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Pardon my intrusion! 
Borden places the top hat and ANGIER/ROOT at a JAUNTY ANGLE. 
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. Borden BOWS, hops down off the stage, and walks up the aisle, bowing, enjoying it all the way. 
INT. STAGE -- LATER 
Cutter crouches over Angier, fixing a LONG SPLINT to his broken leg. Behind them, Root still hangs above the stage, groaning in protest. 
CUTTER I don't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps, I was careful. 
ANGIER Well, he did. 
Cutter helps Angier to his feet. 
CUTTER Sit, do you think it might be her? Olivia? 
Angier stops to look at Cutter. 
ANGIER No. I don't. 
Cutter gestures at Root. 
CUTTER Shall we cut him down? 
ANGIER He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down. 
EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT 
Angier, thinly disguised, leg in long metal brace, pushes through the crowd outside the box office. The marquee: The Professor Performs His Masterpiece- THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED 
MAN!! 
On the box office: SOLD OUT THRU SUNDAY. Angier STARES. 
SCALPER (O.S.) Need tickets, sir? 
Angier turns to the SCALPER. Nods. 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING 
Angier slumps into a seat at the back of the PACKED theatre. 
ONSTAGE: Borden works through his show with a SUPERIOR DEGREE OF SHOWMANSHIP, even cracking a smile when called for. Working WITHOUT GLOVES, he makes much of performing tricks ONE-HANDED. He is assisted by Olivia, who looks STUNNING. 
Borden performs ths Transported Man. Borden HAS DRESSED IT UP WITH ELECTRICAL APPARATUS. Two large glass balls transmit SPARKS between one cabinet and the other along BARE WIRES. 
Another watches, anger rising as he watches Olivia's close RAPPORT with Borden. 
INT. APARTAMENT -- EVENING 
Olivia enters in to the darkness bedroom. She strikes a match and lights one of the gaslights... 
...and SCREAMS as the gaslight illuminates Angier, sitting in an armchair, cane leaning against the arm of the chair. 
ANGIER You weren't expecting me? 
OLIVIA I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said "afternoon". 
ANGIER Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days... 
Angier RAPS his leg brace with his cane. HOISTS himself up. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career... now you. 
OLIVIA What do you mean? You sent me to- 
ANGIER Then I know how hard this had been hard for you. 
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY 
CLOSE ON: SHATTERED GLASS, BROKEN PROPS AND CABINETRY. Borden and Fallon survey the WRECKAGE of their shop. Borden looks at Fallon. 
BORDEN Notebook. Fallon nods. Borden sighs. Weary. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Then he's just getting started. 
EXT. STAGEDOOR, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING 
A small CROWD of autograph SEEKERS crowd the stagedoor. A BODYGUARD steps through the door and begins unshering them away as Fallon and Borden follow him through the door. The bodyguard hold the door to a carriage open and Fallon steps up. Borden stops at the door. 
BORDEN I'm walking tonight, gentlemen. Fallon looks concerned. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Let him come. I don't care. Borden doffs his hat and walks onto the crowd street. Fallon steps down, reaches into the bodyguard's jacket and pulls out a PISTOL. He checks that it's loaded and slips it into his own jacket. Then he sets off after Borden. 
EXT. STREETS, WEST END -- EVENING 
Fallon continues to follow Borden at a distance. Borden steps into a tobacconist's. Fallon stops and idles at the street corner. As Fallon watches, acrooss the street, another man STOPS. Fallon slips back around the corner and looks: 
It's Angier, leaning on his cane. 
Borden emerges from the tobacconist and continues down the street, a cloud of pipe smoke drifting after him. 
Fallon waits for Angier to set off after Borden, then follows both men from a distance. 
Borden crosses to the same side of the street as Angier. Fallon picks up his pace and tries to cross the street but is HELD UP for a second by passing traffi. 
As he reaches the other side, Borden is gone, but he sees Angier dissappear down and alleyway. 
EXT. ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS 
Fallon rounds the cornder and stops. The alleyway is EMPTY. -- he has lost them. Finally, he sees an open, darkned doorway towards the end of the alleyway. 
INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS 
Fallon stops at the doorway, his gloved hand gripping te doorframe. 
Angier stands at the other end of the hallway, watching him. 
Fallon takes a step towards him and CRASHES through the rotten floor to the basement below. 
INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS 
Fallon drops heavily into an almost-vertical OPEN COFFIN. 
DISORIENTED, Fallon just glimpses CUTTER DROP THE LID INTO PLACE, shutting him in. Cutter starts NAILING it down. 
A GUNSHOT TEARS through the lid of the box. Cutter falls back, but is caught by Angier. 
Angier rolls Cutter off to one side. He is clutching at a BLOODY WOUND on his arm. 
CUTTER I'll live. 
(TO COFFIN) You save me the trouble to making you an air hole! 
Angie picks up the hammer and continues NAILING. 
EXT. HIGHGATE CEMETARY -- MORNING 
Borden picks up his way through the overgrown cemetary. He hears a KNOCKING and turns: 
Angier is behind him, RAPPING on a broken headstone with the head of his cane. 
BORDEN I'm impressed. 
ANGIER Why's that? 
BORDEN You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice. 
ANGIER The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want. 
BORDEN Which is? 
ANGIER Your secret. 
Borden tries to gauge Angier's expression. 
BORDEN My secret? 
ANGIER Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all. 
BORDEN 
(SHRUGS) You have my notebook. 
ANGIER Useless without the keyword. 
Angier pulls a sheaf of writing paper and a pencil stub from his pocket. He offers them to Borden. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) Write down your method Mr. Borden. Describe it in full. 
Borden takes the paper and pencil and stares Angier in the eye, gauging him. 
Beat. 
Borden writes a SINGLE WORD on the top page and folds it up. 
ANGIER (CONT'D) I want the method not the keyword- I don't even know if the secret is in you notebook. 
Borden looks at Angier with a glint in his eye. 
BORDEN The keyword is the method. 
Angier reaches for the folded paper, which Borden lifts out of reach. 
LIGHT... 
WHITE SCEEN- 
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) But here, at the Turn, I must leave you, Borden... 
The WHITS becomes handwriting an a page and we are- 
INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY 
Borden STARES at Angier's journal in disbelief. 
ANGIER Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting your death. For my murder. 
Borden SLAMS the journal shut. Staring at it. 
EXT. PRISON CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY 
BORDEN stands at the fence again. 
OWENS Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you'd reconsidered his offer. 
BORDEN Angier's journal, the "gesture of good faith"? It's a fake. 
OWENS 
(SURPRISED) I assure you it's not. 
BORDEN It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death. 
OWENS Clever predictions, I'm sure. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. It's written in Angier own hand, of which we have numerous examples. (looks at Borden) What makes you think it's a fake? 
Borden looks away, uncomfortable. 
BORDEN It doesn't matter. 
Borden leans forward and stuffs ROLLED PAPERS through the fence. Owens takes them carefully. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) My tricks. All of them. 
OWENS Including the Transported Man? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased. 
BORDEN No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each. 
Owens leafs through the papers, annoyed. 
OWENS Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless. 
BORDEN You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here. 
Owens looks at Borden. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) I want to say goodbye. 
INT. BORDEN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Jess sits at the foot of the stairs, listening to her parents SHOUT at each other in the living room. She is CRYING. 
BORDEN (O.S.) Stop it! Just stop it! 
SARAH Deny it all you want- I know! 
INT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
Sarah is WILD, eyes red, hair a mess. Utterly DISTRAUGHT Borden is trying to calm her. 
BORDEN Sarah, it's not true! I've told you Olivia means nothing to me! 
SARAH I'll go yo her! I know what you really are, Alfred! 
BORDEN 
(QUIETLY FIRM) Sarah. You can't do that. 
INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
Jess looks up. Fallon is standing above her. Listening. 
SARAH (O.S.) I'll do what I have to! 
Jess reaches up a hand. Fallon takes it in his. 
BORDEN (O.S.) Sarah, you can't talk like this! 
INT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
Sarah turn to face Borden. Deperate. 
SARAH I can't live like this! 
BORDEN 
(ANGRY) What do you want from me! Sarah pauses. Catches her breath. 
SARAH 
(QUIET) I want you to be honest with me. No tricks, no lies, no secrets. Borden calms. Looks into her eyes. Nods. 
SARAH (CONT'D) Do you love me? Borden looks into her eyes. Sincere. 
BORDEN Not today. Sarah takes this in. Borden watches, helpless. 
SARAH 
(WHISPERS) Thank you. Borden watches her turn away from him. 
INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
ANGIER IS STANDING DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM. 
Ackerman is dumfounded. He looks back down at the stage. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) (quiet, haunted) Pardon me. It's very rare to see... real magic. it's been many years since I've seen... 
Anckerman steadies himself; 
ANGIER Are you interested in helping us? 
ACKERMAN 
(NODS) Yes. But you'll have to dress it up a little. Disguise it. Give them enough reason to doubt it. 
INT. STAGE MANAGER'S OFFICE, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY 
Merrit sits eating a sandwich. The door to his office opens and ACKERMAN strides in. Merrit STRUGGLES to his feet. 
MERRIT 
(SURPRISED) Mr. Ackerman. When they said...I didn't think you'd be here in person. Ackerman sits without being asked to. 
ACKERMAN I have an act for your venue. 
MERRIT 
(FLUSTERED) Well, of course, sir...But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet. They're playing through next year. 
ACKERMAN Get rid of them. This is a magical act. An excellent one. I believe you booked his first engagement several years ago. The Great Danton. 
MERRIT You really want me to- Ackerman stands. 
MERRIT (CONT'D) I'll do it. Of course. Ackerman picks up a pen and paper from Merrit's desk. 
ACKERMAN 
(SMILES) There will be one hundred performances. No more, no less. Five perfomances a week. No matinees, no weekends. Ackerman scribbles onto the paper and hands it to Merrit. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) 
(SMILES) And that's what you'll be charging for each ticket. Good day. Ackerman sweeps out of the room, leaving Merrit dumbfounded, staring at the scrap of paper in his hands. 
INT. RESTAURANT -- EVENING 
Olivia and Borden are seated across from each other, finishing their meal. Olivia watches Borden eat. 
OLIVIA You haven't spopken about her, Freddy. Not once. 
BORDEN Who? 
OLIVIA Don't be cruel. 
BORDEN Why would I talk about her to you? 
OLIVIA Because she was part of your life and now she's gone. 
Borden says nothing. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) She wanted to meet me the day before she killed herself. Said she had something to tell me about you. 
(LOOKS AWAY) I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her. (looks at Borden) What would she have said, I wonder? 
BORDEN 
(SNAPS) You want the truth about me, Olivia? (she nods, wary) I never loved Sarah. 
OLIVIA 
(APPALLED) You married her, had a child with 
HER- 
BORDEN Part of me loved her. But part of me didn't. The part that found you. The part that's sitting here now. I love you. That is the truth that matters. 
Olivia tosses her napkin on her plate. 
OLIVIA You could be sitting in some other restaurant talking to some other woman about me that way. It's unhuman to be so cold. 
Borden watches her rise from the table. She looks at him. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) By the way, have you seen who's opened at the Pantages? (Borden shakes head) The Great Danton. 
BORDEN He's back? 
OLIVIA After two years. And he has a new trick. They're saying it's the best that London's ever seen. 
Borden cannot hide his reaction. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) If you could see the look on your face, Professor. You should go to him- you deserve each other. Olivia smiles at him and leaves. 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING 
Borden, in disguise, takes his seat halfway along the aisle. 
The lights dim. Curtains RISE on a simple stage. Bare except for a WATER-FILLED GLASS TANK. 
Borden STIFFENS in his seat, perplexed. 
Angier limps onto the stage. Addresses the audience. 
ANGIER Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk. (removes his coat) Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now, for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it, you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved. 
Borden watches the hook descend from the flies. Remembering. 
INSERT CUT: Borden STARES as Angier desperately BRUSHES the water from Julia's face. 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- LATER 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT 
Angier, facing the audience, steps backwards into the machine. He looks up at the electricity sparking just above him. 
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
Borden lights a MATCH. In front of him is a LARGE GLASS TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITS LID PROPPED OPEN. Borden frowns. 
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
BOLTS of electricity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball of LIGHTING which CRACKS- 
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS 
The ROOM fills with lIGHT as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a BODY DROPS INTO THE TANK. The lid of the tank and trapdoor above SNAP SHUT, leaving the tank, and Borden, in complete

Borden the tank, ANGIER IS DROWING. His rolling EYES fixed on Borden, he POUNDS desperetely on the thick glass, SCREAMING 
BUBBLES... 
Borden, HORROFIED, tries forcing the lif ot the tank open. It's sealed shut. He leaves the tank and begins searching around under the stage. He finds a SPANNER. 
Borden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank, which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY. 
WATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into Borden, and both of them onto gournd. Above them we can hear YELLING. Borden rolls Angier onto his side and POUNDS on his back. Water and blood OOZE from the man's lungs. His eyes are dilated and lifeless: 
ANGIER IS DEAD. 
Borden is frozen, unable to move. 
Cutter appears behind him, SHOCKED by what he sees. Borden turns to look at him, his eyes wild with confusion. 
CUTTER What did you do?

A POLICEMAN shows Owens into the room, walking him past all of the equipment to the far end where Cutter stands staring at the MACHINE'S CRATE. 
OWENS Mr.Cutter? 
(CUTTER TURNS) Owens. 
They shake hands. 
CUTTER Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens. It's fallen to me to dispose of Mr.Angier's equipment. Looking at the manifest, it's cleat that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items. 
OWENS Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just- 
CUTTER It's not just that, Mr.Owens. There is a particular item (turns to crate) This time, in fact, that I wish to... well, that is to say, I want to- 
OWENS You wnat to buy it instead. 
CUTTER I suppose so, yes. 
Owens moves closer to the crate. Sees the COLORADO SPRINGS stencil. 
OWENS This is the machine? 
(OFF LOOK) I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about procuring this particular item. 
CUTTER Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord Caldlow in person. 
OWENS Out of the question, I'm afraid. 
Cutter nods. Owens starts to walk away. Turns. 
OWENS (CONT'D) of course, I suppose... if, in the course of your delivery arrangements your paths were to cross... I can't stop you from speaking your mind. 
Cutter nods.

ANGIER 
(SHRUGS) I learned an American accent from- 
CUTTER 
(ANGRY) How are you alive, Robert?! I saw you on the slab, for God's sake. 
Angier fixes Cutter with a steady gaze. 
ANGIER I magician never reveals his secrets. 
The Housekeeper appears with Jess at her side. 
HOUSEKEEPER Go on, child. 
Angier smiles kindly at her. 
ANGIER Good night, Jess. 
They leave. 
CUTTER Who's the girl? 
Angier says nothing. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) I've seen her. I've seen her in court with Fallon... 
Cutter, realizing, looks at Angier, SHOCKED. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) 
(QUIET) What have you done? 
ANGIER She needs looking after- 
CUTTER She needs her father, but you're letting him hang. And I helped you. 
Cutter moves to the door. In a daze. Pauses. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) I came here tonight to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine. But I won't beg you for anything. 
ANGIER You don't have to. I'm going to make sure the machine. is never used again. 
(SHRUGS) A good magician never repeats his tricks. 
Cutter considers this. Makes a decision. 
CUTTER Then, Lord Caldlow, where would like me to deliver it? 
ANGIER My theatre. It belongs with the Prestige materials. 
Cutter lookd at Angier. Sad. 
CUTTER I once told you about the sailor who described drowing to me...

Cutter opens the door. Angier watches him go. 
EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING 
Borden is at the fence. Fallon is on the other side. 
BORDEN We go alone now- both of us. Only I don't have as far to go as you. 
Borden looks down at his feet. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) You were right. I should've left him to his damned trick... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for so many things. For Sarah. I didn't want to hurt her. 
Fallon wipes tears from his face. Borden looks at him. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Don't cry. Not for me. Go live your life in full. For both of us. 
Borden pulls the RUBBER BALL from his pocket and BOUNCES it up and down. He TURNS to be led back into the prison, DROPPING the ball. 
The ball bounces gently past the fence. Fallon catches it. 
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING

The procession stops at a large windowless metal door, sunk deep into the wall. Sullen opens the door and Borden is led inside. As Borden passes Sullen he leans in to his ear-

He checks the placemen of the chisel against his own mutilated fingers, adjust the chisel's position, them picks up the hammer.

Borden stares at his mutilated hand clasping the rubber ball. 
ANGIER What about Olivia? And your wife? 
BORDEN We each loved one of them. We each had half a full life. Enough for us, but not for them. Borden puts the ball in his pocket. Tears in his eyes. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price of a good trick. Borden looks down at Angier with contempt. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Angier is dying. He opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is so wak that Borden has to stoop to hear him. 
ANGIER 
(VERY QUIET) I've made sacrificies. 
BORDEN It takes nothing to steal someone else's work. 
ANGIER It takes everything.

Angier stands in front of Tesla's machine. Loading the pistol. He places the pistol by the machine... Angier takes off his jacket and steps towards the HISSING machine. BOTLS curl themselves around him. 
ANGIER HURLS HIMSELF INTO THE LIGHT. 
This time we do not cut away. 
The machine sputters out. 
ANGIER IS STILL STANDING BENEATH IT. 
ANGIER 
(CONFUSED) It didn't work. 
VOICE (V.O.) Yes it did. 
Angier turns... 
ANOTHER ANGIER is standing on the chalk hashmark, STEAM rising off his shoulders. 
The first Angier lunges for the pistol and levels it at the second Angier. 
SECOND ANGIER 
(HORRIFIED) No, wait! I'm the-

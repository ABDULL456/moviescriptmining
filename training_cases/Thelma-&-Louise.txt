"THELMA & LOUISE"

Callie Khouri 
Final shooting script 
JUNE 5, 1990 
FADE IN: 
INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY) 
LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early- thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with. 
INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left from last night's dinner which had to "soak".  She is still in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g. 
From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it- yourself" attempt by Thelma. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING 
Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number. 
INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
Phone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it. 
THELMA (hollering) I got it!   Hello. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING 
LOUISE (at pay phone) I hope you're packed, little housewife, 'cause we are outta her tonight. 
INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
THELMA Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go. 
LOUISE (V.O.) You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown. 
Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook Pork." 
THELMA He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work? 
LOUISE (V.O.) No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion. 
THELMA I'll call you right back. 
Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister. 
THELMA Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry up. 
DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry.  He manages a Carpeteria. 
DARRYL Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning. 
THELMA I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late. 
Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and 
it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. 
He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair.  Thelma watches approvingly. 
THELMA Hon. 
DARRYL What. 
THELMA (she decides not to tell him) Have a good day at work today. 
DARRYL Uh-huh. 
THELMA Hon? 
DARRYL What?! 
THELMA You want anything special for dinner? 
DARRYL No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are. 
THELMA Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend. 
DARRYL Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am. 
He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek. 
They are driving down the interstate.  Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun. 
THELMA Louise, will you take care of the gun? 
Louise shrieks at the sight of it. 
LOUISE Why in hell did you bring that? 
Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive. 
THELMA Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers, bears... snakes!  I just don't know how to use it.  So will you take care of it? 
Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse and holds it in her hand.  She tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat.  Thelma puts the bullets under the seat. 
They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring. Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC. 
THELMA Whose place is this again? 
LOUISE It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys. 
THELMA I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl. 
LOUISE How come he let you go? 
THELMA 'Cause I didn't ask him. 
LOUISE Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you. 
THELMA Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what. 
They are both silent for a minute. 
THELMA (looking straight ahead) I left him a note.  I left him stuff to microwave. 
After a pause. 
THELMA I guess you haven't heard anything from Jimmy... yet? 
Louise's jaw tightens.  The car speeds up. 
THELMA ...never mind. 
A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway and HONKS.  The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women.  There is a bumper sticker on the back that says: "Lick you all over -- ten cents." 
LOUISE One of your friends? 
Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to smoke a cigarette. 
THELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads "See you in church on Sunday!" 
Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out. Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything. 
INT.  CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 
THELMA How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry. 
LOUISE Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month. 
THELMA I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes... 
LOUISE We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma. 
THELMA Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this. 
Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in. 
LOUISE Alright, but it's gonna be a quick stop. 
EXT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT 
They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon.  It's called the SILVER BULLET.  The sign flashes COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD.  There is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars.  Even though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night spot.  It's already pretty crowded. 
INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT 
This place is jumpin'.  There are ten pool tables with crowds all around.  The long bar is filled with customers. 
There are tables and booths.  The room is dense with smoke. There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up.  There are a lot of single men.  Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an empty table. 
LOUISE I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas. 
THELMA Isn't this fun? 
A WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table. 
WAITRESS Y'all wanna drink? 
LOUISE No thanks. 
THELMA I'll have Wild Turkey straight up and a Coke back, please. 
LOUISE Exactly. 
THELMA In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some! 
She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune. 
Practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance floor.  Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass, too. 
LATER 
Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while. Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.  Thelma is breathless, drunk and giggly.  She holds a beer bottle in one hand.  She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan is studying her closely.  Louise notices this. 
LOUISE (over the noise) Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road. 
THELMA (eyes closed, swaying with the music) Ready when you are. 
Louise heads off to the bathroom. 
THELMA (eyes still closed) Louise, I'm gonna come with you. (she gets a funny look on her face) I don't feel so good. 
She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle. 
Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her. 
HARLAN (catching Thelma, copping feels) Oopsy-doopsy.  We need to get you some fresh air, little lady. 
He steers her towards the door. 
Louise leans against the wall, waiting in line. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot. She is pretty limp. 
THELMA Oh shit. 
HARLAN What's wrong? 
THELMA Stop. 
HARLAN What for? 
THELMA I'm spinning. 
INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT 
The Waitress is going over to their table.  She picks up Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair. 
She sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she can see them and walks away. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Louise goes into the bathroom.  She stands in front of the sink and looks at herself in the mirror. 
EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Thelma has been sick.  She has Harlan's handkerchief and is wiping her mouth.  Harlan has backed off for this part, but he's right back in there. 
HARLAN How you feelin' now, darlin'? 
Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her head away. 
THELMA I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better. 
HARLAN Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too. 
He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her. Thelma pulls away. 
THELMA (uncomfortable) I think I need to keep walking. 
INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT 
Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in. She scans the room looking for Thelma.  She doesn't see her. She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there. She picks up the check and looks at it. 
EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot. He is trying to kiss her now.  He is pushing her arms down and turning her head away. 
THELMA Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick. 
HARLAN It's okay.  I'm married, too. 
Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning to push him away harder. 
INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT 
Louise is paying the Waitress.  The Waitress is shaking her head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either. 
They get onto the interstate going west. 
TRAVELING SHOT FROM BEHIND -- VARIOUS DRIVING SHOTS 
INT.  CAR - NIGHT 
Louise picks up the handkerchief from the car seat and wipes the gun off.  Her movements are as if in slow motion.  She puts the gun under the seat.  Thelma is watching her. 
THELMA Louise. 
Louise does not answer. 
THELMA Louise.  Where are we going? 
LOUISE (shaking) I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think. 
Thelma starts to cry quietly. 
THELMA Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police. 
LOUISE Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them? 
THELMA I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened. 
LOUISE Which part? 
THELMA All of it.  That he tried to rape me. 
LOUISE Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over! 
EXT.  INTERSTATE - NIGHT 
Thelma pulls off to the side of the road.  Louise gets out and starts to walk around the car.  She stops when she gets to the back of the car, and she is sick.  Thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side.  Louise gets in the driver's side. 
THELMA Louise... Are you alright? 
Louise rests her head on the steering wheel. 
LOUISE Oh Christ. (to Thelma) Thelma. 
Thelma doesn't hear. 
LOUISE Thelma. 
Thelma looks at her blankly, without answering. 
LOUISE I've gotta stop for a minute.  I've got to get it together.  I'm gonna find a place to get a cup of coffee and I'm gonna sit down for a second. Do you want to come? 
Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly.  Louise studies Thelma's face. 
LOUISE Is that yes?  Are you up to this? 
Again, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod.  Louise puts the car in gear and pulls OUT OF SHOT. 
EXT.  TRUCK STOP - RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The green '66 T-Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks. Louise turns to Thelma. 
LOUISE We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means? 
THELMA Yes. 
LOUISE It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that? 
Again, she twitches more than nods. 
LOUISE Tell me you understand that. 
Thelma nods more firmly now.  She understands. 
VARIOUS POV SHOTS of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee shop.  They look small and incongruous with the surroundings. 
INT.  TRUCK STOP - TIGHT SHOT - WAITRESS' HANDS - 4 A.M. 
slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter.  REVEAL Louise and Thelma sitting at the counter.  Louise is looking at a map.  The car is parked outside, near the door. 
LOUISE (halfway to herself) We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move. 
THELMA Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun. 
LOUISE If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now. 
THELMA Just what is that supposed to mean? 
LOUISE It means shut up, Thelma. 
THELMA So this is all my fault, is it. 
Louise looks at Thelma for a long time. 
As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her hands.  Thelma's not that good at handling money. 
THELMA Umm.  Shit.  Forty-four dollars. 
Louise has not noticed any of this.  She is so intent on her driving. 
THELMA I'm cash poor. 
LOUISE Hmmm.  We gotta get some money. 
EXT.  MOTEL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY 
The motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops. 
INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY (6 A.M.) 
The curtains are open and we can see the car parked right outside the room.  Thelma is lying on the bed staring up at the ceiling.  Louise is bustling around the room, putting things in drawers. 
THELMA Why are you unpacking?  You said we were just gonna take a nap. 
Louise did not realize she was doing it. 
LOUISE Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do. 
THELMA Well, when you figure it out, wake me up. 
LOUISE Just what the hell is wrong with you? 
Louise slams the closet door.  Thelma jumps. 
THELMA What do you mean? 
LOUISE Why are you actin' like this? 
THELMA Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off! 
They are silent for a moment. 
LOUISE You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me. 
THELMA I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas. 
LOUISE Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ.  I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out... 
THELMA Give me the keys. 
LOUISE You're not touchin' that car. 
THELMA My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people. 
LOUISE Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it. 
INT.  POLICE GARAGE - DAY 
Hal is at the police station where they're dusting the car with Harlan all over it for prints.  Hal looks closely at the back of the car.  He holds his hands over two sets of hand prints.  He moves his hands to the outside of the prints so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car.  His face is one inch away from the trunk.  He sees a very clear drop of blood.  It's different than any of the other blood splatters on the car.  He calls the identification technician over and points it out. 
HAL (pointing) What's that? 
The I.D. TECH comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders. 
I.D. TECH Blood? 
HAL Whose? 
I.D. TECH His, I guess... 
Hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache. 
He stares at the guy. 
HAL You guess? 
Hal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the area of the black smudge and the drop of blood.  He shakes his head slightly. 
EXT.  MOTEL - DAY 
Thelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool. 
She stops, then decides to go on to the pool.  She lies down in a lounge chair facing the road. 
INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Louise in the motel room.  She's looking at the phone.  She picks it up and dials it and watches herself in the mirror. She stares as if she's trying to see into herself, see through herself. 
EXT.  MOTEL POOL - DAY 
Thelma arranges herself in a lounge chair, trying desperately to feel like she's on vacation. 
INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Louise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY 
THELMA Honey? 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Darryl in the den of their house.  The room is a mess. 
There are beer cans everywhere.  The large screen TV is ON, showing a FOOTBALL GAME.  Darryl is in a recliner.  He is wearing loud shorts, a V-necked T-shirt, and a couple of necklaces and bracelets. 
DARRYL Goddamnit, Thelma, where in the Sam Hill are you?! 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY 
THELMA I'm... I'm with Louise.  We're in the mountains, we're... 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
DARRYL (interrupting) What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Have you lost your goddamn mind?!  Is that it?  I leave for work and you take complete leave of your senses? 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY 
THELMA Darryl... baby... Darryl, calm down now, honey.  Please don't get so mad.  I can explain... 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game. 
DARRYL Hold on.  Hold on a minute, damnit. 
He covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where "his team" fumbles the ball.  This only makes him madder.  He puts the phone back to his ear in time to hear Thelma say: 
THELMA (V.O.) ...only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night. 
DARRYL No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me? 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY 
Thelma is trying not to cry.  She's trying to be strong. 
THELMA Darryl, please... You're my husband, not my father, Darryl. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
DARRYL (interrupting) That does it!  That Louise is nothin' but a bad influence.  If you're not back here tonight, Goddamnit, Thelma... well, I just don't wanna say... 
Neither one of them say anything for a moment. 
DARRYL Thelma? 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY 
THELMA Darryl. 
DARRYL (V.O.) What? 
THELMA Go fuck yourself. 
She hangs up on him. 
EXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY 
Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car.  So she makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see. 
Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision. 
HITCHHIKER Whoa!  Excuse me!  Miss, are you alright? 
Thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue.  Her crying is silent. 
HITCHHIKER Is there anything I can do? 
Thelma shakes her head "no." She tries to control her tears. She notices how blue his eyes are. 
THELMA No.  Thanks.  Sorry. 
THELMA 
collects herself as she walks back to the car.  She gets in and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror.  In the mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the side of the building.  He is several feet behind the car, and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and stuffs it into his duffel bag.  Now he is just in T-shirt and jeans.  He looks good.  Really good.  She watches in the mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road. She can see him as he's walking.  He stops.  He's thinking. He heads over to the car. 
HITCHHIKER Would you mind me asking which direction you and your friend are going?  I'm trying to get back to school and my ride fell through, so I'm kinda stuck.  Are you going my way? 
Thelma doesn't know what to do. 
THELMA Umm.  I think we're going to Oklahoma City.  But I'm not sure. 
HITCHHIKER Do you think you could... I mean, I could help pay for gas. 
A MAN comes up behind Louise and stands close behind her. 
MAN (JIMMY) Did you say Peaches?!  Why that's the secret word!  Show her what she's won, Don. 
He drops an envelope in front of her.  Louise is startled and turns around quickly. 
JIMMY Hey, peaches. 
LOUISE Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here? 
JIMMY (to Woman) Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card. 
The Woman hands them a key. 
WOMAN 'Round to the back. 
EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Louise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very close to J.D.  Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat to the other side of the car.  She tries to look nonchalant. 
THELMA Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here? 
JIMMY Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. 
THELMA Good answer.  Same goes double for me. 
JIMMY Who's your friend? 
J.D. is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable. 
THELMA This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here. Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go.  And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.? 
J.D. Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care. 
He quickly turns and walks away toward the road. 
THELMA (watching him) Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go. 
LOUISE (to Jimmy) Thelma kinda took to him. 
Jimmy is smiling. 
JIMMY (to Thelma) Well, come on, gal, I got you a room. You can go on in and take a nice cold shower. 
THELMA Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman. 
JIMMY I always knew that. 
THELMA A regular outlaw. 
Louise shoots Thelma a look.  The three of them drive around to the back of the motel.  Thelma turns and looks at the road.  J.D. is standing there.  He blows her a kiss. 
EXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
They stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them climb out of the car. 
LOUISE Let me just go in and freshen up for a minute.  I need to wash my face, you know. 
Thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk. 
JIMMY Okay, honey.  I don't want to rush you.  I just wanna talk to you and... (whispering) ...be alone with you.  I'll just be in my room, 115, you just come on down when you're ready. 
Jimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room.  He stops at the door. 
JIMMY I'll be waiting. 
Louise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe he's acting this way.  He turns on his heel and slinks away. 
THELMA I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad. 
LOUISE He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away. 
THELMA I heard that. 
INT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
They close the door to their room.  Louise sets the envelope of money on the table. 
LOUISE (indicating envelope) Our future. 
Louise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup. 
She stands very close to the mirror.  She is putting on lip liner.  Thelma is watching. 
THELMA So what are you gonna tell him? 
LOUISE Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is. 
THELMA You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man. 
JIMMY Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble. 
Louise just looks at him for a minute. 
LOUISE Jimmy, I'm not gonna tell ya what the trouble is.  Someday soon you'll understand why I can't.  But I won't tell ya, so don't ask me. 
Jimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is. 
JIMMY (almost at a loss for words) Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing? 
LOUISE Maybe. 
JIMMY Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him? 
LOUISE It's nothin' like that. 
JIMMY (exploding) Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise! Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever? What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?! 
Louise spills her champagne. 
LOUISE Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'! 
JIMMY (calming down) Alright, alright.  I'm sorry. 
They both take a second to regain their composure. 
JIMMY Can I just ask you one other thing? 
LOUISE Maybe. 
Jimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket. 
JIMMY Will you wear this? 
He hands Louise the box.  She opens it and it is a diamond ring.  Louise is flabbergasted. 
JIMMY Will you at least see how it fits? 
LOUISE Jimmy... it's beautiful! 
JIMMY You didn't see that one comin', did ya? 
INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
J.D. is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still undone and no shirt.  He has an incredible physique.  He also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety. Thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from a vending machine and is into her second Wild Turkey and 7- Up.  She sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror.  He definitely looks better with his shirt off. 
She suddenly feels awkward and stands up. 
THELMA You wanna drink? 
INT.  JIMMY'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Louise has the engagement ring on her finger.  It's really beautiful. 
JIMMY So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right? 
LOUISE Why now, Jimmy? 
JIMMY (this is hard for him) 'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently. 
Louise doesn't know how to respond.  She struggles for a reply. 
LOUISE Jimmy, we've gone all these years... we never made it work.  We're not gonna be able to just... I'm not... What kind of job, honey?  Can you see it.  I can't. 
Jimmy doesn't answer right away.  He's trying to see it. 
JIMMY I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do. 
LOUISE I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse. 
Jimmy does not really understand why this is happening. 
JIMMY Are you just doin' this to punish me? 
LOUISE Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished. 
INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Thelma has poured a drink for J.D. who's sitting on the edge of the bed.  She walks over and hands it to him and as she does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the other.  He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds her hand with both of his.  He closely studies her wedding ring.  He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as intently.  He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring as if to say, "This is not right for you.  This isn't going to work."  He looks at the ring as he moves it through space finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink. He drops it in.  He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to say, "There.  Now don't you feel better?"  He smartly kisses her hand. 
INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Louise and Jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed. 
Jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking at it, as Jimmy holds her hand in his.  They both ponder it. 
JIMMY It does look good. 
INT.  THELMA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
INT.  SIESTA COFFEE SHOP - DAWN 
TIGHT SHOT of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee pot.  Louise and Jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the same side.  They are both playing with their wedding rings. 
JIMMY Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is. 
LOUISE Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff? 
JIMMY I'm choking on it. 
They sit for a minute. 
JIMMY Honey?  Ummm... Do you want me to come with you? 
They look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see that Louise is already gone.  Louise is really touched that he asked her that but she knows it's impossible.  She is very kind to him. 
LOUISE Oh... now... it's probably not such a good idea right now.  I'll... catch up with you later, on down the road. 
In her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box. She puts it on the table and slides it back to him.  He stops her, suddenly.  He covers her hand with his. 
JIMMY You keep this! 
Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still. A taxi pulls up outside. 
LOUISE Your taxi's here. 
Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that employees in the coffee shop look away.  A cook fans himself with a spatula.  The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at his watch. 
JIMMY Are you happy, Louise?  I just want you to be happy. 
Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand. 
LOUISE I'm happy, sweetie.  Happy as I can be. 
Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop.  Louise watches him go.  A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup. 
WAITRESS Good thing he left when he did.  We thought we were gonna have to put out a fire. 
The Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too.  Louise waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab.  The cab driver winks at her.  She smiles to herself. 
INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
The room is totally trashed.  J.D. and Thelma are both asleep, naked and hanging off either side of the bed. 
J.D. starts to stir... 
INT.  HAL'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Hal is in bed with is WIFE.  He has to get up.  He is holding his wife in his arms. 
HAL Honey? 
SARAH Yes, baby? 
HAL Do you think you could ever shoot someone? 
SARAH What? 
HAL Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone? 
SARAH I could shoot your cousin Eddie. 
HAL Why? 
SARAH Because he's an inconsiderate asshole. 
HAL I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger? 
SARAH I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend. 
HAL On what? 
SARAH (trying to picture it) Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children. 
HAL Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie.  I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say... 
SARAH Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan. 
HAL That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range? 
SARAH (thinking) In the leg. 
HAL (getting up) I gotta go to Little Rock. 
INT.  COFFEE SHOP - MORNING 
Louise is sitting in the booth by herself.  Thelma comes hurrying by.  She looks disheveled but is grinning like an idiot.  She sees Louise and charges into the coffee shop. 
Her energy and volume is several notches higher than the rest of the people in the coffee shop.  There are a couple more customers in there now.  Thelma slides into the booth seated directly across from Louise. 
TIGHT SHOT of rear wheel of green T-Bird LAYING RUBBER out of the motel parking lot.  Thelma and Louise, both looking a little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away. 
EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Hal, FBI Man, various other police and detective types, pull up in front of the house.  The front door swings open and there stands Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a cannon. 
EXT.  STREET - DAY 
Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Police are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc., while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull expression on his face. 
HAL (to Darryl) As you know, we've tapped your phone. In the event that she calls in. 
Max comes up and joins them as they walk down the hallway. 
MAX We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them. 
HAL The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her? 
DARRYL Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I'm about as close as I can be with a nut case like that. 
MAX Well, if she calls, just be gentle. Like you're happy to hear from her. You know, like you really miss her. Women love that shit. 
EXT.  CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
Thelma and Louise are sitting in the car.  They've put all their money together. 
LOUISE Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl. 
THELMA (getting out of the car) Don't worry about it.  You want anything? 
LOUISE No. 
Thelma marches off to the store.  Louise puts a tape in the deck and is listening to loud R&B MUSIC.  She checks herself in the rearview mirror.  She takes her lipstick out and is about to put it on.  She makes eye contact with herself and, instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans her head back on the seat.  She's in a world of shit. 
Thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the car. 
THELMA (breathless) Drive! 
Louise looks at her. 
THELMA Drive!  Drive away! 
LOUISE (driving away) What happened? 
Thelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills. 
LOUISE What?  You robbed the store?  You robbed the Goddamn store?! 
Thelma shrieks with excitement.  Louise is completely stunned. 
THELMA Well!  We needed the money!  It's not like I killed anybody, for God's sake. 
Louise shoots her a look.  She puts the car in gear and FLOORS it out of the parking lot.  She is still looking at Thelma as if she has completely lost her mind. 
THELMA I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it. 
LOUISE Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit! 
THELMA (sternly) Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya! 
LOUISE Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say? 
THELMA Well, I just... 
INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
Hal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as TV plays back VCR TAPE of Thelma in the convenience store pulling a gun.  In perfect lip sync is: 
THELMA (V.O.) Alright, ladies and gentleman, let's see who'll win the prize for keepin' their cool.  Everybody lie down on the floor.  If nobody loses their head, then nobody loses their head... 
TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a state of shock.  TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, etc., all looking intently at the screen. 
VIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her purse with money.  As he's loading the purse with bills, she's taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in there, too, while she points the gun at the cashier. 
THELMA (V.O.) (videotape playback) You, sir... You do the honors.  Just empty that cash into this bag and you'll have an amazing story to tell all your friends.  If not, you'll have a tag on your toe.  You decide. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CAR - DAY 
Thelma and Louise in car, driving. 
LOUISE (incredulous) Holy shit. 
CUT TO: 
LOUISE Litterbug. 
They come ROARING up on a semi-tanker carrying gas.  We see their FISH-EYE REFLECTIONS in the shiny tanker. 
The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that Thelma and Louise saw earlier.  The truck is going slower than they are. 
LOUISE Aw, great.  This always happens. Whenever you're in a hurry. 
She noses out to see if she can pass, but there's a car coming.  The car passes and the truck HONKS.  The truck driver's arm comes out his window and waves them past. 
THELMA Isn't that nice?  Truck drivers are always so nice.  The best drivers on the road. 
As they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling and waving at them.  They smile and wave back.  He flicks his tongue at them.  Louise screams. 
THELMA/LOUISE Ugh!!  Gross!!  Oh my God!  Aw, God! 
Louise FLOORS it and speeds past him. 
THELMA Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that? 
LOUISE They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on. 
Louise shivers with disgust. 
INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
Jimmy is looking at police mug shots of a lot of young guys. Hal shows Jimmy a mug shot of J.D. 
HAL Is this the guy you saw them with? 
JIMMY (looking closely) It's him. 
MAX (clapping his hands) Oh, happy day. 
JIMMY You gotta be kiddin' me.  They picked up a murderer?! 
HAL Armed robber. 
JIMMY Oh, great. 
MAX (to Hal) They're flying him here right now. He was picked up this morning for parole violation.  They also found about six grand on him, so he probably knocked over something while he was out there.  They can drop him by here for questioning.  I'm so happy. 
JIMMY (overhearing) How much cash did he have? 
EXT.  POLICE STATION - DAY 
J.D. arriving, handcuffed, at State Police building. 
EXT.  DIRT  ROAD - DAY

INT.  CAR - DAY 
LOUISE Thelma. 
THELMA Yeah. 
LOUISE I want you to call Darryl. 
THELMA What for? 
LOUISE To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped. 
THELMA Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so? 
LOUISE (agitated) Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma! 
THELMA Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense? 
LOUISE But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away! 
THELMA They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth! 
LOUISE It won't work. 
THELMA Why not?! 
LOUISE No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now. 
They both pause for a moment. 
THELMA God.  The law is some tricky shit, isn't it? 
Then: 
THELMA How do you know 'bout all this stuff anyway? 
Louise does not answer the question. 
Darryl is sitting in the hallway.  Hal comes out of the room first. 
HAL Mr. Dickinson, if you'll just hang on, I want a word with you and then we'll take you home. 
Police officers lead J.D. out of the interrogation room, down the hallway.  Darryl is watching J.D. closely.  J.D. is smirking at him. 
J.D. (slyly, to Darryl) I like your wife. 
DARRYL (going after him) Come back here, you little shit! 
Hal and another police officer are restraining Darryl. 
J.D. is led off down the hall. 
EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Louise and Thelma pull into a gas station. 
EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT 
A gas station attendant approaches as Louise and Thelma are getting out of the car. 
LOUISE (to attendant) Fill her up. (to Thelma) There's a phone right over there. 
THELMA Let's get it over with. 
Thelma and Louise walk to the phone. 
LOUISE I'm not kidding, Thelma.  If you think he knows, even if you're not sure, hang up. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The TV is ON and the place is a mess. 
Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action as the phone RINGS, putting on headsets, turning on tape recorders. Darryl picks up the phone.

Hal, Max, etc., all are gesticulating wildly. 
DARRYL (real friendly) Thelma!  Hello! 
EXT.  PAY PHONE 
Thelma hangs up the phone. 
THELMA (matter-of-factly) He knows. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Everyone is very disappointed, taking off their headsets, turning off tape recorders and looking at Darryl like he's an idiot. 
HAL Shit. 
Darryl still holds the phone in his hand. 
DARRYL What?!  All I said was hello. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT 
Thelma and Louise are staring at each other intently. 
Louise steps up to the phone. 
LOUISE You got any change? 
Thelma digs in her bag and hands Louise a roll of quarters. Louise gets out of the car and goes to the pay phone.  Thelma follows her.  She puts the money in and dials.  It RINGS. 
LOUISE Darryl, this is Louise.  Are the police there? 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Again everybody springs into action.  Darryl is fumbling with the phone. 
DARRYL Uh, no!  No, why would any police be here?  Hey, where are you girls, anyway? 
Darryl gives Hal and Max a look as if he's got it completely under control.  Clever guy. 
EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT 
LOUISE Let me talk to whoever's in charge there? 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT) 
All's quiet.  The large screen TV is ON and the room is filled with dense smoke.  Hal, Max, sit at a table going over paperwork.  Other plainclothes and surveillance guys play cards.  Darryl sits crumpled in his recliner staring blankly at the TV. 
INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jimmy sits on his couch with his guitar while two plainclothes cops sit reading the paper, doing the crossword puzzle. 
INT.  CAR - NIGHT 
Over music from tape: 
Thelma is sipping on a little Wild Turkey. 
THELMA Now what? 
LOUISE Now what what? 
THELMA Whaddo we do? 
LOUISE Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards. 
THELMA I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me. 
Louise speeds up. 
Thelma hands Louise a little bottle of Wild Turkey and she drinks it down.  Thelma has one too. 
THELMA Can I ask you kind of a weird question? 
LOUISE Yeah. 
THELMA Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most? 
LOUISE You mean now or before? 
THELMA Before. 
LOUISE I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs. 
THELMA What little dogs? 
LOUISE You know those little dogs you see people with? 
THELMA Like a Chihuahua? 
LOUISE Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth? 
THELMA Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos. 
LOUISE Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you? 
THELMA Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me. 
LOUISE I can see that. 
THELMA I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse. (quieter) I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it. 
LOUISE Well, now, maybe you won't have to. 
THELMA Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya? 
EXT.  MOONLIT DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT)

LOUISE Shit!  Thelma, wake up!  Shit!  We're gettin' pulled over! 
Thelma jumps awake. 
THELMA What!  What!  Oh shit!  Oh no! 
They are trying not to panic.  They are slowing down, but still doing 70 mph.  The patrol car is right behind them. 
THELMA What do we do?  What do you want to do?! 
LOUISE I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket. 
THELMA Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please... 
Louise pulls the car off the road.  The patrol car pulls up right behind them.  The lights shine brightly in through the windows. 
EXT.  SIDE OF DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY 
PATROLMAN (O.S.) Turn off your engine. 
Louise does.  The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches their car.  He comes to the driver's side window.  It is rolled up. 
PATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him.  He gestures to her to roll her window down.  She does. 
LOUISE Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem? 
PATROLMAN You wanna let me see your license, please? 
Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and shows her license. 
PATROLMAN You wanna take it out of your wallet, please? 
LOUISE Oh yeah. 
She does and hands it to him. 
THELMA I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down. 
LOUISE About how fast was I going? 
PATROLMAN About a hundred and ten.  You wanna step out of the car, please? 
They walk to the back of the car.  He notes the license plate number. 
PATROLMAN Is this your car? 
LOUISE Yes. 
PATROLMAN You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please. 
LOUISE In the back? 
PATROLMAN Front. 
LOUISE Am I in trouble? 
PATROLMAN As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are. 
Patrolman gets in the driver's side.  He picks up a clipboard and clips Louise's driver's license to it.  He picks up the hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun comes in his car window.  It's Thelma and she puts the gun to his head. 
THELMA Officer, I am so sorry about this. Could you let go of that? 
He drops it. 
THELMA I really, really apologize, but please put your hands on the steering wheel. See, if you get on that radio, you're gonna find out that we're wanted in two states and probably considered armed and dangerous, at least I am, then our whole plan would be shot to hell.  Louise, take his gun. 
Louise reaches over and takes his gun. 
LOUISE (apologetic) I am really sorry about this. 
THELMA I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please? (she opens the door for him) You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio. 
LOUISE What? 
THELMA Shoot the radio! 
Louise SHOOTS the car radio.  The cop flinches with each shot. 
THELMA The police radio, Louise!  Jesus! 
Louise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio.  It BLASTS all to hell. 
LOUISE And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach. 
THELMA Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila? 
LOUISE You do? 
THELMA Yeah, you want it? 
LOUISE Yeah. 
Thelma starts to dig through her bag again. 
THELMA It's in here somewhere. 
Louise is rubbing her face.  She looks pretty bad.  Her hands are shaking. 
LOUISE Shit.  I'm gettin' tired. 
THELMA Are you alright? 
Louise does not really seem alright. 
LOUISE I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police. 
THELMA You know why.  You already said. 
LOUISE What'd I say again? 
THELMA Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else? 
LOUISE What? 
THELMA That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead.  I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass. 
LOUISE I said all that? 
THELMA No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest. 
LOUISE (tired) Whatever.

HAL Hello, Louise. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING 
LOUISE Hey. 
HAL (V.O.) How are things goin' out there? 
LOUISE Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.

LOUISE Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Hal smiles. 
HAL I swear.  Louise, I almost feel like I know you. 
LOUISE (V.O.) Well.  You don't. 
HAL You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone. 
LOUISE (V.O.) Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident? 
HAL I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING 
Louise does not answer. 
HAL (V.O.) Did Harlan Puckett...

THELMA Me too.  I feel awake. 
LOUISE Good. 
THELMA Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean.  Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that? Like you've got something to look forward to? 
Louise and Thelma both get quiet for a second. 
LOUISE We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita. 
THELMA We can change our names. 
LOUISE We can live in a hacienda. 
THELMA I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med. 
LOUISE Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that? 
THELMA It'd have to be pretty good. 
LOUISE It would have to be pretty damn good. 
They are both laughing.  The car is still flying down the road.  The sun is coming higher in the sky now.  They come to an intersection in the middle of nowhere.  Louise stops and looks at the map. 
LOUISE We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico. They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico. 
THELMA You're drivin'. 
Louise takes a right turn and speeds down the road. 
EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY 
Louise and Thelma are singing along to a wild R&B SONG. They do the hand movements as if they are the Supremes. 
They come roaring up on the semi-tanker, the same one they have seen three times before.

LOUISE It's him.  He's got California plates. It's the same guy. 
THELMA Pass him! 
EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY 
Louise bears down really hard and passes him.  Again as they get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them. 
He is leering at them and laughing.  Louise and Thelma drive further down the road. 
Louise pulls the car off to the side of the road.  As the truck gets close they start waving to him to stop.  He pulls his truck off the side of the road and stops.  ANGLE ON Louise and Thelma smiling up at him.  He chuckles to himself.  He leans out the window. 
THELMA Hi! 
TRUCKER Hi there!  You alright? 
THELMA We're fine!  How are you? 
TRUCKER Grrrreat! 
LOUISE Follow us. 
They turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop.

Max and Hal sit next to each other in the jet.  Hal tries to appear as if he's used to all this.  Max holds a cellular phone to his ear. 
TIGHT SHOT of Max as we hear through the phone: 
Police VOICE OVER becomes part of scene. 
POLICE (V.O.) (on phone) ...Abducted... shot up the car... stole the officer's weapon... tanker... blown up... terrorized... 
Max's face becomes troubled and more serious than we've seen so far.  He looks at Hal as he hangs up the phone.

WIDE SHOT of car speeding through the desert on an empty highway west.  DRIVING SHOT -- Thelma has her face to the sun with her eyes closed.  Louise is driving with a fierce intensity.  They hardly resemble the two women that started out for a weekend in the mountains two days earlier.  Although their faces are tanned and lined and their hair is blowing wildly there is a sense of serenity that pervades.

Hal and Max are climbing out of the jet and running across the tarmac to a waiting helicopter.  Max is carrying a walkie- talkie now.

LOUISE Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.

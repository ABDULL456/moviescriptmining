T I T A N I C 
a screenplay by James Cameron 
1 BLACKNESS 
Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing brighter. They resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-falling toward us like express elevators. 
One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile manipulators. 
TILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness below. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone. 
CUT TO: 
2 EXT./ INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP 
PUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to its circular viewport to see the occupants. 
INSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLY MIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing softly in Russian. 
Next to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeply tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer and part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO2 scrubber, fast asleep and snoring. 
On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body named LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert. 
Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment. 
CUT TO: 
3 EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA 
A pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIR ONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its thrusters. It hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud BONK. 
CUT TO: 
4 INT. MIR ONE 
Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing. 
ANATOLY 
(heavy Russian accent) 
We are here. 
EXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO 
5 MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and the THRUM of big thrusters. 
6 The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs. Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible. Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his face pressed to the center port. 
BODINE 
Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. Thirteen... you should see it. 
ANATOLY 
Do you see it? I don't see it... there! 
Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship appears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standing just as it landed 84 years ago. 
THE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow railing, intact except for an overgrowth of "rusticles" draping it like mutated Spanish moss. 
TIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock Lovett's face fills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME. 
LOVETT 
It still gets me every time. 
The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns. 
ANATOLY 
Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead. 
CUT WIDER, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning it in his hand so it points at his own face. 
LOVETT 
Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here. 
Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera aimed at himself at arm's length. 
LOVETT 
It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above. 
Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches the sonar. 
BODINE 
You are so full of shit, boss. 
7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps gleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous wreck. 
LOVETT (V.O.) 
Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nine inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds. 
8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's Quarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby. 
LOVETT 
Right. Let's go to work. 
Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick controls of the ROV. 
9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOP DOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward. 
BODINE (V.O.) 
Walkin' the dog. 
SNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind it like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insect eyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful First Class Grand Staircase. 
Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First Class Reception Room. 
SNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and descending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again. 
MONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence: 
10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights. 
11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as Snoop moves around it. 
12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top "granny shoe". Then something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll. 
Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wall sconce... hint at the grandeur of the past. 
13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, the sitting room of a "promenade suite", one of the most luxurious staterooms on Titanic. 
BODINE 
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54. 
LOVETT 
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday. 
BODINE 
I'm tryin' boss. 
Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe, scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going. 
BODINE 
I'm crossing the bedroom. 
The remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through the collapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new, gleaming in the dark. 
LOVETT 
Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door. 
SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving debris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were in 1912. 
LOVETT 
Easy, Lewis. Take it slow. 
Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is a dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under the door... 
BODINE 
Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'? 
CLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he is seeing the Holy Grail. 
LOVETT 
Oh baby baby baby. 
(grabs the mike) 
It's payday, boys. 
ON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a small STEEL COMBINATION SAFE. 
CUT TO: 
14 EXT. STERN OF DECK OF KEDYSH - DAY 
THE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of a ship by a winch cable. 
We are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV KELDYSH. A crowd has gathered, including most of the crew of KELDYSH, the sub crews, and a hand-wringing money guy named BOBBY BUELL who represents the limited partners. There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover his moment of glory. 
ROSE 
I was just wondering if you had found the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett. 
Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression... 
BUELL 
I told you you wanted to take this call. 
LOVETT 
(to Rose) 
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is? 
ROSE 
Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me. 
CUT TO: 
20 EXT. OCEAN - DAY 
SMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA STALLION HELICOPTER thundering across the ocean. PAN 180 degrees as it roars past. There is no land at either horizon. The Keldysh is visible in the distance. 
CLOSE ON A WINDOW of the monster helicopter. Rose's face is visible, looking out calmly. 
CUT TO: 
21 EXT. KELDYSH - DAY 
Brock and Bodine are watching Mir 2 being sweng over the side to start a dive. 
BODINE 
She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That Anastasia babe. 
BUELL 
They're inbound. 
Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo. 
BODINE 
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now. 
LOVETT 
A hundred and one next month. 
BODINE 
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead. 
The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the rotors. 
LOVETT 
And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say. Got it? 
CUT TO: 
22 EXT. KELDYSH HELIPAD 
IN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST the helicopter's wheels bounce down on the helipad. 
Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF hands out about ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by Keldysh crewmen. Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her out, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travel light. 
HOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic equipment. 
BODINE 
S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends. 
CUT TO: 
23 INT. ROSE'S STATEROOM / KELDYSH - DAY 
Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is placing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway. 
LOVETT 
Is your stateroom alright? 
ROSE 
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. 
LIZZY 
Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck? 
ROSE 
Oh, yes. 
Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes arranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband. 
ROSE 
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. 
(to the Pomeranian) 
Isn't that right, sweetie. 
LOVETT 
Would you like anything? 
ROSE 
I should like to see my drawing. 
CUT TO: 
24 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION AREA 
Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across a span of 84 years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it, they have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive. 
TIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing. 
25 FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines. 
26 THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water. 
27 A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching pad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlessly direct. 
28 Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklace in his hand. 
LOVETT 
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. 
ROSE 
It was a dreadful, heavy thing. 
(she points at the drawing) 
I only wore it this once. 
LIZZY 
You actually believe this is you, grandma? 
ROSE 
It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number? 
LOVETT 
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rost? 
ROSE 
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. 
LOVETT 
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. 
(to Lizzy) 
See the date? 
LIZZY 
April 14, 1912. 
LOVETT 
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. 
(MORE) 
LOVETT (CONT'D) 
(to Rose) 
And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery. 
ROSE 
A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDON HOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. "Cal" is handsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning. 
CAL 
You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths. 
Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, who descends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress, from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and rules her household with iron will. 
CAL 
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. 
(indicating a puddle) 
Mind your step. 
RUTH 
(gazing at the leviathan) 
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable. 
CAL 
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship. 
Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience. 
This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with servants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as an undertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and Rose. 
A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute loading. 
PORTER 
Sir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round that way-- 
Cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver. The porter's eyes dilate. Five pounds was a monster tip in those days. 
CAL 
I put my faith in you, good sir. 
(MORE) 
CAL (CONT'D) 
(curtly, indicating Lovejoy) 
See my man. 
PORTER 
Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir. 
Cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses. 
LOVEJOY 
(to the porter) 
These trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot up in the rooms. 
The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates and steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who come running. 
Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks his pocket watch. 
CAL 
We'd better hurry. This way, ladies. 
He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into the crowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her mistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggage handlers. 
Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers (mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers. Most of the first class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above. 
They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds, queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER examines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice. 
They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph "cinematograph" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose father founded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of the Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious. 
DANIEL 
Look up at the ship, darling, that's it. You're amazed! You can't believe how big it is! Like a mountain. That's great. 
Mary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad Clara Bow pantomime of awe, hands raised. 
Cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him. And he is bumped again a second later by the boys' father. 
CAL 
Steady!! 
MAN 
Sorry squire! 
The Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting. 
CAL 
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. 
RUTH 
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family. 
CAL 
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late. 
ROSE 
You told me to change. 
CAL 
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck. 
ROSE 
I felt like black. 
Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with two tons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's Victualling Department. 
CAL 
Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to your execution. 
Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall, Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangway to the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains. 
CLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOW-MOTION as it closes possessively over Rose's arm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming. 
35 CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's funnels, bellowing their departure warning. 
CUT TO: 
36 EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS / TITANIC - DAY 
A VIEW OF TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above the terminal buildings like the skyline of a city. The steamer's whistle echoes across Southampton. 
PULL BACK, revealing that we were looking through a window, and back further to show the smoky inside of a pub. It is crowded with dockworkers and ship;s crew. 
Just inside the window, a poker game is in progress. FOUR MEN, in working class clothes, play a very serious hand. 
JACK DAWSON and FABRIZIO DE ROSSI, both about 20, exchange a glance as the other two players argue in Swedish. Jack is American, a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for the standards of the times. He is also unshaven, and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. He is an artist, and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris. He is also very self-possessed and sure-footed for 20, having lived on his own since 15. 
The TWO SWEDES continue their sullen argument, in Swedish. 
OLAF 
(subtitled) 
You stupid fishhead. I can't believe you bet our tickets. 
SVEN 
(subtitled) 
You lost our money. I'm just trying to get it back. Now shutup and take a card. 
JACK 
(jaunty) 
Hit me again, Sven. 
Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand. 
ECU JACK'S EYES. They betray nothing. 
CLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card. 
ECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties. This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two 3RD CLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC. 
The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning. 
JACK 
The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change. 
CUT TO: 
44 EXT. RIVER TEST - DAY 
IN A LONG LENS SHOT the prow of Titanic FILLS FRAME behind the lead tug, which is dwarfed. The bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of the liner's hull as it moves down the River Test toward the English Channel. 
CUT TO: 
45 INT. THIRD CLASS BERTHING / G-DECK FORWARD - DAY 
Jack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both sides like a college dorm. Total confusion as people argue over luggage in several languages, or wander in confusion in the labyrinth. They pass emigrants studying the signs over the doors, and looking up the words in phrase books. 
They find their berth. It is a modest cubicle, painted enamel white, with four bunks. Exposed pipes overhead. The other two guys are already there. OLAUS and BJORN GUNDERSEN. 
Jack throws his kit on one open bunk, while Fabrizio takes the other. 
BJORN 
(in Swedish/ subtitled) 
Where is Sven? 
CUT TO: 
46 INT. SUITE B-52-56 - DAY 
By contrast, the so-called "Millionaire Suite" is in the Empire style, and comprises two bedrooms, a bath, WC, wardrobe room, and a large sitting room. In addition there is a private 50 foot promenade deck outside. 
A room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of orange juice and hands the Bucks Fizz to Rose. She is looking through her new paintings. There is a Monet of water lilies, a Degas of dancers, and a few abstract works. They are all unknown paintings... lost works. 
Cal is out on the covered deck, which has potted trees and vines on trellises, talking through the doorway to Rose in the sitting room. 
CAL 
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money. 
ROSE 
(looking at a cubist portrait) 
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again... ? 
(reading off the canvas) 
Picasso. 
CAL 
(coming into the sitting room) 
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap. 
A porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into the room on a handtruck. 
CAL 
Put that in the wardrobe. 
47 IN THE BEDROOM Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She sets it on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in there, hanging up some of Rose's clothes. 
TRUDY 
It smells so brand new. Like they built it all just for us. I mean... just to think that tonight, when I crawl between the sheets, Iill be the first-- 
Cal appears in the doorway of the bedroom. 
CAL 
(looking at Rose) 
And when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first. 
TRUDY 
(blushing at the innuendo) 
S'cuse me, Miss. 
She edges around Cal and makes a quick exit. Cal comes up behind Rose and puts his hands on her shoulders. An act of possession, not intimacy. 
CAL 
The first and only. Forever. 
Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now. 
CUT TO: 
48 EXT. CHERBOURG HARBOR, FRANCE - LATE DUSK 
Titanic stands silhouetted against a purple post-sunset sky. She is lit up like a floating palace, and her thousand portholes reflect in the calm harbor waters. The 150 foot tender Nomadic lies-to alongside, looking like a rowboat. The lights of a Cherbourg harbor complete the postcard image. 
CUT TO: 
49 INT. FIRST CLASS RECEPTION/ D-DECK 
Entering the first class reception room from the tender are a number of prominent passengers. A BROAD-SHOULDERED WOMAN in an enormous feathered hat comes up the gangway, carrying a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porter running to catch up with her to take the bags. 
WOMAN 
Well, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Take 'em the rest of the way if you think you can manage. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called "new money". 
At 45, MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean... 
CUT TO: 
50 OMITTED 
51 EXT. BOW - DAY 
The ship glows with the warm creamy light of late afternoon. Jack and Fabrizio stand right at the bow gripping the curving railing so familiar from images of the wreck. Jack leans over, looking down fifty feet to where the prow cuts the surface like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets of water. 
CUT TO: 
52 INT. / EXT. TITANIC - SERIES OF SCENES - DAY 
ON THE BRIDGE, CAPTAIN SMITH turns from the binnacle to FIRST OFFICER WILLIAM MURDOCH. 
CAPTAIN SMITH 
Take her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs. 
Murdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to ALL AHEAD FULL. 
53 NOW BEGINS a kind of musical/visual setpiece... an ode to the great ship. The music is rhythmic, surging forward, with a soaring melody that addresses the majesty and optimism of the ship of dreams. 
IN THE ENGINE ROOM the telegraph clangs and moves to "All Ahead Full". 
CHIEF ENGINEER BELL 
All ahead full! 
On the catwalk THOMAS ANDREWS, the shipbuilder, watches carefully as the engineers and greasers scramble to adjust valves. Towering above them are the twin RECIPROCATING engines, four stories tall, their ten-foot-long connecting rods surging up and down with the turning of the massive crankshafts. The engines thunder like the footfalls of marching giants. 
54 IN THE BOILER ROOMS the STOKERS chant a song as they hurl coal into the roaring furnaces. The "black gang" are covered with sweat and coal dust, their muscles working like part of the machinery as they toil in the hellish glow. 
55 UNDERWATER the enormous bronze screws chop through the water, hurling the steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that lingers for miles behind the juggernaut ship. Smoke pours from the funnels as-- 
56 The riven water flares higher at the bow as the ship's speeds builds. THE CAMERA SWEEPS UP the prow to find Jack, the wind streaming through his hair and-- 
57 Captain Smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing. He stands with his hands on the rail, looking every bit the storybook picture of a Captain... a great patriarch of the sea. 
FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH 
Twenty one knots, sir! 
SMITH 
She's got a bone in her teeth now, eh, Mr. Murdoch. 
Smith accepts a cup of tea from FIFTH OFFICER LOWE. He contentedly watches the white V of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of his own personal power. They are invulnerable, towering over the sea. 
58 AT THE BOW Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down. 
In the glassy bow-wave two dolphins appear, under the water, running fast just in front of the steel blade of the prow. They do it for the sheer joy and exultation of motion. Jack watches the dolphins and grins. They breach, jumping clear of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front of the bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut. 
FABRIZIO looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the sunsparkles. 
FABRIZIO 
I can see the Statue of Liberty already. 
(grinning at Jack) 
Very small... of course. 
THE CAMERA ARCS around them, until they are framed against the sea. 
NOW WE PULL BACK, across the forecastle deck. Rising, as we continue back, and the ships rolls endlessly forward underneath. Over the bridge wing, along the boat deck until her funnels come INTO FRAME besides us and march past like the pillars of heaven, one by one. We pull back and up, until we are looking down the funnels, and the people strolling on the decks and standing at the rail become antlike. 
And still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in a gorgeous aerial portrait, black and severe in her majesty. 
ISMAY (V.O.) 
She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history... 
CUT TO: 
Don't do it. 
She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for her eyes to focus. 
ROSE 
Stay back! Don't come any closer! 
Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern running lights. 
JACK 
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in. 
ROSE 
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. 
JACK 
No you won't. 
ROSE 
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. 
JACK 
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand. 
Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance. 
ROSE 
You're distracting me. Go away. 
JACK 
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you. 
ROSE 
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. 
He takes off his jacket. 
JACK 
I'm a good swimmer. 
He starts unlacing his left shoe. 
ROSE 
The fall alone would kill you. 
JACK 
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold. 
She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in. 
ROSE 
How cold? 
JACK 
(taking off his left shoe) 
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. 
He starts unlacing his right shoe. 
JACK 
Ever been to Wisconsin? 
ROSE 
(perplexed) 
No. 
JACK 
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in the-- 
ROSE 
I know what ice fishing is! 
JACK 
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. 
(takes off his other shoe) 
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here. 
ROSE 
You're crazy. 
JACK 
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship. 
He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse. 
JACK 
Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand. 
Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe. 
ROSE 
Alright. 
She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He reaches out to take it, firmly. 
JACK 
I'm Jack Dawson. 
ROSE 
(voice quavering) 
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson. 
Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning to face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and one foot slips off the edge of the deck. 
She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand. 
QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for the ladder. 
ROSE 
HELP! HELP!! 
JACK 
I've got you. I won't let go. 
Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing with his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth hull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS again. 
Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she flails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in a tangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of her. 
Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill and sprints across the fantail. 
ROWE 
Here, what's all this?! 
Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled and sobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above her knees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage man with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, and starts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them. 
ROWE 
(to Jack) 
Here you, stand back! Don't move an inch! 
(to the seamen) 
Fetch the Master at Arms. 
CUT TO: 
66 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT 
A few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS, the closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is right in front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here with Lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie evening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioed blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who is hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more concerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels. 
CAL 
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?! 
ROSE 
Cal, stop! It was an accident. 
CAL 
An accident?! 
She goes back to the book, turning a page. 
ROSE 
Well, well... 
She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languid beauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands and eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form... almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as some strollers go by. 
ROSE 
(trying to be very adult) 
And these were drawn from life? 
JACK 
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off. 
She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight, half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a flower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print of Georgia O'Keefe. 
ROSE 
You liked this woman. You used her several times. 
JACK 
She had beautiful hands. 
ROSE 
(smiling) 
I think you must have had a love affair with her... 
JACK 
(laughing) 
No, no! Just with her hands. 
ROSE 
(looking up from the drawings) 
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. 
JACK 
I see you. 
There it is. That piercing gaze again. 
ROSE 
And...? 
JACK 
You wouldn'ta jumped. 
CUT TO: 
74 INT. RECEPTION ROOM / D-DECK - DAY 
Ruth is having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYER-EDWARDES, the COUNTESS OF ROTHES, a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician features. Ruth sees someone coming across the room and lowers her voice. 
RUTH 
Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way. Get up, quickly before she sits with us. 
Molly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising. 
MOLLY 
Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea. 
RUTH 
We're awfully sorry you missed it. The Countess and I are just off to take the air on the boat deck. 
MOLLY 
That sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip. 
Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to go up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table. 
ISMAY 
So you've not lit the last four boilers then? 
SMITH 
No, but we're making excellent time. 
ISMAY 
(impatiently) 
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titnaic must make headlines! 
SMITH 
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in. 
ISMAY 
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. 
(Ismay slaps his hand on the table) 
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J? 
A beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy. 
CUT TO: 
75 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE - DAY 
Rose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the slanting late-afternoon light. Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa. 
ROSE 
(girlish and excited) 
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free! 
JACK 
(laughing) 
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar. 
ROSE 
(angry in a flash) 
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. 
JACK 
I'm sorry. Really... I am. 
ROSE 
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... 
She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees something ahead and her face lights up. 
ROSE 
...or a moving picture actress! 
She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward-- 
DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail. 
MARVIN 
You're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've left your lover on the shore. You may never see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling. 
SUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the rail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. Rose pulls Jack into the picture and makes him pose. 
Marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this in CUTS, with music and no dialogue. 
SERIES OF CUTS: 
Rose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead. 
Jack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomiming fanning him like slave girls. 
Jack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing, turns her head in bored disdain. 
Rose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shoot-out. Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like Snidely Whiplash. 
CUT TO: 
76 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE / AFT - SUNSET 
Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck rail aft, shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on. 
It is a magical moment... perfect. 
ROSE 
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? 
CAL 
(caught off guard) 
Dawson! I didn't recognize you. 
(studies him) 
Amazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen. 
CUT TO: 
80 INT. D-DECK RECEPTION ROOM 
CUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. They encounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty broad-shouldered way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are going into the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low: 
MOLLY 
Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack? 
JACK 
Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up. 
MOLLY 
Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got a lot of it and you're in the club. 
As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out several notables. 
ROSE 
There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal. 
(nodding toward a couple) 
And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. 
Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and Colonel Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots Jack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably. 
ROSE 
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course. 
Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are looking at Rose like a prize show horse. 
SIR COSMO 
Hockley, she is splendid. 
CAL 
Thank you. 
GRACIE 
Cal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck. 
Ruth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, somewhat coquettishly. 
RUTH 
How can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch. 
The entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into the Astor's going through the ornate double doors. 
ROSE 
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. 
ASTOR 
(shaking his hand) 
Good to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston Dawsons? 
JACK 
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. 
J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astor appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose: 
MADELEINE 
It's a pity we're both spoken for, isn't it? 
CUT TO: 
81 INT. DINING SALOON 
Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation of chandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from BANDLEADER WALLACE HARTLEY'S small orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter and move across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear... 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted upon... 
CUT TO: 
82 INT. DINING SALOON 
CLOSE ON RUTH. 
RUTH 
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good on this ship. 
WIDER: THE TABLE. Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal and Thomas Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel Gracie, the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the Astors. 
JACK 
The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats. 
Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate. 
CAL 
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night. 
(to Jack, as if to a child) 
This is foie gras. It's goose liver. 
We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Now they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous. 
GUGGENHEIM 
(low to Madame Aubert) 
What is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here? 
WAITER 
(to Jack) 
How do you take your caviar, sir? 
CAL 
(answering for him) 
Just a soupcon of lemon... 
(to Jack, smiling) 
...it improves the flavor with champagne. 
JACK 
(to the waiter) 
No caviar for me, thanks. 
(to Cal) 
Never did like it much. 
He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles. 
RUTH 
And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? 
JACK 
Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. 
Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look and picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks. 
RUTH 
You find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you? 
JACK 
Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count. 
Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute. 
MOLLY 
Well said, Jack. 
COLONEL GRACIE 
(raising his glass) 
Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy, who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommy lunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around. 
TOMMY 
You stupid bastard!! 
Bjorn comes around, his fists coming up... and Jack leaps into the middle of it, pushing them apart. 
JACK 
Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse? 
Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grins and claps Bjorn on the shoulder. 
ROSE 
So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. 
In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up on point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gape at her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screws up in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around. 
ROSE 
Oooowww! I haven't done that in years. 
Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up. 
THE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through the gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing. 
LOVEJOY closes the door. 
CUT TO: 
88 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT 
The stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way. Rose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats. Still giddy from the party, they are singing a popular song "Come Josephine in My Flying Machine". 
JACK/ROSE 
Come Josephine in my flying machine 
And it's up she goes! Up she goes! 
In the air she goes. Where? There she goes! 
They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end. Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose grabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos. 
ROSE 
Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless. 
She goes to the rail and leans on it. 
ROSE 
They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst. 
He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is the slightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is that square inch of skin where their hands are touching. 
JACK 
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake. 
ROSE 
A mistake? 
JACK 
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address. 
ROSE 
(laughing) 
I did, didn't I? 
(MORE) 
ROSE (CONT'D) 
(pointing suddenly) 
Look! A shooting star. 
JACK 
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven. 
ROSE 
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it? 
Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. It would be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems to be thinking the same thing. 
JACK 
What would you wish for? 
After a beat, Rose pulls back. 
ROSE 
Something I can't have. 
(she smiles sadly) 
Goodnight, Jack. And thank you. 
She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance. 
JACK 
Rose!! 
But the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world. 
CUT TO: 
89 INT. ORSE AND CAL'S SUITE / PRIVATE PROMENADE - DAY 
SUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across the promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension is palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes inside. 
CAL 
I had hoped you would come to me last night. 
ROSE 
I was tired. 
CAL 
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting. 
ROSE 
(stiffening) 
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. 
CAL 
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand? 
ROSE 
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee-- 
Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. He moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms. 
CAL 
Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made out a fool! Is this in any way unclear? 
Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the door bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens up. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom. 
ROSE 
We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy. 
CUT TO: 
90 INT. RUTH'S SUITE - DAY 
Rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with her corset. The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's fury at all. 
RUTH 
You are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it! 
Rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the corset strings with both hands. 
ROSE 
Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed. 
Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK! 
RUTH 
(wheeling on her) 
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone! 
ROSE 
SMITH 
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind. 
LIGHTOLLER 
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base. 
SMITH 
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Yes sir. 
SMITH 
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful. 
CUT TO: 
111 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE 
Rose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key in the lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him silently through the bedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting room door. 
LOVEJOY 
Miss Rose? Hello? 
He hears a door opening and goes through Cal's room toward hers. 
CUT TO: 
112 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE 
Rose and Jack come out of her stateroom, closing the door. She leads him quickly along the corridor toward the B deck foyer. They are halfway across the open space when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoy comes out. The valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them. 
ROSE 
Come on! 
She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemen about. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They run into one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR. 
ROSE 
Take us down. Quickly, quickly! 
The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate. Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on the bars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs as Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her. 
CUT TO: 
113 INT. E-DECK FOYER / ELEVATORS 
Lovejoy emerges from another lift and runs to the one Jack and Rose were in. The Operator is just closing the gate to go back up. Lovejoy runs around the bank of elevators and scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. He tries the stairs going down to F-Deck. 
CUT TO: 
114 INT. F-DECK CORRIDORS / FAN ROOM 
A functional space, with access to a number of machine spaces (fan rooms, boiler uptakes). Jack and Rose are leaning against a wall, laughing. 
JACK 
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. 
ROSE 
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... 
JACK 
Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh! 
Lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He charges toward them. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is one door, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open. 
115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down. Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it a moment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder. 
JACK 
After you, m'lady. 
CUT TO: 
116 INT. BOILER ROOM FIVE AND SIX 
Jack and Rose come down the escape ladder and look around in amazement. It is like a vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and black figures moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room, dodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal. 
JACK 
(shouting over the din) 
Carry on! Don't mind us! 
They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pulls her through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in the dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, they see the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into the insatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar of the fires. 
CUT TO: 
117 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM 
Amid unparalled luxury, Cal sits at a card game, sipping brandy. 
COLONEL GRACIE 
We're going like hell I tel you. I have fifty dollars that says we make it into New York Tuesday night! 
Cal looks at his gold pocket watch, and scowls, not listening. 
CUT TO: 
118 OMITTED 
119 INT. BOILER ROOM SIX 
The furnaces roar, silhouetting the glistening stokers. Jack kisses Rose's face, tasting the sweat trickling down from her forehead. They kiss passionately in the steamy, pounding darkness. 
CUT TO: 
120 INT. HOLD #2 
Jack and Rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. She hugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room. 
They come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring car, lashing down to a pallet. It looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trim and headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color. 
Rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal. There are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing a rose. Jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leather and wood. 
JACK 
Where to, Miss? 
ROSE 
To the stars. 
ON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat into the back. He lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quiet darkness. He looks at her and she is smiling. It is the moment of truth. 
JACK 
Are you nervous? 
ROSE 
Au contraire, mon cher. 
He strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's fingers. 
ROSE 
Put your hands on me Jack. 
He kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight. 
CUT TO: 
121 INT. WIRELESS ROOM 
A BRILLIANT ARC OF ELECTRICITY fills frame-- the sparks gap of the Marconi instrument as SENIOR WIRELESS OPERATOR JACK PHILLIPS (24) rapidly keys out a message. Junior Operator Bride looks through the huge stack of outgoing messages swamping them. 
BRIDE 
Look at this one, he wants his private train to meet him. La dee da. 
(slaps them down) 
We'll be up all bloody night on this lot. 
Phillips start to receive an incoming message from a nearby ship, the Leyland frieghter CALIFORNIAN, which jams his outgoing signal. At such close range, the beeps are deafening. 
PHILLIPS 
Christ! It's that idiot on the Californian. 
Cursing, Phillips furiously keys a rebuke. 
CUT TO: 
122 INT. / EXT. WIRELESS SHAK / FREIGHTER CALIFORNIAN 
Wireless Operater CYRIL EVANS pulls his earphone off his ear as the Titanic's spark deafens him. he translates the message for THIRD OFFICER GROVES. 
EVANS 
Stupid bastard. I try to warn him about the ice, and he says "Keep out. Shut up. I'm working Cape Race." 
GROVES 
Full astern! FULL ASTERN!! 
The engineers and greasers like madmen to close steam valves and start braking the mighty propeller shafts, big as Sequias, to a stop. 
133 IN BOILER ROOM SIX, Leading Stoker FREDERICK BARRETT is standing with 2nd Engineer JAMES HESKETH when the red warning light and "STOP" indicator come on. 
BARRETT 
Shut all dampers! Shut 'em!! 
134 FROM THE BRIDGE Murdoch watches the burg growing... straight ahead. The bow finally starts to come left (since the ship turns the reverse of the helm setting). 
MURDOCH'S jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing slowness. He holds his breath as the horrible physics play out. 
135 IN THE CROW'S NEST Frederick Fleet braces himself. 
136 THE BOW OF THE SHIP thunders right at CAMERA and-- 
KRUUUNCH!! The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow. 
137 UNDERWATER we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. The iceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as the steel plate of the hull flexes under the load. 
138 IN #2 HOLD the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet with a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along outside the ship, the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in, sweeping them off their feert. The icy water swirls around the Renault as the men scramble for the stairs. 
139 ON G-DECK forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. He hears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice. 
140 IN BOILER ROOM SIX Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLING THUNDER of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship buckle in toward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water coming in about two feet above the floor. 
141 ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up in astonishment as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain. Fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and they have to jump back to avoid flying chunks of ice. 
142 ON THE BRIDGE Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quicky throws the switch that closes them. 
MURDOCH 
Hard a 'port! 
Judging the berg to be amidships, he is trying to clear the stern. 
143 BARRETT AND HESKETH hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through the swirling water to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. The room is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces. Barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes down like a slow guillotine. 
BARRETT 
Go Lads! Go! Go! 
He dives through into Boiler Room 5 just before the door rumbles down with a CLANG. 
144 JACK AND ROSE rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving aft down the side of the ship. 
145 In his stateroom, surrounded by piles of plans while making notes in his ever-present book, Andrews looks up at the sound of a cut-crystal light fixture tinkling like a windchime. 
He feels the shudder run through the ship. And we see it in his face. Too much of his soul is in this great ship for him not to feel its mortal wound. 
146 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Gracie watches his highball vibrating on the table. 
147 IN THE PALM COURT, with its high arched windows, Molly Brown holds up her drink to a passing waiter. 
MOLLY 
Hey, can I get some ice here, please? 
Silently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. She doesn't see it. It disappears astern. 
148 OMITTED 
149 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet turns to his Lee... 
FLEET 
Oy, mate... that was a close shave. 
LEE 
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ! 
CUT TO: 
150 INT. / EXT. BRIDGE 
CLOSE ON MURDOCH. The alarm bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming to reflect his inner state. He is in shock, unable to get a grip on what just happened. He just ran the biggest ship in history into an iceberg on its maiden voyage. 
MURDOCH 
(stiffly, to Moody) 
Note the time. Enter it in the log. 
Captain Smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge, tucking in his shirt. 
SMITH 
What was that, Mr. Murdoch? 
MURDOCH 
An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines full astern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and I-- 
SMITH 
Close the emergency doors. 
MURDOCH 
The doors are closed. 
Together they rush out onto the starboard wing, and Murdoch points. Smith looks into the darkness aft, then wheels around to FOURTH OFFICER BOHALL. 
SMITH 
Find the Carpenter and get him to sound the ship. 
CUT TO: 
151 INT. G-DECK FORWARD 
In steerage, Fabrizio comes out into the hall to see what's going on. He sees dozens of rats running toward him in the corridor, fleeing the flooding bow. Fabrizio jumps aside as the rats run by. 
FABRIZIO 
Ma-- che cazzo! 
152 IN HIS STATEROOM Tommy gets out of his top bunk in the dark and drops down to the floor. SPLASH!! 
TOMMMY 
Cor!! What in hell--?! 
He naps on the light. The floor is covered with 3 inches of freezing water, and more coming in. He pulls the door open, and steps out into the corridor, which is flooded. Fabrizio is running toward him, yelling something in Italian. Tommy and Fabrizio start pounding on doors, getting everybody up and out. The alarm spreads in several languages. 
CUT TO: 
153 INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR / A-DECK 
A couple of people have come out into the corridor in robes and slippers. A STeWARD hurries along, reassuring them. 
WOMAN 
Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder? 
STEWARD #1 
I shouldn't worry, m'am. We've likely thrown a propeller blade, that's the shudder you felt. May I bring you anything? 
THOMAS ANDREWS brushes past them, walking fast and carrying an armload of rolled up ship's plans. 
CUT TO: 
154 EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK 
Jack and Rose are leaning over the starboard rail, looking at the hull of the ship. 
JACK 
Looks okay. I don't see anything. 
ROSE 
Could it have damaged the ship? 
JACK 
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay. 
Behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck, laughing. 
CUT TO: 
155 INT. STEERAGE FORWARD 
Fabrizio and Tommy are in a crowd of steerage men clogging the corridors, heading aft away from the flooding. Many of them have grabbed suitcases and duffel bags, some of which are soaked. 
TOMMY 
If this is the direction the rats were runnin', it's good enough for me. 
CUT TO: 
156 INT. CORRIDOR ON B DECK 
Bruce Ismay, dressed in pajamas under the topcoat, hurries down the corridor, headed for the bridge. An officious steward named BARNES comes along the other direction, getting the few concerned passengers back into their rooms. 
STEWARD BARNES 
There's no cause for alarm. Please, go back to your rooms. 
He is stopped in his tracks by Cal and Lovejoy. 
My God. 
CUT TO: 
172 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT 
Lightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. One first class woman is barefoot. Others are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are in bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns, then topping it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, even small dogs. 
Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him. He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the steam... 
LIGHTOLLER 
Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir? 
Smith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of him. Lightoller sees the awesome truth in Smith's face. 
LIGHTOLLER 
(to the men) 
Right! Start the loading. Women and children! 
The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes. 
ON WALLACE HARTLEY raising his violin to play. 
HARTLEY 
Number 26. Ready and-- 
The band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side, near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. They strike up a waltz, lively and elegant. The music wafts all over the ship. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Ladies, please. Step into the boat. 
Finally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of the drop to the water far below. 
WOMAN IN CROWD 
You watch. They'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, and we'll all be back on board by breakfast. 
Cal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band. 
RUTH 
My brooch, I left my brooch. I must have it! 
She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing to let her go. The firmness of his hold surprises her. 
CAL 
Stay here, Ruth. 
Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time. 
CUT TO: 
173 INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT / CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL 
It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children. Some have lifebelts on, others don't. 
STEWARD #2 
(to Steward #3) 
I told the stupid sods no luggage. Aw, bloody hell! 
He throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases and bags, completely blocking the corridor. 
Fabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other way. They rech a huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the MAIN 3RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabrizio spots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently with suitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him. 
Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. There is a steel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamen on the other side. 
STEWARD 
Stay calm, please. It's not time to go up to the boats yet. 
Near Tommy, an IRISHWOMAN stands stoically with two small children and their battered luggage. 
LITTLE BOY 
What are we doing, mummy? 
WOMAN 
We're just waiting, dear. When they fiish putting First Class people in the boats, they'll be startin' with us, and we'll want to be all ready, won't we? 
CUT TO: 
174 EXT. STARBOARD SIDE 
Boat 7 is less than half full, with 28 aboard a boat made for 65. 
FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH 
Lower away! By the left and right together, stady lads! 
The boat lurches as the falls start to pay out through the pulley blocks. The women gasp. The boat descends, swaying and jerking, toward the water 60 feet below. The passengers are terrified. 
CUT TO: 
175 EXT. / INT. TITANIC HULL AND MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE 
TRACKING along the rows of portholes angling down into the water. Under the surface, they glow green. PUSHING IN on one porthole which is have submerged. Inside we see Jack, looking apprehensively at the water rising up the glass. 
INSIDE THE MASTER AT ARMS' OFFICE Jack sits chained to the waterpipe, next to the porthole. Lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. He puts a .45 bullet on the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. He picks up the bullet. 
LOVEJOY 
You know... I believe this ship may sink. 
(crosses to Jack) 
I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation... 
He punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. 
LOVEJOY 
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. 
Lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and puts it in his pocket. He exits. Jack is left gasping, handcuffed to the pipe. 
CUT TO: 
176 EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE, FORWARD 
At the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe light the first distress rocket. It shoots into the sky and EXPLODES with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starbursts which light up the entire deck as they fall. 
WHIP PAN off the starbursts to Ismay. The Managing Director of White Star Line is cracking. Already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, the rocket panics him. He starts shouting at the officers struggling with the falls of BOAT 5. 
ISMAY 
There is no time to waste! 
(yelling and waving his arms) 
Lower away! Lower away! Lower away! 
FIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, looks up from the tangled falls at the madman. 
LOWE 
Get out of the way, you fool! 
ISMAY 
Do you know who I am? 
Lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay. 
LOWE 
You're a passenger. And I'm a ship's bloody officer. Now do what you're told! 
(MORE) 
LOWE (CONT'D)

Steady men! Stand by the falls!

Yes, quite right. Sorry.

SECOND OFFICER LIGHTOLLER is loading the boat nearest Cal and Rose... Boat 
LIGHTOLLER 
Women and children only! Sorry sir, no men yet. 
Another rocket bursts overhead, lighting the crowd. Startled faces turn upward. Fear now in the eyes. 
DANIEL MARVIN has his Biograph camera set up, cranking away... hoping to get an exposure off the rocket's light. he has Mary posed in front of the scene at the boats. 
MARVIN 
The operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift. 
CUT TO: 
184 EXT. OCEAN / BOAT 6 
Molly and the two seamen are rowing, and they've made it a hundret feet or so. Enough to see that the ship is angled down into the water, with the bow rail less than ten feet above the surface. 
MOLLY 
Come on girls, join in, it'll keep ya warm. Let's go Ruth. Grab an oar! 
Ruth just stares at the spectacle of the great liner, its rows of lights blazing, slanting down into the sullen black mirror of the Atlanic. 
CUT TO: 
185 INT. FIRST CLASS ELEVATOR / CORRIDORS 
Through the wrought iron door of the elevator car Rose can see the decks going past. The lift slows. Suddenly ICE WATER is swirling around her legs. She SCREAMS in surprise. So does the operator. 
The car has landed in a foot of freezing water, shocking the hell out of her. She claws the door open and splashes out, hiking up her floor-length skirt so she can move. The lift goes back up, behind her, as she looks around. 
ROSE 
Left, crew passage. 
She spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place is understandably deserted. She is on her own. 
ROSE 
Right, right... right. 
She turns into a cross-corridor, splashing down the hall. A row of doors on each side. 
ROSE 
Jack? Jaaacckk?? 
CUT TO: 
186 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR 
Jack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until he turns red. He collapses back on the bench. realizing he's screwed. Then he hears her through the door. 
JACK 
ROSE!! In here! 
187 IN THE HALL Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back, locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave. 
She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him. 
ROSE 
Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. 
They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing. 
JACK 
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. 
ROSE 
I know, I know. 
JACK 
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one. 
She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk. 
JACK 
So... how did you find out I didn't do it? 
ROSE 
I didn't. 
(she looks at him) 
I just realized I already knew. 
They share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searching drawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out. 
A LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below. 
CUT TO: 
188 EXT. TITANIC / BOAT ONE 
While the seamen detach the falls, Boat One rocks next to the hull. Lucile and Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon sit with ten others in a boat made for four times that many. 
LUCILE 
I despise small boats. I just know I'm going to be seasick. I always get seasick in small boats. Good Heavens, there's a man down there. 
In a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees Jack looking up at her... a face in a bubble of light under the water. 
CUT TO: 
189 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE 
Rose stops trashing the room, and stands there, breathing hard. 
ROSE 
There's no key in here. 
They look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. Jack has pulled his feet up onto the bench. 
JACK 
You have to go for help. 
ROSE 
(nodding) 
I'll be right back. 
JACK 
I'll wait here. 
She runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, then splashes away. Jack looks down at the swirling water. 
CUT TO: 
190 INT. STAIRWELL AND CORRIDORS 
Rose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck. She climbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail. The weight of it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons and shimmies quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in her stockings and knee-length slip, to find herself in-- 
191 A LONG CORRIDOR... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward. She is alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as the ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, unimpeded now. 
ROSE 
Hello? Somebody?! 
She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hall slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin of the water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through the water, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, his eyes crazed... 
ROSE 
Help me! We need help! 
He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs with terrifying sounds. 
The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then they come back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment of blackness was the most terrifying of her life. 
A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He is upset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by the arm, pulling her with him like a wayward child. 
STEWARD 
Come on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right. 
ROSE 
Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's-- 
STEWARD 
No need for panic, miss. Come along! 
ROSE 
No, let me go! You're going the wrong way! 
He's not listening. And he won't let her go. 
She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the nose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back. 
STEWARD 
To Hell with you! 
ROSE 
See you there, buster! 
The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Just the way Jack taugh: her. 
She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes the axe, running back the way she came. 
192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the bottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along the corridor to the room where Jack is trapped. 
you go, I go. Don't argue with me, Isador, you know it does no good. 
He looks at her with sadness and great love. They embrace gently. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Lower away!! 
CUT TO: 
198 EXT. BRIDGE / FORWARD WELL DECK / FOC'SLE 
AT THE BOW... the place where Jack and Rose first kissed... the bow railing goes under water water. Water swirls around the captsans and windlasses on the foc'sle deck. 
Smith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well deck. Water is shipped over the sides and the well deck is awash. Two men run across the deck, their feet sending up spray. Behind Smith, Boxhall fires another rocket. WHOOSH!

201 INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL 
Fabrizio, standing with Helga Dahl and her family, hears Jack's voice. 
JACK 
Fabrizio! Fabri! 
Fabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the crowd. He and Jack hug like brothers. 
FABRIZIO 
The boats are all going. 
JACK 
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy? 
Fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to the stairwell. 
Tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head of the stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women are squeezing through. 
STEWARD #2 
Women only. No men. No men!! 
But some terrified men, not understanding English, try to rush through the gap, forcing the gate open. The crewmen and stewards push them back, shoving and punching them. 
STEWARD #2 
Get back! Get back you lot! 
(to the crewmen) 
Lock it!! 
They struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward #2 brandishes a small revolver. Another holds a fire axe. They lock the gate, and a cry goes up among the crowd, who surge forward, pounding against the steel and shouting in several languages. 
TOMMY 
For the love of God, man, there are children down here! Let us up, so we can have a chance! 
But the crewmen are scared now. They have let the situation get out of hand, and now they have a mob. Tommy gives up and pushes his way back through the crowd, going down the stairs. He rejoins Jack, Rose and Fabrizio. 
TOMMY 
It's hopeless that way. 
JACK 
Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast. 
Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood. 
FABRIZIO 
(with a lot of hand gestures) 
Everyone... all of you... come with me now. We go to the boats. We go to the boats. Capito? Come now! 
They can't understand what he's saying. They can see his urgency, but OLUF DAHL, the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. He will not panic, and will not let his family go with this boy. Fabrizio turns to Helga. 
FABRIZIO 
Helga... per favore... please... come with me, I am lucky. Is my destiny to go to America. 
She kisses him, then steps back to be with her family. Jack lays a hand on his shoulder, his eyes saying "Let's go". 
FABRIZIO 
I will never forget you. 
He turns to Jack, who leads the way out of the crowd. Looking back Fabrizio sees her face disappear into the crowd.

CLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pulls out two stacks of bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out "Heart of the Ocean", putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks the safe. 
CAL 
(holding up stacks of bills) 
I make my own luck. 
LOVEJOY 
(putting the .45 in his waistband) 
So do I. 
Cal grins, putting the money in his pocket as they go out. 
CUT TO: 
205 INT. STEERAGE, AFT 
Jack, Rose, Fabrizio and Tommy are lost, searching for a way out. They push past confused passengers... past a mother changing her baby's diaper on top of an upturned steamer trunk... past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in Serbo-Croatian, a wailing child next to them... past a man kneeling to console a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing... and past another man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out what the signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently. 
Jack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks before they are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate. The steerage men are yelling at a scared STEWARD. 
STEWARD 
Go to the main stairwell, with everyone else. It'll all get sorted out there. 
Jack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it. 
JACK 
God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!! 
He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He starts pulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it breaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the stairs between the waiting people. 
ROSE 
Move aside! Quickly, move aside! 
Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATE with all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward, narrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rose steps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone: 
ROSE 
If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job

206 EXT. BOAT 6 / TITANIC - NIGHT 
Ruth rows with Molly Brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors. She rests on her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship. 
It slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. Nothing is above water forward of the bridge except for the foremast. Another rocket goes off, lighting up the entire area... there are a dozen boats moving outward from the ship. 
207 AT THE BOAT DECK RAIL Captain Smith is shouting to Boat 6 through a large metal megaphone. 
SMITH 
Come back! Come back to the ship! 
CHIEF OFFICER WILDE joins him, blowing his silver whistle. 
208 FROM BOAT 6 the whistle comes shrilly across the water. Quartermaster Hitchins grips the rudder in fear. 
HITCHINS 
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going. 
MOLLY 
We got room for lots more. I say we go back. 
HITCHINS 
CAL 
God damn it to hell! Come on. 
He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through the bridge. 
Bruce Ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into Collapsible C. He stares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's eyes. 
MURDOCH 
(staring at Ismay) 
Take them down. 
CUT TO: 
221 EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE - NIGHT 
ON THE PORT SIDE Lightoller is getting people into Boat 2. He keeps his pistol in his hand at this point. Twenty feet below them the sea is pouring into the doors and windows of B deck staterooms. They can hear the roar of water cascading into the ship. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Women and children, please. Women and children only. Step back, sir. 
Even with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering in the cold. Near her a WOMAN with TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS looks into the eyes of a HUSBAND she knows she may not see again 
HUSBAND 
Goodbye for a little while... only for a little while. 
(to his two little girls) 
Go with mummy. 
The woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears from them. Beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion. 
HUSBAND 
Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl. That's right. 
Some of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to be helped into the boats. A MAN scribbles a note and hands it to a woman who is about to board. 
MAN 
Please get this to my wife in DeMoines, Iowa. 
Jack looks at Tommy and Fabrizio. 
JACK 
You better check out the other side. 
They nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse. 
ROSE 
I'm not going without you. 
JACK 
Get in the boat, Rose. 
Cal walks up just then. 
CAL 
Yes. Get in the boat, Rose. 
She is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks at her, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking display in 1912. 
CAL 
My God, look at you. 
(taking off his boat) 
Here, put this on. 
She numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not the cold. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Quickly, ladies. Step into the boat. Hurry, please! 
JACK 
Go on. I'll get the next one. 
ROSE 
No. Not without you! 
She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He sees the emotion between Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to her and says... 
CAL 
(low) 
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us. 
JACK 
(he smiles reassuringly) 
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch. 
CAL 
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full. 
Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out for Jack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herself stepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Lower away! 
The two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend. 
CAL 
(low) 
You're a good liar. 
JACK 
Almost as good as you. 
CAL 
I always win, Jack. One way or another. 
(looks at him, smiling) 
Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning. 
Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste a second of his last view of her. 
222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through the pulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightoller giving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in her ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling... 
Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face. 
SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reaches the gunwale, climbing it... 
Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catching it, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose is back on Titanic. 
JACK 
No Rose! NOOOO!! 
Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to A-Deck. 
Hockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, this gutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all thought. 
CUT TO: 
223 INT. GRAND STAIRCASE 
TRACKING WITH JACK as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints down the stairs. He sees her coming into A-deck foyer, running toward him, Cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs. 
They meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace. 
JACK 
Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot-- 
And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can. 
ROSE 
You jump, I jump, right? 
JACK 
Right. 
Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them locked in their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HAND on him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband in one cobra-fast move. 
He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing above them he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES. 
The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pulls Rose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again, running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oak panelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of stairs. 
Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes sprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, and reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.

Jack and Rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship groans and torgues around them. 
CUT TO: 
234 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE 
Murdoch, at Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd is threatening to rush the boat. They push and jostle, yelling and shouting at the officers. The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy falls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below. 
TOMMY 
Give us a chance to live, you limey bastards! 
Murdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd. 
MURDOCH 
I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me. 
Cal steps up to him. 
CAL 
We had a deal, damn you. 
Murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal. 
MURDOCH 
Get back! 
A man next to Tommy rushes forward, and Tommy is shoved from behind. Murdoch SHOOTS the first man, and seeing Tommy coming forward, puts a bullet into his chest. 
Tommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as his life flows out over the deck. 
Murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. Then he puts the pistol to his temple and... BLAM! He drops like a puppet with the strings cut and topples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet below. 
Cal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black water. The MONEY FLOATS out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading across the surface. 
The crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat. 
PURSER MCELROY 
(calling above the confusion) 
Any more women or children?! 
THE CHILD crying in the alcove. Cal scoops her up and runs forward, cradling her in his arms. 
CAL 
(forcing his way through the crowd) 
Here's a child! I've got a child! 
CAL (CONT'D) 
(to McElroy) 
Please... I'm all she has in the world. 
McElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun, brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into the boat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women. 
CAL 
There, there. 
CUT TO: 
235 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKE ROOM 
Thomas Andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the large painting above the mantle. The fire is still going in the fireplace. 
The room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off the table. Behind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. They run through, toward the aft revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. She sees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table. 
ROSE 
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews? 
ANDREWS 
(a tear rolls down his cheek) 
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose. 
JACK 
(to her) 
It's going fast... we've got to keep moving. 
Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her. 
ANDREWS 
Good luck to you, Rose. 
ROSE 
(hugging him) 
And to you, Mr. Andrews. 
Jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door. 
CUT TO: 
236 EXT. BOAT DECK AND VARIOUS LOCATIONS 
The band finishes the waltz. Wallace Hartley looks at the orchestra members. 
HARTLEY 
Right, that's it then. 
They leave him, walking forward along the deck. Hartley puts his violin to his chin and bows the first notes of "Nearer My God to Thee". One by one the band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody. 
Without a word they walk back and take their places. They join in with Hartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on this still night. The vocalist begins: "If in my dreams I be, nearer my God to thee..." 
THE HYMN PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE: 
237 A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as he walks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through him. Without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the enclosed WHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleaming brass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse. 
238 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pulls out his pocketwatch and checks the time. Then he opens the face of the mantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything must be correct. 
239 IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE water swirls in from the private promenade deck. Rose's paintings are submerged. The Picasso tranforms under the water's surface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies come to life. 
240 DOWNANGLE on the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on a bed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss stare at the ceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water pours into the room through a doorway. It swirls around the bed, two feet deep rising fast. 
241 IN A STEERAGE CABIN somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the young IRISH MOTHER, seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking her two young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making sure they are all warm and cozy. She lies down with them on the bed, speaking soothingly and holding them. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BOAT DECK / BRIDGE 
242 IN A WIDE SHOT we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the bridge house sinks into the water. 
243 ON THE PORT SIDE Collapsible B is picked up by water. Working frantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't drag it under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he saws furiously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, still upside down, is swept off the ship. Men start diving in, swimming to stay with it. 
244 IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he has completely forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as they work, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't drag the collapsible under. 
Fabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles to put it on as the water rises around him. 
245 CAPTAIN SMITH, standing near the wheel, watches the black water climbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the stricken expression of a damned sould on Judgment Day. The windows burst suddenly and a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. He disappears in a vortex of foam. 
246 Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. It partially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. Over a hundred passengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boat becomes a frenzy of splashing, screaming people. 
As men are trying to climb into the callapsible, Cal grabs an oar and pushes them back into the water. 
CAL 
Get back! You'll swamp us! 
Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes and pulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he is dragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks back to the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water. 
247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them. He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers his violin. 
HARTLEY 
Gentlemen, it has been a previlege playing with you tonight. 
CUT TO: 
248 EXT. A-DECK AFT, PORT SIDE 
Jack and Rose run out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. Jack pushes his way to the rail and looks at the state of the ship. The bridge is under water and tehre is chaos on deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on. People stream around them, shouting and pushing. 
JACK 
Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as possible. 
They push their way aft through the panicking crowd. 
CUT TO: 
249 EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL 
Collapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the sining ship. It slams against the side of the forward funnel. 
CAL 
(to the crew in the boat) 
Row! Row you bastards!! 
Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massive stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water. 
Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the ship seemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation. 
SEVERAL PEOPLE 
We're saved! 
Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly. 
Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight of the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF ASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches, railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts. 
The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty. 
People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck, screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other people loose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at the forward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one. 
JACK 
We have to move! 
He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified to move. He grabs her hand. 
JACK 
Come on! I've got you! 
Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as the railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her fiercely. 
The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable. 
Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators. 
Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are the gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern. 
Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them. Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment. 
JOUGHIN 
(nodding a greeting) 
Helluva night. 
The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Looking down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and Rose. 
JACK 
(talking fast) 
Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship will suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of my hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me. 
She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder. 
ROSE 
I trust you. 
Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet. 
278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name TITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the water. 
Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean. 
CUT TO: 
279 EXT. OCEAN / UNDERWATER AND SURFACE 
Bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them. 
280 Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holding tightly to Rose, pulling her up. 
281 AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some are stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning, shouting... screaming. 
Jack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, 4 degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire. 
A man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. Jack PUNCHES him repeatedly, pulling her free. 
JACK 
Swim, Rose! SWIM! 
She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water. 
JACK 
Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it. 
All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a chorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black water stretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming. 
CUT TO: 
282 OMITTED 
283 EXT. OCEAN 
Jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing. 
JACK 
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. 
ROSE 
It's so cold. 
JACK 
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. 
His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them. Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turns and... SCREAMS. 
A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG, swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes bugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland. 
Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water. 
ROSE 
What's that? 
Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down. 
But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges, almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. He clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best he can. 
Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. A MAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns him back. 
JACK 
It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under. 
MAN 
Let me try at least, or I'll die soon. 
JACK 
You'll die quicker if you come any closer. 
MAN 
Yes, I see. Good luck to you then. 
(swimming off) 
God bless. 
CUT TO: 
284 EXT. COLLAPSIBLE A / OCEAN 
The boat is overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the sides in the water. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standing in the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning. 
CAL 
Stay back! Keep off! 
Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. Cal CLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp. 
FABRIZIO 
You don't... understand... I have... to get... to America. 
CAL 
(pointing with the oar) 
It's that way! 
CLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see the spirit leave him. 
FABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon in a tuxedo. The image fades to black. 
CUT TO: 
285 EXT. OCEAN 
JACK AND ROSE still float amid a chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship's officer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously, knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles. 
JACK 
The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back. 
She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips blue and her teeth chattering. 
ROSE 
Thank God for you Jack. 
(barely audible) 
Jack. 
She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost. 
He seems to be sleeping peacefully. 
But he is not asleep. 
Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her. 
ROSE 
Oh, Jack. 
All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go. 
She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try. 
And then... her eyes snap open. 
She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles to draw breath, calling again. 
292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something ahead, turning the tiller. 
293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film. 
ROSE 
I won't let go. I promise. 
She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane. 
Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across the still water. 
294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle. 
LOWE 
(turning the tiller) 
Row back! That way! Pull! 
Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowe takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slips into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
295 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH 
EXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present day. 
OLD ROSE 
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred. 
As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the salvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality of what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. With her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first time, they do feel like graverobbers. 
Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond. 
OLD ROSE 
Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
296 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - PRE-DAWN 
MATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved. 
DISSOLVE TO: ANOTHER BOAT, and then ANOTHER, seeing faces we know among the survivors: Ismay in a trance, just staring and trembling... Cal, sipping from a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker... Ruth hugging herself, rocking gently. 
IN BOAT 14: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her face is visile, white as the moon. The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Soon everyone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it is all silent, SLOW MOTION. 
IN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all human emotion. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
298 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - DAWN 
Golden lgiht washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm sea reflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships, are icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits nearby, as boats row toward her. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
299 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN / CARPATHIA MONTAGE - DAY 
IMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship's hull looming, with the letters CARPATHIA visible on the bow... Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face blank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's gangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship... ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, so gentle and sad, part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever. 
THE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside of herself, coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... Rose being draped wtih warm blankets and given hot tea... BRUCE ISMAY climbing aboard. He has the face and eyes of a damned soul. 
As Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. He must run the gauntlet of their accusing gazes. 
CUT TO: 
300 EXT. DECK / CARPATHIA - DAY 
It is the afternoon of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck, looking for Rose. The deck of Carpathia is crammed with huddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatch cover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts. 
He keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a steward approaches him. 
CARPATHIA STEWARD 
You won't find any of your people back here, sir. It's all steerage. 
Cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another. 
Rose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he approaches her. He barely recognizes her. She looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging in her eyes. 
ROSE 
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you. 
CAL 
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you-- 
She holds up her hand, stopping him. 
ROSE 
Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is something you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I for you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me. In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased. 
She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their lives. 
ROSE 
Is this in any way unclear? 
CAL 
(after a long beat) 
What do I tell your mother? 
ROSE 
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic. 
She stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken with emotion. 
CAL 
You're precious to me, Rose. 
ROSE 
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley. 
We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her. 
After a moment, he turns and walks away. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read. 
301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She gazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming her home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind. 
302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54. Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an amazing tableau. 
Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press-- 
Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalent of a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions. 
Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER 
Name? 
ROSE 
Dawson. Rose Dawson. 
The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium flashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a sudden disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to embrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. The reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode. 
Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through the jostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the confusion. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
Can you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic? 
TRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashes and the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined.

PAUL Everything stays as it is! 
WOODLY A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat. 
PAUL (hotly) My father! 
WOODLY I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma? 
PAUL Don't worry about it. 
WOODLY How's the fungus around your thumbnail? 
PAUL (concealing the thumb) It's fine! 
WOODLY It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now. (unrolling the poster) Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety. 
PENELOPE (reading) "War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely. 
WOODLY No doubt Paul thinks it stinks. 
Lion doorbell roars. 
WOODLY I hate that thing. 
PAUL (going to the door) Keeps fairies away! 
He admits HERB SHUTTLE, who carries an Electrolux vacuum cleaner. 
SHUTTLE (to PAUL affectionately, touching him) Hi kid. (seeing WOODLY) Would you look what the car dragged in. 
WOODLY I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner. 
SHUTTLE Is that a fact? 
WOODLY That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom. 
PENELOPE Please-- 
SHUTTLE He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom. 
PENELOPE I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon. (to all) Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone? 
All freeze, except for PENELOPE, who comes forward to address the audience.  Lights on set fade as spotlight comes on. 
PENELOPE Most men shunned me--even when I nearly swooned for want of love.  I might as well have been girdled in a chastity belt.  My chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and chickenwire, but of Harold's lethal reputation. 
SHUTTLE comes into the spotlight. 
SHUTTLE I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us. 
PENELOPE Doing what? 
SHUTTLE He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is. 
PENELOPE Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know. 
SHUTTLE He'd assume we had. 
PENELOPE That's something I suppose. 
SHUTTLE All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up. 
PENELOPE I'm glad. 
SHUTTLE I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University. 
PENELOPE I know. 
SHUTTLE If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt. 
WOODLY Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines. 
SHUTTLE (to PAUL) You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day? 
WOODLY He died of a massive rupture. 
SHUTTLE You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny. (to PAUL) Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow. 
WOODLY You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque? (to PAUL) Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains! 
PENELOPE enters from the bedroom, dressed for the fight. She wears barbaric jewelry HAROLD gave her years ago, a jaguar-skin coat over her shoulders. 
PENELOPE (brightly) Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long. 
SHUTTLE Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat. 
PENELOPE Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go? 
WOODLY (sick about the slain jaguars) Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool. 
PENELOPE What? 
WOODLY Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you. 
SHUTTLE She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks. (to PAUL) Your mother looks beautiful--right? (PAUL pointedly declines to answer) Kid? (PAUL walks away from him) Doesn't your mother look nice? (he goes to PAUL, wondering what is wrong) Paul? 
PAUL (smolderingly) I don't care what she wears. 
SHUTTLE Something's made you sore. 
PAUL Don't worry about it. 
SHUTTLE You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong? 
PAUL (close to angry tears) It's my father's birthday--that's all. (facing everybody, raising his voice) That's all.  Who cares about that? 
SHUTTLE (horrified, raising his hand to swear an oath) I had not the slightest inkling. (to PENELOPE, feeling betrayed) Why didn't you say so? 
PAUL (bitterly) She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun! (to PENELOPE) I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it. (to WOODLY) Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far. 
SHUTTLE (reaching out for PAUL) Kid--kid-- 
PAUL (to SHUTTLE) And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts! 
SHUTTLE (reaching out again) What's this? 
PAUL (recoiling) Don't! 
SHUTTLE (aghast) You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight. 
PAUL Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here. 
He grabs a jacket from a chair.  SHUTTLE is in his way. 
PAUL Don't touch me.  Get out of the way. 
SHUTTLE Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl? 
PENELOPE (to PAUL) Where will you be? 
PAUL Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten. 
SHUTTLE I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment. 
PAUL (at the door) Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too. 
He exits through front door, slams it. 
SHUTTLE (heartbroken) Kid--kid-- 
WOODLY Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me. 
PENELOPE And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there! 
WOODLY They didn't murder me. 
PENELOPE Paul's only twelve years old. 
WOODLY He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound. 
PENELOPE We've got to rescue him. 
WOODLY If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that. 
PENELOPE He's not your son. 
WOODLY No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight." (pause) On that we can build. 
PENELOPE It's a jungle out there. 
WOODLY That's been said before. 
PENELOPE He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged. 
Lion doorbell roars. 
WOODLY I hate that thing. 
He opens the door, admits SHUTTLE, who carries a bakery box. 
PENELOPE Did you see him? 
SHUTTLE Yeah. 
PENELOPE Is he all right? 
SHUTTLE Far as I know. 
PENELOPE Is he coming home? 
SHUTTLE He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park. 
PENELOPE The park! 
SHUTTLE It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is! 
SHUTTLE I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another. 
PENELOPE (disgusted with him) You figure! 
SHUTTLE Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake. 
PENELOPE A what? 
SHUTTLE For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake. 
PENELOPE How nice. 
SHUTTLE They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else." 
WOODLY "Happy Birthday, Wanda June!" 
SHUTTLE We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife. 
PENELOPE Did you talk to Paul? 
SHUTTLE Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door. 
PENELOPE We've got to find him. (preparing to exit through front door) I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. (to WOODLY) And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home. (to SHUTTLE) That's all he said--the thing about the key? 
WOODLY I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency. 
HAROLD is unstirred. 
WOODLY I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later. 
HAROLD Ahh--then she's still alive. 
WOODLY She's fine.  Please-- 
HAROLD And still Mrs. Harold Ryan? 
WOODLY Will you please go?  An emergency! 
HAROLD She still has just the one child-- the boy? 
He moves slowly toward the front door, with WOODLY trying to hustle him and LOOSELEAF out. 
WOODLY Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy! 
HAROLD (stopping) And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan? 
WOODLY Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall. 
HAROLD And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters? 
WOODLY Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now! 
HAROLD moves a little more, stops again. 
HAROLD Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all? 
WOODLY (at the end of his patience, blurting) And her fiancé! 
HAROLD (delighted) And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman? 
WOODLY I've got to run! 
He turns out the overhead light. 
HAROLD You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes. 
WOODLY (holding open the front door) I've literally got to run! 
HAROLD I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was. 
All three exit.  A moment later, HAROLD lets himself and LOOSELEAF in again with a key.  He turns on the light again, roams the room, reacquainting himself with his beloved trophies.  LOOSELEAF is jangled by the adventure.  HAROLD chucks a lioness under her chin. 
HAROLD Miss me, baby? 
LOOSELEAF I dunno, boy. 
HAROLD Hm? 
LOOSELEAF It's a bitch. 
HAROLD (quietly) A bitch. 
LOOSELEAF Didn't recognize you. 
HAROLD We've never met. 
LOOSELEAF I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants. 
HAROLD I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't. 
LOOSELEAF I'm gonna wet my pants. 
He laughs idiotically. 
HAROLD ignores this, attempts to savor the ghosts in the room. 
LOOSELEAF You know what gets me? 
HAROLD Go home! 
LOOSELEAF Thank God we found the fucking diamonds! 
HAROLD The hell with the diamonds! 
LOOSELEAF You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich. 
HAROLD Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change! 
LOOSELEAF Can I have the Cadillac? 
HAROLD Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care. 
LOOSELEAF What'll you do for transportation? 
HAROLD I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home! 
LOOSELEAF You know what gets me about that Cadillac? 
HAROLD Go home! 
LOOSELEAF When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch. 
HAROLD Go home. 
LOOSELEAF I'm liable to find anything! 
HAROLD That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up. 
LOOSELEAF I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was. 
HAROLD So long, Colonel. 
LOOSELEAF You know what gets me? 
HAROLD (taking hold of LOOSELEAF and steering him to the front door) Let's talk about it some other time. 
LOOSELEAF How short the skirts are. 
HAROLD (opening the door) Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful. 
LOOSELEAF Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone. 
HAROLD shoves him out of the apartment and shuts the door. HAROLD starts to roam the room again, but the lion doorbell roars. 
HAROLD (going to the door) Hell! 
HAROLD opens the door.  LOOSELEAF comes in. 
LOOSELEAF You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy! 
HAROLD Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months! 
LOOSELEAF Months? 
HAROLD I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways. 
LOOSELEAF (bleakly, shrugging) I'm lonesome already. 
He exits. 
HAROLD (roaming the room again) The moon.  The new heroism--put a village idiot into a pressure cooker, seal it up tight, and shoot him at the moon. (to his portrait) Hello there, young man.  In case you're wondering, I could beat the shit out of you.  And any woman choosing between us--sorry, kid, she'd choose me. (pleased with the room) I must say, this room is very much as I left it. (sees the cake) What's this?  A cake? "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"?  Who the hell is Wanda June? 
Blackout. 
HAROLD Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me. 
PENELOPE What do you do for a living? 
HAROLD My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there. 
PENELOPE Some kind of animal? 
HAROLD The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man. 
Blackout. 
SCENE SIX 
CURTAIN rises on empty living room.  PAUL lets himself in with a key. 
PAUL Mom? (silence) Herb? (silence) Dr. Woodly? (advances into room uneasily) Hello? (sees the cake) A cake?  Who's Wanda June? 
HAROLD enters quietly from the kitchen, holding a can of beer. 
PAUL Anybody home? 
HAROLD As a matter of fact-- 
PAUL (nearly jumping out of his skin) Sir? 
HAROLD As a matter of fact--I am home. 
PAUL (thinking HAROLD may be a burglar) Hello. 
HAROLD (simply) Hello. 
PAUL Are you-- 
His voice fails him. 
HAROLD (hoping to be recognized) You were about to ask a question? 
PAUL Are you--do you-- 
HAROLD Ask it! 
PAUL (blurting) Do you know who Wanda June is? 
HAROLD Life has denied me that thrill. 
PAUL Do you mind if I ask who you are? 
HAROLD Mind? (aside) God, yes, I mind. (to PAUL) I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago. 
PAUL Dr. Woodly. 
HAROLD Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list. 
PAUL Is anybody besides you here now? 
HAROLD The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth. 
PAUL Where's Mom? 
HAROLD You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night? 
PAUL She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess. 
HAROLD You think you could find me a pencil and paper? 
PAUL I'll see. 
He rummages through a drawer. 
PAUL (slightly dismayed at such murderousness) "The sting." 
HAROLD Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis. 
PAUL Tell me that. 
HAROLD I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand. 
PAUL (his excitement rising) Tell me that!  Tell me that! 
HAROLD Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. 
PAUL Wow. 
HAROLD We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name! 
PAUL Mhravitch. 
HAROLD We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound. 
PAUL (involuntarily) Uck. 
HAROLD Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet? 
PAUL I don't know. 
HAROLD The story gets hairier.  Should I stop? 
PAUL Go on. 
HAROLD We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there. 
PAUL Where did you get the poison? 
HAROLD We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time. 
PAUL And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia." 
Blackout. 
SCENE SEVEN 
SILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  The sounds of a Nazi rally come up slowly: "Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!"  Spotlight comes up on MAJOR SIEGFRIED VON KONIGSWALD, and officer in the dreaded SS.  He is in full ceremonial uniform.  The sounds fade. 
VON KONIGSWALD (sadly, resignedly, remembering) Ja ja.  Ja ja. (pause) I am Major Siegfried von Konigswald. They used to call me "The Beast of Yugoslavia," on account of all the people I had tortured and shot--and hanged.  We'd bop 'em on the head. We'd hook 'em up to the electricity. We'd stick 'em with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff. One time we killed a guy with orange juice.  There was a train wreck, and two of the freight cars were loaded with oranges, so we had oceans of orange juice.  It was a joke--how much orange juice we had. And we were interrogating a guy one day, and he wouldn't talk, and the next thing I know--somebody's filling up this big syringe with orange juice. (pause) There was a guerrilla war going on. You couldn't tell who was a guerrilla and who wasn't. Even if you got one, it was still a civilian you got.  Telling Americans what a guerrilla war is like--that's coals to Newcastle. How do you like that for idiomatic English? "Coals to Newcastle." (laughs) That Harold Ryan--he says he spoke to me in perfect German?  He talks German like my ass chews gum.  I'm glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me.  I sure didn't understand it the first time around.  I figured he was a Lithuanian or something, which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be.  All I knew was he was very proud about something, and he had a machine pistol, and it was aimed at me.  The woods were full of all kinds of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other, and they all had guns.  They were always looking for revenge.  You find a way to bottle revenge--that's the end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola. (pause) Harold Ryan said he killed maybe two hundred guys.  I killed a hundred times that many, I bet. That's still peanuts, of course, compared to what that crazy Looseleaf did.  Harold and me--we was doing it the hard way.  I hope the record books will show that. There should be a little star or something by the names of the guys who did it the hard way. (pause) I'm up in Heaven now, like that little Wanda June kid.  I wasn't hit by no ice-cream truck.  Harold Ryan killed me with his bare hands. He was good.  My eyes popped out. My tongue stuck out like a red banana.  I shit in my pants.  It was a mess. (pause) When I got up on the day I died, I said, "What a beautiful day this is. What a beautiful part of the world." The whole planet was beautiful.  Up here I meet guys from other planets. (laughs) We got some really crazy-looking guys up here.  Their planets weren't anywhere near as nice as Earth.  They had clouds all the time.  They never saw a clear blue sky.  They never saw snow.  They never saw an ocean.  They had some little lakes, but you couldn't go swimming in them.  The lakes were acid.  You go swimming, you dissolve.  We got some guys up here who got shoved in them lakes.  They dissolved. (pause) Harold Ryan stopped talking German to me there in Yugoslavia.  He switched to English, so I finally got some kind of idea what he was so burned up about.  He wanted revenge for the guy we killed with orange juice.  I don't know how he ever found out about it.  There was just three of us there when we did it--me and two regular military doctors.  Somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed.  If I'd lived through the war, and they tried me for war crimes and all that, I'd have to tell the court, I guess, "I was only following orders, as a good soldier should. Hitler told me to kill this guy with orange juice." 
Blackout. 
SCENE EIGHT 
DARKNESS.  Lights come up on living room.  HAROLD has just finished telling his true war story to PAUL. 
HAROLD Mhravitch.  Remember that name. 
PAUL Mhravitch. 
HAROLD The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch. 
PAUL When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch. 
HAROLD It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more. 
PAUL Sir? 
HAROLD The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout. (abruptly) Play lots of contact sports? 
PAUL I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt. 
HAROLD You're supposed to get hurt! 
WOODLY (puzzled by PENELOPE's mood) Are--are you crying, Penelope? 
HAROLD She's crying because she's so happy. 
PENELOPE That's why I'm crying. 
PAUL Dr. Woodly? (indicating HAROLD) You know who this is? 
WOODLY I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father? 
PAUL He isn't any friend of Father. 
WOODLY He isn't? 
PAUL He is my father. 
WOODLY No! 
PENELOPE Eeeeeeeeeeee-yup.  Dr. Woodly--I would like you to meet Harold, my husband.  Harold, this is Dr. Woodly, my fiancé. 
She crosses to the door of the master bedroom, kissing each male lightly as she passes. 
PENELOPE Good night, dear.  Good night, dear. 
She stands in the doorway. 
PENELOPE Stay or go, talk or sulk, laugh or cry--as you wish.  Do whatever seems called for.  My mind is gone. Good night. 
She exits into bedroom, closes the door firmly, locks it audibly. 
WOODLY (dazedly) I feel the same way.  What next? 
HAROLD What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is-- 
WOODLY None. 
HAROLD Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night. 
WOODLY (crushed, without any possible comeback) Good night. 
He exits through the front door.  HAROLD goes at once to PENELOPE's door, tries it, finds it locked. 
HAROLD Penelope!  God damn it!  Penelope! 
He considers kicking down the door, thinks better of this, turns away. 
HAROLD Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt. 
PAUL Is Looseleaf Harper alive? 
HAROLD Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable? (not waiting for an answer, calling again) Penelope! 
PAUL She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes. 
HAROLD Why don't you go to bed--son. 
PAUL I can't take my eyes off you. 
HAROLD Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you? 
HAROLD Can't it keep till morning? 
PAUL She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes." 
HAROLD That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning. 
PAUL Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead. 
HAROLD Penelope! 
HAROLD enters, drained but recovering.  He chews on a root. He has slept in the shirt and trousers he wore the night before.  He is barefoot.  PAUL knocks again. 
PAUL Dr. Woodly? 
There is the sound of WOODLY's door opening.  WOODLY and PAUL speak unintelligibly, WOODLY evidently inviting PAUL in for a moment.  WOODLY's door closes. 
HAROLD What's that all about? 
PENELOPE We thought a doctor might help. 
HAROLD Your old beau? 
PENELOPE We thought it was an emergency. 
HAROLD I don't want that chancre mechanic in here. 
PENELOPE He's a very decent man, Harold. 
HAROLD We all are. 
PENELOPE Shouldn't you lie down? 
HAROLD When I'm dead-- (throwing it away) or fucking. 
PENELOPE Paul said you were awfully sick. 
HAROLD I was, I was.  It never lasts long. 
He hears WOODLY's door open, is alert to WOODLY's approach, continues to speak to PENELOPE absently. 
HAROLD The Indians call it "Zamba- keetya"--the little cloudburst. 
WOODLY and PAUL enter.  WOODLY is correctly professional and carries a little black bag. 
WOODLY Ah!  You're ambulatory! 
HAROLD What a brilliant diagnosis! 
PENELOPE You know what I want? (all look at her) I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends. 
HAROLD Nothing would please me more. 
PENELOPE (believing him) Thank God! 
WOODLY (pleased but careful) Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps? 
HAROLD I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats. 
WOODLY You've been bitten by bats? 
HAROLD Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe. 
WOODLY You have chills? 
HAROLD Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud." 
WOODLY enjoys the joke and the blooming friendship. 
HAROLD You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure. 
WOODLY I was going to ask. 
HAROLD Pacqualinincheewa root. 
WOODLY Would you say that again? 
HAROLD Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back. 
WOODLY I've never heard of it. 
He exits instantly. 
HAROLD Now that's what I call fun. 
PENELOPE Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary. 
HAROLD You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up. 
PENELOPE I did? 
HAROLD We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now. 
PENELOPE A trip, you mean? 
HAROLD I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here. (to PAUL) Go out and play. 
PAUL Play? 
HAROLD Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours. 
PENELOPE He hasn't had breakfast yet. 
HAROLD Buy yourself breakfast. (takes his billfold from his hip pocket, hands PAUL a $100 bill) There we go. 
PAUL A hundred dollars! 
HAROLD The smallest thing I've got. 
PAUL Can I get dressed first? 
HAROLD Make it fast. 
PAUL exits to his bedroom.  HAROLD turns to PENELOPE. 
HAROLD Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon! 
PENELOPE It's so--so stark. 
HAROLD You used to like it stark! 
PENELOPE Just--bang--we have a honeymoon. 
HAROLD (beginning to stalk her cunningly) I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves! 
PENELOPE wants to run, but doesn't. 
HAROLD Good!  You held your ground. 
HAROLD is very close now, but not touching her. 
HAROLD Now--turn around, if you would. 
PENELOPE Turn around? 
HAROLD (laughing) I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around. 
PENELOPE obeys. 
HAROLD I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream. (touches her shoulders gently, expertly) So tense, so tense. 
PENELOPE You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way. 
HAROLD You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time. 
PENELOPE I have a brain. 
HAROLD We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl. 
PAUL (entering, dressed to go out and play) Dad-- 
PENELOPE What happened? 
LOOSELEAF Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out. 
PENELOPE How horrible. 
LOOSELEAF Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody? 
HAROLD Could have happened to anybody. 
LOOSELEAF First Nagasaki--now this. 
HAROLD How about breakfast, wife? 
PENELOPE Breakfast? 
HAROLD (as though to a waitress) Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand? 
PENELOPE turns away. 
HAROLD And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice. 
PENELOPE Mrs. Wheeler is dead. 
HAROLD All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler. (regarding LOOSELEAF, resigning himself to being stuck with his company for a little while longer) Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow. 
PENELOPE That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips. 
HAROLD (honestly mystified) Which one? 
PENELOPE (chokingly) "Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler." 
HAROLD She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that. (suddenly, angrily, slamming a table with his fist) Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow! 
PENELOPE What a honeymoon. 
HAROLD Honeymoon temporarily canceled. (catching sight of PAUL, whose physical appearance really offends him) The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators. 
PENELOPE You're wrong. 
HAROLD Then let me see him go out and get some exercise. (explosively) Right now! 
PAUL goes reeling in terror to the front door, opens it. 
PAUL (to HAROLD, abjectly) What kind of exercise? 
HAROLD Beat the shit out of someone who hates you. 
PAUL exits.  HAROLD pounds on a table. 
HAROLD Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment! 
PENELOPE We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday. 
HAROLD You're a woman, aren't you? 
PENELOPE nods. 
HAROLD Then we have a cook. 
PENELOPE hesitates. 
HAROLD Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now. 
PENELOPE People don't use that word any more. 
HAROLD Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook! 
PENELOPE You leave me so--so without-- without dignity. 
PENELOPE I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me. 
HAROLD That's what you're supposed to say. 
PENELOPE This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness. 
HAROLD You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you! 
PENELOPE I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel. 
HAROLD It couldn't! 
PENELOPE I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours. 
HAROLD (shaking his head) Fish can't feel. 
PENELOPE Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more. (an unexpected, minor insight) Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you. 
HAROLD (sensing danger) Such as?... 
PENELOPE The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots. 
HAROLD Tell me about its sexual roots. 
PENELOPE It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth. 
HAROLD I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had. 
PENELOPE Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there. 
HAROLD Go on. 
PENELOPE (blurting) And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say-- (pause) for revenge. 
HAROLD You learned this in some college course? 
PENELOPE I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that. 
HAROLD (darkly) The doctor. 
PENELOPE Yes. 
HAROLD And what is his most cherished possession? 
PENELOPE (not sensing the drift of the conversation) His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess. 
HAROLD And he keeps it in his apartment? 
PENELOPE (still at sea) Yes. 
HAROLD And no one's there now? 
PENELOPE I don't think so. 
HAROLD That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do. 
PENELOPE (suddenly catching on, sick with fear) What are you going to do? 
HAROLD He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin. 
PENELOPE No you're not! 
HAROLD Why not? 
PENELOPE Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD (promptly and emotionlessly) Goodbye. 
Blackout. 
SCENE TWO 
VON KONIGSWALD                 WANDA JUNE (making peace sign)            (making peace sign) Peace.                         Peace. 
Blackout. SCENE THREE 
SILENCE.  Darkness. 
WOODY WOODPECKER VOICE Ha ha ha ha ha! (pistol shot) You got me, pal. 
Silence.  A baby cries.  Silence.  The lights come up. 
LOOSELEAF Go to the funeral? 
HAROLD Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform! 
LOOSELEAF That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore. 
HAROLD Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare. 
LOOSELEAF Alice would be absolutely tear-ass. 
HAROLD When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear. (raises his glass) To our women. 
LOOSELEAF I didn't know we had any women left. 
HAROLD The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy. 
LOOSELEAF Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap. 
Lion doorbell roars. 
HAROLD (going to the door) This could be my next wife. 
He admits HERB SHUTTLE, who carries a bouquet of roses. 
SHUTTLE (puzzled by HAROLD) Hello. 
HAROLD How are you, honeybunch? 
SHUTTLE Is Penelope in? 
HAROLD The posies are for her? 
SHUTTLE I wanted to apologize. 
HAROLD You've come to the right man. 
SHUTTLE I forgot my vacuum cleaner. 
HAROLD I forget mine for years on end. 
SHUTTLE (suddenly realizing who HAROLD is) Oh my God-- (pause; points) And you are Looseleaf Harper. 
LOOSELEAF Hi. 
SHUTTLE faints. 
HAROLD (crowing) It's what I've dreamed of all my life, Looseleaf!  To have a grown man realize who I was--and faint! (to audience) End of Act Two. 
Blackout. 
ACT THREE 
SCENE ONE 
MILDRED enters drunkenly up aisle, sits precariously on apron of stage and speaks to audience. 
MILDRED Two days later.  The afternoon of the day of Looseleaf Harper's mother-in-law's funeral.  You got it?  Two days later. (pause) You know what happened in Heaven today?  There was a tornado.  I'm not kidding you--there was a Goddamn tornado.  Tore up fifty-six houses, a dance pavilion and a Ferris wheel.  Drove a shuffleboard stick clear through a telephone pole.  Nobody got killed.  Nobody ever gets killed.  They just bounce around a lot.  Then they get up-- and start playing shuffleboard. (pause) I never saw a tornado when I was alive, and I grew up in Oklahoma. There's this big, black, funnel- shaped cloud.  Sounds like a railroad train without the whistle. I had to come to Heaven to see a thing like that.  A lot of people got photographs. (pause) After the tornado was over, a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of me--to use up the roll.  I don't like people who go around taking pictures of everything. Nothing's real to some people unless they've got photographs. (pause) Two days later--right? 
She exits clumsily, the way she came.  Silence.  Lights come up on the living room, which has become a pigpen.  LOOSELEAF, HAROLD, SHUTTLE and PAUL sit around a dinner of nearly raw beefsteak set on the coffee table.  LOOSELEAF wears an ill- fitting uniform, which he has rented. 
LOOSELEAF Okay. (pause) Okay. 
HAROLD You're an imbecile. 
LOOSELEAF I know you think that. 
HAROLD Everybody thinks that. 
LOOSELEAF Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb. 
HAROLD The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life! 
LOOSELEAF (shaking his head) I don't think so. (pause) It could have been. 
HAROLD If what? 
LOOSELEAF If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live." 
HAROLD They were enemies.  We were at war. 
LOOSELEAF Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb. (pause) I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one. 
HAROLD Goodbye, Looseleaf. 
LOOSELEAF walks around and gathers his things. 
LOOSELEAF So long, you guys. 
PENELOPE What will you do, Colonel? 
LOOSELEAF I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys. 
PENELOPE kisses LOOSELEAF.  Everybody but HAROLD acknowledges his departure is some way.  HAROLD turns his back.  LOOSELEAF exits, closes door.  Silence. 
SHUTTLE Who's going to fly our helicopter now? 
HAROLD (blackly, tautly) What? 
SHUTTLE We got to get another pilot. 
HAROLD For what? 
SHUTTLE For Africa. 
HAROLD Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman? 
SHUTTLE You invited me. 
HAROLD To make an ass of yourself. 
SHUTTLE What went wrong? 
HAROLD We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive. 
SHUTTLE Gee whiz-- 
HAROLD It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us. 
SHUTTLE I wouldn't drop my gun. 
HAROLD You're hollow, like a woman. 
SHUTTLE I'm smarter than Looseleaf. 
HAROLD He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one. 
SHUTTLE (close to tears) How do you know how I'd act in Africa? 
HAROLD Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me! 
PENELOPE Like what? 
HAROLD (becoming dangerously physical, seizing a battle-ax) Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response! 
He splits a coffee table with the ax. 
PAUL (rushing in with his .22 rifle at a high port arms) Mom? 
HAROLD What's this? 
PAUL wilts instantly, attempts to make his rifle inconspicuous, harmless, meaningless. 
HAROLD What's this? 
PAUL Nothing. 
HAROLD That's a rifle you have? 
PAUL No. 
HAROLD Of course it is.  Is it loaded? 
PAUL No. 
HAROLD Open the bolt! 
PAUL obeys.  A cartridge pops out. 
HAROLD That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it. 
HAROLD Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs. 
PAUL Gee whiz, Dad-- 
HAROLD Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun! 
PAUL (bleatingly) Dad-- 
HAROLD Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!` 
PENELOPE He's a child! 
HAROLD With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy. 
PENELOPE You're begging him to kill you? 
HAROLD If he thinks he's man enough. 
PENELOPE (amazed by sudden insight) That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead. 
HAROLD I'm teaching my son to be a man. 
PENELOPE So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you. 
HAROLD I plan to live one hundred years! 
PENELOPE No you don't. 
HAROLD If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself? 
PENELOPE Honor, I suppose. 
HAROLD What a handsome word. 
PENELOPE (wonderingly) But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed. 
HAROLD If you've lived a good life, fought well-- 
PENELOPE It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all. 
WOODLY I agree. 
WOODLY closes the door.  PENELOPE backs away from the phone, drifts toward PAUL, who still holds his rifle. 
HAROLD This is man to man. 
WOODLY It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing? 
HAROLD What brought you back? 
WOODLY The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like. 
HAROLD (to PENELOPE) He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are. 
PENELOPE This is suicide. (to PAUL) Go get the police. 
HAROLD Stop! 
PAUL stops. 
HAROLD There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth. (to WOODLY) Am I correct? 
WOODLY Yes. 
HAROLD I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct? 
WOODLY Correct. 
HAROLD What an hallucination! (laughs) Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me. 
WOODLY You haven't heard me yet. 
HAROLD You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess? 
WOODLY We'll find out now, won't we? 
PENELOPE No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death? 
HAROLD There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking. 
WOODLY You're a filthy, rotten bastard. 
HAROLD (pretending to be wounded) Oooooo.  That hurt. 
WOODLY You're old--so old. 
HAROLD Now who's being cruel? 
WOODLY A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs. 
HAROLD We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon. 
PENELOPE takes the rifle from PAUL. 
WOODLY You're a son of a bitch. 
HAROLD Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm. 
PENELOPE (leveling the gun) I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything. 
HAROLD Ah!  The lady is armed. 
PENELOPE I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone. 
HAROLD (to WOODLY) Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way. 
PENELOPE I mean it! 
HAROLD Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun. 
He bellies and bullies PENELOPE and PAUL out the front door. 
HAROLD Get the police!  No time to lose! 
He slams the door, turns to WOODLY. 
HAROLD You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that? 
WOODLY I'm high as a kite. 
HAROLD Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again. 
WOODLY You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown. 
HAROLD I love you!  Have a cigar! 
WOODLY (ignoring the cigar) Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete! 
HAROLD I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze? 
WOODLY If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else. 
HAROLD This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that? 
WOODLY You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man. 
HAROLD I'm an honorable clown? 
WOODLY King Arthur. 
HAROLD You hope. 
WOODLY In any event, I will not beg for mercy. 
HAROLD No quarter asked. (taking a sword) No quarter given. 
WOODLY Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew? 
HAROLD (offering sword) Cut me open.  Find out. 
WOODLY I've struck my blow. 
HAROLD With spittle? 
WOODLY I've poisoned you. HAROLD (pointing at WOODLY in horror) Lucretia Borgia? (looking around frantically) Something I drank or touched? (understanding) You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace! 
WOODLY I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown." 
HAROLD Poison. 
WOODLY You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes." 
HAROLD (touching his forehead experimentally) I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there. 
WOODLY You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive? 
HAROLD (blankly, as though in a dream) No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife. 
HAROLD (blankly) I see. 
WOODLY You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself! 
HAROLD (quietly) Don Quixote. 
WOODLY My violin is avenged! 
HAROLD Something seems to have happened to my self-respect. 
WOODLY And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.

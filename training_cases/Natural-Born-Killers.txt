INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF SCREEN. 
MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup. 
MICKEY What kind of pies do you have? 
MABEL Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime. 
MICKEY Which do you recommend? 
MABEL The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste. 
MICKEY I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years. 
MABEL When ya had it, did ya like it? 
MICKEY No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk. 
Mabel turns to her right. 
MABEL (to someone O.S.) Should I make that two pieces? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX, Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back is to the camera as well. 
MALLORY Nada, Rosey. 
MABEL (annoyed) My name's not Rosey. (points at name tag) It's Mabel. 
Mabel exits FRAME. 
MALLORY Whatever. 
Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she selects a quarter. 
MABEL Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'? 
Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes follow Mallory, he loses his ball. 
She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop. 
Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk. 
MABEL (to Mickey) She ought not be doing that. That's for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll. 
CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie: 
MICKEY I can't take her anywhere. 
Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop. She's really cooking and smoking. 
Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are. 
Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his pie and milk. 
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the pickup's hood. 
EARL Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot. Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er out. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks. 
SONNY Good God almighty. What the hell is that? 
OTIS That's a bitch outta hell, son. 
Otis and Sonny exchange looks. 
SONNY Take a run at 'er, kiddo. 
Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next to Mickey. 
SONNY Miller, Mabel. 
Mickey and Mallory in a flashy '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville. Duane Eddy's 'REBEL ROUSER' blares on the soundtrack. The B.G. is an outrageous PROCESS SHOT. The titles splash over this image 50's style. 
When this sequence is over, we CUT TO BLACK. 
END CREDIT SEQUENCE 
Over black screen, we hear: 
CAPTAIN SQUERI Send Scagnetti in here. 
INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY 
CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in the middle of the frame. 
JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's office. Squeri's never seen. 
SCAGNETTI You wanted to see me, Capt'n? 
CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.) Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the prison board, is waiting to meet you. You're gonna deliver two prisoners from the county jail to Nystrom Insane Asylum in Bakersfield. 
SCAGNETTI This is bullshit. I'm a detective. You want an errand boy, call Jerry Lewis. 
Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him. 
CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.) Jack! 
INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY 
Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway, wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket. 
PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already tied tie over his head. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY 
DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit, stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door. In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room. 
SCAGNETTI Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me? 
McClusky turns toward Scagnetti. 
MCCLUSKY Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank. 
SCAGNETTI Thank you, sir. 
MCCLUSKY Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please. 
Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation table. 
MCCLUSKY (referring to book) This is damn good reading. I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't found you. This would make a better movie than that 'Serpico' shit. 
McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti. McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap. 
MCCLUSKY I think you'll find that good reading as well. Mickey and Mallory's file. You familiar with them? 
Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up. 
SCAGNETTI Who isn't? 
MCCLUSKY You been followin' the news coverage? 
SCAGNETTI They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries--- 
MCCLUSKY Susanville, Soledade. 
SCAGNETTI They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards--- 
MCCLUSKY Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines. 
Scagnetti nods. 
MCCLUSKY Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out. 
SCAGNETTI I can appreciate that. 
MCCLUSKY So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane. 
SCAGNETTI Lobotomy Bay? 
MCCLUSKY You've heard of it? 
SCAGNETTI So, how do I fit into this scheme? 
MCCLUSKY The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you? 
SCAGNETTI By all means. 
We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures toward the cell. 
MCCLUSKY Here she is...you know her, you love her, you can't live without her...Mallory Knox. 
We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing. 
INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY 
CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'. 
MALLORY (singing) 99 years is a long, long time. Look at me, I will never be free, I'm a long time woman... 
MCCLUSKY (O.S.) Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to meet you. 
Mallory just keeps on truckin'. 
MALLORY (singing) Been workin' on the road now. Been workin' by the sea. Been workin' in the cane fields. and I wanna be free... 
MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second. Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward. 
MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold. 
CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars. 
SCAGNETTI Jesus Christ! 
CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky. 
MCCLUSKY Don't worry about it. She does that all the time. 
BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood trickling down her scalp. 
MCCLUSKY (O.S.) Follow me. 
INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY 
CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files. 
PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men. 
WURLITZER You duckin' me Dewight? 
MCCLUSKY Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya? 
WURLITZER (to Scagnetti) This son of a bitch is chairman of the prison board, but it's like pullin' teeth to get him down to a prison. 
MCCLUSKY The only reason I'm here now is to set him straight, and I'm on the next flight out. (to Scagnetti) Jack, this is the superintendent of the jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man who's got the power of the pen here. 
Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti. 
WURLITZER Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox. 
SCAGNETTI Thanks. 
MCCLUSKY From now on, you'll be dealin' with Phil. He can answer all the questions you got about the arrangements. I'm gonna be bidding you good luck and adieu in about twenty minutes. My flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in a hour. 
WURLITZER And I want you to know, we'll all cry a river when you're gone. 
They all laugh. 
SCAGNETTI What's the travelling arrangements? 
WURLITZER Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey. 
SCAGNETTI And where do you keep Mickey? 
WURLITZER We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor. 
SCAGNETTI Who? 
WURLITZER Wayne Gayle. 
SCAGNETTI (surprised) Wayne Gayle! 
INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY 
WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty. Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it. 
WAYNE (into recorder) Testing one...two...three... testing...one...three...over, over, over, Mickey Knox meeting. 
Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the recorder in his sport coat jacket. 
The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands and feet are double cuffed. 
The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment. Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, and fascinating figure. 
WAYNE (V.O.) After living a very routine, drab, nothing out-of-the-ordinary-ever- happens kind of life, the sweethearts shocked the entire nation with a cross-country crime and murder spree that lasted only three weeks, but left---

WAYNE And they were finally apprehended here at this Circle K in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CIRCLE K - DAY 
This sequence is filmed in 16MM COLOR, cinema verite a'la 'COPS.' 
The CAMERA runs behind three blue windbreaker clad COPS, as they run up to the Circle K, shouting obscenities. 
In front of the store three windbreaker cops have Mickey on the ground, beating him with nightsticks. One COP lies on the ground near them, holding his hands over his face, screaming. 
To the left Mallory is slugging it out with a windbreaker COP, matching each other blow for blow. 
Meanwhile, the three cops we ran with reach the action and join in.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 
Wayne Gayle walks down the street. The CAMERA walks with him. He speaks into the camera. 
WAYNE Mickey and Mallory's idea of an armed robbery was a little different than most. It was an assault, actually. 
EXT. 7/11 STORE - DAY 
Wayne interviews BISHOP, a young blonde kid with a 'Flock of Sea Gulls' haircut. Bishop's name appears on the SCREEN. 
BISHOP Well. I knew that Mickey and Mallory kill everybody when they're through, except for one clerk. There were a couple of people in the store then, and I was working with Stevo. And I like Stevo, you know? But I was thinking, what could I do to make them pick me to be the clerk that gets to live? 
INT. 7/11 STORE - DAY 
This scene is shot through the STORE'S BLACK & WHITE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The date and time of day are burned into the edges of the frame. 
Mickey and Mallory charge into a 7/11 store, cocking their shotguns and shouting things. 
Mickey SHOOTS a CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming. 
Mallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming. 
Mickey points his shotgun at Bishop the store clerk and screams: 
MICKEY Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast! Faster! Faster! Faster than that! 
Bishop stuffs money in a bag as Mallory guards the door, shotgun ready. 
STEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room carrying boxes and wearing a walkman. 
Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him. 
As all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes, Wayne's narration happens over it. 
WAYNE (V.O.) They'd storm in with shotguns, and kill every customer in the place right off the bat. 
CUT TO: 
Smiling PHOTOS of other VICTIMS. We CUT from each photo to the next photo after shotgun FIRE.

Mike fuckin' (BLEEP) Griffin is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP) should be revering. You know why Mike Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya why. Because he was killed in the line of duty. Do you want to know how he died? 
WAYNE Yes. 
INTENSE COP I'll tell you. Mike Jerome Griffin was killed in the line of duty by those two anti-heroes. 
CUT TO: Wayne interviewing RUSSELL VOSSLER, Harvard law student. 
WAYNE Tell me, Mr. Vossler, how many days of the trial have you attended? 
RUSSELL Ahhh yesss, I've been fortunate enough to attend two days. Law history in the making. I've been a participant. 
WAYNE And you being a Harvard law student, what is your opinion of Mickey Knox's performance? 
RUSSELL Ahhh, Mickey's pistolero savvy in the courtroom trial rivals, dare I say conquers that of master Melvin Belli. He's like a magnificent loose cannon, firing point blank in the prosecutor's face. It is my anticipation--- 
BACK TO: The long-haired guys, Chuck, Jeff & Steve as Wayne speaks. 
WAYNE You're talking about a man and a woman who killed innocent people. 
STEVE Don't get us wrong...

NORMAN Hypnotizing. 
SIMON Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?' 
WAYNE Yes.

CUT TO: 
INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY 
Wayne enters an editing room where filmmaker NEIL POPE is working at a movieola. 
WAYNE (V.O.) We talked with Neil Pope, writer and director of 'Thrill Killers' for his take on the Mickey and Mallory phenomena. 
Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets Wayne M.O.S. 
CUT INTO INTERVIEW: 
NEIL POPE It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory Knox are a cultural phenomena that could only exist in our sexually repressed society. A flower that could only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food culture. A what I tried to do with 'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of the problem all the way down the vine to the original bad seed. Yet amidst the violence and murder and carnage, you've got the structure of a Wagnerian love story. 
EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out. The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey, shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster, where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990). 
MOVIE MALLORY Mickey, honey, listen to me. 
Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does. 
MOVIE MALLORY I can't go. I'm too fucked up. 
MOVIE MICKEY I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but-- 
MOVIE MALLORY I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here. 
MOVIE MICKEY No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way! 
MOVIE MALLORY If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you--- 
MOVIE MICKEY No fuckin' way! 
DR. REINGHOLD Well, for one, the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities. But it's the country's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic devotion to each other. In a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude. To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing. They have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth. And they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond. It's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world.' They're exciting. I read their file and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels? Why are you filming this special? Because you know as well as I do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says. Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. They've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered. 
EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY 
SHOTS of the crowd. 
WAYNE (V.O.) This attitude from the young towards their ultimate anti-heroes is nation wide. And spreading.

LONDON BOY You take all the great figures from the States...Elvis, Jack Keroac, Bukowski, James Dean, Jim Morrison, Angela Davis, Jack Nicholson, Jim Thompson, Martin Scorcese...add a bloody pale of nitro and you got Mickey and Mallory. They're like rebels without a cause, except they have a cause. Only nobody knows what it is. 
LONDON GIRL (screaming) Their cause is each utter! 
TWO JAPANESE TEENS a BOY and GIRL, dressed like the Knox's. They speak in Japanese, which is translated in English.

INT. WAYNE'S STUDIO - DAY 
WAYNE And as to almost give this whole misplaced admiration scenario a cherry on the top, the rock band Redd Kross entered the charts last week at number 13 with their song 'Natural Born Killers, The Saga of Mickey and Mallory.' 
CUT TO: A CLIP from the Redd Kross video of 'Natural Born Killers.' 
BACK TO: WAYNE'S STUDIO 
WAYNE The third wicked twist to this story is Grace Mulberry. 
CUT TO: 
FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER - Headline reads: 'MICKEY AND MALLORY KILL SIX TEENS DURING SLUMBER PARTY!' In smaller bold face under it: 'One Teen Escapes Killer's Clutches.' On the front page is a PHOTO of the teen who escaped. It's seventeen year old GRACE MULBERRY. CAMERA moves in CU of the photo. 
WAYNE (V.O.) Of the six teens murdered that night, seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was the lucky one left to tell the tale. And this haunted young lady summoned up the courage to take the stand, tell what she saw that horrible night, and then allow herself to be cross-examined by the man who killed her brother and girlfriends. 
EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY 
All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media event. 
Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators and reporters surround the car. 
Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start walking up the courthouse steps. 
Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask questions. 
Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the direction of each question, but she doesn't answer. 
She remains silent and scared. 
FEMALE ORIENTAL REPORTER Miss Mulberry! How does it feel to be the only survivor of Mickey and Mallory's reign of terror? 
FAT MALE REPORTER Miss Mulberry! Has the experience marked you? 
Some scruffy TRANSIENT sticks his head in Grace's face. 
TRANSIENT Did ya watch your brother get stabbed up? 
WAYNE How do you feel about Mickey cross- examining you? 
Grace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we hear the cry of: 
VOICE (O.S.) Mickey and Mallory! 
CAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit. 
Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their faces. 
WAYNE Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry? 
MICKEY I'm keen with anticipation. 
ECU of Grace's finger rolling a large, male-style, High School class ring around her palm. 
CU of Mickey glancing to the ring. Mickey smiles. 
Mickey's POV of Grace as she pulls from a reserve of strength. Clenching the ring tight in her fist, her eyes come up and lock hatefully on Mickey. 
CU Mickey as he walks forward towards Grace. 
MICKEY That's one helluva story, Miss Mulberry. 
CU of Grace. 
GRACE Yes it is. 
At this point Mickey begins to pace from right to left, but always remaining in CU. 
MICKEY Grace...I hope you don't mind if I call you Grace... 
BACK TO: Grace as we DOLLY from a MED CU into a ECU. 
MICKEY Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your late brother Tim, if you feel up to it. 
CONTINUE DOLLY: Once locked onto her eyes, her head drops forward and we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT 
ECU of Grace's eyes as her head is pulled back into frame. Her eyes are wide with fear. The CAMERA pulls back to reveal a gag in her mouth and a knife pressed against her throat. 
She's back at the night of the murder. 
Mickey's wearing a black leather jacket over a white t-shirt, which is covered with blood. Blood is smeared on his face, and he's holding a knife pressed to his lips, also covered with blood. But he's walking and talking with the same manner and poise as in the courtroom. 
MICKEY Grace...I hope you don't mind if I call you Grace... 
TWO SHOT revealing that Grace is bound and gagged with Mallory right behind her, holding the knife and cracking gum. 
MALLORY Naw, she don't mind. 
MICKEY Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
CU of Grace in a daze. 
MICKEY (O.S.) Did you get along? 
Mickey waits for an answer that doesn't come. 
MICKEY Miss Mulberry? 
Back to Grace. 
GRACE More or less. 
MICKEY More or less... 
BACK TO: Mickey. 
MICKEY What do you mean by that? 
BACK TO: Grace. 
GRACE Well, he's my older brother. When we were growing up, there were times we could of very well done without each other. But when it counted, we were close.

CAMERA PANS from shadows to find Mickey, the pan continues through his line. 
MICKEY I'd like to talk about Tim's martial arts abilities. How long had he been studying? 
PAN CONTINUES back into the shadows, then 180 degrees to find Grace. 
GRACE He started when he was in the seventh grade, so that would make it nine years.

CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
We quickly PAN down a number of items with white evidence tags on them. We stop at Mickey's Buck Knife. Mickey's hand comes into FRAME and picks up the knife. 
MICKEY Then I took... 
CU of Mickey as he brings the knife into FRAME. 
MICKEY ...this knife and proceeded to tear him limb from limb. And this man, whose hands are lethal weapons--- 
CU of Bisbing as she stands. 
BISBING Objection, defence is intimidating the witness with the murder weapon. 
JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.) Sustained. Mr. Knox, put the knife down. 
Mickey is locked on Grace. 
MICKEY (cont'd) --had little to no defence. 
GRACE (yelling) I don't know how you did it, but you did it! 
JUDGE STEINSMA Mr. Knox! The knife! 
Mickey glances to the judge, then slowly places the knife back on the table. 
MICKEY How do you think a human being could possibly be capable of doing something like that? 
Mickey locks eyes with eyes. 
GRACE (yelling) I don't know! 
Mickey is on top of her. 
MICKEY Now...I don't believe that Grace. I think you have a definite opinion on how I was able to do those things you described. Now, I'm going to ask you again. And I want you to remember you are under oath. 
Grace collects herself. 
MICKEY (O.S.) In your opinion, Miss Mulberry, how was I able to murder you brother Tim Mulberry in the manner you described. 
The Judge looks down at Grace. 
Grace looks back into her open palm. CU of the ring. 
BACK TO: Mickey bearing down on her, waiting for an answer. 
BACK TO: Grace as we slowly DOLLY closer she looks up at Mickey timidly. 
GRACE (softly) You're not human. 
Mickey smiles. 
GRACE I thought about it a lot. And the only thing I could figure is that you're not human. 
Bisbing hides her disappointment by looking down. 
Mickey straightens up as Grace continues. 
GRACE You're a vampire, or the devil, or a monster, or cyborg, or something like that. But you're not human. 
Grace breaks down. Putting her hands to her head to stop the pain. 
CU of Mickey smiling down at her. 
CU Mallory smiling proudly at Mickey. 
CU Judge Steinsma betraying no emotion looks down at Grace. 
CU of Grace sobbing, she tries to collect herself by clutching the ring tighter. 
Mickey rolls his pencil in his hand the CAMERA tilts up as he leans into a CU. 
MICKEY (softly) Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing... 
GRACE (softly into her lap) What... 
Mickey smiles. 
MICKEY You're right.

WAYNE (V.O.) The sentence was never to reach that point. Because after only a year, Mickey and Mallory created so much mayhem that it was decided... 
INSERT: FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER: 'MICKEY AND MALLORY TO BE TRANSFERRED TO ASYLUM.' 
WAYNE (V.O.) ...that they were mentally ill and needed to be transferred to a state mental hospital. 
CAMERA move into the picture of Mickey and Mallory on the front page of the newspaper. 
CUT TO: 
PHOTO: of Dewight McClusky. 
WAYNE (V.O.) We talked with Dewight McClusky, chairman of the California State Prison Board, about this curious turn of events in the Mickey and Mallory case. 
INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Wayne's interviewing McClusky. 
WAYNE Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision? 
MCCLUSKY The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need. 
WAYNE Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed? 
MCCLUSKY Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates. 
WAYNE When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed? 
MCCLUSKY What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong. 
WAYNE Who is we? 
MCCLUSKY The prison board and the doctors who examined them. 
WAYNE Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them? 
MCCLUSKY Using the same doctors is not common practice. 
WAYNE I take it by your answer it was a whole new team? 
MCCLUSKY Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that. 
PHOTO: of DR. ALBERT RODRIGUEZ. 
WAYNE (V.O.) The two psychiatric opinions the board sought were those of Albert Rodriguez... 
PHOTO: of DR. FELIX VARGUS. 
WAYNE (V.O.) ...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the good doctors, for whatever reason, refused to be interviewed. 
INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY 
Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing. 
DR. REINGHOLD It's a funny situation actually. If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage. The prison board is basically saying, 'We can't handle these guys.' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. They were a handful everywhere they went. Now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. But no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. Well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. But there's something being said here. Forget the immorality for a second. Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. What the board is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society. They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. All the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids. And whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated. 
WAYNE So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory are not insane? 
DR. REINGHOLD Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace to living creatures, yes. But to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they don't know right from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right and wrong. They just don't give a damn. 
FREEZE FRAME on Dr. Reinghold. 
INT. EDITING BAY - DAY 
Wayne's just finished viewing the show. He puts his hands on Scott and Roger's shoulders. 
WAYNE Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing. 
SCOTT Okay. 
Wayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie. 
WAYNE Children, we have a show. (to Scott & Roger) You two get some long well overdue sleep. 'Cause tomorrow, bright and early, county jail and then journey's end...Mickey Knox. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: 'TOMORROW--BRIGHT AND EARLY.' 
INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY 
Mickey's pacing back and forth in his cell, trying out different jokes. 
Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS. 
WAYNE (aside to Scott) Here's the welcome wagon. 
Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand. 
WURLITZER Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you. 
WAYNE Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again? 
WURLITZER I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here. 
WAYNE That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy. (to his crew) I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me. 
Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks confidentially to Wurlitzer. 
WAYNE The main thing I need is a big room, shut off from the population, so we can get some privacy...with a few electrical outlets. 
INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY 
Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook. 
Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA moves from person to person without cutting. 
WURLITZER (to two Deputies) This is just for an interview, I was on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once. It was a much bigger deal than this. They had a crew of maybe seventy-five people. 
CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott. 
WAYNE We're gonna be talking over here. But I want enough freedom so if I wanna get up and move around, we can. 
Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left. 
WAYNE Take him and walk him over this way. (pretending Scott's Mickey) So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents, what the hell was that all about? (pauses--to Scott) Then maybe take him to the window. 
He walks Scott to the window. 
WAYNE (pretending Scott's Mickey) So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail today, what's the first thing you'd do? (pause--to Scott) Little shit like that. I don't wanna have to feel I gotta stay in the chairs. We're after a cinema verite, anything can happen, truth twenty-four times a second kindda feel. 
End of single SHOT. 
Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies. 
WURLITZER And when it's lunch time, they don't just go to McDonalds. They got cooks there servin' great food. Swedish meatballs... 
Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies. 
WURLITZER How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle? 
WAYNE Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you. 
WURLITZER By all means. 
Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around the room. 
WAYNE You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they? 
WURLITZER Oh yes, indeed. Top flight. 
WAYNE Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie. 
WURLITZER Is that her real name? 
WAYNE Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand. 
Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this. 
WURLITZER I see. 
WAYNE Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before--- 
WURLITZER (proudly) Ya know, I was. 
WAYNE (acting surprised) Really? 
WURLITZER I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago. 
WAYNE (still acting surprised) Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members--- 
WURLITZER Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more. 
WAYNE See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it? 
WURLITZER It sure is. 
WAYNE They got a asshole over here. (pointing to his left) A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there. (points to his right) A asshole perched up there. (points straight up) Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this... (indicates the hustle and bustle of a set) ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy. 
SCAGNETTI See, I've been there twice. And I'm not lookin' forward to goin' back. But I'm in and out. You, on the other hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the rest of your life there. Now that's what I call cruel and inhuman punishment. 
Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking. 
SCAGNETTI Course you're not gonna give a shit. 'Cause when the good doctor's get through givin' you the zap... (he puts his finger next to his temple, pantomimes being electrocuted) ...You won't know where the hell you are. They'll just put you on a window sill, and water you every other day. 
Mallory lets out a big yawn. 
INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY 
Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally bursting into laughter. 
WAYNE (to his crew) And when he gets here, its no dick'n around time. Make him up, clip a mike on him, then leave him alone. I don't want you talking to him. I don't want you getting in his face. I want you hiding behind your gear. You are invisible. 
CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how he can still walk. 
WAYNE (to his crew) Okay, break. 
Wayne's team disburses. 
WURLITZER Okay, boys, lets start undoing him. 
Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne. 
Wayne approaches Mickey. 
MICKEY (to Wayne) Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about. 
WAYNE All right, Mickey. 
MICKEY Let's discuss it when I'm unbound. 
CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove the chains. 
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY 
CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind. 
Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's wrists. 
Mallory's silent. 
Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette. 
BINGHAM Turn around and face the wall! 
Mallory does. 
Bingham and Washington move to the door. 
SCAGNETTI Wait outside for a second, fellas. 
BINGHAM We're not supposed--- 
SCAGNETTI Don't worry about it. 
Bingham and Washington move outside. 
Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door. 
Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back to him. 
Scagnetti walks up behind her. 
Mallory doesn't move. 
SCAGNETTI Want a smoke? 
Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti. 
SCAGNETTI C'mon, I already lit one for you. I know you smoke. 
Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of Mallory. 
SCAGNETTI I was reading the file on you. You know what it said during your trial, whenever they put you on the stand, no matter what they asked, your answer was always the same...'I love Mickey.' It also says that when they gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey' was the only thing you said that registered as the truth. 
Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory. 
SCAGNETTI Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is that the attraction? Or does he just got a big dick? 
Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear. 
SCAGNETTI That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a big donkey dick. 
Scagnetti presses closer. 
WAYNE Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes. 
WURLITZER Don't call my men assholes. 
WAYNE I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here. 
Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up a light stand. 
WAYNE Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of these assholes. Now I want to create the illusion that this is just Mickey and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves. So make sure you don't film these assholes. I don't want to see 'em on film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five' slated our spot as human interest which means we'll go live at just after five-thirty. 
Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G. 
Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies. 
WURLITZER This asshole's tryin' to tell me what I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him! This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's dealin' with here, but we do. And if shit happens, he ain't gonna be responsible, we are. So keep your shotguns out, your fingers on the triggers, and be ready to fire at a moment's notice. 
BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a donut. He takes a big bite. 
ROGER Say something. 
MICKEY (mouthful of donut) What? 
ROGER Anything. 
Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem. 
MICKEY (talking in rhyme) I stand amid the roar Of a surf tormented shore, As I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand-- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep--while I weep! O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? 
Mickey bites into the donut. 
MICKEY (mouthful of donut) How was that? 
Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike. 
ROGER Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box. 
MICKEY There's a chocolate cream filled in there? 
ROGER Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special. 
MICKEY Tough titty, it's mine now. 
ROGER Look, I'll trade you. 
Wayne enters frame. 
WAYNE Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra. 
ROGER (to himself) Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer. 
Roger exits FRAME. 
Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey. 
WAYNE Sorry about that. 
MICKEY Don't worry about it. 
WAYNE We're about ready to go here. Are you ready? 
MICKEY Let's do it. 
Wayne smiles and exits FRAME. 
WAYNE (O.S.) Okay people! Let's start to settle down here.

SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of Mickey's eye. 
CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face. 
WAYNE (O.S.) Are you comfortable? 
Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods. 
WAYNE (O.S.) Roger? 
ROGER (O.S.) Rockin'! 
WAYNE (O.S.) Scotty? 
WAYNE Tell me about the purity. 
MICKEY (laughing) It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job. 
WAYNE (laughs) Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later. 
MICKEY I'm sure we will. 
WAYNE Describe Mallory. 
MICKEY Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers... 
WAYNE Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. (points at his head) What's up here? (points at his heart) What's in here? 
MICKEY That's indescribable. 
WAYNE Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again? 
MICKEY (smiles) Says who? 
WAYNE Says the United States of America. 
MICKEY (laughs) When have they ever been right? 
The crew laughs (O.S.) 
MICKEY Hey, just like Soupy Sales. 
INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room. His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose. Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril. 
INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY 
Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture. 
MICKEY ...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows? 
SCAGNETTI (whispers) How's it goin'? 
WURLITZER (whispers) Shhhh! I wanna hear this. 
Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face. 
WURLITZER What the hell happened to you? 
SCAGNETTI You should see the other bitch. What time you got? 
WURLITZER Two-thirty. Shhh... 
CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to Mickey's story. 
MICKEY But I came to the direction I need a gun. Do, the next day I started off early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a gun shop and pick up a little home protection. I walked into the place and had never seen so many guns in all my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the this really nice sales guy comes up to me. His name was Warren. I'll never forget his name. He was really nice. Anyway, Warren showed me all these different models of guns. Magnums, automatics, pistols, Walters. And I ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon as I held that baby in my hands, I knew what I was gonna do. It felt so good. It felt like it was a part of me. They had a mirror in the store. I looked at myself holding it, and looked so fuckin' good, I immediately bought it. Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo. Turned my car around, drove to Mallory's house, we took care of Mallory's parents, packed up the car, and we were off. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA: 
MEDIUM CU on Mickey. 
MICKEY Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer. 
WAYNE Okay, let's cut it. 
BACK TO: COLOR 35mm 
WAYNE (to Scott) Did ya get that? 
Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages. 
SCOTT It's gonna be beautiful. 
WAYNE Super cool. (to Mickey) This is great stuff. How ya doin'? 
MICKEY I could go for a Coke. 
WAYNE (yelling) Could I get a Coke for Mickey? 
WURLITZER I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke. 
WAYNE Fine. (to Unruly Julie) Julie, why don't you make a food run? (to the room) What's around here? 
DEPUTY SHERIFF There's an In and Out Burgers about a block away on Olive. It's walking distance. 
WAYNE Okay, Julie, take everybody's order. I'll have a double double with cheese, french fries, and a large Coke. 
A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS. 
The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before moving on. 
CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling across the floor. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY 
SHOT through Scott's CAMERA: 
FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT. 
MICKEY You guys wanna hear a joke I heard? 
WAYNE (O.S.) Sure. 
MICKEY Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date. 
As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's CAMERA follows. 
MICKEY The mother asks, 'Where's he taking you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in movie.' The mother tells her she can only go if she takes Little Johnny with her. She says okay. They go to the drive-in, they come back. The mother gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay, what happened? Where did ya go?' 
Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts like he's driving. 
MICKEY Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What did they do?' 
Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing. 
MICKEY 'They kissed. What else?' 
Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts. 
MICKEY 'He felt her up? What else?' 
Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing. 
MICKEY (dumbfounded) 'They took off their clothes? What else?' 
Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex. 
MICKEY 'They did it? What were you doing?' 
Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking off. 
Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies, even Scagnetti cracks a smile. 
As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4 during the punchline. 
While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with the butt. 
Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious. 
Scott's CAMERA goes wild. 
BACK TO: COLOR 35mm. 
The other deputies react. 
Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with a THUD. 
Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin. 
Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION. 
The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him out of FRAME. 
Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up -- SLOW MOTION. 
CU of ceiling being BLASTED. 
Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3. 
Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to fire -- SLOW MOTION. 
Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti -- SLOW MOTION. 
Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey. 
Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti. 
They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of the room. 
Nobody fires. 
MICKEY Wagons, hooaaa! 
The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to his neck. 
Roger follows with the camera. 
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY 
Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to herself, and doing the hand motions. 
MALLORY (singing) Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing there isn't much to it. All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I like the rest, but the best part I like is Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo, do quack, quack. 
The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey, Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped with tape. 
CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes. 
MICKEY (to Mallory) Honey, I'm home. 
Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something everybody told them they would never do again. 
For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple. 
MALLORY (in between kisses) It's taken you so long to come to me.

BAILEY (O.S.) Here's the list of the rioters. 
CAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up. 
WURLITZER Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the list of the hostages? 
BAILEY (O.S.) I'm working on it Capt'n. 
WURLITZER Keep on it, son. 
Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces. 
WURLITZER (reading the names) Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez, Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos, Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard... 
Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with his hands. 
NAPALATONI (O.S.) Capt'n. 
Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down. 
WURLITZER What is it Napalatoni? 
NAPALATONI (O.S.) Mickey Knox is loose. 
Wurlitzer looks up. 
WURLITZER What do you mean he's loose? 
NAPALATONI (O.S.) He's armed, he's killed three deputies and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle, another TV guy, that cop fella, and two other deputies as hostages. And Capt'n, they have one of them news cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't stop playin' it. What do you want us to do? 
Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing would come out. He just sits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY 
The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is standing, alert and ready for action. 
As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger, tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man. 
Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn. 
MICKEY Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building. (to Wayne) Donut said something about a news van. 
WAYNE Yeah, we have a van. 
MICKEY Where's it parked? 
WAYNE Out front. 
MICKEY Let me have the keys. 
Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses the keys to Mickey. 
WAYNE Mickey, can I talk to you alone? 
The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would die. 
Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer. 
Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder. 
NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE and COLOR 35mm. 
Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be spared. 
WAYNE (yelling) My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty million people every week! I am a respected journalist, winners of the Golden Globe, the Edward R. Murrows Award among others! If anybody puts me in danger, my network will sue The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. My estate will sue every officer personally who fires. The network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis and Sinclair... 
Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the deputies. 
MALLORY (yelling) Make a path! 
The wall of deputies starts moving backward. 
The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne yelling all the way. 
The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea. 
Wurlitzer stands his ground. 
WURLITZER How far do you think your gonna get? 
MICKEY Right out the front door. 
WURLITZER That'll never happen. 
MICKEY It is happening. 
The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep their weapons ready. 
Wayne stops his speech to take a breath. 
MALLORY Don't stop! 
Wayne starts up again. 
The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer are nose to nose. 
WURLITZER (to Mickey) I will personally hunt you down, blow the head off your fucking-whore-wife, and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself. 
MICKEY (calmly) Another day perhaps, but not today. 
Mickey leaves FRAME. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY 
The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey, Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open air. 
A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey. 
FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE. 
Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE LEADER. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK & WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a fence post. 
This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly into the CAMERA. 
WAYNE This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead. This may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van. Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked out the front door, into my news van and made our getaway. When we were followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka and tossed his body out of the back. Mickey told authorities over my police band that I would surely be next if they didn't give up the pursuit. They took Mickey at his word and called off the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't employed, I don't know. My only thought is it all happened too fast for arrangements to be made. We've just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview. Tensions run high-- 
Mickey screams O.S. 
MICKEY (O.S.) We ain't got all fuckin' day! 
WAYNE Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory... 
Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held. 
CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces in and out of FRAME in the B.G. 
WAYNE Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work? 
MALLORY It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work. 
WAYNE (O.S.) What did you think then? 
MALLORY I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.

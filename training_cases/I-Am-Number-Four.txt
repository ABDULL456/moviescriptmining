I AM NUMBER 4 
Written by 
Alfred Gough & Miles Millar 
The events in this film are real. Names and places have been changed to protect the Lorien Six, who remain in hiding. 
Take this as your first warning. Other civilizations do exist. Some of them seek to destroy you. 
FADE IN: 
A BILLION STARS pinprick the velvet-black sky that stretches over a vast sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the whispering canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise. 
TITLE ON SCREEN: REPUBLIC OF CONGO, AFRICA. 
EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS 
A BUNGALOW. It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness. 
INT. HUT - NIGHT 
Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat. The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until 
THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES. The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS. 
ANOTHER RATTLE. It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans in and peers through the bamboo slats. WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life. Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of 
A SERRATED METAL BLADE protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted eyes and whispers his last, desperate word... 
MIDDLE-AGED MAN Run! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves impossibly fast. Faster than any human could. 
A MONSTROUS HOWL ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears. He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of 
A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE! GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of 
A HULKING BEAST. It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side. It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved, the Teen turns to make his escape when 
A HAND wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster. 
THIS IS A MOGADORIAN. He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises 
A SWORD. Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright. 
FORM CUT TO: 
THE SAME SYMBOL. It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet- ski race with TWO BUDDIES. 
TITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA. 
The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages on the beach. Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels 
THE SYMBOL searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams across the water. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY 
LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh like a brand. 
INT. BATHROOM - MOTEL - NIGHT 
Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat scab that has formed over the wound. 
DANIEL (V.O.) I got the first scar when I was eight. I woke up screaming. We lived in Vermont. The second was on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was the third. His finger traces the lines of the other two scars. 
EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY 
The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony. 
DANIEL (V.O.) Because of the spell our Elders cast, the Mogs can only kill us in order. That's the reason I've survived this long. But our enemy is relentless. 
INT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING 
Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over, his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won. 
DANIEL (V.O.) Now their hunt has turned to me. I am number 4. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT 
A tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that RUMBLE past, headed to destinations unknown. 
INT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT 
Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes. Henri slides into the booth, all business. 
HENRI Florida's clear. I sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers. 
DANIEL I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table. 
HENRI New IDs. Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name. 
DANIEL Just when I think you can't get any less original, you lower the bar. 
HENRI I'm not interested in originality. I'm interested in untraceable. There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United States. (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.) John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away. Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him. 
INT. ARCADE - REST STOP - NIGHT 
A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches. They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen. 
JOHN It's been so long since the last scar. 
HENRI You got lulled into a false sense of security. That's my fault. John struggles to keep his temper in check. 
JOHN I liked Florida. I liked having friends. I liked feeling normal. Henri's face softens with paternal compassion. 
HENRI I wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't. Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with frustration. 
JOHN Then why fake it? Why not just go hole up in the wilderness. 
HENRI That's exactly what Number 3 did. 
John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on his iPhone and hands it to John. 
HENRI It's from an African news site. A man and his son went missing two nights ago. The locals think they were taken by strange beasts. John understands the implication. 
JOHN Piken. 
HENRI The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters. Blending in is our best protection. 
JOHN So we just keep moving from town to town? 
HENRI Until I say otherwise -- yes. John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice softens but never loses its intensity. 
SAM You were talking to Sarah Harte. 
JOHN She was talking to me. 
SAM Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since Freshmen year. 
John looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around Sarah's shoulder. 
SAM If there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down. You got a warning shot. John piles the books into his locker. 
JOHN Maybe I'll fire back next time. 
SAM Look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater. Football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals. If you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves. 
JOHN You sound like my dad. 
SAM Obviously a wise man. 
(BEAT) I'm Sam by the way. Sam extends his hand. John doesn't take it. 
JOHN Thanks for the download. As he SLAMS his locker shut... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY 
It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers. The Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in. They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field. Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle. 
COACH Alright, people. Let's hit the gym. The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers. 
INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY 
John emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage. Some of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling. 
COACH Okay, half court, three on three. Girls have this basket, boys have that one. 
CUT TO: Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with Sarah who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her. 
COACH New kid, you're up. Show me what you've got. John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball. Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice. 
THE SHOT goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard with such force that it 
SHATTERS. Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle. 
COACH Enough! Hit the showers. 
(TO JOHN) LeBron, grab a broom. As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah watching him. OFF this silent exchange... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
THE INTRICATELY CARVED BOX is clutched in Henri's hands. He heads down the hall and stops in front of the grandfather clock. Its tarnished pendulum sways. He unlocks the glass panel and slots the Box out of sight behind the clock's brass face. 
Satisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes the key. When he turns back, he finds 
BERNIE KOSAR. The dog is studying him with his head cocked. 
HENRI Let's keep this our little secret. OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY 
John joins the line. He sees Sarah sitting by herself, inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty. 
JOHN Henri, what's happening to me? 
HENRI Calm down. You're going to be okay. John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands. 
JOHN On what planet is this okay? 
HENRI Yours. 
(BEAT) I need to get you out of here. 
INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY 
John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat. His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets. Henri leads him quickly down the hall. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUV - DAY - MOVING 
John fearfully studies his hands which have returned to normal, then looks over at Henri who seems oddly calm. 
JOHN Okay, start talking. What the hell's going on? 
HENRI Your first Legacy is starting to manifest. 
JOHN Legacy? 
HENRI An extraordinary ability. Yours is called Lumen. They start a lot sooner on Lorien. I was beginning to fear yours would never emerge. 
JOHN You knew this was going to happen? Why didn't you say anything? 
HENRI I didn't want to worry you. You were already under enough pressure. 
(SINCERE) I'm sorry. John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious. 
JOHN What else have you been hiding from me? 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT 
The curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box. 
HENRI This couldn't be opened until your first Legacy appeared. Ready? John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid. John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the âpetalsâ fanned across the opposite side. 
THE DISCS momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami. 
JOHN Whoa. PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold. Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup, creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his neck -- the symbols are an exact match. 
HENRI Open it. John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks. They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty. 
JOHN What are they? 
HENRI Crystals from Lorien's core. They'll guide us in your training. John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away. 
HENRI Place your hand over them. John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut- sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to spin and project 
A SWIRLING HOLOGRAPHIC GALAXY. 
HENRI Our solar system. Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless. 
HENRI That's what Lorien looked like thousands of years ago. We had all the problems that Earth has today. The planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly Lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the Legacies started. John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land masses become a lush emerald green. 
HENRI Only a select few developed these abilities. They became known as the Garde. 
JOHN That's what I am? 
JOHN She was returning my backpack. He dumps it by the door. 
HENRI I think you should stay home from school for a couple of days. 
JOHN I'm fine. 
HENRI Just to be safe. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
John lies on his bed, staring at his luminescent palms, conflicted by his emotions. 
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
Moonlight cuts across Bernie Kosar who is SNORING peacefully at the end of the bed. John tosses and turns. He finally sits up, unable to sleep. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAWN 
Nursing a mug of black coffee, Henri diligently scans the laptop screens. He's clearly never gone to bed. He looks up as John enters wearing track gear. 
JOHN I'm going for a run. Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly. 
JOHN Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up. 
CUT TO: 
START MONTAGE: 
EXT. WOODS - DAWN 
EPIC AERIAL SHOT LOOKING DOWN AT AN EAGLE as it soars above the rich kaleidoscope of trees. It almost seems to be following John, who is powering along a narrow track below. 
CUT TO: John moves at superhuman speed, leaving a blurring wake of leaves. His foot splits a log as he bounds over it. 
CUT TO: John charges towards a secluded stream. It's 30 feet wide. He doesn't slow, leaps off the bank and effortlessly hopscotches from boulder to boulder to the other side. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HILL - DAWN 
It offers a high-def view of Paradise. John reaches the top and is exhilarated by the sense of temporary liberation. He 
WATCHES AS 
THE EAGLE alights in a nearby oak tree. John bends to tighten his laces, his eyes fall on the trio of scars branded on his ankle. His happiness dims. 
He grits his teeth and takes off for home. As he passes the oak, the CAMERA TRACKS TO REVEAL the gecko scampering down the gnarled trunk. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Sam is at his locker. He glances over at John's, hoping he'll show. Disappointed, he joins the crisscrossing throng. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
John âpracticesâ turning his Lumen Legacy âoffâ and âonâ. Henri watches as John's palms glow. Â  John focuses intently, causing them to flare with sudden brilliance. Momentarily blinded, John jerks back and topples off his chair. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT 
MARK (O.S.) What's he doing in here? John and Sarah spin to find Mark. Sarah is flustered. 
SARAH I thought you were on two-a-days. 
MARK Coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come. You didn't answer my question? 
SARAH John was helping me move some boards. John turns to Sarah. 
JOHN I'm going to take off. Mark doesn't take his eyes off John and blocks his way. 
MARK Seriously, Sarah, what's up with this guy? 
SARAH I don't have time for this, Mark. 
MARK But you had time to go to his house the other night. Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission. 
SARAH You were following me? 
MARK Just trying to figure out what's going on with you. Sarah's shock turns to anger. 
SARAH You've crossed so many lines I can't even speak to you right now. She hustles out of the room. Mark glares at John. 
MARK This isn't over. OFF John, unmoved by the threat... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK 
The sky is even pinker than the house. 
INT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK 
A drawer flies across THE FRAME. The place has been totally trashed. Floorboards have been ripped up. Sofas shredded. Nothing has been spared. CAMERA DRIFTS OVER the debris to... 
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - STILT HOUSE - DUSK 
The mattress has been dissected and its guts lie scattered. 
A TEEN GIRL. kneels in front of John's old desk searching the drawers. She wears a biker jacket, combat boots and has a striking âdon't-fuck-with-meâ face. Frustrated in her search, she flings the desk against the wall. It splinters on impact. 
INT. KITCHEN - STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK 
TIGHT ON THE STOVE -- a hand twists on the burners. Raw gas HISSES. The Teen Girl makes one final scan, then heads for the door. 
EXT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK 
The Teen Girl strides down the steps and crosses to a sleek Ducatti. She slips on a helmet. PUSH IN on her Arctic-blue eyes as they focus on the house with a strange intensity. 
KABBBOOOOOOM! The house detonates. The concussive force of the blast rips the structure right off its stilts. Tornadoes of flame BLAST through the windows as the house catapults into the air. Orange reflections flicker on the Girl's visor as she flips it down, REVS the motorcycle and SCREAM-PEELS down the drive backlit by the glittering inferno... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY 
Sam catches John at the lockers. 
SAM Nice freakout the other day. 
JOHN Wasn't feeling well. They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his door, there's a HISSING POP and 
A RED INK PACK EXPLODES. It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered. It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray. 
JOHN has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse. TIGHT ON John's hands as he balls them and an angry glow flickers through his gloves. 
MARK (to John, taunting) Told you it wasn't over. Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks. He frantically clears his locker, looking for something. He finally pulls out a photo which drips with ink, reels at the jocks. 
INT. SUV - DAY 
John climbs in. 
HENRI Wasn't that your friend from the other night? 
JOHN Her name's Sarah. 
(ANNOYED) I didn't ask for a ride home. 
HENRI Principal called. Said there was an incident. 
John stares out the window, guilty. 
JOHN A guy was messing with me. I took care of it. Problem solved. 
HENRI You're stronger and faster because of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores. 
JOHN It was no big deal. Don't blow it out of proportion. 
HENRI You can't risk everything over wounded pride. 
JOHN I wasn't looking for a fight. It just happened. Get off my back. Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it. ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website and features a photo of the charred stilt house. John's gut churns as he stares at the image. 
HENRI Article says it was arson. 
JOHN We were clean. There's no way the Mogs can track us here. Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off. 
HENRI They can track us anywhere. I think it's time you saw what you're really up against. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Sunlight razors across workbenches cluttered with rusty tools. Henri and John stand in the middle of the space. 
THE BOX 
is open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and holds it over the crystals. 
ONE RISES. It's white and as thick as two fingers. It floats in front of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE FRAME and transporting him into 
A VISCERAL MEMORY. 
EXT. LORIEN - NIGHT 
EXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke. The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather. Young John glances up and sees 
AN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES. 
GRANDFATHER (in Loric with subtitles) Keep moving. 
EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT 
It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John and his grandfather race up the steps. 
INT. SANCTUARY - TEMPLE - NIGHT 
A statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore, towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight. 
FOOTSTEPS ECHO! Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and straight into the path of 
TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS. The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn, they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat by a crystal-handled dagger. 
MAGENTA LIGHT 
HENRI No... go. John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture. 
HENRI You've had enough for one day. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET - PARADISE - NIGHT 
A Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the sidewalks. Icicle lights twinkle in the trees. EXCITED KIDS in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand. 
A SLAP ON GLASS. John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store. 
INT. ED'S SPORTING GOODS STORE - NIGHT 
An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters. The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron. 
JOHN You work here? 
SAM Not by choice. (pointing to sign) Ed's my stepdad. He's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they'll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods. John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter. 
SAM I put those on special tonight for any wannabe Jason Voorhees. Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words âFuture Supervillainâ. 
SAM Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll hang with you. He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view. 
JOHN What about your stepdad? 
SAM He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's already hammered by now. I'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep. Every night is trick âr treat at my house. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the road bordering the woods. Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton candy. John subtly scans the crowd. 
SAM She's over there. John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye, sees John and smiles as he approaches. 
SARAH You made it. (re: Sam's shirt) Like the T-shirt, Sam. 
SAM Guidance Counsellor said I need to set goals for myself. Figured I'd aim high. She looks back at John. 
SARAH What do you think of Halloween in Paradise? John regards a particularly over-the-top float. 
JOHN They should pull out all the stops next year. 
SARAH Well, you haven't had the full experience until you've been on the Haunted Hayride. 
She motions to the picnic area where TEENS are lining up to get on tractor-pulled hay wagons. The wagons lurch through the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods. 
SARAH Give me a sec. She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie her camera. Sam whispers to John. 
SAM I'm impressed. Before John can respond, Sarah steps back. 
SARAH You guys ready? 
SAM Three on a wagon might get a little crowded. I'll meet you two on the other side. He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away. 
SARAH Sam's cool. 
JOHN Definitely unique. 
SARAH I haven't really talked to him since 8th grade. Mark had a tight circle. If you weren't a jock or cheerleader, you didn't exist. 
JOHN I'm glad you broke free. 
SARAH Me too. OFF their growing connection... 
CUT TO: 
JOHN I was getting to that. I got a new Legacy. Henri absorbs that revelation. 
HENRI Telekinesis. That's a big step. Must have been triggered by the fight. John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze. 
HENRI I need to teach you how to control these abilities. We'll start working on that tomorrow. The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to the bank of computers. Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard. 
JOHN What is it? Henri pulls up a website. 
HENRI We got a hit on one of the search words. 
(SCANNING) It's a paranormal blog. âThey Walk Among Us!â ANGLE ON COMPUTER: A video buffers into motion. It's handheld and jerky. It WHIP-PANS over some sand and joins a group of Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf. He's holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers. John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes... 
JOHN That's Sand Dollar Beach. 
HENRI Looks like a cell phone camera. There's enough for the Mogs to ID your face. 
JOHN Can you take it down? Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands. 
HENRI Working on it. 
JOHN I'm sorry, Henri. 
HENRI This isn't your fault. There's still nothing to trace us here. Henri glances up from his screen. 
HENRI This could take all night. Get some sleep. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT 
John dumps his hoodie on the floor and slumps on his bed. He pulls his phone out of his jeans and sees a new text message from Sam. He CLICKS it open. 
PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as he scans the message with alarm. He sits bolt-upright, gripped with dread. He checks the message again. 
TIGHT ON PHONE: âI SAW WHAT U DID IN THE WOODS. NEED 2 TALK. 
2NITE. MY GARAGE.â JOHN hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm. A bad night just got worse. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT 
Henri is illuminated by the dirty glow on the computers. His fingers work the keys with expert precision. He's so focused on the task that he doesn't notice 
JOHN blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera screens and disappear into the woods. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
John cautiously approaches. It's a â50s ranch style. The garage adjoins the house. The lights are out. RAIN bullets off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open. 
INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
John slides into view. It takes a second for his eyes to adjust. A pickup sits under a white tarp. There's no sign of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him. 
SAM I've narrowed it down to three possibilities: you're a genetic experiment, you're a freak of nature, or you're an extraterrestrial. 
JOHN I don't know what you think happened tonight... Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face. 
SAM Your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you took off faster than an Olympic runner. 
(MORE) 
SAM (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) Did I leave anything out? John silently reels. 
INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY 
The walls are now adorned with Thanksgiving banners. John and Sam head past the lockers. Mark and the Jocks move out of their way, acknowledging the new high school dynamic. 
INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT 
Using his telekinesis, John strains to lift a tennis ball. It momentarily RATTLES, then stops. Henri is not impressed. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
Bernie darts ahead as John and Sarah walk through a crimson cascade of falling leaves. As they kiss, the leaves around them freeze midair and slowly begin to drift upwards. 
INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
John helps Sam with a dusty box. It's stuffed with Sam's dad's old papers and books. We CATCH tantalizing glimpses of images: Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, the Rings of Saturn... 
INT. INTERNET CAFE - NASHVILLE - DAY 
It's a Vandy student hangout. CAMERA DRIFTS over a row of computer terminals and FINDS the Teen Girl who torched the stilt house. She's studying her computer screen intently. REVERSE TO REVEAL: She is watching the cell phone footage of John on the âThey Walk Among Usâ blog. 
INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY 
Under Henri's watchful gaze, John focuses on a tennis ball. It RISES. John grins in triumph, causing the ball to drop and bounce on the floor. Strike two. 
INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY 
Mark silently stews when he sees Sarah and John sitting together at a table. 
EXT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY 
Bernie pogos on his back legs, trying to bite the tennis ball that John telekinetically hovers just out of the dog's reach. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON A LAPTOP scrolling with endless lines of URL addresses. REVERSE TO REVEAL Henri studying the screen. Waiting. Watching. 
EXT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY 
John is fully submerged in an old claw-foot tub. GO TO JOHN'S DISTORTED VIEW LOOKING UP at Henri as he drops a match into the tub. The liquid instantly IGNITES and we realize John's lying in gasoline. He sits up, rests his hands behind his head as the FLAMES harmlessly lick his face. 
INT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY 
The trees are now bare. John stands 20 feet from Henri and nods. Henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball server. John's face is a mask of concentration as the yellow balls fly towards him. He holds up his hand and the balls 
STOP IN MIDAIR. It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his hand. They hang there. John sees a smile sneak onto Henri's face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to collapse and the balls to drop into the mud. 
END MONTAGE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Bernie looks like a drowned rat. He's sitting in the tub being scrubbed by John and Sarah. 
SARAH I don't see any family pictures around. I guess the photo aversion is hereditary. He greets the observation with a shrug. She carries on. 
SARAH Your mom... grandparents. Is there anyone else in your life? 
JOHN They died. 
SARAH I'm sorry. 
JOHN It was a long time ago. It's just me and my dad now. John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle's ears. 
SARAH I get the feeling he doesn't like me very much. 
INT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY 
It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch of counter space is filled with platters of food. John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag. John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration -- things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over. She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress. 
SARAH Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty. 
INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY 
The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John. 
SARAH You look dazed. 
JOHN Just taking it all in. She crosses. 
SARAH I'm glad you came. They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes. 
ANNIE Don't mind me. She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera. 
ANNIE Let's get a picture of you two lovebirds. Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye. 
SARAH Mom. No. John really doesn't like having his -- 
JOHN It's okay. Let her take it. The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES 
OUT THE FRAME... 
CUT TO: 
INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Red candles flicker. Sarah's DAD is expertly carving the turkey. Everybody is at the table. John sits next to Sarah. She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES. 
IT'S SIX O'CLOCK. 
John looks at his phone. No messages. His brow creases with concern. He turns to Sarah, whispers. 
JOHN I need to check in with Henri. He exits. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
John speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the phone to his ear. It rings three times and then is answered. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) Henri? CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials. This time it's picked up immediately. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) Henri? 
MAN (V.O.) 
(OVER PHONE) Are you one of them too? John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) Who are you? Where's Henri? CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it, panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea and punches another number. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) I need your help. 
INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The food is getting cold. Everybody is waiting for John. Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look. 
He squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior. WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes. 
SAM (O.S.) See anything? Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him. 
JOHN I told you to go! 
SAM They might know where my dad is! John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar 
CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER. It's lying on the counter by the fridge. 
JOHN Henri's here. John âturns offâ his palm and reaches for the door handle. Sam anxiously swats his arm away. 
SAM Wait! Other than strength, speed and night-light, what powers have you got? 
JOHN Telekinesis -- but that's a work in progress. 
SAM No invisibility, X-ray vision, flight? 
JOHN Sam, we drove here. Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up. 
SAM Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it. But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK. 
INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty. He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door. 
EXT. BACK PORCH - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
John and Sam are gone. Frank steps out and locks the door. He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs. CAMERA FOLLOWS the butt as it cartwheels into 
SAM'S LAP. He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner, John releases his hand. The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the lock and concentrates. 
SAM Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. There's a LOUD CLICK. 
SAM You just dead bolted it! Way to go! 
JOHN New plan -- follow Lucky Strike. Text me if he comes back. Sam sneaks off after Frank. 
INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON LOCK as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door swings open. John cautiously crosses the threshold. He holds up his right hand, dims his palm to a dull-blue glow. He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into... 
INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
Everything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's BREATH FOGS in the hazy aura his palm casts. The naked floorboards CREAK. Fear bites as John scans the lifeless gloom, not sure where to start. TIGHT ON HIS SHOE as it brushes a mousetrap. SNAP! 
His breath catches in his throat. He âturns offâ his hand. His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door that leads down into... 
INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner. 
JOHN Henri! He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind. 
THE BAT whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs. 
BRET knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically âunlocksâ the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag. Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings. 
HENRI You shouldn't be here. 
JOHN Your life is my life, remember? Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze. 
HENRI I talked my way in. Thought the big guy was buying it. He rubs a wound on his neck. 
HENRI I was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind... some sort of animal tranq. 
A MOGADORIAN 
climbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them. 
SAM Hurry up! John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair. As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck. 
VRRRROOMMM! The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS... 
JOHN 
DRIVE! Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
CAMERA TRACKS the swish of a familiar red coat as its owner slowly descends the stairs, PANS UP PAST his right hand, which methodically twists two meditation balls, TO REVEAL 
THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER. He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands behind each one. Frank looks at the Commander in terror. 
FRANK I called you like I said. It's not my fault they got away! The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the window. We get our first good look at his face. A gnarled scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER Where did they go? 
His accent is thick and his voice is unnerving. 
FRANK How should I know? The kid had me pinned to the ceiling. The Commander turns to Bret. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER Where did they go? Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the Commander holds one of the meditation balls. 
DOZENS OF TINY RAZOR-BLADES suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin. With cold-blooded calm, the Commander drops the ball into Frank's mouth. OFF its terrible DRILL-LIKE WHIR...

Vermillion clouds streak the heavens. Sam's truck pulls up next to Henri's SUV, which is inconspicuously parked in front of a 24-hour pharmacy. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAWN 
John turns to Sam. 
JOHN We'll meet you back at the house. 
HENRI We're not going back to Paradise. 
(TO SAM) Thank you for your help, but you'll never see us again. Henri climbs out. Sam looks at John, confused. 
SAM Is he serious? John nods, numb. 
SAM What am I supposed to tell people? 
JOHN Nothing. Forget about us. We never existed. 
(BEAT) Goodbye, Sam. OFF Sam as John climbs out...

EXT. MOTEL - DAY 
It's a rundown dump on the bleak edge of a no-name town. 
INT. SUV - DAY 
John silently stews. BIKERS smoke at the edge of the grimy pool which is drained for the winter and rattles with frozen leaves. Henri steps out of the motel office with a key. 
SARAH What happened last night? I've tried calling him all day. But his number's no longer in service. 
SAM Forget about him, Sarah. Incredulous, she grabs his arm. 
SARAH I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. 
SAM He left with Henri and he isn't coming back. Ever. 
(PULLING FREE) I'm sorry. OFF Sarah, shattered...

INT. SHOWER - MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
John stands under the steaming spray. Eyes screwed shut. Naked and lost. TWO LOUD KNOCKS at the door. 
HENRI (O.S.)

EXT. MOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON 
The GROUP OF BIKERS by the pool has grown four fold. They're partying hard. Henri keeps his head down as he passes. 
INT. MOTEL OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The FEMALE CLERK stares at the TV mounted on the wall. She's watching a local news report about the Warsaw house murders. Henri enters. The window RATTLES as a motorcycle speeds past and he slides his key onto the counter.

Henri steps in and is annoyed to hear the SHOWER still running. He strides to the bathroom door. 
HENRI John? No answer. He KNOCKS. Still nothing.

Henri shoulder-rams the door open. He whips back the shower curtain and stares at the empty tub. 
JOHN IS GONE. OFF Henri's grim concern...

The sky is twilight blue. A gleaming Harley ROARS around the bend, going full throttle. John is on its back. The wind whips his hair. Eyes set forward. Headed back to Paradise.

Annie opens the front door and is surprised to find John. 
ANNIE Little late for dessert. 
JOHN I need to talk to Sarah. 
ANNIE She's not here. Some friends dragged her to a party at Mark Jayne's. John absorbs this news, turns. Annie steps out after him. 
ANNIE I don't usually pry into my daughter's love life, I certainly didn't want my mother in mine -- but Sarah's my youngest and she's special to me. 
JOHN She's special to me too.

INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's total chaos. Smoke and FLAMES plume up from the basement. Terrified Teens scramble. John thrashes through the crowd, SHOUTING -- 
JOHN Sarah! 
EXT. BACK YARD - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The panicked evacuation spills out. A window EXPLODES and orange flames lick the cold night air. John sees Emily stumble out clutching one of Mark's dogs, Abby. 
JOHN Where's Sarah? 
EMILY Went back for Dozer. Another EXPLOSION rocks. A COUPLE of drunk Jocks CHEER. John looks back at the house. The fire has taken hold with incredible speed. The living room curtains are ABLAZE. 
A DOG'S HAUNTING HOWL 
cuts over the sound of the HISSING FLAMES. It's coming from the second floor. John charges past Mark, towards the house. 
MARK It's too late. You can't get through! John ignores him and runs into the inferno. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
FLAMES sprint up the walls and clouds of black smoke spew from the sectional sofa. Immune to the heat, John heads into the front hall and finds 
THE STAIRCASE is fully engulfed. Fearless, he clambers up the flaming steps. His jeans and shirt catch fire. He's almost reached the top when the staircase BREAKS AWAY behind him and DISINTEGRATES in a cloud of embers. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's a raging conflagration. The family portraits blister on the walls. John beelines towards Dozer's PLAINTIVE WAIL which reverberates over the UGLY ROAR of the fire. 
INT. GUEST ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Sarah is crouched by the heavy oak bed that dominates the corner of the room, COUGHING, eyes burning from the smoke and heat. Dozer is cowered underneath, HOWLING. Sarah desperately tries to move the bed but it won't budge. 
CRAAAACK! The door rips off its hinges. Through the smoky half-light, Sarah watches as John strides into the room, heroically backlit by flame. 
SARAH John! 
(FRANTIC) Dozer's under the bed. He's too scared to come out! John strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and effortlessly hoists it. Sarah looks at him, amazed, then scrambles forward and gently scoops Dozer into her arms. John puts the bed back down. 
JOHN Don't let go of him. I promise I won't let go of you. 
As he lifts them... 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The trio heads into the hall just as an 8-foot section of the floor collapses in front of them. Unfazed, John sprints forward and bridges the hole. ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror and grips Dozer tighter. John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he powers down the hall, which is a SHRIEKING tunnel of fire. 
A BURNING BEAM breaks free and swings down in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS, but watches in stunned amazement as John sweeps it out of the way with a telekinetic flick of his hand. 
EXT. SIDE - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The second-floor window SHATTERS as John leaps out holding Sarah and Dozer. A ROARING tongue of fire whips his back as he drops to the ground and touches down with Sarah and Dozer. COUGHING and shell-shocked, Sarah puts the dog down. 
JOHN You okay? She stares at him, unsure. 
SARAH You walked through that fire without getting burned. I saw you stop that beam. SIRENS wail in the distance. 
JOHN I'll explain everything... but not here... (offering his hand) Sarah... please? As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house. REVERSE TO REVEAL the Red-Haired Teen watching playback on his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He runs to the back of the house and finds Mark. 
RED-HAIRED TEEN

HENRI John's not at the house. Is he here? 
SAM No, but he's all over the internet. 
HENRI I know. He turns back to his SUV. Sam follows. 
SAM Those things from Warsaw -- they're coming, aren't they? 
HENRI Go back inside. This isn't your fight.

INT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING 
Henri careens through the night with Bernie and Sam. 
HENRI

HENRI Get out now! At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the headlights of an SUV flash across the window. Fear registers in John's eyes as he realizes... 
JOHN Too late... they're here. 
EXT. SUV - NIGHT 
The Commander climbs out. Mark follows but is distracted as a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a tractor trailer from which inhuman GROWLS echo. 
MARK What the hell's in there? He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers. He backs away in fearful realization. 
MARK You guys aren't FBI. Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck and constrains him. The Commander pulls 
TWO BANDOLIERS over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal and swirl with purple light. Finally, he slips on his trademark red coat and spins towards the school. 
INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT 
One of John's hands holds Sarah's while the other lights their way as they hurtle down the passage. They've almost reached the doors when they suddenly fly open and 
A FIGURE 
struts into view. We RECOGNIZE her as the mysterious Teen Girl. She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and FIRES right at them. THE BLAST scorches the air between John and Sarah but takes out the 
He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it springboards into the air... ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench. ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their bases and fly skyward. ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him. ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks. The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch. 
EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT 
John sinks by Henri's side. 
JOHN Henri. Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to drag him to his feet. 
JOHN Come on, taillights in five. 
HENRI I won't be coming with you this time. Save yourself. 
JOHN We go together! Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment 
THE COMMANDER'S SWORD flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's. 
HENRI Find the others. His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER. 
HENRI Your life is my life... always. His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip. Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face 
THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER. But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air. He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick uselessly as he's lifted face to face. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER Number 4. Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like mocking trophies. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER Your Cepan saved you on Lorien. The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER But this moment was inevitable. The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it. John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the moment when a warrior is born. ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which flutter to the ground like glittering confetti. John stares at the alien with calm confidence. 
JOHN Nothing is inevitable. 
ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES. The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers. TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over. The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction. 
IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION! 
John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the 
SUPERNOVA OF FIRE that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the night sky. Her breath catches in her throat. 
SARAH Oh my God... John. Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting for the stadium. 
EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT 
It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles. Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians. 
SARAH John! She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope. Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs. 
SARAH John! Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.

EXT. CITY SKYLINE - DAY 
From an AERIAL VIEW we see the outline of a city.  Any city will do.  Mirrored high rises.  Sprawling apartment complexes.  A lot of people live here...whoever they are. 
As we move closer we discover that this is not a real city at all, but a scale model of one. 
Everything is in miniature -- the buildings, parks, and freeways. GLIDING over this tabletop metropolis, we find that none of the buildings have roofs, allowing us to peak inside. 
VARIOUS CLOSE ANGLES We FLOAT through miniature coffee shops, offices, and bedrooms, where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday life 
A man dines alone.  A woman walks her dog.  Two kiss on the street. One waits for a bus. 
Over this we HEAR Marianne Faithful's smoky-voiced cover of the standard "When We're Alone" 
Just picture a penthouse Way up in the sky, With hinges on chimney For stars to go by, A sweet slice of heaven For just you and I, When we're alone. 
From all of society We'll stay aloof, And live in propriety There on the roof, Two heavenly hermits We'll be in true, When we're alone. 
As the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a miniature bed.

INT. LORNA'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY 
A cramped one-room studio.  Asleep on a futon is a slender girl of nineteen -- LORNA.  Her blood red toenails give the place its only color. An alarm clock rings it's twelve noon.  Lorna uses her foot to turn it off. 
LORNA Terri.  Why did you let me sleep so late? 
Lorna looks over to an empty pull-out sofa, its only occupant a skinny kitten. 
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
Terri? 
(to the cat) 
She must already be at work, huh? 
The cat meows -- very non-committal. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LORNA'S KITCHEN - DAY 
Still in her T-shirt and panties, Lorna opens a can of cat food as the kitten looks on. 
LORNA She probably forgot what day it is, right Arthur?  Some friend she turned out to be.  Not like you.  You remember what day it is, don't you? 
(off the cat's blank stare) 
I'm not giving you any food until you tell me. 
Arthur the cat responds with a pitiful meow.  Lorna smiles and sets down the food. 
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
That's right.  I knew you'd remember. 
CUT TO OMITTED 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Lorna, dressed casually, walks to the bus stop.  Reading the crossword puzzle in the paper, she doesn't see the curb and trips, spilling her purse. 
Embarrassed, she gathers her things, then takes a seat next to a Latino Woman.  Lorna smiles and resumes work on the puzzle. 
Stumped by a clue, she turns to the Woman. 
LORNA Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts? 
The Woman shrugs and looks off. 
Suddenly, Lorna's phone rings.  She reaches into her purse but it's not there.  Then, she spots it...in the street.  But the moment she goes to get it, a truck roars past and smashes it to smithereens. 
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
Oh my god. 
LORNA A bus ran over it.  Isn't that perfect?  It's a perfect sign. 
Terri pops a cigarette in her mouth as the Waitress delivers the toast. 
WAITRESS (to Terri) 
Can't do that here, Miss. 
TERRI I know, I know.  I'm not going to light the damn thing. 
(beat) 
Fuck me. 
LORNA Look, I'm good for next month's rent. 
This takes Terri by surprise. 
TERRI What, you're leaving too? 
LORNA Maybe.  Get out of town for a while.  I really feel good about this. 
(beat) 
I appreciate everything you've done for me this year, Terri. 
TERRI I wish you'd talked to me first. 
LORNA I didn't because...I knew you'd try to talk me out of it. 
TERRI That's because I'm looking out for you.  It's because there is so much opportunity here. 
(beat) 
And it's because I'm your friend. 
Lorna fiddles with her toast. 
LORNA I know. 
(beat) 
Listen, I'm late. 
Lorna leaves some change on the counter, picks up her gift and gives Terri a hug. 
LORNA Thanks. 
TERRI Well...Happy Birthday. 
As Lorna goes, the Waitress reappears. 
WAITRESS Your friend comin' back? 
TERRI Hard to say. 
CUT TO 
INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Someone is flipping through a stack of wedding photos.  Festive shots of various couples.  At the altar.  Cutting the cake. Posing with relatives. 
CUT TO We're in -- 
A living room, Lorna sits on the couch browsing the wedding photos. She has a quizzical look, as if the photos were of some incomprehensible alien culture. The apartment is cluttered but not dirty.  The decor suggests an occupant of modest means and bohemian taste. 
The occupant is TODD, who ENTERS counting a wad of money.  Late twenties.  Unshaven.  By turns, cocky and nervous. 
He sets the money in front of Lorna. 
TODD Seventy-five, right?  For the half-hour. 
LORNA Not including tip. 
She smiles.  Todd paces uneasily. 
TODD And, typically, the size of the tip is... 
LORNA Depends on how generous you feel. 
TODD Of course. 
LORNA Is...this your first appointment? 
TODD No.  I've done this before. 
Lorna thinks otherwise.  She pats the seat next to her. 
Alone, Lorna prepares.  She tears open a condom wrapper, stares into the mirror and runs her lines. 
LORNA Oh, you really have a big cock...My, you really have a big cock...God, what a big cock you have. 
CUT TO 
INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Lorna and Todd are having sex.  She's on top, her movements slow and hypnotic.  Occasionally, Lorna offers a moan, some are more convincing than others. 
NOTE: Throughout the scene, our ANGLES generally exclude Todd from view.  We may HEAR him, but our focus is on -- 
LORNA As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions. In fact, puzzles are on her mind. 
LORNA Forty-two across...Simon & Garfunkel hit...eight letters...begins with 'I'...I...I'm A Loser...Did they sing that?...Susie used to play Mom's Simon & Garfunkel records all the time...I scratched one once and she pulled my hair...I haven't spoken to her for almost a year...Her little kid must be walking by now...Maybe I should give Susie a call...Nah, fuck that!  She's perfectly capable of calling me...I mean, I'm listed...I'm...I am a rock...that's it!...I Am A Rock, that's the answer...I am a-- 
Suddenly, Lorna remembers the job at hand. 
LORNA (flatly) 
God, you really have a big cock. 
Like Pavlov's proverbial dog, Todd MOANS and the whole thing is quickly over. 
Lorna gives Todd a look -- it's an astonishing impersonation of tenderness. 
LORNA Wow.  That was something. 
TODD Yeah...was it? 
LORNA Let me tell you...that was something. 
TODD Really. 
LORNA Cut the modesty.  You really know what you're doing. 
CUT TO 
INT. TODD'S KITCHEN - DAY 
Lorna, dressed, is dialing the kitchen phone.  From the kitchen window she can see a school playground across the way.  It's recess.  Girls in uniforms perform a jump rope cadence. 
LORNA (into phone) 
Hey, it's Lorna...I'm clocking out for the last time...No, I'm not done for the day, I'm done...Wait, I don't think you heard me...Well, just give it to one of the other girls.  Give it to Terri...I don't care if he's an important client, I told you I'm...Well, you'll just have to cancel it, won't you?...I don't care what it pays, it's not my fuckin'-- 
She turns to find Todd in the doorway, listening. 
LORNA (into phone) 
Hold on... 
(to Todd) 
What? 
TODD Nothing.  Are you alright? 
LORNA I'm fine.  The cab fare will be another twenty. 
TODD You never said anything about cab fare. 
LORNA Of course I did.  Are you calling me a liar? 
TODD No.  I swear, you didn't say a word about it. 
Lorna slowly brings the phone to her ear. 
LORNA (into phone) 
Alright.  Where is it? 
CUT TO 
INT. TODD'S CAR - MOVING - DAY 
Todd is at the wheel of his vintage Buick.  Lorna sits on the passenger side.  She looks off, distracted.  On the seat between them is the gift from Terri, still unopened. 
TODD You haven't told me where we're going yet. 
LORNA Make a right at the light. 
He does. 
TODD Can I ask you a question? 
(without a beat) 
TODD Oh.  About a buck and a quarter. 
(to the couple) 
We just need to reload. 
As they do-- 
PHIL Since when do you have a hundred and twenty-five dollars to throw away? 
TODD I'm sure you spend just as much on porn rentals. 
PHIL There's no comparison.  Here, I'll do the math for you. 
Phil pulls a calculator out of his camera bag. 
PHIL (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
(punching in numbers) 
A video rents for $2.65.  That's a two-day rental.  That means you can get off at least a couple times before it's due.  $125 divided by $2.65 equals approximately 47.  47 X 2 = 94.  I can get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid to get off once.  Now tell me who gets the better deal. 
TODD You're right.  I can't argue with that. 
PHIL Anyway, I stopped watching porno. 
TODD You did?  Why? 
PHIL They kinda depress me. 
(beat) 
When I want to get off now, you know what I use? 
TODD What? 
Phil taps his forehead. 
PHIL My imagination. 
(to the couple) 
Okay, folks.  It's magic time. 
LATER. The couple is gone.  Phil and Todd wrap some equipment. 
Phil (cont'd) 
What I don't understand is, aren't you getting enough action from that Sarah? 
TODD What's Sarah got to do with it? 
PHIL You're seeing her, aren't you? 
TODD Sarah...that's a whole different situation. 
PHIL But you're doing it with her, right? 
TODD I like Sarah a lot.  And I don't want to blow it by pushing too hard. 
Phil stares. 
PHIL You mean, you haven't... 
TODD Technically?  No. 
PHIL She won't put out? 
TODD No, no, no.  You don't get it.  You can't equate the two.  What I did with Lorna-- 
PHIL Lorna? 
TODD That's her name.  Lorna.  I mean, that's the name she gave me. What I did with her...that was like going to some exotic place. For a visit.    Haven't you ever wondered what that kind of person is like?  What that world is like?  I was just...doing research.  The lower depths... 
(beat) 
You think I'm full of shit, don't you? 
PHIL I didn't say anything. 
CUT TO: OMITTED CUT TO 
EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
A revival house in a college neighborhood.  The ticket seller hangs a "Sold Out" sign in the box office window, just as Todd and SARAH come running down the sidewalk. 
SARAH Shit!  Sold out! 
(off Todd's look) 
What?  You've never had a Lorna Doone? 
TODD No. 
SARAH Terri and Lorna.  Sisters, maybe?  Lovers, more like it.  Or...witches. And this bracelet is some sort of talisman. 
TODD You have a perverse mind. 
(beat) 
...which I like, by the way. 
SARAH Or...perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this "gift" provides her with an alibi. 
TODD Maybe you should put it back. 
SARAH What, aren't you a little curious? 
Todd pulls over and stops. 
TODD Sarah...I don't know how to put this.  This is our fourth night out, and I feel a lot of pressure...for this to work. 
SARAH I want it to work, too. 
(off his look) 
Oh.  Is this about sex? 
TODD Don't you think we're being a little...methodical about the whole thing?  Maybe we should just... 
SARAH What?  Get it over with? 
TODD Not exactly. 
SARAH Don't you think it's better to be sure of each other first? To have a little bit of trust? 
Sarah absently fingers the bracelet that's not hers. 
TODD You can trust me. 
SARAH I know, I know. 
(beat) 
But you're not sleeping with anyone else, right? 
TODD Of course not. 
SARAH It's not such a strange thing to ask.  Sometimes relationships...overlap. I just need to feel-- 
TODD I told you.  I'm not. 
Beat. 
SARAH You haven't asked me if I'm seeing anyone. 
TODD Is that bad? 
SARAH It's silly, I know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine anyone being interested in me. 
TODD What?  You should be flattered I don't ask.  I respect you enough to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone. 
Sarah considers this. 
SARAH Hmm.  Ask me, anyway. 
TODD Are you serious? 
(off her look) 
Alright.  Are you seeing anyone? 
SARAH Absolutely not. 
Todd takes the bracelet, puts it on the dash, then leans to kiss Sarah. 
SARAH I do want to make love tonight. 
TODD I'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity-- 
She presses her finger to his lips-- 
SARAH I think spontaneity is overrated. 
CUT TO 
SARAH These walls, they're paper-thin.  This building is so poorly built.  Everyone can hear you. 
Todd rolls off of her. 
TODD Is that why you're so quiet? 
SARAH Yes, the walls are...What are you saying? 
TODD It's hard for me to tell if you're enjoying this. 
SARAH Of course, I am.  I'm sorry if I'm not vocal enough for you. 
TODD That's not what I...Sarah, I just want to make sure I'm doing something right here. 
SARAH There's no right or wrong way to do this. 
TODD I know.  I just want to make sure I'm...you know, in the ballpark. 
Sarah stares at him. 
SARAH Todd, I don't expect you to do everything right the first time...Sorry, that didn't come out the way I meant it... 
They roll away from each other and stare at the ceiling.  We hear a distant siren -- a fire engine, maybe.  Somewhere there's a five-alarm fire blazing.  Not here. 
TODD You didn't like it. 
SARAH No, I didn't say that.  I was just...Let's be still for a while. Alright? 
FADE OUT: FADE IN: 
INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT 
Sarah and Todd haven't moved.  It's not clear how much time has elapsed. 
SARAH Everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it.  But that's just a myth. 
TODD A myth.  You're right. 
SARAH Let's not be too hard on ourselves. 
TODD I agree. 
SARAH Our expectations were a little high, that's all. 
Todd nods his agreement. 
TODD And at the end of the day, sex is only one part of the picture. 
SARAH True.  What do you mean? 
TODD I know this couple. They had nothing in common but good sex. They went at it like a pair of rabbits.  And guess how long it lasted?  A month.  They were hot for each other...but there was nothing else. 
SARAH Right. 
(beat) 
There's got to be something else. 
And they stare at the ceiling. 
FADE OUT: FADE IN: 
INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - STILL LATER - NIGHT 
They still haven't moved, but unbeknownst to Sarah, Todd has fallen asleep. 
She looks at him.  She caresses his face.  Then, her hand slides down under the sheets.  She tries to arouse him, but after a while she stops.  He's very much asleep. 
Sarah lies back.  She slides her hand between her legs and begins to touch herself. 
Quietly. 
FADE OUT: FADE IN: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Early morning.  The air is cool and crisp as Sarah, wearing sweats and a T-shirt, jogs through the neighborhood. 
She turns down a side street, heading for-- 
EXT. SARAH'S GRANDPARENTS HOUSE - DAY 
A nondescript house with a faded American flag hanging off the front porch.  Sarah climbs the steps where an elderly man -- her GRANDFATHER, sits with the morning paper in his lap, unread. 
Sarah gives him a kiss. 
SARAH Morning, Pappy.  How's she doing today? 
SARAH No small feat. 
GRANDMOTHER It's an accomplishment.  But the next morning, your Pappy saw it.  He demanded an explanation.  And, Sarah, do you know how I got out of that pickle? 
SARAH You lied. 
GRANDMOTHER Damn right.  I said, "What, you don't remember giving me this?" He said, "No."  And I said, "Well, you were so fired up last night, it's a wonder you can remember anything." 
(beat) 
And the beast was tamed. 
Sarah considers the story. 
SARAH And you've never been tempted to... 
GRANDMOTHER What?  Come clean with your Pappy?  Why should I tell him?  He had nothing to do with it. 
SARAH Right. 
GRANDMOTHER It's mine.  Not his. 
SARAH I wonder what became of that boy. 
GRANDMOTHER Never saw him again.  I don't regret a thing, if that's what you're wondering. 
SARAH I was, in fact. 
GRANDMOTHER Look what I have.  I have you. 
(beat) 
And you know what else?  I have the tall grass by that river. And those clouds.  From where I was laying the clouds looked really beautiful that day. 
CUT TO 
INT. THE MODEL CITY/OFFICE - DAY 
The same model we saw at the start of our story.  We glide toward a miniature suburban development.  Row upon row of houses, each no different than the next. 
Over this -- 
SARAH I don't believe it.  You're actually asking my opinion.  You really want to know what I think? 
We TILT UP to reveal that we're in-- 
The well-appointed office of the well-heeled JOSH, an architect in his early 40s.  Josh studies the model like a boy with a train set.  Sarah stands beside him. 
JOSH To tell you the truth, no.  I just wanted to hear your voice. You've barely said "boo" to me all morning. 
SARAH (shrugs) 
Boo. 
JOSH Alright, what do you think of it? 
SARAH You'd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood. 
(off his look) 
Hey, what do I know?  I'm just the assistant. 
JOSH What are they going to think?  That's all that matters. 
SARAH To paraphrase you, this is going to give them a major hard-on. Not the women, of course. 
JOSH You haven't met these women. 
Sarah laughs, catches herself and stops. 
CUT TO 
INT. OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY 
Sarah and Josh move down a hall toward the elevators.  Josh is in micro-management mode -- 
JOSH The champagne order? 
SARAH Done.  Dom Perignon.  Fifteen cases. 
JOSH Invitations? 
SARAH A messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs. 
JOSH Good. 
He reaches behind her and pats her butt. 
As she hangs up the construction supervisor exits.  Sarah and Josh are alone. 
SARAH Guess I'll be heading back... 
JOSH Wait. 
(beat) 
About the other day...Are you having any second thoughts? 
SARAH (shrugs) 
No.  None. 
JOSH You're angry I called it quits, aren't you?  You can admit it. 
SARAH No.  In fact, I want to thank you. 
JOSH For what? 
SARAH For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship I've ever had in my life.  For that, I thank you. 
Josh raises his hands in surrender. 
JOSH Touché. 
SARAH Are you having seconds thoughts? 
JOSH No.  I say, let's make a clean break.  Let's just walk away from it. 
Sarah smiles.  She extends her hand. 
JOSH What are you doing? 
SARAH Let's seal the deal.  Shake. 
It's a little awkward, but they do. 
JOSH Alright.  Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem left. 
SARAH What? 
JOSH Where do we put the bed? 
Josh gestures to the empty room.  Sarah smiles -- it's a familiar game. 
SARAH Oh, the bed.  Let's put it against this wall.  Away from the morning sun. 
JOSH Wrong.  It's got to go here.  So you can see the hallway. 
They head out. 
As Josh and Sarah leave the house, they "decorate" several rooms. 
INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM -- DAY 
SARAH Not enough height for bunk beds. 
JOSH Why do you assume there will be two children? 
SARAH There has to be.  They need to keep each other company. 
INT. THE KITCHEN -- DAY 
SARAH Definitely not enough space for two people to cook. 
JOSH I prefer to eat out. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM -- DAY 
They size up the space, enjoying their play.  Sara walks around imaginary furniture. 
SARAH Oh, no.  I wouldn't put the ottoman there. 
JOSH Where would you put it? 
SARAH It needs to go over... 
She waves her hand, accidentally brushing against Josh's chest. She lets her hand linger... 
SARAH Hmmm. 
JOSH What? 
...and linger.  They both know what's happening. 
SARAH We have another problem. 
He'll answer, anyway. 
joSH 
If my hands weren't tied...it might have made all the difference. 
Beat. 
sarah 
I said I wasn't asking.  And that's the worst answer you could've given. 
cUT TO 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
Josh and Sarah get into their respective cars -- her BMW, his Navigator. 
Josh looks at himself in the rear-view mirror.  He reacts-- 
JoSH 
What the hell is this? 
Sarah looks over. 
joSH (cont'd) 
You bit me on the neck!  I've got a goddam hickey! 
Sure enough, there is a bright red mark on his neck. 
Sarah comes over.  She reacts with shock, embarrassment, then...laughter. 
joSH (cont'd) 
What's so goddam funny?  You did this on purpose, didn't you? 
sarah 
I did not.  I was just...I didn't mean to...I was caught up in the moment. 
And she laughs again. 
jOSH 
What the hell are we going to do about this? 
sARAH 
Josh, you are a big boy.  You can take care of this on your own. 
Josh glares at her, starts his engine, and leaves her in the dust. 
cUT TO: 
INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Todd is on the kitchen phone.  Lorna's bracelet sits on the counter. 
TODD (into phone) 
No, no, no.  You don't understand.  I don't want an appointment, I just need to get in touch with her...She left a package here by mistake, a gift...No, I'd rather give it to her myself...Lorna, but I assume none of you use your real names...What?  But she was working last week?...And you don't have a forwarding number? ...Look, it's really important that I get this back to her, so-- 
The line goes dead. 
TODD Dammit. 
He dials again.  Then, a knock at the door.  Todd reacts -- he's not expecting anyone. 
He opens the door and finds-- 
SARAH Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier.  She holds a small paper bag. 
TODD Sarah... 
SARAH I brought you something. 
She hands him the bag.  He looks inside. 
TODD Pickles.  Huh. 
(beat) 
What's in your hair? 
She touches her hair. 
He gets into bed next to her. 
JOSH I've been under a lot of stress. 
GWEN You don't have to apologize.  There's nothing wrong with the slump we're going through.  In fact, it's a good thing. 
JOSH How's that? 
He turns off the side light.  We can't see them -- the room is completely dark. 
GWEN Too much passion can ruin a marriage.  Look at Eric and Sylvia. At the beginning, you couldn't pry them apart.  They were joined at the genitals.  And, then...total burn-out.  A marriage cannot sustain that kind of intensity.  It's good for people to grow bored with each other.  That way, they can meet and fall in love again. 
She snuggles up to him, strokes his back. 
GWEN In case you hadn't noticed...I'm trying to seduce you. 
JOSH I can feel that. 
GWEN You're welcome to reciprocate. 
Josh turns on the light and sits up. 
JOSH I can't. 
GWEN It's alright. 
JOSH To seduce...to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise. I know all your moves.  You know mine.  How can there be any surprise? 
Gwen sits up, throws back the sheet. 
GWEN Rub my feet. 
He does. 
GWEN I think we should have an affair. 
JOSH What? 
GWEN With each other. 
JOSH That makes no sense. 
GWEN You pick me up at a bar... 
JOSH And, what?  Pretend I don't know you? 
GWEN (ignores him) 
Or we could meet at a hotel.  I'll register under my maiden name. Just like THE GRADUATE. 
JOSH THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having an affair with a college boy. 
GWEN When I met you, you were a college boy. 
JOSH Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very unhappy woman who has an affair out of wedlock.  As I recall, it turns out rather badly for her. 
GWEN Alright.  Bad example. 
(rethe foot rub) 
You can stop. 
JOSH Actors pretend.  That's what they do.  I'm not an actor.  And I love you the way you are. 
GWEN I love you, too. 
And he turns out the light again. 
JOSH Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem. 
Beat. 
GWEN Who said there was a problem? 
CUT TO 
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 
A cocktail party at Josh's firm.  Josh is the center of attention, greeting investors, fielding compliments.  Gwen stands beside him, drinking champagne -- Dom Perignon, after all. 
JOSH'S POV Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date -- Todd. 
GWEN Your lovely assistant is here. 
(reTodd) 
You didn't tell me she had a new boyfriend. 
As Josh and Todd sidle up--. 
JOSH (to bartender) 
Gin.  Straight up.  Olives. 
(Todd) 
What are you having? 
TODD I'm fine, thanks. 
JOSH So...Sarah's an attractive girl. 
TODD Very. 
JOSH You two serious? 
TODD (shrugs) 
Hard to say. 
JOSH She wants to play the field, right? 
TODD No, that's not it. 
JOSH I see.  You want to fuck around. 
Todd reacts. 
JOSH C'mon, we're guys.  I know the drill. 
Todd considers his audience, then decides to open up-- 
TODD We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was on the fence about Sarah.  I liked her, but I didn't think we were in a good groove. Then, a couple weeks ago, her grandmother died.  Things changed. 
JOSH I didn't know. 
(beat) 
She didn't say a thing about it. 
TODD It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard.  So where did that leave me?  I was ambivalent about things, right?  But then my ambivalence had to take a back seat.  I had to be there for her.  Completely.  And, ready or not, our relationship became...a real relationship. 
Josh simply listens. 
TODD You know, I wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody.  I don't know...Death has a funny way of making you get outside yourself. 
Josh looks past Todd-- 
JOSH'S POV Gwen is still chatting with Sarah.  Gwen makes eye contact with Josh and sends him a warm smile. 
CUT TO 
INT. JOSH'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
Josh and Gwen drive home in silence.  Gwen notices something out the window. 
GWEN You missed the on-ramp. 
JOSH I know. 
GWEN Why? 
JOSH Somewhere we need to go first. 
CUT TO 
EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The Mercedes pulls up to the "Happiness Chinese Restaurant." Josh and Gwen get out and take in the sight-- 
GWEN We don't have to do this tonight. 
JOSH Yes, we do. 
She peers in the window. 
GWEN We can't go in here.  Everything's different. 
He opens the door for her. 
JOSH That's okay.  We're different, too. 
CUT TO 
INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
An upscale hotel.  Gwen, in a sheer blouse and a slim leather skirt, fills out the registration card at the front desk.  The DESK CLERK looks up from his computer. 
DESK CLERK And how many nights will you be staying with us? 
GWEN One. 
DESK CLERK We do have a two-night minimum. 
GWEN Then...two. 
She hands him the card. 
GWEN I'd like to pay in cash. 
DESK CLERK That won't be a problem.  We just need a credit card imprint for your incidentals... 
Gwen reacts.  The Desk Clerk puts her at ease. 
DESK CLERK ...which we tear up when you check out. 
Gwen smiles. 
DESK CLERK Will you be needing more than one key? 
GWEN Two, please. 
CUT TO 
INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY 
Gwen and DAVID lunch in the hotel's elegant dining room.  David is quite the draw, turning heads across the room.  And, it's no wonder.  He has real magnetism. 
DAVID WARREN I'm still reeling.  It was the most humbling experience of my life.  Getting raked over the coals by a bunch of sixteen-year old drama students!  At my own alma mater! 
GWEN I'm surprised they weren't all over you. 
DAVID WARREN They were, with knives drawn. 
GWEN What did they say? 
DAVID WARREN Basically, why am I working on a piece of shit like MALIBU NIGHTS when I should be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov? 
(beat) 
It was brutal. 
A WAITER delivers a bottle of champagne to David. 
WAITER Compliments from the table in the corner. 
The Waiter gestures.  David and Gwen turn.  In the corner three middle-aged women are smiling. 
David mouths a gracious "thank you" their way. 
GWEN See?  Those women are happy you're not doing Shakespeare. 
Beat. 
DAVID WARREN Gwen.  You look great.  You haven't changed a bit. 
GWEN I don't think I'm MALIBU NIGHTS material. 
DAVID WARREN Those women!  Walking boob jobs.  They're appalling. 
GWEN You look like you enjoy kissing them. 
DAVID WARREN It's very simple.  I close my eyes and imagine I'm kissing someone else. 
GWEN Hmm.  Someone else in particular? 
DAVID WARREN Yes. 
GWEN If she's as tan as you, I don't want to hear about it. 
David reaches for his wallet. 
DAVID WARREN Here, take a look... 
He hands her a photo.  In it, we see David standing with a distinguished man in his mid-40s.  With them is a smiling boy, about eleven. 
Gwen is nonplussed. 
DAVID WARREN What's wrong with this picture, huh? 
She smiles. 
GWEN No, you don't understand. 
DESK CLERK Yes.  I do. 
(beat) 
More than you might think. 
Gwen stares at him. 
DESK CLERK Shall I close out the account? 
GWEN No.  I need the room after all. 
(beat) 
Will you show me the way there? 
The Desk Clerk looks at her with no apparent interest. 
DESK CLERK You're in luck.  I was just about to take my break. 
CUT TO 
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
The Desk Clerk and Gwen ride in the elevator.  Silently.  There is no discernible connection between them. 
CUT TO 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY 
The Desk Clerk leads Gwen to the room.  It couldn't look more business-like. 
CUT TO 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
They enter.  He locks the door.  She surveys the room. 
DESK CLERK Something from the mini-bar? 
GWEN No. 
DESK CLERK How's the air conditioning? 
GWEN Fine. 
DESK CLERK Shall I pull down the covers? 
GWEN I suppose. 
DESK CLERK Do you want to know my name? 
GWEN No. 
He takes her in his arms. 
DESK CLERK You're shaking. 
GWEN I'll be fine. 
(beat) 
This could get you in trouble.  You could lose your job, right? 
DESK CLERK I don't care. 
GWEN You don't even know me. 
DESK CLERK You're right. 
GWEN We have nothing in common. 
Beat. 
DESK CLERK That's where you're wrong. 
He begins to unbutton her blouse.  Without touching.  Without affection.  After a beat, she begins to unbutton his shirt. 
CUT TO 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY 
A little later.  A maid vacuums the carpet as the Desk Clerk emerges, followed by Gwen.  They cross to the elevator, as business-like as before. 
DESK CLERK (to the Maid) 
INT. EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - DAY 
David hangs his uniform shirt in his locker.  He gathers his personal things.  A jacket, a knapsack, and...a violin case. 
The HOTEL MANAGER approaches. 
HOTEL MANAGER Yo, fiddler on the roof. 
David reacts -- this is the last person he wants to deal with. 
HOTEL MANAGER (regards the violin) 
Wish I could play an instrument.  Chicks really dig that stuff. Tried the guitar in high school.  What can I say?  No discipline. 
DAVID Discipline.  Always a struggle. 
HOTEL MANAGER I hear you.  For instance, it takes a certain discipline to know that when you're working at the hotel, when you're on the clock... 
(shrugs) 
...you shouldn't fuck the guests. 
David was not expecting this. 
HOTEL MANAGER (cont'd) 
You want to bring your girlfriend here on your day off?  That's a different story.  I'll even give you the corporate rate on a room. 
(beat) 
Just don't do it while you're on the clock.  You hear me? 
DAVID It won't happen again. 
HOTEL MANAGER Good. 
David marches away. 
CUT TO 
INT. MUSIC CONSERVATORY - DAY 
In a sun-lit practice room, a string quartet rehearses.  Four men -- David included, perform an energetic movement from a Beethoven quartet. 
NOTE: Throughout the film, we've heard this string quartet as underscore.  Now...we meet the soundtrack. 
David plays with emotion and a physicality we haven't seen in him -- truly, this is where he lives. 
CUT TO 
INT. CONSERVATORY HALLWAY - DAY 
After the rehearsal.  Violin at his side, David trudges through the exit.  Music emanates from every room.  He turns a corner, runs smack into-- 
ROSALIE. She's been waiting. 
DAVID Jesus! 
She simply picks up where they left off-- 
ROSALIE I want you to be there on Sunday. 
DAVID No. 
ROSALIE You told me we'd always be friends. 
DAVID I lied. 
ROSALIE You're an important part of my life, David.  There's so much history between us.  I don't want to trash it simply because-- 
DAVID Because what?  Because you're getting married? 
Beat. 
DAVID Rosie, I want you to be happy.  I do.  And someday, we'll be friends.  Someday, we'll all go out to dinner.  The four of us. 
ROSALIE The four of us? 
DAVID Sure.  Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale imitation of you I can dig up to be my date. 
ROSALIE Stop it. 
But he's on a roll-- 
DAVID And the check will come and Jerry will pick up the tab and I'll protest, but not too much.  Then, you'll give me a kiss on the cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too long. And we'll say, "It was great to see you."  And it will be great to see you... 
(beat) 
CUT TO 
INT. ROSALIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
After midnight.  Rosalie slips inside the door.  No sign of Jerry. She removes her shoes and tiptoes into-- 
INT. ROSALIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The television is on -- the sound is muted.  An infomercial is playing.  Jerry is sleeping. 
ON ROSALIE She nudges him.  He doesn't stir.  Rosalie sits at the foot of the bed.  She grabs the remote and "un-mutes" the sound. 
INT. ROSALIE'S BEDROOM - ON TV - NIGHT 
A physical fitness EXPERT is talking. 
EXPERT ...And the change is not just physical.  You'll be amazed how quickly your whole outlook will-- 
INT. ROSALIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
She flicks off the TV. 
Rosalie undresses and climbs into bed.  She starts to kiss Jerry. Slowly, he wakes. 
JERRY Hey... 
ROSALIE Hey... 
JERRY What time is it? 
ROSALIE Late. 
He looks at the time. 
JERRY It is late.  What happened? 
ROSALIE Oh.  The girls.  Wedding talk.  We could've gone on all night. 
She rubs his chest. 
ROSALIE Jerry... 
JERRY What? 
ROSALIE We need to make love now. 
JERRY Okay...why now? 
ROSALIE I can't explain it.  We just need to make love now. 
He nods.  He kisses her neck, her breasts. 
Suddenly she stops him, taking his face in her hands. 
JERRY What's the matter? 
ROSALIE I just need to fix this moment in my mind. 
A long beat.  She studies his face. 
ROSALIE I love you.  Totally.  Completely.  I don't want to spend another minute of my life without you. 
(off his reaction) 
You don't have to say anything. 
She climbs on top of him. 
JERRY You're forgetting something. 
ROSALIE No, I'm not. 
He laughs uncomfortably. 
JERRY Don't you think... 
ROSALIE No, I don't.  Let's not use it tonight. 
(beat) 
I'm ready. 
A beat. 
JERRY If you're ready, so am I. 
She straddles him, rocking back and forth.  With grim determination. 
JerRY 
Right. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TOBACCO SHOP - DAY 
Jerry accompanies his FATHER -- late 50s, on a cigar-buying expedition. Tobacco enthusiasts relax in leather chairs.  Wafts of smoke hang in the air -- expensive smoke. 
Jerry's Father finds a brand he likes. 
FATHER Here we are.  Bahia Gold.  Two hundred a box. 
JERRY You don't have to do this, Dad. 
FATHER If I can't come to the bachelor party, I want to be there in spirit. 
(beat) 
The boys will like these.  Classic. 
JERRY Thank-you. 
FATHER I remember my bachelor night.  Frankly, I wish I didn't.  Not a night I'm particularly proud of...I'll leave it at that. 
JERRY Why are you sharing this? 
FATHER Reminiscing.  That's all. 
JERRY Or warning me. 
FATHER Nonsense.  I know you.  You won't make an ass out of yourself. 
(beat) 
Oh...A little something from your mother and me. 
He reaches into his pocket, hands Jerry a key. 
JERRY What's this? 
FATHER It's a key. 
(smiles) 
There's a new housing development, just west of here.  I've been giving the developer a lot of breaks, and...now he's giving me one in return.  I'm almost embarrassed to say how little this cost me. 
JERRY I can't accept this. 
FATHER Yes, you can. 
(beat) 
C'mon.  Make your old man happy. 
Jerry says nothing. 
FATHER Uh-huh.  I get it.  This is Rosalie's domain.  She should have a say in where you two settle down.  But don't worry, you won't be forcing her hand.  Know why?  Because she's going to love it. 
Jerry just nods. 
FATHER Let's ring these babies up. 
CUT TO 
INT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Bachelor party in progress.  In the living room, a dozen guys smoke Cuban-rolled cigars, drink shots of Tequila, and watch a Stripper perform. 
The least boisterous of the group is Jerry, who watches the action with a drunken glow. 
The party's host, Jerry's BEST FRIEND, enters and summons Jerry into-- 
INT. TOWNHOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT 
The Best Friend aims Jerry toward the stairs. 
BEST FRIEND Alright, my man.  You ready? 
JERRY Do I have a choice? 
BEST FRIEND No. 
JERRY Then, I'm ready. 
BEST FRIEND The guys pitched in for this... 
Morning.  Terri -- still under the covers -- studies the torn clipping from the paper.  Lorna brushes her teeth. 
TERRI Hello...It's the oldest condition known to man.  Cold feet. 
LORNA You're wrong.  I'm telling you he's two states away by now. 
(beat) 
He made a clean break.  I know it. 
Terri shakes her head. 
TERRI If you're wrong, you're paying for drinks tonight. 
CUT TO 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Lorna and Terri walk briskly down the sidewalk.  They round a corner to see-- 
EXT. CATHEDRAL -- DAY 
A magnificent Catholic church. A white limousine -- decorated with streamers -- sits in front, surrounded by expensive cars. 
TERRI Well, what do you know... 
Lorna can't believe it -- she almost feels betrayed. 
TERRI Told you we should've dressed up. 
LORNA C'mon...we're going inside. 
TERRI What for?  Wait... 
But Lorna is bounding toward the cathedral. 
CUT TO 
INT. CATHEDRAL VESTIBULE - DAY 
Lorna and Terri enter.  The vestibule looks empty.  Suddenly, they are startled by a FLASH. 
They turn to find a photographer checking a bulb -- it's Todd. 
TERRI Lorna, we shouldn't be here. 
Hearing her name Todd looks up.  Then, he gathers his gear and starts inside. 
But Lorna intercepts him. 
LORNA Excuse me, could you tell me who's getting married in... 
(beat) 
Hey, I know you.  The wedding guy. 
TODD I'm sorry. Have we met? 
LORNA Yeah.  You don't remember me? 
TODD You must be thinking of somebody else. 
Lorna reacts.  Stops herself. 
LORNA Right.  I must be thinking of someone else.  Sorry. 
TODD Excuse me... 
And he disappears into the church. 
TERRI What was that all about? 
LORNA Nothing. 
TERRI Nothing, my ass. 
LORNA Alright, alright.  I slipped. 
TERRI Slipped?  You broke the cardinal rule of the trade. 
(pedantic) 
Never acknowledge a client in public. 
LORNA What is this?  Hooking For Dummies?  C'mon... 
Lorna grabs Terri by the wrist and slips into--

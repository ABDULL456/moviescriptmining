THE 25th HOUR

INDUSTRY ENTERTAINMENT 
EXT . WES T SIDE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT 
o    A blac k dog sleeps on the shoulder of the highway, head between his paws , curled up next to the barricad e that separates the north and southbound lanes . 
Traffic rumbles past him: yellow cabs , blu e polic e cruisers , white limousines with tinted glass and Jersey plates . 
We hea r the squeal of brakes. A black *65 Ford Mustang, min t condition, pulls onto the shoulder, ten yard s past the dog , and back s up . Th e dog raises its head. 
Two me n step out of the car.          The driver , MONT Y BROGAN, mid - twenties , is pale-skinned in          the flickering light . A small silver crucifix hangs from a           silver chain around his neck ; his fingers are adorned with           silver rings . 
The passenger , KOSTYA NOVOTNY, a hulking ma n in his late thirties , blow s his nose in his handkerchief. It's a cold night . Monty wears a camel's hai r overcoat, Kostya an old blue Soviet Navy coat . 
MONTY 
He's alive. 
KOSTYA 
(Ukrainian accent) This dog, how do you call it? 
MONTY 
Pit bull . Must have lost somebody some money . The dog stares at them and they stare at the dog . 
KOSTYA 
What d o w e do , Monty, w e watch hi m rot ? 
·· ' .·····- · ' ? -. : · ·- ·' MONTY : . ·' ·· '' ' ' ;:; '' ' 
I was thinking of shooting him . 
KOSTYA 
Shooting him? Ar e you sick in the head ? 
The dog continues to stare at them impassively, his face lit by the passing headlights. The pavement by hi s paws is littered with broken glass, twisted scraps of metal , black rubber from blow n tires.

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MONTY 
They just left him here to die. They threw him out the window and kept driving. A ship's horn sounds from the Hudson. 
KOSTYA 
Come, my friend, it is cold. Come, people wait for us. 
MONTY 
They're used to waiting. Monty squats near the dog and inspects him. From this angle it is clear that the pit bull has been badly abused. One ear has been chewed to mince; his hide is scored with cigarette burns; flies crawl in his bloodied fur. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
I think maybe his hip -- The dog pounces, jaws snapping,; lunging for Monty's face. Monty stumbles backwards. The dog, too badly injured to continue the attack, remains in his crouch, growling. Monty sits on the pavement, shaking his head. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Christ. (beat) He's got some bite left. 
KOSTYA 
I think he does not want to play with you. Come, you want police to pull over? You want police looking through your car? 
MONTY 
Look what they did to him. Used him for a fucking ashtray. Monty stands and dusts his palms on the seat of his pants. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Let's get him in the trunk. 
KOSTYA 
What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED :    (2 ) 
MONTY 
There's a vet emergency room on the East Side. I like this guy. 
KOSTYA 
You like him? He tries to bite your face off. Look at him, he is meat. You want some dog, I buy you.nice puppy tomorrow. Monty is not listening. He walks back to his car, opens the trunk, pulls out a soiled green army blanket. Kostya holds up his hands: stop. 
KOSTYA    (CONT'D) 
Wait one minute,    please. Please stop one minute? I do not    go near pit bull. Monty? I do not go near    pit bull. Monty, carrying the army blanket, walks back toward the dog. 
MONTY 
This is a good dog. I can see it in his eyes. He's a tough little bastard. 
KOSTYA 
Sometimes I think you are very stupid man. The dog has slumped back to the pavement. His breath, comes in. shorts rasps and wheezes. But he never takes his eyes off the two men. 
MONTY 
We wait much longer, he'll be dead. 
KOSTYA 
One minute ago you want to shoot him. 
MONTY 
That was a mercy thing. But he's not ready to go yet. 
KOSTYA 
Yes? He told you this? Monty slowly circles behind the dog, holding the blanket the way a matador wields his cape. 
Okay.

{   \            Monty lean s close r t o Jakob . 
MONTY 
(whispering) I think the one with the bell y button' s checking me out. Jakob turns and sees Mary staring at them. He quickly turns back to Monty , wh o is smiling at Mary. Jako b grab s the door knob. 
JAKOB 
Okay, so I'll see you later? Monty nods . 
MONTY 
Tel l Frank we'll meet up after midnight . He leads Doyle away and Jakob closes the door , the n turns to look at his silent class. The bell rings and all the students grab their bags .                                              , 
INT. TEACHERS ' LOUNG E -- LATER 
Jakob, alon e in the room, sits on a sofa, his hea d in his                                                                                                                                                        \ hands. He looks up when he hears a knock on the door.                                                                                                                                                           xl"y Mary D'Annunzio peek s in.

I thought no students were allowed in the teachers ' lounge. 
JAKOB 
I won' t tell on you. Mary walks into the room, looking around suspiciously. Jakob points at a chair . 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Tak e a seat. Mary sits .                                                                                                                                                                                                 (        ) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
So what's up? 
MARY 
Who was that guy who came to class? 
JAKOB 
Monty? An old friend of mine. He went here, too. 
MARY 
He doesn't look like you. 
JAKOB 
Actually, I have many friends who don't look like me. 
MARY 
No, I mean, he doesn't look like someone you'd be friends with. 
JAKOB 
We grew up together. (beat) So what can I do for you? 
MARY 
I want to know why I got a B+ on my story. 
JAKOB 
Okay, first of all -- 
MARY 
Nobody else in this class can write. You know it, too. Don't start -- 
JAKOB 
Don't worry about everyone else. 
MARY 
Vince Miskella writes a story about his grandmother dying and you give him an A? What is that, a charity A? Everyone's always writing about their grandmother dying. You know why? Not because it's so traumatic. Because it's a guaranteed A. And you're all sentimental, like, "Oh, Vince, that was very powerful, very moving." No it wasn't. You didn't care, I didn't care, nobody cared. That's what grandmothers do, they die. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : (2) 
Mary has worked herself into a lather and Jakob watches her admiringly. 
JAKOB 
What did your mother say when you go t that? 
Mary stares at him, not comprehending. 
MARY 
What? When I got what? 
JAKOB 
(pointing at her wrist) The tattoo. 
MARY 
She said, "Where'd you get the mone y for that. " 
JAKOB 
Oh . And? 
MARY 
And what did I say or where did I get the money? 
Oh good, you've got a theory. Look, you're in awfully deep. You've got sixty million of the bank's money in there-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : (2) 
e                        SLATTERY A hundred million. 
The news startles Lichter. 
LICHTER 
A hundred million? Jesus, Frank. 
SLATTERY 
They authorized me to a hundred million. 
Other traders sitting nearby have begun watching this exchange, and Lichter is careful to keep his voice down. 
LICHTER 
A week ago. They raised your limit a week ago, and you're already maxing out. 
SLATTERY 
I'm telling you, we're in for a low number. One-forty, maybe one-thirty-five. 
LICHTER 
Cut your stake in half,    all right? You've been doing a great job,    everyone knows that, but I'm still you   r boss and I'm telling you: sell those    contracts. Lichter grips Slattery's shoulder for a moment and then walks toward his office (a real office, with walls and a door) , exchanging hellos with other traders on the floor. PHELAN, fresh from college, walks down the row, handing fax sheets to all the traders. He hands a sheet to Slattery, wh o looks-at--it briefly before crumpling it .         ........ 
PHELAN 
Sollie's looking for a high number. Tw o hundred and eighty thousand's their call . 
SLATTERY 
Fuck Sollie. 
PHELAN 
Fuck Salomon Brothers? 
SLATTERY 
They're hedging their bets . They want everyone on their side of the fence. 
PHELAN 
What's the big deal with the employment number, anyway? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : (3)                                     ...,., 
Slattery doesn't want to discuss this right now . 
SLATTERY 
More jobs means fewer people looking for work, right? Which means it's harder to find the right people for a job, which means you got to raise wages to get them, which mean s inflation goes up -- you following? 
PHELAN 
(not following) Yeah. 
Slatter y frowns. 
SLATTERY 
You're wearing a striped shirt with a striped tie . Phelan looks down at his tie . 
PHELAN 
Yeah? Is that bad ? SLATTERY                                                   "x ,L#bi             You look like a xuoAiiiig optical -LJ.JHJOJ.LJII. xxiv c a fuckin j u^t.J.^ax illusion .                      ** 
Go away. Phelan walks away, nervously adjusting his tie . MARCUSE peeks over the partition in front of Slattery. With his slicked-back hair , red suspenders, and obnoxious smirk, Marcuse looks like a ma n who owns the Gordon Gekk o action figure. 
- MARGUSE-                                  ...·-..- 
Better hop to , sonny boy. Slattery says nothing, just stabs angrily at hi s keyboard. 
MARCUSE (CONT'D) 
I don't see you pickin g up the phone . Didn't Lichter just tell you to sell? Sounds like your allowance got cut off . Slattery, nostrils flared, pretends to ignore the taunts . 
MARCUSE (CONT'D) 
You're not going to disobey a direct order, are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : (4) 
Slattery rolls back in his wheeled office chair and stares at Marcuse. 
SLATTERY 
I don't come into your bedroom and tell yo u how to fuck your wife, do I? 
Marcuse grins . He calls to another trader down the floor. 
MARCUSE 
Hey , Schultz, what are we looking at for the employment number?. 
SCHULTZ 
(yelling from his desk) Two-fifty, two-seventy, somewhere in there . Marcuse sits down again, disappearing behind the partition. Slattery glowers at his desk. He picks up his phon e and holds the receiver to his ear, never dialing a number. Lichter calls to Slattery from his office door. 
LICHTER 
Slattery! We're good? Slattery nods and gives a thumbs up. As soon as Lichter returns to his office, Slattery hangs up the phone . Marcuse sticks his head above the partition again. 
MARCUSE 
Good thing you got rid of those contracts.-Looks like a huge numbe r o n -- ,«--·-.·----««». the way. The trading floor suddenly -- and eerily-^ goes quiet. Everyone's attention is fixed on the television monitors hanging from th e ceilings. The monitors ar e muted; closed captioning files along the bottoms of the screens. 
Each monitor is tuned to the same station, a financial network broadcasting the employment number's release. A REPORTER wearing a bowtie reads the statistics. 
Slattery bows hi s head. He holds his hands in his lap and closes his eyes . For a long while the room is very quiet. 
Then a commotion of shouts and groans riles the floor. Everyone is hollering at the same time, and we can only make out a few phrases . 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
You were born in America, you lived in America your whole life, you've been to Puerto Rico twice, for vacation. What is that? I should get an Irish flag tattooed on my ass cause my grandparents are from there? 
NATURELLE 
You,don!t have room on your ass for an Irish flag. Monty dips his hands into the warm water, reaches below her, grabs her butt. Naturelle shrieks and Monty laughs. 
MONTY 
Between you and me the kids will be just right. Loud pounding on the apartment door startles them. They stare at each other. Doyle barks from the other room. Naturelle gets out of the tub, pulls on a bathrobe, and goes to answer the door. Monty waits, listening. He knows who it is. He stares out the bathroom's open window. 
C)    INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM -- STILL IN FLASHBACK 
Monty, wearing sweatpants and no shirt, walks into the living room. Four D.E.A. AGENTS, all wearing D.E.A. windbreakers and shoulder holsters, wait for him. Doyle, ears back, growls at the agents. Monty scratches Doyle's head and the dog relaxes a bit. Naturelle, panicked, stares at Monty. She's still holding the apartment door open. 
MONTY 
Close the door, baby. She closes the door. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI 
Montgomery Brogan? 
MONTY 
Yeah. Brzowski flips open a badge and hands a paper to Monty, who looks it over. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI                                    ^^ 
I'm Agent Brzowksi with the Drug Enforcement Agency. We've got a warrant to search your apartment. Brzowksi walks over to the sofa and sits down. The other three agents stroll around the apartment. One looks out the window; one starts flipping through a magazine on the coffee table; one stares at a photograph on the wall. 
AGENT CUNNINGHAM 
You take this picture? 
MONTY 
Yeah. 
AGENT CUNNINGHAM 
Nice picture. When one of the agents steps too close to Doyle, the dog growls and the agent jumps back. 
MONTY 
Easy, Doyle. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI                                    I) 
I don't see any tags on that dog.                         ^"^^ 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : 
o                            MONTY He's inside. He doesn't have to wear tags. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI 
He better stay calm or I'll have the pound come get him. I've seen too many men bit by these little bastards . Monty whistles and Doyle stands and walks over to him. Monty crouches, one hand stroking Doyle's thick neck. 
Naturelle, uncomfortable wearing only the bathrobe, begins heading back to the bedroom. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) 
Ms . Rosario? That's your name , right? I need you to stay right here, ma'am. 
He winks at her. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) 
Can't have you sneaking around. Naturelle leans against the wall, looking for a sign from Monty, who gives her none. The agents don't seem to be searching very hard. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) 
Hm. He stares down at the sofa he's sitting on . 
AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT-?D) 
This sofa is not very comfortable. Monty stares at the agent for a second and then exhales. He turns and looks carefully at Naturelle. 
AGENT CUNNINGHAM 
Maybe it's your posture. Posture's very important. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI 
No , it's this sofa. It's very uncomfortable. It's lumpy. 
MONTY 
Get it over with. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
yj                           AGENT BRZOWSKI I just don't understand. It looks like such a nice sofa. How much did you pay for this sofa, Ms . Rosario? Brzowksi stands and looks down at the cushion. Monty is still staring at Naturelle, who meets his eye for a second and then quickly turns away. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) 
Maybe it's the padding? 
AGENT CUNNINGHAM 
Could be the padding. Brzowski picks up the center cushion, turns it in his hands, and unzips it. 
AGENT BRZOWSKI 
Probably the padding. He pulls out handfuls of white fiber filling and lets them drift to the floor. Monty and Naturelle watch. 
,                          AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) 
rsS*f              Yeah, there's something lumpy in here, v-v              Mr. Brogan. It's a good thing I found this, you know. It'll make your sofa much more comfortable to sit on. The other agents laugh. Brzowski pulls out a package the size of a bottle of wine from the cushion, a bundle of plastic wrap and masking tape. Brzowski raises his eyebrows in mock shock while the other agents poh and. cluck*        -- --,      --· -~ -- --- 
AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) 
Mr. Brogan, I do believe you're fucked. 
END FLASHBACK 
INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM 
Monty sits on the sofa, running his hand over the sofa cushion. Outside it's dark and Monty hasn't turned on the lights. 
NATURELLE (O.S.) 
Baby? V_/     Monty looks up. Naturelle stands in the bathroom's doorway, wearing a bathrobe. 
Why would she? 
Kostya shrugs again. 
KOSTYA 
Maybe her aunt is illegal alien. 
MONTY 
What if she is? 
KOSTYA 
Maybe the Federals threaten her. Monty shakes his head and walks down the stairs. 
MONTY 
.        You're insane. She wouldn't do that. 
KOSTYA 
No? Did you ask her? Monty--stares--up--at- Kostya for a few seconds before-walking -- away. Kostya stands at the top of the stoop. He feels something and raises his palms to the air. The snow has begun to fall. 
He looks up into the sky. Something catches his eye -- in one of the fourth floor windows, Naturelle is staring down at him. Kostya watches her. She lets the curtain close. Kostya takes another slug from his flask. 
INT. SUBWAY STATION 
Monty waits for the 6 train. Two BOYS (12), wearing winter parkas and knit caps, crouch near the edge of the platform, pointing down at the tracks and laughing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MONTY 
What's down there? The boys point and Monty looks. We follow his gaze. We can't see anything at first, but then, as if our eyes were adjusting to the dark, we begin to pick out movement. A gang of large RATS crawls through the tracks, nosing through balled-up paper bags, candy wrappers and orange peels. 
BOY 1 
These ones, they eat rat poison like chocolate. The biggest rat of all sniffs around the base of an upright wax-paper coffee cup that sits just outside the third rail. Monty reaches into the pocket of his camel's hair coat and pulls out a handful of change. 
MONTY 
Watch this. He selects a quarter and -- with a free throw motion as smooth as Hersey Hawkins's-- tosses it into the empty cup, a ten- foot shot. The big rat, startled, hustles into the alcove below the lip of the platform. The boys, impressed, whistle. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Here -- He offers his palmful of change. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Take a shot at it. The boys look at each other for a moment before each takes a coin. They stare up at Monty. He nods at them. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Let's see what you got. Boy 1 takes careful aim at the coffee cup. His shot is way off target, though -- it pings off the tile on the far side of the tunnel. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Your release is too high. Look -- He mimics the boy's shooting motion. 
(CONTINUED)

o 
^^                        MONTY (CONT'D) 
See? You're letting go way up here, so it's floating on you. It's like -- you play basketball? 
BOY 1 
No. 
MONTY 
Baseball? 
BOY 1 
No . 
MONTY 
No? What do you play? 
BOY 1 
Soccer. 
MONTY 
(disgusted) Soccer? All right, forget it. (turning to the other boy) Your turn, little man . Boy 2 toes the edge of the yellow danger line and practices his motion . When he finally releases the coin, it flashes through the air and drops neatly into the cup. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Thataboy! He raises his fist and the boy taps knuckles, grinning 
BOY 1 
You see that! You see that! Charlie got mad skills! Charlie says nothing, just grins and hops around on one foot. 
MONTY 
Make a wish. 
CHARLIE 
I get a wish? 
MONTY               ' 
Hell , yes . A shot like that deserves a wish. 
Monty and Charlie stare at the coffee cup and concentrate.

JAKOB   = 
Very big. On television, the weatherman blabs on about the coming storm. 
WEATHERMAN

JAKOB 
What do we say to him? He's goin g to be living in a cell for seven years .

It's like visiting a friend in the                       - hospital with cancer . What do we say? 
SLATTERY 
We don't say anything. We get him drunk and go wherever he wants to go . 
JAKOB 
I don't even know wh y he invited me . 
SLATTERY 
What are you talking about? 
JAKOB 
We hardly ever see each other these days . You and I are his friends from the past . 
SLATTERY 
His friends from the present haven't done him much good. They're quiet for a time, staring at the huge television. 
JAKOB 
I can't believe he'l l be gone for seven years. Someone turns him in and boom, goodbye. 
SLATTERY 
It's the best thing that ever happened to him. The comment startles Jakob. 
JAKOB 
What does that mean ? 
SLATTERY 
It means if he didn't get arrested, he wouldn't be alive in seven years . They'd find him under the Manhattan Bridge with two bullets in hi s head. Jakob thinks about this for a second before picking up a framed photograph from the coffee table.

INT. SLATTERY'S APARTMENT 
Jakob returns the photograph to the coffee table. 
JAKOB 
Lords of the Outer Boroughs. Remember that? Slattery stands and stretches. He looks tired. 
SLATTERY 
You want to help me with this rug? It's been sitting here for a month. 
JAKOB 
Where do you want it? 
SLATTERY 
Over here. They carry the rolled rug to the center of the room and tear off the plastic wrap. 
JAKOB 
What's he planning to do with Doyle? 
SLATTERY 
Doyle? I don't know. Give him to Naturelle? Slattery balls up the plastic wrap and tosses it into the corner. They begin unrolling the rug. 
JAKOB 
They should at least let him take his dog with him. Maybe it wouldn't be so lonely. Slattery cocks an eyebrow and stares at Jakob. 
SLATTERY 
You can't take your dog to prison with you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : 
JAKOB 
I'm just saying it would be nice if you could. 
They look down at the unrolled rug. 
SLATTERY 
That looks pretty good^ 
JAKOB 
Monty's tough. I think he'll be okay. 
Slattery starts shaking his head and Jakob hurriedly continues. 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
If it was me , I'd never last a day. But Monty's different. 
SLATTERY 
(dismissively) You don't get it. Here, let's move it closer to the sofa. They lift the rug and shift it a few feet. 
JAKOB 
So explain it to me . 
SLATTERY 
You want the simple version? People wh o look like Monty don't do wel l in prison . 
JAKOB 
You're talking about... It can't be as bad as people say. I mean, it's a Federal prison. I'm sure they're pretty careful -- 
Slattery starts to laugh. 
SLATTERY 
Man , you talk exactly like a guy who never left school. 
Jakob has no comeback for this . He simmers. 
SLATTERY (CONT'D) 
Monty's got three choices, and none of them are good. One , he can run. Get on a train going to wherever and hope they never catch up to him.

He won't do that. His dad's bar -- 
(smiling) Okay --                                          ^ 
NATURELLE 
This is funny? Monty steps back and Naturelle advances on him with the knife. She's kidding, basically, but it's hard to tell. 
NATURELLE (CONT'D) 
You think this is funny? I'll carve your heart out, you shit. Monty laughs. Doyle has walked into the kitchen and now stands behind Monty, staring up curiously at the two humans. MONTY                                           x You're gonna carve my heart out?                 ·        i)

Naturelle waves the knife at him and Monty takes another step backward, trips over Doyle, and lands hard on his back . He begins to laugh hysterically. 
NATURELLE 
Keep laughing. 
She kicks him in the ribs, not very hard, and Mont y howl s with laughter. Doyle, a little confused, licks Monty' s face. 
NATURELLE (CONT'D) 
Yeah, keep laughing, you fuck. I'll carve your heart out and feed it to Doyle. She continues kicking while Monty laughs and Doyle, mystified, begins to bark, and finally Naturelle starts laughing too. Monty grabs her wrist and pulls her down on top of him . She drops the knife to the side and bites Monty, hard, oh the lips. 
CUT TO : 
INT. MONTY'S KITCHEN -- PRESENT 
Naturelle, in her silver dress, stares at the carving knife. Doyle pads in behind her, panting. Naturelle turns and looks down at his blunt, expectant face. 
NATURELLE 
You ready for this? 
INT. VELVET NIGHTCLUB -- MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT 
LUIS VOLANDES has decorated his office walls with signed photographs of various low-rung celebrities. Volahdes, a potbellied ma n in his late thirties, wit h a mane of curly black hair , sits behind his desk, listening to Kostya, who shadowboxes, ringed fists flashing. 
VOLANDES

Kostya frowns at the smaller man . 
KOSTYA 
Monty goes to prison tomorrow. You wan t we have party tomorrow night? 
VOLANDES 
(holding up his hands) Hey, I like Monty. He's a good kid. Okay, any special requests for this party? 
Volandes taps the side of his nose. Kostya shakes his head 
KOSTYA 
None of that. For his last night , we get him a girl. 
VOLANDES 
What does he like? 
Kostya smiles. 
KOSTYA 
Monty? He likes everything. Get him a pretty girl. And don't be cheap. The office door opens. Uncle Blue and Valghobek walk in. Volandes quickly stands. 
VOLANDES 
Hey. I didn't -- we weren't expecting you. 
UNCLE BLUE 
(to Kostya) What time is Monty coining tonight? 
KOSTYA 
One , two, who knows? Monty will be late for his own funeral.

From midnight on, I want you somewhere else. Nobody comes down here, you got that? 
INT. BUG BAR -- NIGHT 
Slatter.y. and Jakob sit on bar stools. Slattery sips from a glass of whiskey; Jakob nurses a bottle of beer. The Bug Bar gets its name from the exotic insects in glass jars behind the bar. A television above the bar shows the entertainment news. A VETERAN in an army jacket practices trick shots on the pool table, JODY, the young, zaftig bartender, runs a rag over the bartop. 
JODY 
How you doing, Frank? You want another one? 
You don't have to come! I was just saying. Monty raises his glass and Slattery and Jakob grab their glasses and raise them too . 
MONTY 
Fuck Sunday. He drinks. Slattery and Jakob hesitate and then follow suit . 
EXT . VELVET -- NIGHT 
Monty steps out of a taxi, followed by Slattery and Jakob . A roiling MOB occupies half the block, crowding in front of the entrance to the dance club . Most are teenagers. They clot together in groups of fours and fives, smoking cigarettes and stomping their feet to keep warm. Almost none are dressed for the snow. 
MONTY 
The whole city came out to say goodbye . 
SLATTERY 
«Jto-u'^ve»jgot a lot of yojxng _f an.s. I- think-                       -- we're the oldest ones here. 
MONTY 
Wait a second. 
Monty slips through the maz e of boys and girls . The kids look at him as he walks by . 
Monty makes his way to the velvet ropes . KHARI GREENE , a pillar of a ma n wearing the exact same camel's hair coat as Monty, stands by the door, checking names off a clipboard. 
Two pale scars run in parallel lines down Khari's left cheek. 
MONTY (CONT'D)

KHAR     I 
Yeah, well, I      hope you got some seven- year mothballs      for that coat. Monty hesitates and then      laughs. Khari puts his arm around Monty's shoulders. 
KHARI (CONT'D) 
You doing all right? 
MONTY 
Just trying not to think, you know? (gesturing at the crowd) What's with all the kids?

I think we should make sure Mr. Elinsky has fun for once. Monty pushes open the door at the stop of the staircase. The noise rushes in, overwhelmingly loud, the bass vibrating in our bones. Mary opens her mouth and speaks, but we might not be able to hear it over the music. 
MARY 
Truth. 
INT. VELVET VIP ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Monty leads Jakob and Mary into the VIP room. Naturelle is already there, speaking with Slattery. The walls of the VIP room are covered with crushed red velvet. The couches are upholstered in red velvet, the small bar in the corner is draped with red velvet, the carpet is red faux velvet. ----^   DJ Dusk's music pours from speakers bolted into the corners. s His beats are impossible to sit still for, incorporating elements of bossa nova, techno, hip hop, and jazz. Slattery has a hard time keeping his eyes off Naturelle. His gaze tends to slide her way, and his desire for her is apparent to everyone. Naturelle smiles when she sees Monty and goes to him. She looks beautiful in-the silver dr.ess_...-_Sh .hugs him. Monty e stands awkwardly in her embrace. When she realizes he's not returning the hug, she quickly releases him. He's watching her carefully. She sees Jakob and smiles at him. 
NATURELLE 
Hey, Jake. She hugs Jakob. Mary has not stopped dancing since first hearing Dusk's mix. 
NATURELLE (CONT'D)

NATURELLE 
Okay. I'm Naturelle. 
MARY 
I've seen pictures of this room. The Smashing Pumpkins were in here. 
She turns and examines Monty more closely. 
MARY (CONT'D) 
Who are you? Are. you somebody famous? 
MONTY 
Do us a favor, D'Annunzio. Don't talk too much . Mary grins, tears off her fake fur coat, and hides it underneath a sofa. She wears a white tank-top with Tweety Bird emblazoned on the front. Tweety Bird looks scared. 
DAPHNE, a young waitress in a green dress , comes over with a tray of champagne flutes. Naturelle kisses Daphne on the cheek and the two women exchange greetings. Everyone takes a glass. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
·-""    '    (raising his glass~) Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends. Everyone takes a sip except for Mary, who guzzles hers in one giant gulp, then belches and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Jakob stares at her, horrified. 
MARY 
Anyone want to go dance? 
Naturelle glances at Monty. 
MONTY 
Do what you want to do . 
Jakob and Slattery hear the coldness in Monty's voice and are surprised by it .

DAPHNE 
What kind do you want? I'll call down for some. 
SLATTERY 
Nah, don't bother, I'll get it. He nods at Monty and Jakob. 
SLATTERY (CONT'D) 
MONTY 
Doyle's the toughest guy I know. He was lying there off the highway when I found him, waiting to die. He knew he was going to die. And he didn't make a sound. The best thing I ever did, my whole life, was rescue that black little son-of-a-bitch. Every day he's had since then is because of me . Every time he runs through the park, that's me . Every bone he chews -- because of me . I saved him.

And it's different from what you'd expect, right? I saved him but I'm the one that's grateful. Because I see him running around, I hear him barking, and there he is, the best thing I ever did, in the flesh. (beat) I'm not going to let the pound have him. Doyle's the ugliest fucking dog in the five boroughs. Who's gonna adopt him? And I'm telling you now, I will not let a vet stick a needle in him and end him. I saved his life, right? I'm responsible for him. I didn't go through all that just so some vet can put hi m to sleep. If it comes to that, I'll do it myself. I'll put a bullet in his ear tonight. So I'm asking you, Jake -- for me , as a favor for me , and it's a big favor but I'm asking you -- will you take him? Will you take him home with you? Jakob is quiet, rubbing his palms over the red velvet sofa cushions. 
JAKOB 
You know what? It would be an honor. 
MONTY 
I was hoping you'd say that. I really was. 
JAKOB 
After that speech, Jesus Christ, how could I refuse? Slattery returns with a glass of whiskey. He sits next to his friends and sighs. 
SLATTERY 
There's some talent here tonight. 
Monty raps Slattery's knee. 
MONTY 
What do you think, Jake's girl's looking pretty good, huh? 
SLATTERY 
Who, the little one? Who is she? 
JAKOB 
She's my student. MY STUDENT.

The lights go off. The room is completely dark. 
When the lights come on again, a few seconds later, Monty is crouching in front of the sofa, his .40 caliber automatic in his hand . 
Kostya stands just inside the doorway of the room, hands on the light switch. 
KOSTYA 
The party begins without me ? 
MONTY 
I should have shot you, you fat Russian fuck. Kostya ambles over to the sofa, wagging his finger. 
KOSTYA

MONTY 
Why is it funny I should say that? 
KOSTYA 
It was funny, what you said. Monty looks at Slattery for a second. 
MONTY 
Wait, when you say, "Funny you should say that," it's like saying, "That reminds me of this other funny story." 
KOSTYA 
No , no , I am saying what you say was funny. "Funny you should say that. " You see? It was funny, the thing you said. 
Nobody speaks for a moment.

INT. VELVET VIP ROOM -- LATER 
The room is beginning to crowd with Monty's friends and acquaintances. Jakob sits alone on the sofa, sipping champagne. He clearly recognizes no one . The men speak loudly, holding their- champagne flutes in ringed fists. Lean women stand in clusters, heads bowed together. We hear snippets of banter in four different languages. 
Jakob dips his head against the sofa's velvet armrest. He's clearly exhausted. He begins slipping into sleep. 
Mary walks into the room. The men standing nearby turn to look at her, then whisper to each other and laugh. Mary sees Jakob curled up on the sofa and dances over to him. 
She pulls off his Yankees cap and puts it on her own head, where it sits, crookedly. She climbs on top of him, her knees straddling his chest, and bends close to whisper in his ear. 
MARY

MARY 
Don't panic. Nobody here gives a shit. 
JAKOB

He is watching two high school girls on the swings. One blonde -- LINDSAY JAMISON -- and one brunette -- a younger Naturelle . Both girls wear the uniform of their private school: white blouses embroidered with the school's initials and green plaid skirts over black tights. Both girls are smoking. But while Lindsay keeps the cigarette clenched in one hand as she swings higher, Naturelle continues taking reckless drags., the crook of her elbow holding the chain lightly as she soars skyward. Monty stands and approaches the swings. The girls pretend not to notice him. 
MONTY 
Hey! The girls keep swinging. 
MONTY (CONT'D)

MONTY 
Yeah, you look familiar. Naturelle has stopped swinging now. Lindsay jumps off he r swing.

Lindsay picks up her bookbag and strides quickly away, looking back once or twice to see if Naturelle is following. Naturelle is not following. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
So you're Natalie? 
NATURELLE 
Naturelle. 
MONTY 
Really? Naturelle. I like that. Naturelle. So what's your friend's problem? 
NATURELLE 
You're the one that got thrown out of Campbell-Sawyer, right? 
MONTY 
Yeah, well, lots of people got thrown out of Campbell-Sawyer. How come you didn't follow Blondie to practice? 
NATURELLE 
I want to finish my cigarette. He smiles and sits on the swing next to her. He tries swinging a little. 
MONTY 
I never really got the hang of these things. 
- ·-- " " NATURELLE  -          --       -- 
It's all in the legs. She starts swinging again and he watches her, her long black hair falling beneath her, her legs straight and then bent, straight and then bent. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE ROOM 
Monty's eyes are still closed. Now he opens them. His hands are in Marguerite's hair, but now they drop by his side. Finally he taps Marguerite on the shoulders. She backs away from him, looking up at his face for a moment before blinking and licking her lips.

SLATTERY 
Who? 
JAKOB 
Mary D'Annunzio. I kissed her . 
Slattery grins . 
SLATTERY 
Yeah? 
JAKOB 
I kissed my student. My seventeen year old high school student. (beat) They'll fire me . 
SLATTERY 
Jake. 
JAKOB 
Yeah? Slattery hands him the glass of whiskey. 
SLATTERY 
Have a drink. 
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY -- LATER 
Monty and Kostya walk slowly down the corridor that leads to the manager's office. 
- -··  KOSTYA 
So? You like her? 
MONTY 
She's very nice. 
KOSTYA 
Does she have three teeth? Eh ? No , I think she has many teeth. I think you like her. 
MONTY 
I said so, didn't I? 
KOSTYA 
o Very nice . 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
0·^ They stop outside the office and knock on the steel-plated door. MUSTAFAYEV, a balding man smoking a cigarette, opens the door and closes it behind him. He nods. Monty and Kostya pull out their guns and hand them to him. Checking the safeties, he shoves the guns under his belt and, cigarette clenched between his teeth, carefully pats both men down. When Mustafayev finishes searching them he raps on the door and it opens again. He gestures, and Monty and Kostya enter. 
INT. VELVET MANAGER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS 
Mustafayev follows them inside, hands their guns to one of the ZAKHAROV twins, and goes back outside, closing the door. The twins are Russian redheads who speak very little English. Their faces are blunted and pitiless. Uncle Blue sits behind Volandes' desk, reading the paper. Valghobek sits on a corner of the desk. The twin with the guns places them carefully in front of "     Uncle Blue, then returns to stand by his brother, both of them standing behind Monty and Kostya. DJ Dusk's music can barely be heard down here, the thump of bass and drum sounding like distant bombshells. Uncle Blue folds his paper neatly and sets it aside. 
UNCLE BLUE 
Montgomery. How is the party? 
MONTY 
It's all right. Thanks for setting it up. 
UNCLE BLUE 
The first time I went to prison I was fourteen years old, a skinny little boy. Very afraid. By the time I came out I had my beard. I was a grown man. I went back to my hometown, I found my mother, I kissed her. And she screamed. (smiling) She did not recognize me . I have been in three different prisons, Montgomery, in three different countries. You know what I learned? Monty shakes his head and waits. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
o                        UNCLE BLUE (COM" D) I learned that prison is not a good place to be . 
KOSTYA 
(laughing) I knew that before I went. 
VALGHOBEK 
Nobody's talking to you. Keep your mouth shut. 
UNCLE BLUE 
Seven years is a long time. Some men would do anything to avoid seven years in prison. Monty waits. 
VALGHOBEK 
Your father's a hardworking man . Where's his bar? In Bay Ridge? 86th Street and 6th Avenue, am I right? 
MONTY 
Yes . 
VALGHOBEK 
At least he has a short commute. He can practically walk to work. Where does he live, 17th Avenue? And what was the cross- street? 81st? 8002 17th Avenue. Is that right? The first floor. That must be noisy, living on the first floor. But he doesn't walk to work, does he? He drives. -A 1987 Honda. Should-I tell you how many miles he has on the car? Monty stares at the floor. 
UNCLE BLUE 
Your father, I like your father. A hard- working man. He has had bad luck, some very bad luck. Everyone in the neighborhood loved your mother. You remember her, Senka? 
VALGHOBEK 
Sure. She was a beautiful woman. A real sweetheart.

Monty flicks off the safety and presses the muzzle against Kostya's skull. Everyone in the room is quiet, watching. The only sound is DJ Dusk's mix, an accelerating industrial heartbeat. 
VALGHOBEK 
Do it. Kostya weeps, softly, his big body shuddering. Uncle Blue, face impassive behind his heavy beard, watches carefully. 
ZAKHAROV 
He is cockroach. Kill him. Monty's face is very close to Kostya's. 
MONTY 
(quietly) You were my friend. f=*5                        KOSTYA ^                 Monty -- Monty closes his eyes. When he opens his eyes, he flicks the safety back on. He stands. He tosses the gun to Uncle Blue, who catches it and frowns. 
_   MONTY, 
It doesn't matter to me . Not a goddamn thing matters to me , except this: if you hurt my father, I'll kill you both. The Zakharov twins grab Monty and hold him. Monty doesn't struggle; he and Uncle Blue stare at each other. Uncle Blue drums the desktop with his fingers. Everyone waits. A glass of water on the table trembles from the distant bass. Finally Uncle Blue nods at Valghobek, who opens the office door. The twins release Monty. Everyone (except for Kostya, who is face down on the floor) watches him. 
o V'     Monty walks out of the room, never looking back. 
EXT. 14TH STREET -- LATER 
Monty trudges down the sidewalk, followed by Slattery and Jakob. The snow continues to fall, and lies thickly drifted on the crookedly-parked cars, on the parking meters, on the spears of the church gate they pass. They reach the Union Square subway station and walk down the stairs, disappearing from our view. 
CLOSE ON FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW 
We slowly follow their path backward. In the yellow shine of the streetlights the footprints fill with snow, until finally (the camera still moving backward) they disappear. 
INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION 
Monty, Frank, and Jakob sit with their backs against the ""'corrugated shutters of a closed newspaper stand. An OLD MAN,    wearing   a garbage bag with a hole cut out for his head, leans    against   a blue I-beam that helps support the ceiling. He    holds a   small radio to his ear; we can hear fragments of    Puerto   Rican Jibaro music. Jakob chews on his fingernails. He cranes his neck to look down the subway tunnel -- still no train in sight. He looks at Monty. 
JAKOB 
What time is it? But Monty is jnot present, he is elsewhere, lost in whatever feveFie occuples""his mind. Slattery's eyes are clo~sed;-he- seems to be sleeping. 
JAKOB {CONT'D) 
Monty? Monty looks up, dazed. 
MONTY 
What? 
JAKOB 
Do you know what time it is? Another long pause. 
MONTY 
It's getting late.

The lights of the train come around the bend in the tunnel. 
INT. 4 TRAIN -- LATER 
The three men sit side by side as the train shudders through the darkness. Slattery seems to be sleeping again. Jakob stares at his reflected face in the far window. Monty pulls out his wallet and finds the photograph that his father gave him earlier in the night. 
INSERT PHOTO 
Monty in his fireman's helmet, standing before his parents. 
EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Monty, Slattery and Jakob wade through the snow to the stoop steps. 
INT. MONTY'S BUILDING 
They climb the narrow staircase, their footfalls echoing off the tiled walls. 
INT. MONTY'S APARTMENT                                                ,-~^ 
They enter the apartment. Doyle is excited to see them; he             - pants and spins in little circles, sniffing at their boots. Jakob and Slattery fall onto the sofa and lie there like corpses. Monty opens the bedroom door, steps inside, and closes it behind him. 
INT- MONTY'S BEDROOM 
Naturelle sleeps on her side, facing the window. Monty kneels beside her and takes her hand. Her eyes open. She smiles for a second and then quickly sits up. 
NATURELLE 
What time is it? Both of them turn to look at the digital clock on the nightstand. 
MONTY 
I've got an hour left. Listen -- Naturelle waits as Monty stares down at the bed.                      ^J

IOO,

MONTY (CONT'D) 
I was wrong. About you, about -- She runs her hand through his hair. 
NATURELLE 
It doesn't matter right now. 
MONTY 
It matters to me. (beat) I don't want you to hate me. 
NATURELLE 
How could I ever hate you? 
MONTY 
Jesus, Nat, I blew it. I really blew it. He stands. 
NATURELLE 
Stay with me, baby. We have another hour. 
MONTY 
There's one last thing I gotta do. Naturelle doesn't like the sound of this remark. She leans forward and takes his wrist. 
MONTY 
You think I don't see you staring at her all the time? You've wanted to fuck her for years. He shoves Slattery hard. Slattery's eyes narrow for a moment, but he shakes his head. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : (3) 
SLATTERY 
All right. Al l right. 
He turns stiffly and walks away. 
'                    JAKOB 
Come on. Come on , Monty, what are you doing? Tell him you're kidding. Monty pivots and punches Jakob hard on the cheek, the crack of gloved knuckle on bone echoing on the empty esplanade. Jakob falls back against the balustrade, clutching his face. 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Monty I 
Monty steps closer and punches Jakob again, this time in the gut, and Jakob sinks to his knees, gasping. He covers his face with his hands, to protect himself. Slattery tackles Monty, pinning him to the ground. For a moment everything is still. Doyle, leashed to the baluster, whines, unsure if his master is playing or fighting. Jakob, stunned by the violence, watches. Slattery stares at Monty and Monty stares back . All :of them in the snow, their breath coiling and rising into the sky. Finally Slattery looks away, looks past the East River , past Queens. He clenches his eyes shut. When he opens them, we see the first tears forming. Slattery grabs Monty's throat with his left hand and punches him in the face with his right, again and again and again. Doyle howls. He tries to jump on Slattery bu t the leash keeps yanking him back. He strains forward, fangs bared , bu t his master is three feet too far. 
Jakob touches his cheek and examines his fingers: no blood. 
Doyle, barking madly, keeps jumping for Slattery, keeps being yanked back by the leash. 
Jakob grabs hold of the balustrade and pulls himsel f to his feet. 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Frank... Frank! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : (4) 
The bloo d puddles by Monty's head, melting through the snow and steaming in the air. Slattery, lost in hi s anger , his frustration, continues swinging. 
Jakob stumbles over to Slattery and pushes him. 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Stop! 
Slattery looks up , his face wet with tears , a webbin g of saliva between his lips . 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Okay. Enough. 
Jakob grabs the bi g man under the armpits and help s hi m rise . Slattery looks down at Monty, who is not moving . 
SLATTERY 
Oh Jesus . Jakob crouches and turns Monty onto his stomach . Monty coughs, a thick ribbon of blood falling from hi s mouth . Jakob scoops up a handful of snow and begins gentl y pressing it to Monty's brutalized face. Doyle continues to bark, the collar digging into his throat as he struggles to reach his master. Slattery watches , speechless, his bloodied hand s by his side. Finally Monty shakes his head clear of the snow and begins crawling forward. 
Hold still for a minute. Hold still . When Monty tries to stand his legs collapse beneat h him. Jakob wraps his arms around him before he falls an d lowers him to the snow. 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Don't try to move yet. 
Monty pushes himsel f off the ground again and thi s time manages to keep hi s balance, though he sways lik e a drunk. 
MONTY 
(slurring) It's okay . 
CONTINUED : <5) 
Blood leaks from his nose, from his mouth, from a deep gash bisecting one eyebrow. The entire left side of his face is bright red, already swelling. 
Slattery looks at him and moans , sits down heavily in the snow, his chin tucked against his chest, his right hand, slick with blood, covering his face. 
SLATTERY 
Oh Jesus. 
JAKOB 
Hospital.. We need to take you to the hospital. 
MONTY 
No . He staggers toward them. Doyle is mewling now, stomping his paws, confused. Monty bends down unsteadily and scratches behind the dog's ear. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
(to Doyle) Be a good boy. He walks over to Slattery, wh o sits in the snow, sobbing. Monty leans over and kisses his forehead. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
I'm sorry. Slattery rocks back and forth, hands over his face, his forehead marked with blood. Monty turns to Jakob and touches his shoulder. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
I'm sorry, Jake. 
Jakob is stunned by what's happened in the last few minutes . He has no idea what to say. 
JAKOB 
Okay. 
MONTY 
Take care of my dog. 
He grabs his coat from the park bench and walks away from them. 
EXT. MONTY' S BUILDING -- DAWN                                     ( 
Naturelle, in her down parka, sits on the stoop steps. She sees him when he's a block away, and we see him from that distance, limping through the snow. Naturelle stands and breathes in deeply. She starts walking toward him but stops after a few steps. She can see his face now. His eyes are so badly swollen that he doesn't notice her until he's almost upon her. When he does see her he smiles, and Naturelle has to look away for a moment. He tries to say something but chokes, leans over, hands on his knees, and spits up blood. Naturelle takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps. 
INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM 
He sits on the sofa while Naturelle dabs at his face with a wet washcloth. A bowl of soapy water sits beside her on the coffee table. When she wrings the washcloth above the bowl, drops of blood       ,"***S 
fall into the water and bloom.                                      W-- / 
MONTY 
I don't want you to visit. His voice is rough and slurred, his split lip impeding his diction. She opens a bottle of rubbing alcohol, wets a cotton ball, presses the cottpn lightly against the gash in his forehead.       -- He shudders, his fingers gripping the edges of the sofa cushions. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Okay? 
She grabs him and holds him very hard, clutching him, sobbing into his neck. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
I'm sorry for everything.

He kisses her again and releases her, walks out the apartment door and closes it behind him. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Monty unknots the plastic bag and dumps the ice down the stairwell. The cubes glitter and disappear before clattering on the linoleum three floors below. 
EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING 
Mr. Brogan's car is double-parked. The roof of the old Honda is crowned with snow but the windshield and rear window have been swept clean. 
INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA 
Mr. Brogan opens the passenger door and Monty eases carefully into the seat, then leans over to unlock the driver's door. After Mr. Brogan starts the engine, they wait for a moment for the windows to defrost. 
MR. BROGAN 
FDR is closed. I figured we'd go up First, take the Triborough, catch 87 up to Route 17, and then 211 takes us right into Otisville. Easy drive, except for the snow. Monty says nothing, and Mr. Brogan studies his savaged face. 
MR. BROGAN (CONT'D) 
Jesus, look what they did to you. I'll tell you what, Monty, you're gonna be okay. It looks bad now, I know it, but when all the swelling goes down it's -          · - gonna be okayr     ~ ~"    ··-·-· ······-· 
(beat) They sure gave you a licking, though. How many were there? 
MONTY 
I don't know, Dad. A bunch of them. 
MR. BROGAN 
Well, give it a month and you'll be better looking than ever. A fire truck rolls slowly past, chains on its massive tires. Monty and his father sit in silence, letting the engine warm. 
(CONTINUED)

MONTY 
You were right, Dad. It wasn't Naturelle. Mr. Brogan shifts into drive. 
MR. BROGAN 
Of course it wasn't Naturelle. 
EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE -- DAWN 
Slattery sits on a park bench overlooking the river. It's the same bench Monty sat on the day before. Slattery is alone on the snow-covered esplanade. His knuckles are covered with dried blood. His forehead is marked with blood. He watches the sun rise over Queens. 
EXT. EAST END AVENUE -- DAWN 
Jakob and Doyle walk south along the western edge of Carl Schurz Park. A SKIER, an attractive young woman in her mid- twenties, schusses toward them on cross-country skis. She smiles at Jakob as she passes. 
SKIER 
Cool dog. 
JAKOB 
Thanks. He turns and watches her glide down the hill toward 86th Street. He looks down: at Doyle. Doyle looks-iap- at ~hifff. TM   - 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Cool dog. Jakob shakes his head and smiles, and they continue walking south. 
INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING 
They drive up First Avenue. Monty looks out the window and watches the city roll by. It's his last look for a long time, and he wants to remember everything. A WOMAN wearing a man's overcoat sprinkles salt in front of a shuttered butcher shop. Two YOUNG BOYS drag their sleds behind them, huffing and puffing with exaggerated fatigue.

A NEWSPAPER VENDOR sits on a blue milk crate, sipping coffee from a paper cup, while his CURLY-HAIRED SON snaps icicles from the kiosk's eaves. A POLICE OFFICER, hands on his hips, stares under the opened hood of his cruiser, while his PARTNER leans against the driver's-side door and laughs into his walkie-talkie. At a red light, Monty looks up at the city bus idling noisily alongside them. A LITTLE BOY in the backseat waves. Monty waves back. The boy points at his window: letters have been finger-drawn on the frosted glass. T-O-M. Monty smiles as well as he can and draws his own name on his own frosted window: M-O-N- Before he can cross the T the bus pulls away. They drive north. 
MONTY 
I always thought I'd make you proud of me . M r . Brogan turns to look at Monty and then turns back to the road. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
I pictured it, you know? I pictured you sitting at the bar with all your friends, poker night, and you'd say, "Did I tell you what my boy's been up to?" And your friends would be like, "Goddamnit, _ Brogan,,_all you ever talk about-is your     ,,...      _, __,, _ boy." 
MR. BROGAN 
Give me the word and I'll take a left turn.

SILVER BULLET by Stephen King Based on his story "Cycle of the Werewolf" 
FADE IN: 
EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT 
It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the warm late summer air. 
SOUND: Crickets. 
THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO: 
EXT.  TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY  NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT 
CREDITS BEGIN. 
A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino pants. He is drinking beer. 
ARNIE (sings) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer... 
He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point. 
ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He shines it on the switch. 
He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back pocket. 
ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch. 
CREDITS CONTINUE. 
EXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT  NIGHT 
He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the light on the switch for a moment. During this: 
ARNIE (sings) It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat, won't you try, won't you buy Rheingold beer... 
He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen. 
ARNIE Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze! 
He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then he picks up his crowbar. 
CREDITS CONTINUE. 
EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT 
There's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out - something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes still hang from it. 
What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick ourselves for not knowing earlier. 
It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on the whole rail-rider. 
CREDITS CONCLUDE. 
EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT 
He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly, both the tracks and the switch move. 
ARNIE Hot damn! Now... a little oil... 
He turns back toward the rail-rider. 
EXT.  ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT 
ARNIE It's not bitter, not sweet... it's a big fuckin' treat... 
A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling. ARNIE looks around. 
EXT.  THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT 
Nothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of his tools. 
EXT.  ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT 
He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching point. 
EXT.  ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU  NIGHT 
A hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws on that hand. 
EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU  NIGHT 
Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow. It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat. 
EXT.  ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT 
He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving the can. 
ARNIE (sings) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer... 
He arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen. 
EXT.  THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT 
We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders, half wolf, half human. 
EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT 
NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue to wear it through the whole movie. 
INT.  THE PODIUM  DAY 
To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel. It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency medical unit. 
Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill. 
LOWE For the last ten years... 
No amplification. He taps the mike. 
INT.  JANE 
She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot. 
GIRL (mocking) "Make sure your brother's all right." 
JANE (low) Marty's a booger. 
She reaches the aisle and starts out. 
INT.  THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE 
He taps the mike again. 
INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW 
BOB (good-natured) Just pretend you're in your own church askin' for money, father! It'll work fine! 
Good-natured laughter greets this. 
INT.  LOWE AT THE PODIUM 
A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF SCREAM OF FEEDBACK. 
LOWE For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true. 
SOUND: Enthusiastic applause. 
EXT.  A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU 
It's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF APPLAUSE. 
MARTY (voice) Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're not poisonous? 
BRADY (voice) Little old blacksnake? Hell, no! 
Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief - grab the blacksnake. 
EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY, CU 
BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with respectful wonder. 
NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion, and will through the whole movie. 
MARTY Lemme hold him! 
BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY sees: 
EXT.  JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT  DAY 
JANE (v-o) I was almost fifteen that summer. My brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I had to bear. Brady was actually the worse of the two, but I was rarely disposed to see that. Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents. 
LOWE (v-o from the tent) $32,000 is a lot of money. But when you think of the lives this unit might save, it seems very inexpensive indeed. 
Applause greets this. 
EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY 
Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake. 
BRADY I got an idea. 
MARTY What? 
BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes widen. 
MARTY You wouldn't. 
BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin. 
MARTY You would. 
INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE 
LOWE An endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one, farmers and merchants... Protestants and Catholics... 
EXT.  JANE 
She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing under a tree. There's more applause from the tent. 
BRADY (teasing voice) Jane... Jane... 
She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost touching her upturned face. 
JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose shredded at the knees. 
EXT.  ON THE BANDSTAND 
STELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the sound of JANE's voice. 
STELLA (alarmed) Who - ? 
JANE (approaching closer) It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw. 
STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping. JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly. 
JANE (tenderly) What's wrong? 
STELLA (weeping) He's going away. I know he is. 
JANE Who's going away? 
STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted. 
STELLA What am I going to tell my mother? If he won't marry me, what am I going to tell my mother? 
JANE (bewildered) Stella, I don't know what- 
STELLA Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me alone, you stupid thing! 
STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little frightened. 
INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION 
O'BANION Let us pray. 
INT.  THE TOWN HALL GATHERING 
Most of them bow their heads. 
INT.  REV. O'BANION, AT THE PODIUM 
O'BANION May the Grace of God shine upon those gathered here... and lift them up... and grant success to the endeavor to which they have so openheartedly declared their support. Amen. 
INT.  THE GATHERING 
They raise their heads. Some echo the "Amen." Others cross themselves. 
EXT.  THE PICNIC AREA 
People are coming out and getting ready to chow-down. 
EXT.  THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY 
Traveling along a country road. Headed home. 
INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY 
BOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get. She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees. 
MARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the wagon. 
NAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE she's mad at. 
NAN I want you two to bury the hatchet. You're being very silly, Jane. 
JANE (hot) Did you see my knees? 
MARTY Jane, I- 
NAN I think you're being mean as well as silly. Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life. 
Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the COSLAW family. 
MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it. 
JANE You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple! 
MARTY Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him. 
JANE Brady's a booger and so are you! 
NAN Jane Coslaw! 
BOB (roars) Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of you out! 
In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains thundery. 
INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY 
Train tracks run near the road. 
INT.  THE STATION WAGON, ENSEMBLE  DAY 
BOB (points) That's where poor old Arnie Westrum pitched his last drunk. 
He crosses himself and they all look toward: 
EXT.  THE GS&WM RAILROAD TRACKS (STATION WAGON'S POV) 
INT.  THE CAR  DAY 
BOB They had to pick up what was left of him in a peach basket. 
STELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV. 
INT.  A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU 
A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it. 
THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the mirror, including the window - we are upstairs. 
[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the window!] 
There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture. We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it. There is also a large glass of water on the vanity table. 
STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills, starts to lift them to her mouth- 
A HOWL outside... closer. 
STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with some water. She pauses, looking at herself. 
STELLA Suicides go to hell. Especially if they're pregnant. And I don't even care. 
She takes another five pills. And another five. 
SOUNDS: Rattling foliage. 
EXT.  THE IVY TRELLIS  NIGHT 
Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse, guttural breathing. 
INT.  STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE 
She takes another handful of pills... and the window behind her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the werewolf throws itself through. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER 
She sits up, startled awake. 
From upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A SCREAM. 
INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WITH STELLA 
She runs... and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of her nightgown. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER 
MOTHER Oh my dear God... Stella! 
She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering glass. 
INT.  STELLA'S BED, CU 
One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself. 
Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it. 
EXT.  STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE 
The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal. 
SOUND: A TRIUMPHANT HOWL. 
INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH MOTHER 
She's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it gamely along. 
MOTHER Stella!...Stella! 
She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in. 
A long beat of silence as we hold on the door. 
MOTHER SHRIEKS. 
INT.  MOTHER'S FACE, ECU 
She shrieks again. 
INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE 
It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy wolfprints on the remnants of the bed. 
STELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure isn't what happened. 
MOTHER SHRIEKS. 
EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  MORNING 
a.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the "Press-Herald" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can see STELLA'S photograph. b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER, VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer we'll meet later. c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY! d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her. 
EXT.  A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON MAIN STREET 
The sign reads: TARKER'S MILLS TOWN OFFICE. 
INT.  A HALLWAY, FEATURING A DOOR WITH A PEBBLED-GLASS PANEL 
Neatly lettered on the panel: TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABULARY. And below this: JOSEPH HALLER. 
JOE HALLER (voice) Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off! 
JANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie. 
MARTY Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she? 
JANE What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed? 
MARTY Stop it! 
He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush clatters across the tile. 
BOB COSLAW (sleepy voice) Hey! That you, Marty? 
JANE He's okay, Dad! 
She looks around swiftly, then bends down. 
INT.  MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT 
One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes are shut. He's weeping. 
JANE (low) Marty, are you all right? 
MARTY Yes. Go away. 
JANE Let me help you up. 
NAN (voice) Marty? 
SOUND of her climbing the stairs. 
JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please don't tell on me," it says. 
NAN comes in. 
NAN Jane, have you been teasing your brother again? 
MARTY She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane helped pick me up. 
He bats his eyes at her. 
MARTY (syrupy voice) Jane's wunnnderful. 
JANE picks up his toothbrush. 
JANE (hands it to him) Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that shit in your head might leak down into your mouth and poison you. 
NAN Jane Coslaw! 
But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good put-down. 
EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE  NIGHT 
We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse. 
THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS. 
INT.  TAMMY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT 
She's deeply asleep. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
"Big-time Wrestling" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV. 
MILT (drunk) Give him the airplane! Wring his neck! 
EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE  NIGHT 
More noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something- one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and SHATTERS. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT 
He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax. 
MILT (all eyes again) Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit! 
EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, CLOSER 
A LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER. 
INT.  MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM 
Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks out. 
EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV) 
SOUND of another crash. Plants move. 
INT.  THE HALL, WITH MILT 
He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks inside. 
MILT Let's see if you want to come back and break my pots all to shit after I put some rock salt in your asses! 
INT.  THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE  NIGHT 
The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is really overgrown. 
HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes. 
HERB We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore. 
HERB laughs harder. 
HERB It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw! 
HERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON BRADY'S KITE. 
EXT.  THE MOON, CU 
SOUND: HERB SCREAMING. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY 
SOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In The Sheaves." 
There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG. MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back. 
JANE (v-o) My mother and father- my mother in particular- did not much care for Uncle Al... 
INT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY 
MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ. BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course. There are lots of flowers. 
JANE (v-o continues) ...but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking Marty to the funeral of his best friend... 
INT.  UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW 
As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER. 
UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned. 
JANE (v-o continues) ...they didn't at all mind drafting him. As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him... 
UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers her the flask. Her eyes widen. 
JANE (v-o continues) ...I now believe that was best kept between the two of them... 
After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY, who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER looks distractedly back toward the service. 
JANE (v-o concludes) ...or among the three of them. 
UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing. 
INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE 
LOWE Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. There will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if I could. 
He looks out at them. 
INT.  THE CONGREGATION 
They look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in understanding this awful thing. 
INT.  LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN 
LOWE If there is any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes. 
He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard. 
LOWE If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together. 
INT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY 
The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she puts her head on his shoulder. 
INT.  FATHER LOWE 
LOWE The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast always passes. (Pause) Let us pray. 
EXT.  THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY 
MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would think- and she and MARTY embrace. 
EXT.  UNCLE AL, CU 
He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love. 
EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD  AFTERNOON 
UNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY home. 
INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL 
UNCLE AL You all right, Marty? 
MARTY Yeah. 
UNCLE AL There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one? 
MARTY No. 
UNCLE AL Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy. 
SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE. 
They all stop, scared. 
BILLY McCLAREN Where's it coming from? Other side? 
BOBBY No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't trust- 
ASPINALL It isn't on either side. 
ANDY What are you- 
ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear. 
ASPINALL It's under the fog. It's right in with us. 
The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then: 
SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served. 
SOUND: A SCREAM. 
EXT.  EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE 
He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION, that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap. He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and then it disappears. 
SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING. 
ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone. 
EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE 
They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in the ranks where EDGAR was. 
EXT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU 
BOBBY (moaning) I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move! 
EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE 
The GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath. 
EXT.  ASPINALL, CU 
ASPINALL (low) I think we better start backing up, Andy. Real slow. Real- 
The LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist, snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S voice: 
WEREWOLF (voice) "Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!" 
SOUND: CHOMP! 
ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist. There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face is gone. 
WEREWOLF (voice) "Real slow! Real slow!" 
A hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down. 
EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP 
They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other. 
EXT.  OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV 
THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud. 
WEREWOLF (voice; laughing) "Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!" 
EXT.  OWEN KNOPFLER 
He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat. 
OWEN Come on, then! You want to rock and roll with me? 
EXT.  THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV 
For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with gore. 
WEREWOLF "REEEEEL SLOW!" 
EXT.  MAGGIE AND ANDY 
MAGGIE (shrieking) Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing! 
ANDY (groaning with fear) I don't want to look at it. 
He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at: 
EXT.  OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF 
The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger. 
OWEN Come on, come on! You want to do the bop? I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on! 
The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist. 
Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN shrieks. 
INT.  LOWE 
He looks toward: 
INT.  THE MRS. BOWIE WEREWOLF, AT THE ORGAN 
She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to bubble up between the keys. 
MRS. STURMFULLER AND ALL Won't you try, won't you buy... 
INT.  THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION 
The church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing werewolves. It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell. 
CONGREGATION (big finish) ...Rheiinngold beer! 
Suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins. And ANDY FAIRTON, who now looks as wolflike as any of them, bites the hand's claw off. 
INT.  REV. LOWE, ON THE PODIUM 
He's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE. 
BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK. 
INT.  LESTER LOWE, ECU 
He sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an expression of huge relief on his face as he does so. 
LOWE (praying) Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please let it end. 
EXT.  MAIN STREET  DAY 
An old sedan cruises slowly down the street. ANNE and TAMMY STURMFULLER are in the front seat. It's piled high with possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff in it. 
EXT.  HALLER AND PETE 
HALLER (indifferently) Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl. 
PETE Yeah... but what are they doing? 
HALLER Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap, I deduce that they are leaving. 
EXT.  THE STURMFULLER CAR, THE COPS' POV  DAY 
They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town. 
EXT. JOE HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER, ON THE SIDEWALK 
HALLER She's not the only one. Lot of people leaving town. And I guess if we want a beer, we'll have to drink it at home. 
He nods toward: 
EXT.  OWEN'S PUB, LONG (PETE AND HALLER'S POV) 
A CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black wreath. 
EXT.  HALLER AND PETE 
PETE Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't never seen you like this. 
HALLER (thoughtful) I lost my guts. 
PETE (startled) Bullshit. 
HALLER It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him... and I felt it happen. It was no big deal. No worse than pissing down your own leg. You ever do that? Maybe when you were real scared? 
PETE, distressed, does not respond. 
HALLER One minute I had me some guts- as much as the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone. 
PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror. 
PETE Joe... you are going to feel better than this. This... this feeling of yours... it's gonna pass... 
JOE Is it? 
He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN!) while PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled. 
EXT.  A FAIRGROUND  DAY 
It's deserted. Rides stand still. The midway is deserted. 
THE CAMERA PANS slowly to a sign which reads TARKER'S MILLS FAIRGROUNDS GALA FAIR OCTOBER 1 FIREWORKS AT DUSK 10c ON EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO THE MEDCU VAN FUND! 
A cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued diagonally across it: FIREWORKS CANCELED. MARTY (voice) It's not fair. 
INT.  THE COSLAW FAMILY STATION WAGON  DAY 
It's parked across the road from the sign. 
JANE (voice) Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't get something he wanted! 
They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream cones; they are coming home from a family outing. 
NAN COSLAW Stop it, Jane. 
JANE Well, I don't see why everybody just about breaks down and cries whenever he- 
EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET 
CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying this. 
EXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING 
He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY. 
EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET 
He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM! VRROOM! 
EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU 
A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates. 
SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM! 
EXT.  MARTY, CU 
Grinning. Looking at: 
EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV 
It's about a quarter of a mile away. 
EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET 
He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on his face. 
EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG 
Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's laughing like a lunatic. 
EXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS 
UNCLE AL (to himself) The kid's dead meat. What have I done? (shouts) Put a rock in it, Marty! 
EXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET 
He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing rubber. 
EXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL 
The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns the engine once and then lets it idle. 
UNCLE AL You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man. 
MARTY It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al. 
UNCLE AL It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir. 
MARTY I don't get you. 
UNCLE AL I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you? 
MARTY Sure. 
UNCLE AL Good. 
EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON 
The last bit of daylight is just filtering away. 
EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD 
The barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the f.g. 
UNCLE AL I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time. 
He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him. 
NAN So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this. 
UNCLE AL See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long. 
MARTY Okay. 
He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them with troubled love. 
EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL 
UNCLE AL Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall. 
MARTY Yeah! What is it? 
AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers, Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc. 
An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he inventories these goodies. 
UNCLE AL You're gonna have the Fourth of July in October, Marty. Just don't blow your head off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't just the fireworks. It's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that. 
MARTY (respectfully) I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you! 
UNCLE AL Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know. 
MARTY Yeah, I know. It's great! 
SOUND: Hurt, angry growl. 
EXT.  MARTY, IN THE REST AREA 
He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet. 
The fountain bursts into a shower of light. 
MARTY (delighted) All right! 
EXT.  THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG 
The waterfall is in the b.g. 
The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope. 
EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU 
It goes out. 
EXT.  MARTY 
He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle. He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The Roman candle shoots into the sky. 
EXT.  THE ROMAN CANDLE 
Bursts into colored light. 
EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG 
It GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the sky. 
EXT.  MARTY 
He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall. 
MARTY Is someone there? 
EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT 
It freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY. 
EXT.  MARTY 
With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and sets it on the ground, as before. 
EXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT 
Claw-hands settle over the top. 
EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU 
It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die down. 
EXT.  MARTY 
He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH. 
EXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF 
It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree. Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and advances, hunched over on two legs. 
EXT.  MARTY 
MARTY (terrified) Who's there? 
EXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV 
The grove is a darkened shadowland. 
EXT.  MARTY 
He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire, alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard. 
EXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV 
Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in. 
EXT.  MARTY 
Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor only cranks. Still no start. 
EXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET 
EXT.  MARTY 
He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them. 
EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV 
We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much closer. 
EXT.  MARTY 
He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same time. He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries again. 
EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS 
He hangs up and falls back into bed. 
GIRL (muzzy voice) Whowuzzit? 
UNCLE AL Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep. 
EXT.  THE BACK PORCH, WITH MARTY 
He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard. JANE comes out. 
JANE Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning. 
MARTY Where's Mom? 
JANE Went shopping. Why? 
MARTY Jane, I have to talk to you. 
JANE (mistrustfully) About what? 
MARTY looks at her earnestly. 
MARTY I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't believe me, and if you won't help me, I... I... 
MARTY has to stop. He's almost crying. 
JANE (concerned) Marty, what is it? 
EXT.  MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE 
JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the Medcu unit. 
JANE (voice-over) He told me something that was clearly unbelievable... and yet, somehow I believed most of it. And I understood one thing with total clarity: Marty himself believed it all. 
She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell. 
EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT 
A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being unlocked. The lady is taking no chances. 
MRS. THAYER Jane? 
JANE (politely) I'm collecting returnable bottles and cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer- I just wondered if you had any. 
Her husband comes up the hall. 
MR. THAYER Who is it? 
MRS. THAYER Jane Coslaw. 
EXT.  JANE 
What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring. 
JANE Hi, Mr. Thayer. 
INT.  LON THAYER, ECU 
What we see mostly are his brown eyes. 
MR. THAYER Hello, Jane. 
EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE AND MRS. THAYER 
MRS. THAYER Bring your cart around to the back, Jane- we'll look in the garage. 
JANE Thank you. 
She starts down the steps and we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET  DAY 
Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing her cart. Even more bottles in it now. 
JANE (voice-over) Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al was thirty-five that summer and I was fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe the unbelievable, although even then that ability is growing rusty, is preparing to squeal to a stop. 
She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around collar hangs informally on a bush. 
JANE (calls) Hi, Father Lowe! 
LOWE (without turning) Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw! 
JANE I'm going to bring in a monster load of bottles in an hour or so! 
LOWE (still digging) That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting. 
EXT.  JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET 
She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while a few men seated at the counter listen. 
INT.  JANE, ECU 
Wide eyes, mostly. 
INT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, ECU 
She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside. 
INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE 
This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself. 
SOUND: SQUEAKING. 
JANE looks down. 
INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV 
A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe. 
INT.  JANE 
She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall, bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then slowly bends toward the object and picks it up. 
JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared. 
EXT.  THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY 
JANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand- her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It opens. 
JANE Father Lowe? 
No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters the kitchen. 
INT.  JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN 
She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and into the dark hall. 
JANE Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet... 
Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder. 
LOWE (voice) Very good, Jane! 
She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at: 
INT.  FATHER LOWE, ECU 
Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered with a black eye-patch. 
LOWE (grins) Good, Jane. Very... very good. 
He holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black patch, which tells her everything. 
INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH JANE AND LOWE 
LOWE (concerned) Jane! You're trembling! 
JANE I... I don't feel so well, I guess maybe I got too much sun. 
LOWE Would you like to come in the parlor and lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink? I have some soda- 
JANE No! (softer) That is, I have to get home and help my mom with lunch. 
LOWE I'll give you a ride! 
JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door. 
JANE No- she... she was going to meet me at the market. I'll be fine. 
INT.  LOWE, CU 
How much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch. 
LOWE Give my best to your brother, Jane. 
INT.  JANE, AT THE PORCH END OF THE HALLWAY 
JANE I will. 
She bolts. 
INT.  LOWE, IN THE HALLWAY 
CAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic. 
LOWE (soft) Real slow. 
EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD, WITH MARTY 
His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair. 
MARTY (almost moaning) Oh, Jeez! What did you do then? 
EXT.  JANE AND MARTY 
She's changed into shorts and a blouse. 
JANE I ran faster than I ever ran in my life- what do you think, dummox? By the time I got back here, I really thought I was going to faint. (Pause) What are we going to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody- grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are we going to do? 
MARTY (thoughtfully) I think I know. 
INT.  A SHEET OF RULED SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, CU 
UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward: 
EXT.  THE CATHOLIC RECTORY, LONG - UNCLE AL'S POV 
LESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all. 
EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE 
UNCLE AL (a bit perplexed) Well... he probably did. I mean, he could make a complaint without taking an ad out in the paper, couldn't he? 
MARTY I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller. 
UNCLE AL Marty, do you see your suspect? 
EXT.  THE RECTORY LAWN, WITH LESTER LOWE 
Keeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE waves back. 
EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE 
MARTY (grim) Yes, I see him. 
UNCLE AL Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead. 
MARTY I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was- 
UNCLE AL When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you? 
JANE I don't know exactly what I believe. But I know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al. 
UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he throws his hands up in disgust. 
UNCLE AL Kids! 
He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE. 
She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to catch up. 
EXT.  A FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN  DAY 
It's midafternoon. A bunch of kids are playing baseball. In the extreme f.g. we see one small boy- MARTY- sitting back to us in his wheelchair, watching. 
EXT.  AN OLD COUPE 
It draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops. LESTER LOWE is behind the wheel. 
SOUNDS OF THE BASEBALL GAME CONTINUE. 
EXT.  THE BASEBALL FIELD, AND MARTY, LOWE'S POV 
THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON MARTY'S BACK. 
EXT.  LESTER LOWE 
LOWE (quietly) Little bastard. 
EXT.  A FLY BALL 
EXT.  THE FIELD, A WIDER SHOT 
The field team heads in. Kids start streaming back toward town. 
EXT.  MARTY 
The OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances his way. 
OUTFIELDER You comin' down to Robertson's for a soda, Marty? 
MARTY No- I guess I'll go home. 
I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't. 
OUTFIELDER Okay- seeya! 
MARTY Yeah... seeya. 
He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone. 
EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE 
He starts it up. 
EXT.  MARTY, LOWE'S POV 
He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone. 
EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE 
It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the road. 
EXT.  MARTY'S WHEELCHAIR, LOWE'S POV 
MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it. 
INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE COUPE'S WHEEL 
He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically. 
It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane. 
EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET 
It bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING. 
EXT.  THE COUPE 
It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop. 
INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL 
His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become the face of a gargoyle. 
EXT.  THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV 
EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET 
It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor. The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage is about seventy feet. 
About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along silently, going on its dying momentum. 
EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV 
Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath. 
EXT.  MARTY, REVERSE 
Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at: 
EXT.  THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV 
This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal maniac close behind. 
EXT.  MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE 
LOWE (soft voice) Marty... 
MARTY'S head whips around. 
EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV 
We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge. 
INT.  LOWE'S SHOES 
Sensible black Oxfords. 
LOWE I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if you believe that or not, but it's true. I would never willingly hurt a child. You should have left me alone, Marty. 
SOUND of footfalls resumes. 
EXT.  MARTY 
He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet. 
INT.  LOWE, IN THE SHADOWS 
LOWE (soft; soothing) I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit. Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now. By killing her I took her physical life but saved her life eternal. You see, Marty? You see how all things serve the will and the mind of God? You see, you meddling little shit! 
He begins to walk forward again. 
EXT.  LOWE, MARTY'S POV 
He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not hurrying. 
LOWE You're going to have a terrible accident, Marty. You're going to fall into the river. 
SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger. 
EXT.  MARTY 
TRACTOR SOUND IS LOUDER. 
MARTY'S face fills with hope. He looks from LOWE toward: 
EXT.  THE LANE, MARTY'S POV 
THE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure spreader which is mostly empty. 
EXT.  MARTY 
MARTY (waving madly) Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman! 
INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH LOWE 
He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile. Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it? 
EXT.  ELMER AND MARTY 
ELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it around. MARTY looks back at: 
INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV 
Empty. 
SOUND OF A CAR STARTING, FAINT. 
They shake hands. 
EXT.  THE RECTORY  NIGHT 
A Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the side in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as he does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the picture. He goes up the walk. 
HALLER rings the doorbell. 
No one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one comes. He leans down and looks through a side window. 
INT.  THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV 
No one there. 
EXT.  HALLER 
He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and looks in. 
EXT./INT.  THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV 
LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the shadowy piles of bottles and cans. 
INT.  THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER 
He goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down. In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda cans. 
HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He lights it and looks at: 
INT.  THE COUPE, CU 
One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car. 
INT.  HALLER 
His eyes widen. 
SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker. 
HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy, but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and again and again. 
EXT.  THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE DAY 
UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today. The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees. 
MARTY Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again! 
UNCLE AL And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy? 
MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it to UNCLE AL. 
MARTY I want you to turn this into a silver bullet. 
UNCLE AL You're not going to let it go, are you? 
MARTY I saw what I saw. 
UNCLE AL Marty, the moon wasn't even full! 
JANE (quietly) In the made-up stories, the guy who's the werewolf only changes when the moon is full. But maybe he's really that way almost all the time, only as the moon gets fuller... 
MARTY (finishes) ...the guy gets wolfier. 
JANE (hands AL her crucifix) Here. Take mine, too. 
MARTY Jane... you don't have to do that. 
JANE Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains. 
MARTY Will you marry me, Jane? 
UNCLE AL Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with? 
JANE I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either. 
MARTY No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it. 
UNCLE AL The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit. 
MARTY I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe. 
UNCLE AL Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind. 
MARTY Will you do it? 
UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure. 
EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY 
UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short lane and into a gravel pit. 
THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's bloody and chewed. 
EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY  DAY 
The wagon pulls in. 
INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL 
INT.  THE STATION WAGON, WITH BOB AND NAN 
BOB I can't believe that you'd agree to leave the kids with him. A year ago I would have laughed at the idea. You used to almost breathe fire when Al came in the house. 
NAN He's changed. Just this summer. Or something's changed him. Marty, maybe. And the drinking- I think it's almost stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful. And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure of it. 
BOB I know they'll be safe with him... but will he get them both into bed by nine-thirty? 
NAN (firmly) If I told him to, he will. 
INT.  THE WALL CLOCK IN THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
It reads 1:00. 
SOUND: The National Anthem. 
INT.  THE TV, CU 
The anthem finishes up. We go to a station ID card. 
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE This concludes WDML's broadcast day. 
The TV goes to snow. 
INT.  JANE ON THE COUCH 
She's mostly asleep in one corner. 
INT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET 
He's also dozing. 
INT.  UNCLE AL, IN BOB'S EASY CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV 
He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his lap. 
EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, FROM ONE SIDE 
The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of the house (this is the opposite side from MARTY'S bedroom). 
EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF 
There is a space in here between the house and the bushes- it's like an animal's run. The WEREWOLF creeps along this, its one eye flaring. 
DIM SOUND OF TV SNOW. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL 
UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug. 
MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled. 
EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF 
It recoils, eyes gleaming. Foam begins to drip from its jaws. It creeps slowly along toward a window. TV SNOW SOUNDS GROW LOUDER. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH AL, JANE, MARTY 
UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette out of his lap and puts it out. 
JANE (sleepy) You'll burn yourself up sometime doing that, Uncle Al. 
UNCLE AL I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed. 
MARTY But Uncle Al! You said- 
UNCLE AL I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming. 
JANE The moon's not down yet... 
UNCLE AL Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot. 
JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs. 
MARTY What if I say no? 
UNCLE AL Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. (more kindly) Go on, now. 
MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs, where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and stops. 
MARTY If that'd gone off, it would have been the end of our silver bullet. 
INT.  UNCLE AL 
He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle. 
INT.  UNCLE AL 
He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet into his hand. 
UNCLE AL See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired. 
Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its green eye flaring. 
INT.  BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE 
MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is looking toward the window and she SCREAMS. 
His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in the heating vent. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE 
UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the pistol. 
The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward her. 
INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
Comes toward her. 
INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER 
She makes as if to run one way. 
INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF 
It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow. 
INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU 
A bloodstained hand grabs a poker. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE 
As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING. 
UNCLE AL hits it between the legs. 
It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside. 
INT.  JANE 
She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
Its head whips around. 
INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL 
He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille off. One arm is down inside. 
MARTY (scream) Janey! The gun! THE GUN! 
INT.  JANE 
She tosses it awkwardly. 
INT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION 
It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange, awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF 
WEREWOLF (snarls) Maa-aaa-rty... 
It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing things out of its way. 
INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL 
The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the heating duct again... 
INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU 
There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an inch out of reach. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
WEREWOLF (foaming) Maaa-aaa-rty... 
INT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR 
JANE (sobbing) Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother! 
She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes. 
INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF 
It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't have to pay for. 
WEREWOLF Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty- 
INT.  MARTY, CU 
He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the approaching WEREWOLF. 
INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU 
MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.

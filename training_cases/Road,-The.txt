EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY 
The intense BUZZING of summer insects and the SONG of songbirds. A birds eye view of a bucolic mid west farming landscape, corn field, blue skies, sunshine, a FARMER PLOUGHING a nearby field with a TRACTOR, grain silos and a hay stack. A MAN with a horse. A clapboard house with a strawberry field, a woman's hand picks strawberries; a WOMAN lying in grass, lazing... 
OPENING CREDITS... 
INT. DINING ROOM/HOME - NIGHT 
Next to book shelves and an upright piano, with sheet music on the stand - CHOPIN. There is also a dining room table with leftovers from an abandoned meal - strawberries and cream. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MONTH LATER - a warm night, the MAN is asleep with the same WOMAN, now pregnant, no sheets on the bed. The MAN is restless and wakes. A distant RUMBLING, indistinct - the MAN swings his feet off of the bed and goes to the window, anxious. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The MAN is in his shorts, sweating, putting a plug in the bath and turning on the taps as far as they will go. The WOMAN appears in the doorway in a nightdress and leans against the door frame watching, blearily, cradling her pregnant belly. 
WOMAN. Why are you taking a bath? 
MAN. I'm not. The WOMAN takes off her nightdress and goes to the bath. 
WOMAN. You'll sleep better. He looks at her, surprised she's misunderstood. 
MAN. I'm not! Put your clothes back on. She sees he's looking out the window now - there's an eery rose-colored glow of distant fire through the glass - and distant shouts and screams...

WOMAN. What is it? What's happening? 
END OF FLASHBACK: 
TITLE: THE ROAD. 
EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN 
A MAN of about forty and a BOY of ten are asleep, camped on a tarp under a rock ledge, the blackened chasm of a burnt valley spread out below. It is the same man seen earlier - but ten years older, thinner, malnourished, with a thick beard. They are both emaciated and exhausted, their faces and hands coated in grime and soot from the burned, blackened landscape around them. Ash falls on the tarp, which is bright synthetic blue, the only color in sight. The MAN is woken by something, he instinctively reaches out to touch the BOY, his hand rests on his chest and rises and falls with each of the sleeping BOY's breaths. There is a low RUMBLE, the ground starts to TREMBLE and the BOY wakes. 
BOY. Papa? (NO REPLY.) Papa? 
MAN. Shh. It's okay. 
BOY. What is it, Papa? They listen as it grows NEARER and LOUDER, everything SHAKING, tree roots GROANING and SPLITTING, until it passes between them with a ROAR like a subway train right beneath them. The BOY is now clinging to the MAN and crying, his head buried against his chest in fear. 
MAN. Shh. It's all right. It's all right. It's gone. 
BOY. What was it, Papa? 
MAN. It was an earthquake. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
In the burnt, barren landscape, through swirls of soft ash and smoggy air the MAN appears dressed in a filthy old PARKA with the hood up, a knapsack on his back, pushing a rusted shopping CART with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle and the BLUE tarp now covering it's load. The little BOY, similarly dressed with a KNAPSACK on his back, shuffles through the ash at his side - like Depression-era Dust Bowl homeless. There is a flicker of lightning over head, then more, but no thunder. 
MAN. (V.0.) The clocks stopped at one seventeen one morning. There was a long shear of bright light, then a series of low concussions. 
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/ CRACKED ROAD - DAY 
Broken asphalt, the earthquake has caused a large FISSURE to open up ALONGSIDE the road, with a sheer drop. THE MAN and THE BOY edge past burnt trees and scrub. 
MAN. (V.0.) Within a year there were fires on the ridges and deranged chanting. The screams of the murdered. By day the dead impaled on spikes along the road. 
EXT. LAKE - DAY 
MAN. What? 
BOY. You know what, Papa. I have to watch you all the time. 
MAN. I know I'm sorry. 
BOY. If you break little promises you'll break big ones. That's what you said. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The MAN relents, pouring the hot water back into the pan and taking some of the BOY's cocoa into his own cup. The BOY wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and licks his finger. 
MAN. Watch your finger. 
BOY. You always say that. 
MAN. That's because you always do it. The MAN spreads bits of a worn out road map on the boards and studies them. 
BOY. What are you doing? 
MAN. We have to keep moving. We have to go south to the coast. 
BOY. Why? 
MAN. It'll be better at the coast. 
BOY. Why? 
MAN. Because we're going to freeze here. He picks up the map pieces carefully. 
EXT. TURNPIKE - MORNING 
The MAN and the BOY truck along the blacktop. At the crest of a hill they come to FADED BILLBOARDS advertising MOTELS and stop. The BOY notices a sign in the distance, which has words painted over a faded advertisement: odd, nonsensical, Biblical ramblings about "bones" and "the dead." The MAN follows the BOY's gaze and reads: "BEHOLD THE 
VALLEY OF SLAUGHTER - JEREMIAH 19:6." 
MAN. Do you remember your alphabet? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOY. Yes. 
MAN. Can you read that? 
BOY (SCRUTINISING IT.) No. 
MAN. Good, let's go. The MAN takes out a large REVOLVER, cocks it in readiness and places it on the tarp as they move. The BOY eyes the MAN nervously, eyes the gun and they move off. 
EXT. TURNPIKE, TUNNEL APPROACH - DAY 
They trudge along the turnpike towards the opening of a deep, black tunnel and the BOY suddenly comes to a stop, increasingly upset, unable to face the yawning mouth of the tunnel. 
BOY. I can't, I just can't... 
MAN. There's no other way. 
BOY. We could go over. 
MAN. We can't take the cart over. 
BOY. We don't know what's in there. 
MAN. There's nothing in there. It's just the same as it is out here. Okay? 
BOY. (BEAT. VERY RELUCTANT.) Okay. The boy sticks close to the MAN's side. The man has the revolver in his belt now and his parka unzipped, ready as they nervously walk towards the mouth of the tunnel. 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY 
The MAN has his arm around the boy as they push the cart cautiously ahead, acutely aware of all that's around them. They pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground. Ash and litter blowing about and a handful of MUMMIFIED DEAD REFUGEES appear along the sides of the tunnel, sitting and lying on camp stretchers, their bags and supplies long since looted. They are shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk, shoeless, a couple of men, a woman a small child and a DOG. The MAN stares at the group. The BOY stares at the small child and then at the mummified DOG, transfixed. The MAN puts out his hand for the BOY to take - the BOY takes his hand and the MAN moves him on. 
MAN. Just remember that the things you put into your head are forever. 
MAN. (CONT'D) To hear it you'll need a frontal lobe and things with names like colliculus and temporal gyrus and you won't have them anymore because they'll just be soup. 
GANG MEMBER. Are you a doctor? 
MAN. I'm not anything anymore. 
GANG MEMBER. We got a hurt man. It'd be worth your while. The MAN glances in the direction of the ROAD GANG, then back at the GANG MEMBER, who is still eyeing the BOY. The BOY is sitting with his hands on top of his head, peeking out through his arms, terrified as the tension escalates. 
MAN. If you look at him again I'll shoot you in the head. 
GANG MEMBER. I'll bet that boy is hungry. Why don't you all just come onto the truck. Get something to eat. Ain't no need to be such a hard ass. 
MAN. You don't have anything to eat. Let's go. 
GANG MEMBER. I ain't going nowheres. 
MAN. You think I won't kill you but you're wrong. 
GANG MEMBER. You know what I think? I think you're chickenshit. You never killed a man in your life. He drops his belt on the ground with a CLATTER, a canteen and army pouch hanging from it. The MAN eyes the army pouch, eyes the GANG on the road - and notices for the first time some of them are wearing the same army pouches. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) One is banging his stick on the side of the truck to call their lost member. The MAN is distracted by this and when he looks up the GANG MEMBER has taken two silent steps and is standing between him and the BOY, holding a knife. 
MAN. What do you think you're going to do with that? Without a word the GANG MEMBER dives and grabs the BOY, rolls and lands on his feet holding the BOY against his chest with his knife at his throat. Simultaneously the MAN drops to his knees, trains the pistol and fires from six feet away, shooting the GANG MEMBER in the forehead. He falls back and lies with blood bubbling from the wound, eyes open, the BOY lying in his lap in shock, deafened, expressionless, covered with gore and mute as a stone. The GANG hear the loud SHOT and freeze, they start looking around them more urgently now. The MAN grabs the dazed BOY by the hand and yells but in his deafness the BOY hears only a MUTED soup of words: 
MAN (MUTED.) Move! Let's go! The MAN shoves the pistol in his belt, hoists the BOY onto his shoulders and sets off down the road at a run. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
They crash through the woods, the MAN straining to keep the BOY aloft and find a path through the trees - the BOY clutching the MAN's head with both hands. There's a sickening THUD and the MAN falls, the BOY flying off with a cry. The MAN struggles to gather his wits, unsure whether he's been felled by another man. 
MAN (MUTED.) Come on. Get up, get up quickly! The MAN swings the BOY onto his shoulders and runs. 
EXT. WOODS/TURNPIKE - DAY 
The MAN and BOY stagger through trees and the man drops to his knees, letting the BOY down. They are back by the turnpike again. They listen and watch, utterly exhausted and out of breath, the MAN is wheezing, the BOY at his side, holding his hand, staring, in shock still. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. Shh. It's okay now. You're going to be OK. POV BOY - the BOY can still HEAR nothing, temporarily deaf. But he sees the MAN talking and looking around, through 360 degrees, trying to work out where it's safe to go. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Come on. He grabs the BOY's hand and they take off again. 
EXT. WOODS - EVENING 
The MAN pulls out blankets from his knapsack. The BOY sits staring, shocked as the MAN tries to wipe the blood and gore from his face but it's thick and congealed now. His hands tremble as he tries to pick it from the BOY's hair. 
MAN. It's okay... it's okay now... Frightened by the BOY's muteness, he wraps him in a blanket, unzips his parka and holds him close under the parka. The MAN picks up his revolver, checks the chamber, only one bullet left. He eyes the flickering shadows in the distance and then eyes the BOY, making minute calculations of distance, calibrating the space between the ROAD GANG and the BOY. He holds the revolver up and cocks it. 
MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D) I try to look like any common traveling killer but my heart is hammering. When it comes to the boy I have only one question: Can you do it? When the time comes? There is no moon, but not far away, perhaps 30 yards, a firey TORCH makes its way through the woods. About 50 yards away from that another TORCH is being used to search... shadows flicker ominously. The sounds of TWIGS snapping underfoot and BRANCHES being broken as the ROAD GANG searches wordlessly, just BREATHING heavily through their masks and beards. The MAN clutches the BOY tighter, and stifles a cough. They remain frozen like this, unable to budge. 
FADE OUT. 
EXT. EMBANKMENT - DAWN 
They are by a thin, toxic, rust-red stream, slushy ice at the edges and gray froth. The MAN leans down and pushes ice away and scoops up a hand full of gray water. He runs it through the boy's hair to wash it and the BOY flinches with cold. He rubs more icy water into the BOY's hair, roughly, quickly, with a sense of panic as he helplessly tries to-wash out lumps of flesh and blood. The BOY is weeping silently and shivering from the extreme cold as the MAN picks out the dried gore and washes the hair clean. 
MAN. It's no use crying. You have to talk to me. He takes the blanket and dries the BOY's hair as he talks. 
MAN. (CONT'D) I'm not going to let anything happen to you... I'm going to take care of you... I'm always going to try and be here for you... and I'm going to kill anybody who touches you. He smooths the BOY's hair down with shaking fingers, clumsily trying to brush it out of his eyes, a fatherly instinct to make the BOY neat. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Because that's my job. Do you understand? When he's through the MAN lifts the BOY's thin arms, puts a vest over his head, then a ragged sweater, then he folds the BOY into his parka, zips it up to the neck and kisses him on the top of the head. The MAN grabs his knapsack, tips it upside down, rummages inside - it's empty. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Come on, we need to get the cart back. 
EXT. EMBANKMENT BY TUNNEL EXIT - DAY 
Approaching the embankment, the MAN walks quickly and stealthily, wired, listening to the silence, straining to hear, sure he's being watched. 
(CONTINUED) 
WOMAN. I don't want to survive! I'd take him with me if it weren't for you. You know I would. Why can't you face it? 
MAN. Will you listen? You're talking 
CRAZY - 
WOMAN. It's not crazy and you know it. It's the right thing to do. They glance at the BOY. 
WOMAN. (CONT'D) Other families do it. She goes to the BOY, strokes his hair, kisses him, makes a reassuring display of being motherly. 
WOMAN. (CONT'D) Time for bed, there's a good boy. She picks him up in her arms and carries him off to bed. 
END OF FLASHBACK. 
EXT. RAVINE/WATERFALL - DAY 
The THUNDER of a waterfall, the river disappears into space - the BOY and the MAN stand staring up at the waterfall, 80 feet above, shrouded in gray mist. A color spectrum is visible rising from the waterfall, like a rainbow - the boy is transfixed, clutching the MAN's arm for safety. 
BOY. What is it? The MAN looks at the BOY, surprised he's talking again. 
MAN. It's a waterfall. 
BOY. Look. Colors. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. There used to be color everywhere. You don't remember. It was before you were born. There used to be so many thnings... The BOY approaches the water's edge, shallow and clear with gravel and pebbles sparkling at the bottom. He scoops up some water, surprised that it seems clean. 
BOY. Look. It's clear. 
MAN. Do you want to go in? 
BOY. I don't know. 
MAN. Sure you do. 
BOY. Is it okay? 
MAN. Just don't swallow any. The MAN unzips his parka and slips it to the ground. The BOY eyes the MAN, surprised - then does the same. 
EXT. RIVER/WATERFALL - DAY 
Naked, pale, filthy dirty and shivering with cold, the BOY frolics in the spray of the waterfall. The MAN watches him enjoying himself by the waterfall, clutching his shoulders, hopping up and down, he joins him. 
EXT. RAVINE/ROCKFACE - (CAMP 6) - EVENING 
The MAN has strung the tarp against a rockface to make a shelter. He meticulously filters water through a rag into a pan. In the background, the waterfall can be heard RUMBLING. The BOY has painted his face with CRAYONS, drawing a bizarre set of FANGS and dripping blood around his mouth. The MAN studies the BOY's painted face a moment. 
MAN. Listen. That man back there... there's not many good guys left, that's all. We have to watch out for the bad guys. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. (CONT'D) And we have to talk. Always. We have to just... you know... keep carrying the fire... 
BOY. What fire? 
MAN. The fire inside you. The BOY is thoughtful a minute, and then: 
BOY. Are we still the good guys? 
MAN. Yes. We're still the good guys. 
BOY. And we always will be no matter what happens? He eyes the BOY uncertainly, unsure if he can promise this. 
MAN. Always will be. Yeah. The MAN goes back to tying the tarp. 
EXT. THE RIVER/VALLEY - MORNING 
EXT. SEARS DEPARTMENT STORE/SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT 
They are back in the city, trudging through the parking lot of a huge shopping mall, just outside what used to be SEARS department store. A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky illuminates the ruined store front as the MAN looks up at the mall, thinking. The BOY is just staring into space, still in shock. 
INT. SEARS/MALL - (CAMP 8) - NIGHT 
The MAN and the BOY have set up camp in the mall, outside the SEARS entrance. The MAN is building a big fire. The BOY stares through the glass at the deserted department store. Nearby, strewn across the doorway are bunches and bundles of cash in notes and coins... the BOY looks closer and finds expensive items of jewelry still in their boxes, LOOTED from the store and discarded. 
The BOY sits, he looks like he's given up, and then: 
BOY. Papa? Papa, we wouldn't ever eat anybody would we? 
MAN. No. Of course not. 
BOY. No matter how hungry we were. Even if we were starving? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. We're starving now. 
BOY. Because, because we're the good guys? 
MAN. Yes. 
BOY. And we're carrying the fire. 
MAN. Yes. The MAN takes the BOY in his arms. In a moment the BOY starts blinking sleepily and drifts off to sleep and the MAN strokes the sleeping BOY's hair and kisses him on the forehead. 
EXT. SUPERMARKET/PARKING LOT - DAY 
They walk through the parking lot until the come to a supermarket around the other side. A few old cars in a trash strewn parking lot. The MAN heads through the defunct automatic doors. 
MAN. Come on. There's nobody here. 
INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 
The MAN and the BOY trudge the empty aisles, only litter remaining, the once brightly-colored packaging strewn around, it's contents long since looted. In the empty gun section there is a deer's head mounted on the wall. The BOY stops and stares, mesmerised while the MAN searches the empty shelves for ammo, finding only empty boxes. The MAN glimpses a woman's face staring dolefully from an aisle - an emaciated, dead beat SCAVENGER watching them, vanishing as quickly as she appeared. On their way out they come to a pair of vending machines tipped over, the sodas looted, coins scattered around in the ash. The MAN sits beside one and feels inside the gutted machine, eventually producing a single unopened can of COCA 
COLA. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOY (EXCITED.) What is it, papa? 
MAN. It's a treat for you. Here. Sit down. He helps the little BOY off with his knapsack and sits him down and opens the can of COKE ceremoniously. The BOY looks startled and sniffs the fizzing can as if it's the strangest thing he's ever seen in his life. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Go ahead. The BOY takes the can. 
BOY. It's bubbly. 
MAN. Go ahead. Drink it. The BOY takes a sip and considers. 
BOY. It's really good. You have some, papa. 
MAN. No. I want you to drink it. 
BOY. But I want you to have some. The MAN reluctantly takes the can and has a tiny sip, hands it back to the wary BOY. 
BOY. (CONT'D) It's because I'll never get to drink another one, isn't it? The MAN doesn't know what to say. 
EXT. MALL/PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
They head out of the mall now towards the road, lifeless traffic lights at the intersection, town houses and apartment blocks on the other side of the road. The BOY stops to listen, stares around, suddenly energised, bobbing on his toes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. What's wrong with you? 
The pine panelling is stripped from the walls, there is some broken furniture but much has been taken for firewood. They go over to the fireplace and the MAN examines it. He runs his fingers along the mantle where there is an old drawing pin still stuck in the wood, nostalgia overcoming his fear. 
MAN. This is where we used to have Christmas when I was a boy. We'd hang our stockings right here. The MAN examines the yellow tiled surround. The BOY watches the MAN as if he's gone mad. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. (CONT'D) My mother scrubbed these every day. It's still spotless. Much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped and taken for firewood - there are gaping holes. By the fireplace is a small pile of bones - and--in the grid are more burnt bones and the skull from the family cat. The MAN takes it all in sadly but the BOY is unmoved. 
BOY. Papa? I don't think we should do this. 
MAN. You want to wait outside? The BOY nods vigorously. 
MAN. (CONT'D) All right. He takes the BOY's hand and leads him out. 
EXT. PORCH/HOME - DAY 
The come out onto the porch. 
MAN. Sit here on the stoop and don't go away. The BOY sits quietly and the MAN goes back inside. After a moment he starts going through his knapsack, less afraid now. 
INT. OLD HOUSE - DAY 
The floorboards CREAK horribly, swollen from rain or ripped up, as he creeps into the living room. The timber cladding is stripped from the walls, the ceiling plaster is collapsed, beams exposed. The MAN pads through to the kitchen. 
INT. KITCHEN/OLD HOUSE - DAY 
The kitchen is similarly dilapidated, the cupboards stripped bare. On a shelf by the window are dusty jars of fruit, preserved. He grabs a jar, prizes open the lid and finds a an oily slick of black mucus floating in the top, like rotted mushroom spores. He sniffs it suspiciously, holds it up to the light. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: In the light small black fish hook-shaped spores drift from the top of the jar to the bottom. He replaces the lid, appalled. 
EXT. PORCH/OLD HOUSE - DAY 
The BOY is sitting on the steps of the porch drawing with crayons on a pad taken from his knapsack. Across the road is another big old house, much of the clapboard missing, swathed in dead brambles - the BOY suddenly looks up and stares at it, distracted. 
EXT. BACK YARD - DAY 
The MAN comes outside and regards the deadened yard, old garden hoe and spade, gardening equipment and several dead apple trees. He goes over and examines the ashen ground and digs about to unearth several small, dark brown, shrivelled spheres spaced several feet apart - apples. He bends down and picks one up, examines, sniffs. He gathers up the strange apples and stuffs them in his pockets. 
EXT. PORCH/OLD HOUSE - DAY 
The BOY is still staring at the house across the road when he notices A GHOSTLY FACE, completely still, in a window. The BOY drops the pad and crayon and stands, surprised, not believing his eyes - it is the face of a SMALL BOY roughly his age, which disappears almost immediately, receding back into the gloom like a ghost. 
INT. PANTRY/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 
The MAN is in the looted pantry. He finds some shrivelled raisins that haves spilt and hidden in the back of the shelf. He puts them into a handkerchief, folds it and pockets it. He 
HEARS: 
BOY. (O.O.V.) Stop - stop! The MAN freezes, then charges out. 
EXT. PORCH/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 
The MAN rushes out and stares about frantically for the BOY - he's gone. 
EXT. HOUSE OPPOSITE - DAY 
The BOY has run across the road to another house. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: POV BOY - peeping around the side of the house is the other SMALL BOY, the same age, similarly grimy and thin, wearing an outsize woollen coat. The other SMALL BOY disappears down the side and the BOY runs after him. 
BOY. Wait! Come back! I won't hurt you! 
EXT. BACK YARD - DAY 
The BOY runs to the bottom of the yard where there is various suburban garden detritus, a dusty lawn mower, a clothes line, a shed, bikes with no tyres. 
BOY. Where are you?! The MAN comes sprinting up the side of the house and seizes him by the arm. 
The MAN and the BOY make their way out of the ruined city. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. (V.0.) He yearns for his own friends and imagines how things will be different at the coast - and that there will be other children there... .When I have nothing else, I try to dream the dreams of a child's imaginings... 
EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY 
The MAN and BOY walk along a desolate road in what was once farmland, grain silos loom ominously, still standing. 
BOY. Do you know where we are Papa? 
MAN. I think we're about two hundred miles from the coast. As the crow flies. 
BOY. "As the crow flies?" 
MAN. It means, going in a straight line. POV MAN - In the background, something catches his eye and he 
FOCUSES ON: A frieze of HUMAN HEADS, dried with taut grins and shrunken eyes, perched on wooden poles. Some are tattooed with targets and runic slogans. Some are skinless, with signs and words inked onto them. One has suture marks etched on it, like a blue print for assembly. 
BOY. There aren't any crows are there? Just in books. 
MAN. Yeah, just in books... The MAN stares at the heads as the BOY continues his conversation, distracted and not seeing the heads. 
BOY. Do you think there might be crows somewhere? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. I don't know... 
BOY. But what do you think? 
MAN. I think it's unlikely... They keep walking and talking, the MAN grim-faced but the BOY intent on what's ahead. 
BOY. Could they fly to Mars or some place? 
MAN. No, they couldn't fly to Mars... 
BOY. Because it's too far? 
MAN. Yes. The MAN discretely hurries the BOY on with a guiding hand towards the woods and off the road. 
BOY. What if they tried and-and-and they just got halfway or something and then they were too tired? Would they fall back down...? 
EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 
On the edge of the wood the MAN and the BOY stop to examine footprints in the snow. The MAN listens and hears: the low THUDDING of BULL DRUMS in the distance. He looks at the exhausted BOY a moment. 
MAN. We can't go back on the road. 
BOY. Why, Papa? 
MAN. I think someone's coming. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The BOY stares at the tracks. The MAN stares in both directions, examining the road in the distance. He moves a few paces and notices tied to a dead sapling a thin red neckerchief. He takes a few steps and through a gap in the trees sees a clearing - snow and a mass of BLOOD RED FOOTPRINTS, the icy snow stained blood red like a sorbet. A killing floor. 
BOY. Will they see our tracks? 
MAN. We'll cover them. The MAN moves the BOY away and kicks snow over their tracks - then lays fresh ones going in several different directions. The BOY copies him, leaving his own maze of tracks. They run off keeping parallel with the road but staying off it. POV MAN - in the distance TWO FIGURES appear on the road. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Here they come. The MAN now looks over his shoulder for a good look, then grabs the BOY's hand and takes off. 
EXT. HIGH GROUND - EVENING 
TWO MEN come prowling on the ROAD, they are MILITANTS from some sort of ARMY, wearing the same red neckerchiefs and carrying weapons, searching, predatory. WIDER - we see that only 30 feet away, concealed amongst the trees, the MAN and BOY are crouched in blankets, watching. The two MILITANTS stop and look around, as if they sense the BOY and the MAN - who freeze, frightened to breathe. The MILITANTS sniff the air menacingly. One of them walks over to a stone by the side of the road, leans down and starts sharpening his lance, made from a the straightened coil spring of a car. The MAN and the BOY watch - wide-eyed. Eventually the MILITANTS walk off up the road. 
BOY. What are we going to do? No answer. 
BOY. What's it for? 
MAN. For making music. This... (HE PLAYS.) is music. Your mother played very well. 
BOY. I don't remember. 
MAN. Before you were born. We had one just like it. It was beautiful. 
BOY. What happened to it? 
MAN. Chopped it up for firewood. He stares into space, slumps suddenly, overcome with emotion as he remembers: 
INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 
FLASHBACK - Just the MAN and the pregnant WOMAN alone in the house, just before the BOY was born. Some of the furniture has been broken up for firewood - there are broken pieces by the fire and a huge axe propped on the hearth. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The WOMAN stands at the piano and tries to play. She plays for a moment and the MAN cracks a rare smile - the piano is out of tune and she stops. She plays a bit more but soon starts to bang the keys atonally in frustration. The MAN just lets her get on with it until she's spent. 
WOMAN. I used to worry what would happen if there was a fire. What would I save? What could I bear to lose? There used to be so many things, so many beautiful things. Things people made. Things nature made. Who knew we would lose it all? 
MAN. I'll strip the floorboards. 
WOMAN. You can't live without a floor. 
MAN. You can't live without a piano. She starts to dismantle the piano, opening the lid, taking it off it's hinges, it's heavy, she hands him the heavy lid and he reluctantly dumps it on the floor. 
WOMAN. It's my piano. 
MAN. I bought it for you. 
WOMAN. It needs tuning. Who's going to tune it? Can you tune it? They look at each other sadly. They take the front piece away and dump that. The WOMAN picks up the axe and hands it to the MAN. He swings it at the frame. 
END OF FLASHBACK. 
EXT. YARD - DAY 
The MAN walks toward a tin shed and crosses the dead grass. He stops suddenly. He stamps about a bit, listening. He continues on into the shed. Beside the shed sits an INDUSTRIAL GARDEN TROLLEY. The man reappears, spade in hand. He digs the spade into the dead grass and hear's it CHOMP into wood. He digs more urgently, increasingly exhausted, until a door is revealed in the dirt. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He is so engrossed he hasn't noticed the BOY standing a few feet away, watching with saucer eyes, scared. 
BOY. Don't open it, Papa. 
MAN. It'll be okay. 
BOY. Please, Papa, please. 
MAN. It's okay. 
BOY. No it's not! What if there's people hiding down there? The MAN ignores him, focussed as he chops the plywood around the lock, gets the spade under a corner and levers the door open. The BOY has his fists bunched up to his chest, bobbing up and down with fear. The MAN starts to descend a hand made wooden stair case in the bunker. He takes another disposable lighter from his pocket, gives the child a kiss on the forehead and then disappears into the bunker, leaving the worried BOY staring after him. The BOY looks around at the deserted yard as the evening draws in, now even more frightened. 
MAN. (O.O.V.) Oh my God... oh my God! 
BOY. What is it, Papa? 
MAN (O.O.V.) Come down. Oh my God come down. The BOY is in the hole and down the steps like lightning. 
INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - EVENING 
The little BOY CLATTERS down the steps. The MAN is busy lighting up candles. 
BOY. Papa? What did you find? 
MAN. Everything. I found everything. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Stored in the bunker are crate upon crate of canned goods: tomatoes, peaches, beans, apricots, canned ham, corned beef, hundreds of gallons of water in ferry cans and in boxes paper towels, toilet paper and trash bags stuffed with blankets. The MAN takes the BOY's hand and helps him down, then goes back up the steps and draws the door shut and jams a pair of metal pliers through the heavy inside hasp to stop the door being opened. He goes back down the steps to the BOY and holds up a candle to illuminate the shelves. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Can you see? 
END OF FLASHBACK. 
INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING 
The BOY wakes blearily and immediately notices his collection of artefacts turfed out by the bed. Nearby the MAN is dressing as the BOY starts gathering up his collection crossly, especially protective of the arrow ahead - or just embarrassed. They look at each other. 
MAN. What? 
BOY. (TEASING BUT INDIGNANT.) Don't touch my stuff. 
EXT. LAWN - DAWN 
The hatch opens and the MAN's face appears, as he looks around. He opens the hatch more and clambers out with a couple of jerry cans of water, the yard is quiet. Next, the BOY's face pops up and peers around. He clambers out carrying a big pot with a camping stove in it. 
INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAWN 
They empty the jerry cans into the huge pot, light the stove and put the pot on the stove to heat the water. 
INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAWN 
The BOY is in the bath, filthy and scrawny, as the MAN bathes him, rubbing him with soap, scrubbing an oily film of scum from his dirty neck to reveal clean pale skin underneath. 
MAN. What do you think? 
BOY. Nice and warm. He washes the BOY's hair, lathing water over him with the pot. He has a sudden thought: 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 
FLASHBACK - the MAN watches unseen from the doorway as the WOMAN tenderly washes the BOY's hair - he is perhaps a year younger than at the start of the film - she appears lost in the task, enjoying it, chatting away to the BOY, momentarily unburdened. She sticks a finger in the BOY's ears, giving them a good soaping, which he likes. 
WOMAN. You could grow potatoes in these ears... 
INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY 
END FLASHBACK - now the MAN is in the tub, also scrawny and filthy, lost in thought as he soaps up - the BOY helps. 
INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY 
The MAN trims his beard off with scissors in a mirror. He lathers up with shaving cream and starts to shave with a plastic safety razor. When the MAN is done he turns to the BOY, wiping away the foam. 
MAN. How do I look? 
BOY. Weird. Won't you be cold? 
INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY 
Now the MAN is cutting the BOY's hair with kitchen scissors and a plastic comb. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The BOY has a towel around his shoulders and long locks of hair decorate it. The MAN finishes, takes the towel off, wipes the BOY's neck and face with a flannel, holds up a mirror for the BOY to see. 
BOY. I look funny. 
INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING 
They sit on the bunk bed with a checkerboard between them sipping thick hot chocolate made with condensed milk from plastic mugs and concentrating on the board, their worn out, wet blue jeans drying on a drying rack in the back ground. They are both wearing new sweaters too big for them, plundered from the stores. The MAN watches the BOY fondly, absorbed in checkers. 
EXT. LAWN - NIGHT 
Heavy rain slashes down on the lawn, already pools of water are flooding the lawn. 
INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - NIGHT 
A shiny new quart of whiskey is slipped from its paper liquor store bag and opened with a soft CRACK. The whiskey is poured into a glass with a satisfying GLUG. WIDER - another feast is laid out, ham and powdered mash potato and biscuits and gravy. The BOY is eating while the MAN pours a whiskey. The BOY stops eating to watch the MAN drink the whiskey. The MAN's eyes glaze as he sips the strong liquor, dizzy already. 
BOY. Can I try some? 
MAN. No. You won't like it. Makes you feel funny. The BOY stares, curious, wanting it. 
MAN. (CONT'D) You think I come from another world, don't you? Filled with all these strange things you've never seen. 
BOY. Do you always expect it? Papa? 
MAN. I do, yes. 
BOY. You always think bad things are going to happen but we found this place. Maybe we'll find another place like this at the coast. 
MAN. Maybe. The MAN dumps the carton of food on the floor and packs another, organising jerry cans of water. 
EXT. LAWN - MORNING 
The INDUSTRIAL TROLLEY is loaded up and tied with a grey tarp. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOY. What are you doing? 
MAN. We'll have to cover our tracks from now on. The MAN drags the old mattress back over the entrance to the bunker. He carefully covers the surrounding area with debris. 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
The MAN pulls the new trolley across a bridge, stagnant black water underneath, the trolley is now laden with jerry cans of fresh water and cartons containing as many tins of food and supplies as they could manage. The BOY trails along behind. They are a strange sight, clean clothed, clean shaven, short haired, in their new jumpers - and now both wearing new surgical masks which they raise off their faces to speak. The MAN keeps checking behind him. POV MAN - he sees the glint of glass, perhaps a pair of BINOCULARS watching them. The BOY watches anxiously as the MAN gets out his own BINOCULARS and looks through them. POV MAN - a mysterious winking glint of light which quickly disappears. POV - through a different pair of binoculars, a completely different POV, we see the MAN looking through his binoculars at us. 
MAN. I think they're following us. 
BOY. Who? 
MAN. I don't know. 
BOY. You think it's bad guys? 
MAN. Probably. 
BOY. What if it's good guys? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. I don't think we're likely to meet any good guys for a while. We have to be careful now. We've got food. 
EXT. BEND/THE ROAD - DAY 
As they round a bend in the road they see a hunched figure walking ahead of them. The MAN stops abruptly, gets out the binoculars and watches: POV MAN - a distant, hunched figure hobbling away from them. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
They come up behind an OLD MAN, hunched over, withered, silent as he hobbles ahead. He wears layers of torn clothing and his feet are wrapped in rags and cardboard tied with green twine. They slowly approach and the man stops, turns and watches them suspiciously as they draw level. 
OLD MAN. I don't have anything for you. You can look if you want. I got nothing. 
MAN. We're not robbers. The OLD MAN leans an ear forward, deaf. 
OLD MAN. What? 
MAN. I said we're not robbers. 
OLD MAN. What are you? 
MAN. We're just like you. 
OLD MAN. What are you following me for? 
MAN. We're not following you. 
BOY. We've got food we could give him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. He's not getting any food. The OLD MAN looks away, avoiding their eyes. 
OLD MAN. Ely. 
MAN. Just "Ely?" 
OLD MAN. What's wrong with "Ely?" 
EXT. CLEARING/WOODS - (CAMP 14) - EVENING 
There's a camp fire now. The OLD MAN sits wrapped in a quilt, eating with a spoon and-licking his plate clean. In the far distance, the faint glow of fires. The orange light bounces into the night sky eerily. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. How come you're still alive? What do you eat? 
OLD MAN. I don't know. People give you things. 
MAN. No they don't. 
OLD MAN. You did. 
MAN. I didn't. He did. The OLD MAN eyes the BOY, closely, half blind. 
OLD MAN. Are you a little boy? 
MAN. What does he look like? 
OLD MAN. I don't know. I can't see real good. 
MAN. Is that right? Can you see me? 
OLD MAN. No. But I can tell somebody's there. 
MAN (TO BOY.) Okay. You need to sleep. Come on. He gathers up the BOY and takes him a few feet away, settles him down in blankets while the OLD MAN stares into the fire. 
OLD MAN. I had a little boy once. Gone... all gone... 
MAN. What happened to him? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
OLD MAN. I can't... I can't talk about that... leastways not with you I can't. When the MAN returns he has his gun which he surreptitiously places on the ground in full view of the OLD MAN. 
MAN. You can see that, right? Okay. Tell me now. You're not a shill for a pack of road agents? 
OLD MAN. I'm not anything. I'll go if you want me to. I can find the road. The MAN stares at the OLD MAN cynically but the OLD MAN just stares back blankly. 
OLD MAN. (CONT'D) I live like an animal. You don't want to know the things I've had to eat. When I saw that boy I thought I'd died and he was an angel. I never thought I'd see a child again. I never thought that would happen to me. 
MAN. He is an angel. To me he's a God. 
OLD MAN. Well I hope that's not true. To be on the road with the last surviving God would be a pretty frightening experience. 
MAN. Why do you say that? 
OLD MAN. Where men can't live, Gods can't either. The road gangs would tear you limb from limb, both of you. The low RUMBLE in the earth is heard again, an earthquake, this time in the distance. They listen a moment. 
OLD MAN. (CONT'D) I knew this was coming. This or something like it. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
OLD MAN. (CONT'D) There were warnings. People thought it was a con - I always believed in it. 
MAN. Did you try to get ready for it? 
OLD MAN. No. What would you do? Even if you knew what to do you wouldn't know what to do. Suppose you were the last man left alive? 
CONTINUED: The BOY thinks about this for a moment as they approach the railway line. 
EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE (CAMP 15) EVENING 
The MAN and the BOY are swaddled in blankets up amongst the rocks with a birds eye view of the road and a railway bridge they can see along the road and the dead trees for half a mile. The BOY is nodding off, his head lolling as the MAN keeps watch, increasingly paranoid. 
EXT. BLUFFS, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE (CAMP 16) MORNING 
As they come down from the bluffs, the MAN is staring into the dead woods where another thin stem of SMOKE is rising. 
BOY. What is it? 
MAN. More smoke. I think we should take a look. 
BOY. I don't want to. Let's just keep going. 
MAN. Whoever it is I don't want them behind us. 
BOY. What if they're bad guys? 
MAN. What if they're good guys? They look at each other, a stalemate. The MAN stands and starts to pack up the tarp. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Look. Whoever it is out there, it's better to know about it than to not know. 
BOY. Why? 
MAN. Because we don't like surprises. Surprises are scary. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. (CONT'D) They could sneak up on us further down the road. You need to learn this. The MAN folds the tarp and sleeping blankets and starts heading down the slope to the trolley, the BOY following. 
EXT. CLEARING, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - MORNING 
A deserted campsite, a campfire, recently abandoned. The MAN and the BOY look around, disappointed. 
EXT. DUNES/COAST ROAD, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAY 
Open country now, completely blackened landscape under heavy ash. They are stopped. The BOY unfolds the threadbare map on the ground, a crayon in his hand. 
MAN. You know where we are? 
BOY. No. 
MAN. Where do you think? The BOY points to a place on the map. 
MAN. (CONT'D) More. 
BOY. Here? 
MAN. No. We're closer than you think. He takes the crayon and points on the map. 
MAN. (CONT'D) This is us. This is all sea. 
BOY. Is it blue? 
MAN-. The sea? I don't know. It used to be. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The MAN picks up a desiccated pine cone from the ground, and stares at it, hollow-eyed, hungry. He squeezes it and it crumbles to dust. He takes a few steps, sniffing the air. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Can you smell that? 
BOY. It smells different. 
MAN. Everything is going to be different. 
EXT. DUNES - DAY 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. I don't think so. They couldn't live any place else. 
BOY. Not even if they could get there? If they had a-a-a spaceship? 
MAN. No. It's unlikely. The BOY stares, shivering, thinking. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Are you all right? What is it? He cups his hand to the babbling BOY's forehead. 
BOY. I don't feel so good. The BOY bends away and vomits and the MAN helps, rubbing his back and wiping the BOY's mouth when he's done. 
BOY. (CONT'D) I'm sorry. 
MAN. That's okay, you didn't do anything wrong. The MAN is very worried now. 
EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - LATER 
The MAN covers the BOY in more blankets and constructs a makeshift tent with the tarp as the rain falls all around. 
MAN. It's okay. You're going to be okay. It'll pass. 
BOY. Don't leave me here, don't go away Papa. Not even for a minute. 
MAN. I won't go away. I'm right here. He sits holding the BOY tightly. He feels for the BOY's heart. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He drops droplets of sugar water from a bowl into the BOY's mouth. As the BOY shuts his eyes and dozes he checks the pulse at his neck and wipes his mouth with the blanket. 
EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - NIGHT 
The BOY is sleeping fitfully across the MAN's lap - he is still awake, staring in horror as the BOY sweats and shakes in his sleep. He wipes the BOY's brow, looks up-to the 
HEAVENS: 
MAN. Oh no. No no. Not this. Jesus Christ what have you done to us? What have you done? 
EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - MORNING 
The BOY is fast asleep, motionless but for stertorous breathing through his mouth. The MAN lies beside him, just staring at him, watching him sleep. The BOY opens his eyes and focuses weakly. 
BOY. Hi Papa. 
MAN. I'm right here. 
BOY. I know. The BOY shuts his eyes and goes back to sleep. The MAN strokes the BOY's hair tenderly, takes the pistol from his belt and carefully hides the pistol under the blanket by the boy's side. He stands, takes one last look and walks away... 
EXT. SPIT/WATER - DAWN 
The MAN is alone now, staring at the hull of a wrecked boat keeled over in ten feet of gray water a few yards out from the spit - a sixty footer, twin masts. Closer to shore, in the shallows between the boat and the sand is a grey, lifeless form. The man steps closer and sees: POV MAN - bobbing about in the tide, the bloated, rotting cadaver of a giant squid, eyes like dinner plates, translucent grey skin like an old light bulb. The MAN eyes it uneasily, then starts stripping off his clothes. He stares anxiously into the darkly roiling water near the boat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He looks back along the beach to the distant figure of the BOY, sitting up wrapped in his blankets, looking around, confused and scared, enough to make the MAN wince. He collects himself and wades cautiously into the gray soupy water. He takes a breath and starts swimming to the boat. 
EXT. SAND DUNE - (CAMP 16) - DAY 
The BOY is confused as he watches: POV BOY - the MAN swimming away. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 
MYSTERY POV - over the shoulder of a mystery third person, camera pushes in slightly on the BOY sleeping. 
EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 
A FIGURE's feet enters the scene behind the boy, carefully walks in close around the boy. The FIGURE's long KNIFE drops into the scene, held at the figure's side. The BOY senses the FIGURE and wakes up to see: POV BOY - a dark, hunched FIGURE standing over him. The BOY looks up at the FACE and, whatever it is, he's terrified. The BOY SHRIEKS, terrified, scrambling away, tripping over pots and pans by the fire, he gets to his feet and runs. 
EXT. SHORELINE - EVENING 
BOY. Papa? 
MAN. Be quiet. The MAN cocks the pistol and there's two loud CLICKS. 
MAN. (CONT'D) God damn you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOY. Papa please don't kill the man. 
THIEF. Come on man, I done what you said, listen to the boy. The BOY starts crying - the THIEF looks at the BOY and then the angry MAN, this seems to be sobering. He puts the knife in the trolley and steps away, hands in the air, his thumbs are missing. 
MAN. How long have you been following us? 
THIEF. I wasn't following you. I saw the cart on the sand an' I just took it. 
BOY. Please Papa. 
MAN. Take your clothes off. Take them off, every godamn stitch. 
THIEF. Come on man, don't do this. 
MAN. I'll kill you where you stand. 
THIEF. Don't do this, man. 
MAN. I won't tell you again. 
THIEF. All right, all right, just take it easy. The THIEF looks at the BOY who is now covering his ears and the MAN takes an intimidating step closer with the gun. The THIEF starts stripping and piling his rags in the road. 
MAN. The shoes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
THIEF. Come on man. 
MAN. The shoes. He sits naked in the road and unlaces the rotting shoes. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Put them in the cart. The THIEF stands and drops the shoes in the trolley. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Put the clothes in. The MAN drops the clothes in and stands there covering himself, shivering. 
THIEF. Don't do me like this, man. You don't need to do me like this. 
MAN. You didn't mind doing it to us. 
THIEF. I'm begging you. 
BOY. Papa. 
THIEF. Come on, listen to the kid. 
MAN. You tried to kill us. 
THIEF. I'm starving man. You'd have done the same. 
MAN. You took everything. 
THIEF. I'll die out here. 
MAN. I'm going to leave you the way you left us. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) The MAN grabs the trolley by the handle, pulls it around, puts the pistol on top and holds his hand out for the BOY. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Let's go. The BOY doesn't take his hand but they set off along the blacktop, the BOY snivelling and crying, leaving the THIEF shivering and whimpering. 
BOY. Oh papa. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOY. What would you do if I died? 
MAN. If you died I'd want to die too. 
BOY. So you could be with me? 
MAN. So I could be with you, yes. But that's not going to happen. They look at each other a moment, unsure, the BOY shivering and sick-looking. The BOY lies down and shuts his eyes. The MAN puts a blanket over him. The MAN walks away a few paces and coughs endlessly, a nagging cough that won't go. 
EXT. ORCHARD - DAY 
THE MAN'S DREAM - a dream and a memory of an early summer day, the MAN and the WOMAN are in an orchard, lying in the sun on a picnic blanket, an array of food, bread, fruit and wine beside them. The MAN lies back and the WOMAN cradles his head in her lap, stroking his brow. She brings her face down and gently plants a simple kiss on each of his eyelids, then on each of his lips. POV MAN - the WOMAN's face, smiling a dazzling, radiant smile, framed by sunlight and the indistinct shapes of leaves and blossom and petals against the sky - to him she is angelic. Then he kisses her on each eye and on the lips too - their ritual caress. 
END OF DREAM SEQUENCE. 
EXT. ROADSIDE DUNES, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAWN 
The MAN awakes distressed, he wipes a tear, blinks in confusion. POV MAN - the BOY is kneeling beside him, watching him calmly, no longer sweating and shivering, recovered. 
BOY. Papa? The MAN rouses himself, sits up and just stares at the BOY, amazed, as if he has arisen from the grave 
MAN. How are you feeling? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOY. I feel kind of weird. 
MAN. Are you hungry? 
BOY. Just thirsty. The MAN gets up and fetches water from a ferry can in the trolley, pours a cup, hands it to the BOY who drinks thirstily. The MAN reaches out and strokes the BOY's hair as he drinks. 
EXT. RESORT TOWN, OUTSKIRTS - DAY 
The MAN and the BOY head towards a seaside town off in the distance. 
EXT. RESORT TOWN - DAY 
They enter a small beach resort with a faded "Welcome" sign across the road, the BOY holding the MAN's hand now. 
EXT. RESORT TOWN/WATER'S EDGE - DAY 
They are down by the water. Small pleasure boats are half sunken in the grey water. Faded colored bunting and painted signs advertise ICE CREAMS, FOOD and a FUN FAIR. The BOY helps the man push the trolley through the sand until they can go no further, they stop and drop onto the sand, exhausted. 
BOY. Can I tell you something? 
MAN. Yes. 
BOY. You tell me I shouldn't cry but I've heard you crying. I hear you coughing and crying to yourself in the night when you think I'm asleep. 
MAN. What of it? 
BOY. So if I shouldn't cry you shouldn't cry either. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: They look at each other. 
EXT. PORT - LATE AFTERNOON 
On the port side of town the MAN wheels the trolley through the deserted docks past rotten piers, a row of empty wooden warehouses and a rusty red tanker washed up. He is COUGHING and the sound echoes off the warehouse walls. The BOY is trailing a few paces behind, they're not speaking now. 
EXT. BACK STREET - EVENING 
As they pass the last of a row of deserted warehouses the MAN slows down to let the BOY catch up. But the BOY is now studying the ground intently. He bends down and picks up: POV BOY - an old cardboard match box, it's decals faded. He pushes the match box open to reveal a perfectly preserved Beetle. 
BOY. What is it? 
MAN. It's a Beetle. Suddenly the beetle twitches, then activates its wings and flies out of the box with a BUZZ and upwards into the sky... The BOY and the MAN stare up at the flying creature, amazed 
BOY. In the stories we're always helping people. But we don't help people. We just shoot people. And in the stories good things happen but we just get sick. The MAN thinks about it - stuck for an answer. 
MAN. We're still here aren't we? Doesn't that mean anything? 
EXT. BOAT LAUNCH - DAY 
The MAN pulls the trolley slowly, finding it a great effort. The BOY helps pull, eying the MAN with concern. The MAN stops and rests on the trolley and the BOY pulls on a few more feet then stops and looks back as the MAN COUGHS for a long painful moment. He takes the bloodstained surgical mask from his face, his breath foggy in the cold, he wrings out the blood and saliva, puts his head between his knees and coughs until he can cough no more, gasping for breathe, bloody drool unspooling from his lips into the sand like scarlet twine while the BOY watches, weeping silently. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. We have to leave the cart. I can't push it anymore. 
EXT. BOAT LAUNCH - DAY 
They are trudging along a concrete boat ramp by the beach road, the beach below, the BOY carrying a small-suitcase now, the MAN carrying sacks and bags. They stop and the MAN leans, impossibly breathless, his lungs packing up. They stop at the water edge, where the road reaches the sea. The BOY takes his hand gently. 
BOY. What are we going to do Papa? The MAN can't answer for breathlessness. 
BOY. (CONT'D) Well, what are we? The MAN sits heavily on the ground, totters as the BOY stands watching him, eyes welling with tears. 
BOY. (CONT'D) Oh no, Papa. 
EXT. BEACH/DUNES -(CAMP 18) - DAY 
The MAN is drifting in and out of consciousness in the sand. The BOY comes over with a cup of water and holds it to the MAN's lips, he drinks. The BOY has also lit a fire. He spreads out blankets. 
MAN. Don't get comfortable. You need to keep going. You don't know what might be down the road. 
BOY. No. 
MAN. We were always lucky. You'll be lucky again. You'll see. Just go. 
BOY. No. I can't. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. It's all right. This has been a long time coming. Just keep going south. Do everything the way we did it. 
BOY. No. You're going to be okay Papa. You have to. 
MAN. Keep the gun with you at all times. Don't let anyone take it from you. You need to find the good guys but you can't take any chances. Do you hear me? 
BOY. I want to be with you. 
MAN. I want to be with you too but I can't. 
BOY. Please. 
MAN. You have to go off on your own now. You have to carry the fire. 
BOY. I don't know how to. 
MAN. Yes you do. You know everything about it. 
BOY. Is it real? The fire? Papa? 
MAN. Yes it is. 
BOY. Where is it? I don't know where it is. 
MAN. Yes you do. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BOY. Where? 
MAN. It's inside you. It was always there. I can see it. The BOY stares at him, not sure what to believe. 
VETERAN. I'm sorry. 
BOY. I don't know what to do. 
VETERAN. Well, I think maybe you should come with me. The BOY's finger tightens on the trigger of the GUN. 
BOY. Are you one of the good guys? 
VETERAN. Yeah. I'm one of the good guys. Why don't you put that pistol away? 
BOY. I'm not supposed to let anybody take the pistol. No matter what. 
VETERAN. I don't want your pistol. I just didn't want you pointing it at me. The BOY lowers the gun to his side and the VETERAN comes a few steps closer, causing the BOY to back up a step. 
VETERAN. (CONT'D) Where's your stuff? 
BOY. I don't have much stuff. 
VETERAN. What have you got? Blankets? 
BOY. My Papa's wrapped in them. 
MAN. Show me. The BOY doesn't move. The MAN holds out his hand for the BOY to take, the BOY sees he has a THUMB MISSING and hesitates, wary. The MAN squats, leaning on his shotgun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
VETERAN. Look. You got two choices here. You can stay here with your papa or you can go with me. If you stay you need to keep off the road. 
BOY. How do I know you're one of the good guys? 
VETERAN. You don't. You'll have to take a shot. The BOY weighs it up, eyeing the VETERAN. 
BOY. Do you have any kids? 
VETERAN. Yes we do. 
BOY. Do you have a little boy? 
VETERAN. We have a little boy and a little girl. 
BOY. How old is he? 
VETERAN. He's about your age. Maybe a little older. 
BOY. And you didn't eat them? 
VETERAN. No. 
BOY. You don't eat people? 
VETERAN. No. We don't eat people. 
BOY. Are you carrying the fire? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
VETERAN. Am I what? 
BOY. Carrying the fire. 
VETERAN. You're kind of weirded out, aren't you, kid? 
BOY. Well, are you? 
VETERAN. Yeah. I am. I'm carrying the fire. 
BOY. And I can go with you? 
VETERAN. Yes, you can. The BOY hesitates.

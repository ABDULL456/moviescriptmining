Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles. 
LUKE C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are gonna be mighty glad to see you. 
McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER) 
All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood. 
EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT 
The yard is nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner has torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a napkin blows across the ground. 
In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers. 
CLOSER ON THIS TRIO 
As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots mingling with the silver ones. 
WOODY (abruptly) I wish we were all going. Together. 
The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat. 
LUKE Then you've got a short memory. Think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training. 
WOODY Oh, you're not gonna bring that up again -- 
LUKE (laughing) I'm trying to remember, let's see, which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there? 
WOODY You just can't let that go -- 
LUKE Oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship? If they sent us off to Mars together, there wouldn't be enough fuel to lift all those egos. 
WOODY (laughs) Bullshit, we would've made a great crew. 
MCCONNELL That was never gonna happen. I was always teamed with Maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. You know? Systems. Payloads... 
LUKE Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time Magazine! 
WOODY Yeah, who landed the crippled Block II Shuttle? 
LUKE Yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar rankings? 
WOODY Let it go, Luke. 
MCCONNELL (smiles) Sure, I made a little noise. But putting the first footprints on Mars? Nah. That's for guys who... (looks at Luke) ...wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place. And guys who... (looks at Woody) ...read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships around their necks. 
He grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand away, laughing. 
WOODY You read the same damn science fiction books that I did! You're just not man enough to wear jewelry! 
He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh. 
WOODY You want Flash. You know you want him. Well you'll have to come through me! 
Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head. 
MCCONNELL God, she would've loved to see you two clowns. Just one more time. 
He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, walking away a few steps. 
Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance. 
EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT 
McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette. McConnell has regained his composure. 
LUKE Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time you donated this thing to a museum? 
Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily. He grins. 
WOODY Internal combustion, boys. Accept no substitutes. 
Luke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell. 
WOODY Jim, if there's ever... if there's anything Terri and I can do -- 
MCCONNELL I'm okay. Really. Thanks. 
Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand. 
WOODY See you when I get to Mars, Luke. Don't solve all the mysteries of the universe, okay? Leave a little something for the next guys. 
LUKE I'll see what I can do. Just make sure you bring some fresh beer. 
WOODY You got it. 
With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence. Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this. 
LUKE Should've been your mission, Jim. Yours and Maggie's. 
McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still. 
LUKE None of us ever wanted Mars the way you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve years of hoping for this assignment, training for it -- 
MCCONNELL That's all over now. 
They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression is incredulous, exasperated. 
COTE Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault, he picked today's sector. 
KIROV Hey, c'mon! We've got a scientific duty to check that thing out. 
Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote. They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without success to coax more resolution. 
LUKE Great. That's great. The first anomaly we hit, and it's gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make NASA look ridiculous... You know how many books have been written about that damned mountain? 
COTE The Egyptians put it there. 
KIROV No, the Amazons. 
WILLIS No, it was little green men! 
LUKE And all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll have every UFO kook on Earth spouting off on the six o'clock news... C'mon, people, gimme a read here. Is that a cinder cone? 
KIROV Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic upwelling? 
COTE No fissures. No caldera. 
LUKE It's an upwelling, for sure. But maybe not volcanic... 
The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with growing excitement. He points to the screen. 
LUKE Look at the color. And see how shiny it is? I could swear that's ice... 
COTE This far south? 
WILLIS Impossible. You can't have ice at this latitude. Not unless... 
They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from one to another of them. They're almost trembling. 
WILLIS Oh my God. 
LUKE How far away is it? 
KIROV Sixteen kilometers northeast. Take us twenty minutes to get there. 
LUKE (considers a moment) Let's send a packet to Micker. Then we'll go check it out. 
EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY 
AIRLOCK DOORS 
Slide back, REVEALING the crew in EVA suits, carrying gear. They walk over to... 
THE FOUR-MAN ROVER 
The astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke puts the rover in drive. 
WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY 
As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL, PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which arrived as a separate, unmanned flight. 
Rows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY 
A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA and U.N. flag decals. 
SUPER TITLE: "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG." 
We MOVE IN towards another of the station's segments, which is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers. 
LUKE This is a truly anomalous formation. Looks like nothing we've seen so far. The structure appears to be crystalline, at least from the angle displayed by ARES-8 ... 
INT. MMCR. DAY 
On a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab, finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE. 
LUKE (grins) We're all trying not to go too nuts up here, but -- we think there's a good chance this could be an extrusion from some subsurface, geothermal column of water. And if we're right... 
He looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries. 
LUKE ...then we've found the key to permanent human colonization. 
IN THE MMCR 
There's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS, FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic, epochal discovery. 
MCCONNELL 
Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for instructions. 
MCCONNELL Tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this. Full-court press. 
The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the intense excitement of those around him, stares up at 
THE SCREEN 
Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the excitement their bombshell will create. 
LUKE Anyway, we'are going out to take a closer look at it, try to get an idea of its composition. (checks his watch) By the time you receive this, we should be just about on-site. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY 
Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed, as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY 
Cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover. Kirov has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain. Luke turns to Cote. 
LUKE Well? What's under there? 
COTE (puzzled) Je ne sais pas. I... I think there's something wrong with the equipment. 
LUKE What? 
COTE I mean, it can't be right. It says... it says there's metal under there. 
Luke doesn't understand. He walks up to look at the display screen. 
COTE (points) There's ten, twelve meters of rubble and sand, and then... solid metal. 
LUKE That doesn't make any sense. You're reading a vein of ore. 
COTE (shakes her head) No. It's under the whole mountain. 
The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns. 
LUKE Nick, could the problem with the antenna be interfering? 
WILLIS Could be. 
LUKE (to Cote and Kirov) Try it closer and up the power. I'll watch the screen. 
INT. MMCR. DAY 
McConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as the rest of MMCR looks on. Beck is gone. So are the U. N. ambassadors. 
MCCONNELL Ah, we're all pretty stoked about that formation you spotted, Mars One. The folks in the geology and hydrology back rooms are going over your images and comparing them to every photomap they've got. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY 
Cote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain, resetting the radar gun on its tripod. The deep vibrating tone continues. 
Luke is some distance away, by the rover. He looks at Willis, who's still working on the rover's antenna. 
LUKE Nick, how we coming on that antenna? 
WILLIS Goin' as fast as I can, boss. 
Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis. 
KIROV Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I am. I can't get this to work. 
Willis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts towards the radar gun. 
INT. MMCR. DAY 
McConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it. 
MCCONNELL Medical wants me to remind you that you're three days late on your blood tests. I know they're a bore, but you've got to get them done, or else... or else I don't know what. Just do them, okay? 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY 
Willis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running. 
KIROV All set here, chief. 
Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover. 
LUKE Okay. Crank up the juice and let's see what's in this sucker. 
INT. MMCR. DAY 
McConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates. 
MCCONNELL I think that's about it for business. But on a personal note, be advised that, ah, none of you can sing worth a damn. 
LAUGHTER in the MMCR. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY 
Luke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound... 
KIROV 
Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops. 
LUKE 
Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression. 
LUKE Why did that stop? 
A split-second later, he gets his answer. We hear a WHOOSH, a mighty rushing of wind, as 
A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER 
Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface of the slopes. 
THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS 
Stare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they're too fascinated to even be scared. 
WE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater, with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously still with all four wheels... 
WE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE, its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we come to the area where the fissure had been, and see 
THE FISSURE HAS BEEN FILLED IN 
Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke. The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see 
EXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY 
An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face. 
The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes, slopes, ramps. The "eyes" -- hatches of some kind? -- are closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask. 
We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick, scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble continues, low and insistent... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MARS TWO (DOCKED). COCKPIT. DAY 
We're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its docked position alongside the Space Station. 
Woody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual. 
WOODY (reads) "Problem: Hatch door malfunction, backup power fail, manual override fail. Solution: Replace circuit breaker 907B." 
He straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical junction box at one end of the console. 
WOODY Okay... Piece of cake. 
He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot's seat. 
WOODY God, who dreams up these nightmares? 
TERRI Don't try to change the subject. 
WOODY I'm not! We're talking about your sister's wedding, right? 
TERRI Very funny. We're talking about dancing lessons. Before my sister's wedding. 
WOODY Honey, do you mind? I've got a catastrophic power failure here. 
He peers into the housing with exaggerated concern. But Terri's not so easily sidetracked. 
TERRI Woody, we're a married couple. Would it kill you to invite me out on the floor once in awhile? 
WOODY I danced with you at our wedding. 
TERRI I'm not talking about shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt. I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba, jitterbug -- 
WOODY Face it, honey, some couples dance, some go to Mars. That's life. 
TERRI I'm serious. We've got two more months in this training rotation, but just as soon as we get home, we're starting lessons. If we never dance, people will think there's something wrong. 
WOODY If they see me dance, they'll know there's something wrong. 
Reaching past him, she pulls out the required breaker. As he reacts, surprised, she smiles, despite her exasperation. 
TERRI You are such a lug. 
Overhead, an intercom CRACKLES. We hear PHIL. 
PHIL'S VOICE Cockpit, this is Control. 
TERRI Control, this is Cockpit. 
PHIL'S VOICE Uh, Terri, they want us all back in the Station. Report to Micker. 
TERRI Who says report to Micker? 
PHIL'S VOICE The little men who live in my head. 
WOODY Phil, c'mon! We just started this drill. 
PHIL Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me to round up the team. Now. 
Woody and Terri exchange a worried look. What's wrong?

Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY 
A crisis atmosphere prevails. The big room is more crowded than we've ever seen it, with ENGINEERS and MANAGERS hurrying by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering feverishly into microphones. 
On the center screen, a giant image of Mars. A frantic flow of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red. 
WOODY AND HIS CREW 
Are staring up at this screen, appalled. McConnell and Beck stand nearby, briefing them. 
BECK Then, at 1417, the X-band continuous data stream from Mars went silent. All data -- med, environmental, everything -- suddenly stopped. While we were trying to figure out what the hell went wrong, we got a signal from the folks at the Large Array at Soccoro. 
MCCONNELL At the same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from Mars. 
WOODY What do you mean, "intense"? 
MCCONNELL (hesitates) Catastrophic. 
PHIL What about SIMA? 
Terri looks at Phil -- SIMA? 
PHIL The Saturn Imaging Probe. It's going to slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system. It could be retasked to take pictures, read radiation levels at Mars One Base Camp. 
WOODY Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us Luke hasn't survived and it's not safe to land, we swing around Mars and come right back home. 
MCCONNELL Yes. We can design the mission to have a free return capability. It's a long trip, but if you don't land it's the best option. 
BECK We're getting ahead of ourselves. You're forgetting the bigger problem. (they look at him) The orbits are all wrong. Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now. 
MCCONNELL But we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel. We've modelled that, Ray. I've modelled it. 
BECK On paper, yeah. But those stresses have never been tested in space. 
MCCONNELL The ship can take it. 
BECK I wasn't thinking of just the ship. 
A tense beat. Again we sense the test of wills between these two tough-minded men, once good friends. 
MCCONNELL I know the protocols for a Mars Recovery Mission better than anybody, because I helped design them. And I'm saying these guys can do it. 
WOODY He's right, Ray. We've got a real shot. 
A pause with beck weighing the odds. He looks at Woody. 
BECK Give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow. Then I'll put it in the works. 
MCCONNELL You'll have it by 0600. 
He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager. 
MCCONNELL Let's get to work. 
McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts out, too, Woody stops him. 
WOODY Chief, could I have a word? 
Beck looks at him a moment, nods. 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY 
In a quiet corner, Woody and Beck are alone. 
WOODY I've no longer got the right crew. 
BECK (surprised) What do you mean? Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle. 
WOODY Bjornstrom is a geologist. He's good, but not for this. My people just lost eight months of training. This is a different mission, with a different objective. 
BECK I haven't been given authorization for a mission yet. 
WOODY But when you are, it ought to be given the best chance for success. I want McConnell to fly right seat. 
Beck's expression hardens. 
BECK He's no longer on mission status. 
WOODY Yeah. Because you washed him out. 
BECK He washed himself out. He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations, but he refused to take them. 
WOODY Ray, he's the best pilot I ever saw, and you've got him benched at a desk. 
BECK Everybody has to pass the psych prelims. No exceptions. Jim knew that. 
WOODY Maggie was his wife. He didn't want to lie on a couch and share her with strangers. 
BECK That was his call. But I had to make one too. It was tough as hell, but I'd do it again. 
WOODY His wife wasted away in front of his eyes. What was he supposed to do? Suck it up? Get with the program? What was his crime? That he was upset? That he cried...? 
BECK I couldn't trust him! 
Beck and Woody stare at each other. A long tense beat. 
BECK (his voice softer) Not in a crisis... I'm sorry Woody, but Jim lost his edge. Are you gonna stand there and tell me Jim McConnell is the same man he was two years ago? You want me to bet four more lives on that? 
This stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press on harder, with even greater intensity. 
WOODY When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit out of him. It knocked the hell out of all of us. But you know and I know that he's still the best we've got. He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars. He's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together. Ray, we can do this. Give me McConnell as co-pilot, and we will bring Luke home. And that's a promise. 
Beck looks back at him, his features taunt. 
INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY 
Woody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as 
IN THE DISTANCE, FROM THEIR POV 
Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM's console. Other personnel have moved away, giving them room. Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly. After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search the room till they find 
WOODY'S FACE 
WOODY We'll have to be ready to move fast. Maybe even advance our ETA. Those things can cover the whole planet, and last up to a year. 
A beat. They both hope he's wrong. 
MCCONNELL When does SIMA do her fly-by? 
WOODY Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing. 
They exchange a glance. Woody's right, but the thought is too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars. 
MCCONNELL (softly) My money's on Luke. 
INT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. NEXT MORNING 
CLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK 
Just turning over to read "0545." 
TERRI 
Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly, looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby is her electron microscope. 
MCCONNELL (LOWER HAB) 
Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed. The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau. 
PHOTO OF A WOMAN 
Rests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling, dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with intelligence and energy. 
MCCONNELL 
Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads "0546." 
PHIL (LOWER HAB) 
Stands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances at another digital clock, which reads "0547." Shakes his head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's "Blue Moon."

Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY 
Phil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops himself at a handhold. He grins, charmed by the sight of 
WOODY AND TERRI DANCING 
Like a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious. 
He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head. 
PHIL What brought this on? 
WOODY Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. Once we're in Mars gravity, it's back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt. 
TERRI I'll take what I can get. 
She grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees 
MCCONNELL 
Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: Aren't they something? 
Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER, then an announcement. 
COMPUTER Attention. Incoming packet. 
They all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over to a console, shuts off the music. 
MCCONNELL It's SIMA. 
INT. COCKPIT. DAY. MINUTES LATER 
The crew is gathered around a display screen. The lights are dim, reflecting up off their faces. By their expressions, we can tell the news is not good. 
CLOSE ON THE SCREEN 
It's a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars One Base Camp. Ghostly, dust-covered. No signs of life. 
WOODY Looks deserted. 
PHIL It's still standing, though. So is the ERV. And look, there's the greenhouse. 
MCCONNELL We know Luke survived for at least a few hours. Question is, are there any signs of recent activity? 
They all scan the screen. Phil spots something. 
PHIL There. 
He grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look. CLOSE ON THE SCREEN 
Using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point, the image enlarges. THREE LONGISH DIRT PILES appear, some fifty meters from the hab. 
PHIL What the hell are those? 
McConnell gets it first. 
MCCONNELL Graves. 
An impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a semi-darkened living room. The footage is HANDHELD, a bit jerky. People have paper plates of food, beers in hand, everyone is a little tipsy. Debra is there, Terri, Phil, Cote, Kirov, others. They're watching a STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE, shown on a large screen TV, with commentary by Luke and Woody. 
THE FIRST PHOTO 
Is of a small boy (YOUNG MCCONNELL) in his pajamas, kneeling in front of a Christmas tree. He's grinning ecstatically as he holds up a brand new model rocket. 
LUKE Jim's first ship was seriously underpowered... 
LAUGHTER at this. Some AD LIB CRACKS about the painfully bad haircut and the pajamas. 
THE SECOND PHOTO 
Is of a gawky-looking teenage girl (YOUNG MAGGIE), standing on a porch at night, posing a bit self-consciously by a telescope on its tripod. 
WOODY Maggie was always starstruck... 
More LAUGHTER, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and braces. VIDEOCAMERA swings around the room, REVEALING the adult JIM and MAGGIE. They sit side by side on the hearth, leaning into each other, looking very happy. 
MAGGIE I'll get you guys for this. 
More LAUGHTER. Everyone's having a great time. The VIDEOCAMERA swings back towards the TV screen as 
THIRD PHOTO APPEARS 
Jim and Maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a fighter jet. Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand. Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles. 
LUKE When they met at the Air Force Academy, it was "love at first flight." 
GROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers. 
WOODY After that, NASA training was tough. All Jim could think about was exploring a heavenly body. More ribald LAUGHTER, as 
FOURTH PHOTO APPEARS 
Maggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in space suits. 
LUKE But Maggie, as you can see, kept him on a short leash. Until... 
A FIFTH PHOTO 
Shows McConnell, in a dress uniform, leaning in to kiss Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown. 
WOODY Mission accomplished! 
ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT 
As he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS, the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he's not alone. He looks up. 
WOODY 
Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering. 
IN THE VIDEO 
Luke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves his hands, hushing everybody. 
LUKE Today we celebrate a new chapter in their story. And guys, it's a pretty historic one. 
Both men raise champagne flutes. 
WOODY Let's hear it for the newly-announced Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One. To Jim and Maggie! 
CHEERS at this, repeats of "Jim and Maggie!" Luke grins, giving a little signal, and we see 
A FINAL PHOTO 
Of Maggie in Jim's arms, both of them in goofy tropical vacation wear, smiling. Evidently a photo taken in the surf somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image. 
LUKE When you guys land, it'll prove once and for all there's no intelligent life on Mars. 
More hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri sits nearby. 
MAGGIE Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right? 
ASSORTED VOICES Oh no, here we go! Don't get her started! Somebody put on some music! 
MAGGIE It's our sister planet! 
PHIL Oh brother! 
LAUGHTER at this, and Maggie joins in. She's a good sport. 
TERRI Maggie, why does this have to be about us? Mars is a great opportunity for pure science. 
MAGGIE We'll do the science. And we'll do it very well. That's what we've trained for. But what if there's more...? In all our myths, in every human culture, Mars has always held a special attraction. What if that means something? Only we don't understand it yet... 
The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too. 
MAGGIE The universe is not chaos. It's connection. Life reaches out for life... 
She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand. 
MAGGIE This is what we were born for, isn't it? To stand on a new world, and look beyond it to the next one. It's who we are. 
A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't meant to get so carried away. 
IN THE PRESENT - MCCONNELL 
Reaches out, gently taps the keyboard, FREEZING the screen. He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat. 
ANGLES ON TERRI AND PHIL 
As she seizes his wounded hand, tries to stop the bleeding. He's staring at a gauge. 
PHIL Outgassing! Losing pressure! 
TERRI Woody, seal the breech! 
ANGLE ON WOODY 
As he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the EVA, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. He yanks this open pulling out a 
PATCH GUN 
Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track 
THE RISING DROPLETS OF BLOOD 
Which give a telltale hint of the puncture's location, somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the "ceiling." 
WOODY PUSHES OFF 
Rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a shattered faceplate -- its label reads "MCCONNELL" -- to REVEAL A BREECH IN THE HULL. Jagged metal edges, dangling insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here, going into the vacuum of space. 
Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS, ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail. 
WOODY Kill those alarms! 
McConnell punches buttons, MUTING THE ALARMS, and they all strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. A long beat. But the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared. The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon. 
PHIL'S BLOOD DROPLETS 
Have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in the zero-G. Then suddenly they start moving again, faster and faster, in a new direction. Down through the open core tunnel that leads to the lower Hab. 
MCCONNELL 
Stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening. 
MCCONNELL Still outgassing in the lower Hab! There must be another hole down there, even bigger. 
PHIL Losing pressure fast! We're gonna decompress! 
WOODY Computer, how long until zero atmosphere? 
COMPUTER (after a beat) Four minutes, nine seconds. 
PHIL If we get below 20% atmosphere, the power will shut down! 
TERRI Are you sure? 
PHIL Positive! A vacuum inside the ship would cause a total electrical failure. The nav computers will fry! 
MCCONNELL (to Woody) We'll lose all control. We won't be able to fire the engines to capture Mars orbit. 
Just then a computer screen flickers, freezes. Phil punches keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him. 
PHIL It's already starting. The primary L- 1 hub has been smashed. The systems are crashing. 
Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more calm than he really feels. 
WOODY Everybody switch to suit oxygen. We beat this in the simulator, we can do it here. Jim, you've got the ship. I'm going EVA. 
They stare at him, stunned by their immense task. 
WOODY C'mon, people, let's go! Let's work the problem! 
INT. EVA AIRLOCK. MOMENTS LATER 
Terri, now helmeted, is putting Woody's helmet on him, but something's in the way, chafing his neck. He reaches into his suit, pulls out... 
THE CHAIN 
From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship dangling. 
WOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI 
As they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look. 
At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful. 
PHIL Jesus, it's still bleeding. 
TERRI Keep the pressure on! 
COMPUTER Eighty percent atmosphere... 
INT./EXT. AIRLOCK. NIGHT 
The outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody drifts through it into space. He's now wearing the MMU, an oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle astronauts. 
INT. EVA ROOM. NIGHT 
MCCONNELL'S HELMET. 
With its shattered faceplate -- now useless -- drifts past Terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on Phil's glove. 
MCCONNELL 
Floats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer. 
As Woody enters, stripped from the MMU, dripping with sweat, McConnell is waiting for him. For a moment the two men just look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce hug. 
WOODY (whispers) Know what? You've got enough left. 
McConnell looks at him, understands. 
Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes. 
TERRI Piece of cake? 
WOODY Well. Easier than the cha-cha. 
He scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately. 
Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own eyes. His voice catches for a moment. 
PHIL I don't know what you're getting so cocky about. We scored better times in the sim at least twice. 
MCCONNELL (grins) How's his hand? 
Terri separates from Woody, looks down at Phil. 
TERRI Seems OK. Couple of the tendons are going to be a little tight for awhile. Try to close your fingers, Phil, nice and slowly. 
Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully. 
PHIL Well, at least I'll still be able to drive. 
After a split-second they get it, and the whole crew roars with LAUGHTER, which builds and builds; they're almost giddy with the relief of the tension... 
EXT. DEEP SPACE. DAY 
MARS RECOVERY 
Sails INTO VIEW, with small attitude thrusters firing as the great ship maneuvers into position for its orbital-capture burn. Mars looks very large, blood-red. The entire spectacle is majestic, awe-inspiring. 
WOODY OK, we're ready to light this candle. Go/No Go for braking burn and MOI. Engines? 
INT. COCKPIT. DAY 
All four astronauts are strapped in, fully suited and helmeted. Mars looms through the cockpit windows. The atmosphere is electric with excitement. 
MCCONNELL Go. 
WOODY Systems. 
TERRI Go. 
WOODY Nav. 
PHIL Go. 
WOODY We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines. 
He flips three switches, in rapid sequence, and... 
EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY 
As we MOVE IN on the damaged fuel line, we see a tiny but steady spray of fuel venting from the hole caused by the meterorite. This freezes into eerie streamers and chunks, which slowly drift away from the ship. They're quite beautiful. 
PHIL (V.O.) Optimum angle of entry minus seven degrees. Six... Five... 
INT. COCKPIT. DAY 
Woody looks at the others for moment -- everyone is set, looking good -- then reaches for a last switch. 
PHIL Four... Three... 
Woody hesitates, then glances at McConnell. 
WOODY Jim? 
McConnell, moved by this honor, nods. He reaches out to throw the switch himself. 
MCCONNELL Let's go to Mars. 
As the countdown indicator reaches "0000.00.00", a final signal PINGS, and he flips the switch. 
EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY 
In total silence, the engines ignite. The second they do, the streamers of frozen fuel explode in a white flash. 
INT. COCKPIT. DAY 
With alarms sounding, the four astronauts are slammed violently forward, against their restraints. 
WOODY What the -- 
MCCONNELL Shut down engines! 
He and Woody both reach out, straining against the incredible G-forces, and manage to grab a red emergency lever, yanking it down hard. 
EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY 
Too late! IN SLOW MOTION, we see a terrifyingly violent chain reaction. The fuel tanks themselves explode, one after another. The supporting metal struts are vaporized. The solar panels are snapped off. Two of the huge engine bells are smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, PAST CAMERA, like a flaming cannon ball. The entire aft section of the ship, including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded, charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes what's left of the ship -- mainly the EVA chamber and cockpit -- to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars. 
INT. COCKPIT. DAY 
In the windows, Mars goes crazily in and out of view. The astronauts, flung this way, then that, are all fighting against unconsciousness. 
THEIR POV 
Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them. 
TERRI 
Happens to glance directly below. 
TERRI There she is! 
THEIR POV 
The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against the red of Mars. 
WOODY Jesus. She's not where I thought she'd be. 
PHIL We're going to miss her. 
WOODY 
Looks again at his display screen, frustrated. 
MCCONNELL What do you think? 
WOODY We can't catch it. Not like this. 
MCCONNELL (thinking quickly) Use the tether. 
From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out... 
THE TETHER GUN 
About the size of a large flare gun. There's a carabiner- like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun. 
MCCONNELL We'll only have one, maybe two shots before she's out of reach. 
WOODY It'll be better if I leave you the gun while I run out to the REMO. I've got enough fuel left for that. 
MCCONNELL You'll be going too fast. 
WOODY I'll aim to overshoot, then brake like hell; arc it in. 
McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is, and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes, trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands McConnell the gun. 
WOODY Seeya in a few. 
McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender, loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the tether gun. 
WOODY AND THE REMO 
Woody is chasing the REMO from above. It's as if he were in an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway. Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He checks his armpad display screen. 
WOODY Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm gonna take the edge off. 
Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he can. 
CLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS 
Glowing with orange flame. They suddenly cut off. 
WOODY'S EYES 
Show alarm. He checks his display. 
WOODY I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long. (beat) Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with suit jets. 
Woody hits some buttons and the MMU's latches snap open. He grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets. 
WOODY'S POV 
He's still going very quickly. 
WITH MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL 
Floating close together. The tether line is still unspooling from the gun. They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as he races towards the REMO. Terri's heart is in her throat. 
TERRI Oh Jesus. Jesus... 
McConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm. 
BACK ON WOODY 
Still speeding towards the REMO. His suit jets cut out. 
WOODY Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make contact... 
MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL 
Stare at Woody's distant figure. 
INTERCUT -- 
MCCONNELL At what velocity? 
WOODY Impact's gonna be a little rough. 
MCCONNELL At what velocity? 
WOODY (beat) Thirty-two. 
WOODY You listen to Jim, honey. It's a good plan. 
TERRI No! We are going to -- 
PHIL Oh Jesus, look! The ship! 
Phil points. McConnell and Terri look. 
THE MARS RECOVERY COCKPIT 
Is now several kilometers below and behind them. It's glowing red... then orange... then white. Then it erupts into a giant fireball, devoured by friction with Mars' atmosphere. 
MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL IN DEEP SPACE 
Are all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to look up again. He sees something alarming. 
MCCONNELL Look out! 
THEIR POV 
They are drifting quickly into the REMO. 
MCCONNELL Brakes! 
ALL THREE 
Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the tether gun. 
THE HOOK 
Releases from the REMO's hull. McConnell hits another button and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already scrabbling at a latch on the REMO's outer airlock door. 
MCCONNELL Okay, let's get inside! Phil, start dumping the cargo, or there won't be room for us. 
PHIL But we need those supplies for -- 
MCCONNELL Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody! 
WOODY 
Is looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that Terri has reached it safely. 
WOODY Will do, Jim. 
He turns to look at... 
MARS 
Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat. 
WOODY (softly) Hey, Beautiful... 
BACK AT THE REMO 
Terri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from McConnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the REMO. McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining. 
MCCONNELL Terri, no! 
But it's too late. She's already out of reach, and now fires her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO. 
MCCONNELL 
Is reaching to activate his own jets, when 
PHIL'S HAND 
Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half- maddened, agonized, staring after Terri. 
MCCONNELL Goddammit, Terri, it won't work! 
But Terri keeps on going. 
WOODY 
Looks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars. Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him. 
WOODY Terri, what are you doing? 
INTERCUT -- 
TERRI I'll tell you what I'm not doing, Woody. I'm not going to watch you die. 
WOODY Terri -- 
TERRI You'd do the same for me. 
AT THE REMO 
Phil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle of Woody's suit lights. The airlock door hangs open. Phil looks at McConnell, anguished. 
MCCONNELL Get inside. Dump the cargo, then start the systems. (Phil hesitates) Now. 
INTERCUTTING BETWEEN WOODY AND TERRI 
As Woody keys his mike. Tries to steady his voice. 
WOODY No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if it just wasn't possible. 
TERRI I can do it! 
HER THUMB 
Hovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell's voice, from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he's aged fifty years in the blink of an eye. 
MCCONNELL Come back, Terri. 
Terri's thumb is still poised. Death would be better. 
ANGLE ON MCCONNELL 
Outside the REMO. The hatch is still open. We see Phil inside, staring out anxiously towards Terri. 
MCCONNELL (quietly, simply) He's gone. 
He sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri. 
MCCONNELL Please, Terri... (long beat) We need you. 
TERRI'S THUMB 
Pushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward. 
TERRI'S FACE 
Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO. 
INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY 
On the big screen at MMCR, a glowing green icon labelled "MARS RECOVERY" is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer figures crawls beside it. 
SUPER TITLE: "SPACE STATION. MMCR. 20 MINUTE TIME LAG" 
Beck stands by the NEW CAPCOM, as the latter repeats headset data. 
NEW CAPCOM Okay, they're Go for the burn and MOI. Should be initiating the burn just about... now. 
Suddenly the data stream goes crazy. It shivers, streaks, breaks up... then stops. The blinking green icon representing Mars Recovery glows brighter... then vanishes. 
A moment of stunned silence in the big room. Then a rising babble of scared, confused voices. 
RAY BECK 
Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place, right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a row... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT 
The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. The hatch is sealed. 
INT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT 
McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has been opened; he's facing 
SMALL UTILITY MONITOR 
Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator lights, com ports. 
MCCONNELL 
Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He turns, looking back at 
TERRI AND PHIL 
Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold. 
PHIL'S FACE 
Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear. 
TERRI 
Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock. 
MCCONNELL 
Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly. 
MCCONNELL Phil? (no response) Hey, Phil...? 
Phil looks up at him dully. 
MCCONNELL We're going in blind. We'll deploy the chutes by laptop. I need to get on the data bus, put in a software patch, and try to soften this tin can's landing. I could use your help with the patch. 
After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence. 
MCCONNELL That's great. Good job. (turning to Terri) Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those cargo straps? 
Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches for another one, begins looping them together. 
MCCONNELL 
Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, but at least they're moving. 
EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT. (MINUTES LATER) 
Small thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position for entry into the atmosphere. 
Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it falls away from us, towards Mars at night. 
LUKE ...When I came to and dug myself out of the sand, my faceplate was cracked. Leaking badly. I barely made it back to Base. It was weeks before I could work up the nerve to go back out there and look for their... 
He has to pause, collect himself. 
LUKE Renee was the only one I could find. But it didn't seem right, somehow, to dig just one grave. 
There is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few steps. He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze. 
MCCONNELL Has it been blowing like this for a while? (Luke nods) We saw a big storm from space. But Micker said it was turning south. 
Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only he seems to see. 
LUKE If it holds course. 
McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at Luke. 
MCCONNELL This -- whatever it was -- this force. You say it came directly out of the top of the mountain? 
LUKE You don't believe me. That's okay. But I'm not crazy, Jim. 
McConnell isn't quite sure how to reply to this. 
MCCONNELL What did you mean by its "secret?" What secret? 
LUKE (pause) You better see for yourselves. 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY 
McConnell, Terri, and Phil follow Luke into the Science Lab area of the Hab, then stop in their tracks. Their helmets are off. It's very cold in here; their breath is frosty. 
THEIR POV -- 
The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew. 
LUKE See, where they made their mistake was, they must've planned for it to be visible from Earth... 
The others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electric space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he rubs his hands together, poised over the keyboard. 
MCCONNELL Who's "they"? 
Luke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jittery feverish intensity, a secret excitement. 
LUKE Don't you understand? Hundreds of millions of years have gone by. You've got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, meteor impacts -- hell, in that much time, the whole surface would've changed. So no wonder we never saw it before. Well, I mean, we saw it, but not like they meant us too. Too much dirt on it. 
The others exchange worried glances. Is he totally nuts? 
TERRI Saw what? 
LUKE This. 
On the computer screen they're looking at... 
CLOSE ON THE MONITOR 
Pictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground- level, in telephoto views. Rising out of a ring of rock and dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face. The white is smooth, impenetrable. It has the scale of a mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural. 
MCCONNELL, PHIL AND TERRI (INT. MARS ONE HAB.) 
They are stunned. Can hardly believe their eyes. 
PHIL Jesus... 
TERRI What is that...? 
LUKE I don't know. But whatever it is, somebody built it. And not us. 
A few moments of silence while they try to absorb this. 
MCCONNELL What about the sound? That signal you heard before the explosion? 
LUKE Good, Jim, good. That's the key. 
A click of the mouse and they all HEAR, over speakers, the DEEP PULSING BASS TONE. 
LUKE Hear the pauses? That's what made me realize it's a pattern -- a repeating pattern. 
MCCONNELL Mathematical? 
Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this. 
LUKE That's what I thought. There are distinct blocks in the pattern, and within each block the tones come in groups of three. Threethreethree. For months I struggled to analyze it, trying different constructs... Then I thought about dimensions. 
MCCONNELL X-Y-Z coordinates... 
LUKE Right! Three groups equals three dimensions... So I tried assigning different graphic values to each block, group and tone. And finally I got... this. 
He types another command. They all look at the monitor, the glow reflecting on their faces. They are amazed again. 
CLOSE ON THE MONITOR 
Where we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally familiar double helix, of a DNA molecule -- the elegant blueprint of life. 
BACK TO SCENE (INT. MARS ONE HAB.) 
PHIL My God... Is that what I think it is? 
PHIL So what happens when it gets the right answer? 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY 
As McConnell looks at Luke and Terri. 
MCCONNELL (hesitates) I don't know. But we've got to find out. (to Luke, pointing) Can you work this the other way? Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes? Then dub them into your recording of the signal? 
LUKE I think so, yes. 
MCCONNELL What about the radar gun? Will it accept that input? Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face? 
Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying. 
INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY 
Phil is also growing increasingly nervous. 
PHIL Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if you're wrong? Whoever goes out there... I mean, what if you're wrong? Three people have already died over that thing. 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY 
As Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell. 
TERRI Four. 
McConnell looks at her. 
MCCONNELL Terri, if we leave here without getting some answers, they all died in vain. 
Terri shakes her head. 
TERRI We just don't know enough about that -- that thing out there to take any more chances. 
MCCONNELL What are we here for, if not to take chances...? 
His passion startles them; they've never seen him so emotional. He points at the computer screen. 
MCCONNELL This means we're not alone. It means we're on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankind's history. But we've still got to prove it. Who knows when someone else will get back here? Or if they ever will? You know what Congress is like. They'll say it's too dangerous, too much loss of life, let's go back to unmanned flights. We could be the last explorers to come here for decades. We're it, guys. (pause) We're it. 
LUKE (quietly) We don't have to go out there. There's a better way. 
They look at him, surprised. 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY 
The familiar, plucky little figure of ARES-8 wheels across ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back. Ares' video snout WHIRRS out, extending. The familiar bass rumble of the Face is very loud from here. 
LUKE Checking video feed... 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY 
McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks, then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the image starts to sharpen. 
LUKE There! 
ON THE MONITOR 
They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE... 
THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS 
Stare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick as he maneuvers the remote surveyor. 
MCCONNELL How close do we need to get? 
LUKE I'm not sure. Maybe we better stop by that boulder. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY 
Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire. 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY 
Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods. 
Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY 
From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops. 
For a moment nothing happens. 
Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains. 
ANGLE ON THE FACE 
As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises, it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face. No inside details can be seen. 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY 
McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon, awed. They're barely breathing. 
PHIL Oh my God... 
INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK 
Phil keys his own mike. 
PHIL Yeah, Jim. Your signal's breaking up a little in the storm, but I read you. 
EXT. THE FACE. DUSK 
McConnell stares into the bright opening. Bathed in its light. 
MCCONNELL We're at the Face. We're gonna need a few minutes here. Same deadline, launch at 1950. With or without us. Do you copy? 
PHIL (pause) Copy that. 
Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance. 
TERRI Jim, are you sure you want to do this? 
MCCONNELL I'm not sure of anything anymore. But I didn't come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet. 
Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal. McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath. Then they walk forward together, into the light. 
INT. THE FACE. DUSK 
The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a free hand. 
The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, textures, colors -- anything at all. They can't see walls, ceiling, even a floor. 
MCCONNELL Surface seems firm and level. 
LUKE Roger that. Texture is smooth. 
TERRI I've got good footing and no obstructions. Let's check our -- 
Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them. 
TERRI It's solid again! We're trapped. 
MCCONNELL Don't move! Keep this orientation. 
The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the brightness, some twenty feet apart. 
MCCONNELL (keys his mike) Phil? Phil, can you still hear me? 
INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK 
Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the main computer. It works! He's immensely relieved. 
PHIL Computers are online! Ready to load software. But guys -- we're losing visibility here. 
He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio. 
PHIL Guys...? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone there...? 
No answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread. 
PHIL Don't leave me. 
INT. FACE. DUSK 
McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his right glove. 
Terri and Luke see this. 
TERRI (alarmed) Jim, what're you doing? You'll depressurize! 
MCCONNELL I don't think so. 
McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the hiss of rushing air. 
LUKE Jim, seal it! 
MCCONNELL No. That was air going into my suit, not out. Look at your own suits -- they're not rigid anymore. We've got pressure in here. 
Luke looks at his sleeve. McConnell's right. 
TERRI Above Mars atmospheric? That's impossible. 
MCCONNELL We're millions of miles from Earth and we're inside a gigantic white face. What's impossible? 
Terri types on her arm keypad. She's amazed. 
TERRI There's six psi in here... (taps more keys) Nitrogen and oxygen. 
LUKE Otherwise known as air? 
Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring. Luke follows suit. 
TERRI Hey, there may be some lethal trace gasses I haven't picked up yet, or... or... oh, the hell with it. 
Terri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air. And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed another kind of test... 
HIGH, STRIATED WALL 
Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts. 
THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK 
Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame 
MCCONNELL 
Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands. 
MCCONNELL They're us. We're them... 
LUKE We're Martians...? 
MCCONNELL That's what she means. 
TERRI Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion. 
McConnell and Luke look at her. 
TERRI Almost six hundred million years ago, there was a sudden expansion of life on Earth. The first multi-celled plants and animals appeared. No one has ever understood why... 
LUKE They seeded Earth. 
We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow. 
THE ASTRONAUTS 
Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter here, like stars against a midnight sky. 
THE MARTIAN 
Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core. 
MCCONNELL 
Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes. 
Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor. 
PHIL (over radio) ...in, please. Can you... me? 
Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike. 
TERRI Phil, we're here! We read you. 
Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation. 
PHIL Thank God! Listen, this storm is really -- (loud static) -- few more minutes, I can't -- (more static) You've gotta get back to the ship! 
And then they hear only STATIC. His signal is lost. 
TERRI Phil? Phil...? 
Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register, with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as 
THE FIRST ORANGE BAND 
Begins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri. 
MCCONNELL We are in a ship. This is a ship. And the countdown has already started. 
Terri looks at Luke, alarmed. 
LUKE He's right. 
TERRI Then let's get the hell out of here! 
She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of the colored rings. 
LUKE Jim... 
McConnell doesn't turn. 
LUKE Jim, we gotta go. 
MCCONNELL I'm not coming with you. 
TERRI (stunned) What? 
Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain. 
TERRI What are you talking about? We've got to get home. 
MCCONNELL That's where I'm going. Don't you see? That's what all this is for. (McConnell gestures at the ship around them) You were right Terri. This is an invitation. To follow them. To follow them home. 
He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half smile. 
MCCONNELL I have to go. This is the mission now. To find out who we are. Isn't that why we came here? Like Maggie said, "To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one." 
Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them both. 
MCCONNELL You know, when you think about it -- I wasn't even supposed to be here -- all the accidents, everything that got us to this point, it's just... it's just... I just know it's right. 
Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands. 
MCCONNELL I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. But you're running out of time. You've gotta get back to the ERV and get off this planet. Now please go. 
Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend. 
LUKE I once felt like I was taking your turn. But now I think maybe you're taking mine. Guess I'm a little jealous. 
They clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell. 
LUKE Thanks for saving my life. 
And the words: "IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED" 
INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT 
McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds him, when something catches his attention. He arches his neck, looking down. 
A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID 
Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are covered. 
MCCONNELL'S EYES 
Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder but 
HIS GLOVED HANDS 
Slide helplessly across the smooth surface. 
MCCONNELL 
Looks down again. 
THE COBALT LIQUID 
Is up to his knees. Now his thighs... 
MCCONNELL 
Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher, can he somehow climb to safety? 
ABOVE HIM 
The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a collision course. 
INT. ROVER. NIGHT 
Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri stares at a dashboard computer screen. They have to shout to be heard over the ROARING WIND. 
TERRI I've lost the Base Camp beacon! 
Luke looks over alarmed. 
CLOSE ON A DIAL 
As the needle spins freely, giving no direction whatsoever. 
TERRI No good! We're driving blind. 
LUKE I'll try to keep on a straight line! It's our only chance. 
TERRI Don't worry! I've worked with Phil for four years! I know Jim gave him a direct order, but he won't leave without us. 
EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT 
The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It disappears from view! 
INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT 
Phil sits in the pilot's seat. He is looking at a computer graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With resignation, he keys his mike. 
PHIL This is ERV, do you read? ERV to Rover, do you read...? 
Phil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red switch that reads "LAUNCH." He hesitates, then actually has his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle of static on the radio. Phil keys his mike. 
PHIL This is ERV, do you read? 
LUKE (very faint) Save the fuel, Phil. We're coming in. 
And Phil chokes back a sob. Blinking back the tears, he tries to compose himself, then keys his mike. 
PHIL Uh, Phil's not here right now. He left for Earth five minutes ago. Please leave your message at the beep. 
EXT. THE FACE. NIGHT 
FROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising from the forehead of the Face, from its "third eye," spinning and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex. But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew, this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds, causing a dark counter-swirl. 
EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT 
Phil stands at the bottom of the ERV's ladder, gripping it to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust. 
THE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out, struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands, helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused. 
PHIL Where's Jim? 
TERRI He got another ride. 
Phil stares at her, bewildered. 
LUKE Tell you on the way. Let's go! 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. MARTIAN SHIP. NIGHT 
LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest. Now it's at his shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring. 
He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.

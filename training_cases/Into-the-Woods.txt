FADE UP 
Grey clouds of an early morning sky. 
BAKER (V.O.) Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom, there lay a small village at the edge of the woods... 
Suddenly, the WELL-WORN BOOT of Cinderella steps into the frame and lands on what we thought was the sky, but in fact is simply its reflection in a puddle of water. A strong CHORD accents the splash and we begin a musical vamp. 
EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - DAYBREAK 
CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S dirty hand as it reaches down to gather kindling. 
CINDERELLA (O.S.) 
I WISH... 
BAKER (V.O.) And in this village... 
CLOSE-UP on a bead of sweat as it trickles from her brow, the same hand entering the frame to wipe it. 
CINDERELLA (O.S.) 
MORE THAN ANYTHING... 
BAKER (V.O.) ... lived a young maiden... 
ANGLE on CINDERELLA A pretty (and filthy) young woman, who finishes mopping her brow and trudges towards the back of a large house, the kindling under her arm. 
CINDERELLA 
MORE THAN LIFE... 
MORE THAN JEWELS... 
EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
CLOSE-UP on JACK'S calloused hands as he pulls on a rope. 
BAKER (V.O.) ... a care-free young lad... 
ANGLE ON JACK A spaced-out twelve year-old who is trying to pull his bony cow MILKY-WHITE towards his dilapidated cottage. 
JACK 
I WISH... 
MORE THAN LIFE... 
INT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
CLOSE-UP on a ball of dough. The BAKER'S thick hand pounds it. 
BAKER (V.O.) ... and a childless baker... 
ANGLE ON THE BAKER AND HIS WIFE Hard-working and honest, he is kneading the dough which she then takes and puts in the oven. 
BAKER/BAKER'S WIFE 
I WISH... 
BAKER (V.O.) ... with his Wife-- " 
BAKER 
MORE THAN ANYTHING... 
WIFE 
MORE THAN THE MOON... 
BAKER/BAKER'S WIFE 
I WISH... 
INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
CINDERELLA scrubs a huge pot. 
CINDERELLA 
THE KING IS GIVING A FESTIVAL. 
INT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
The WIFE rolls the dough as the BAKER stokes the hot oven. 
BAKER/WIFE 
MORE THAN LIFE... 
INT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
Inside the tiny cottage, the COW stands bewildered as JACK tries to milk her without success. 
JACK 
(TO MILKY-WHITE) 
I WISH... 
INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
CINDERELLA 
I WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL-- 
INT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
BAKER/WIFE 
MORE THAN RICHES... 
BAKER (V.O.) All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart. 
EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
JACK'S MOTHER, bedraggled, takes in the laundry. 
BAKER (V.O.) The young lad had no father, and his 
MOTHER-- 
JACK'S MOTHER 
I WISH... 
BAKER (V.O.) Well, she was at her wit's end-- 
JACK'S MOTHER 
I WISH MY SON WERE NOT A FOOL./ I WISH 
MY HOUSE WAS NOT A MESS./ I WISH THE 
COW WAS FULL OF MILK./ I WISH THE 
WALLS WERE FULL OF GOLD--/ I WISH A 
LOT OF THINGS. 
INT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
JACK'S MOTHER enters the house and stops dead in her tracks when she sees the cow. 
JACK'S MOTHER What in heaven's name are you doing with the cow inside the house? 
JACK I thought if he was nice and warm he might produce some milk. 
JACK'S MOTHER It's a she! How many times must I tell you? Only shes can give milk! 
INT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
The BAKER and his WIFE are scurrying about the kitchen. 
BAKER (V.O.) And then there was a hungry little girl who always wore a red cape... The BAKER turns to see a small hand rise up and snatch one of the BUNS off the counter. 
BAKER Hey! The BAKER swiftly comes around the counter where a small, plump young girl in a red cape, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD studies the goodies. 
LRRH 
I WISH./ IT'S NOT FOR ME,/ IT'S FOR MY 
GRANNY IN THE WOODS./ A LOAF OF BREAD, 
PLEASE,/ TO BRING MY POOR OLD HUNGRY/ 
GRANNY IN THE WOODS.../ JUST A LOAF OF 
BREAD, PLEASE. 
INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
The STEPSISTERS are still laughing at CINDERELLA. The STEPMOTHER looks around the room and sees a large bowl of lentils. She walks over, picks it up and violently flings the bowl towards CINDERELLA strewing the beans across the room and into the fireplace. 
STEPMOTHER 
(CHEERY) Cinderella, if you can pick up these lentils, and finish your chores in time, then you may go to the ball with us. (to her DAUGHTERS) Come along, ladies... 
STEPSISTERS Yes, Mother. They sweep out of the room giggling. BACK ON CINDERELLA. She stands forlornly, studying the mess that awaits her. She closes her eyes and begins to gently sway as if going into a trance. 
CINDERELLA 
COME LITTLE BIRDS,/ DOWN FROM THE 
EAVES/ AND THE LEAVES,/ OVER FIELDS,/ 
OUT OF CASTLES AND PONDS.../ AHHHHH... 
INT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
JACK is trying to milk the COW as his MOTHER looks on dubiously. 
JACK 
NO, SQUEEZE, PAL ... JACK'S MOTHER hears the loud squalling of birds and runs to the window, sticking her head out. 
JACK'S MOTHER'S POV Birds flying en masse over their house. 
EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - DAY 
We see the BIRDS swarming and flying down the chimney. 
INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
CINDERELLA opens her eyes to greet the birds that now surround her. 
CINDERELLA 
QUICK, LITTLE BIRDS,/ FLICK THROUGH 
THE ASHES./ PICK AND PECK, BUT 
SWIFTLY,/ SIFT THROUGH THE ASHES./ 
INTO THE POT... The BIRDS spread out and begin their task. 
EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
JACK sits atop MILKY-WHITE as if she were a horse, his arm WHIRLING as he releases a sling and sends a STONE hurtling towards a TIN CUP on top of the door frame. There is a loud 
"CLANG". 
JACK Bullseye! JACK'S MOTHER was just exiting the house. The CUP falls down, narrowly missing her. 
JACK'S MOTHER What are you doing? Stop your pretending! She grabs JACK'S sling and pulls him away from the COW. 
JACK'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Now listen to me well, son. Milky-White must be taken to market. 
JACK Mother, no-- he's the best cow in the 
WORLD-- 
JACK'S MOTHER Was. She's been dry for weeks. We've no food or money and no choice but to sell her. 
WITCH And when your mother died, your father deserted you. Your father was no father -- so why should you be? 
BAKER (to his WIFE) I'm so sorry... 
WITCH 
NOW THERE'S NO MORE FUSS/ AND THERE'S 
NO MORE SCENES/ AND MY GARDEN THRIVES - 
/ YOU SHOULD SEE MY NECTARINES!/ BUT 
I'M TELLING YOU THE SAME/ I TELL KINGS 
AND QUEENS: The WITCH grabs some magical looking beans from a SMALL SATCHEL she carries across her body. She displays them. 
WITCH (CONT'D) 
DON'T EVER NEVER EVER/ MESS AROUND 
WITH MY GREENS!/ ESPECIALLY THE BEANS. 
EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
JACK with his cow stands outside with his MOTHER. 
JACK Why do I have to go to the next village? 
JACK'S MOTHER Because everyone in this village knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks. 
JACK But that's cheating. 
JACK'S MOTHER We're starving, Jack. Don't you understand that? You're not to take less than five pounds for her. Are you listening to me? 
JACK 
(HE'S NOT) Yes. 
JACK'S MOTHER How much are you to ask? 
JACK No more than five pounds. She grabs his ear and squeezes it hard. 
JACK'S MOTHER JACK Less! Than five. ... than five! 
She lets go and puts the COW'S leash in his hand and pushes him down the road towards the woods. 
JACK'S MOTHER 
INTO THE WOODS, THE TIME IS NOW./ WE 
HAVE TO LIVE, I DON'T CARE HOW./ INTO 
THE WOODS TO SELL THE COW,/ YOU MUST 
BEGIN THE JOURNEY./ STRAIGHT THROUGH 
THE WOODS AND DON'T DELAY,/ WE HAVE TO 
FACE/ THE MARKETPLACE./ INTO THE WOODS 
TO JOURNEY'S END-- 
JACK 
(STOPS; SADLY) 
INTO THE WOODS TO SELL A FRIEND-- 
INT. BAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
The WITCH, the BAKER, the BAKER'S WIFE. 
WITCH 
YOU WISH TO HAVE THE CURSE REVERSED? The BAKER and his WIFE nod. 
WITCH (CONT'D) 
I'LL NEED A CERTAIN POTION FIRST. The WITCH intently turns on them. 
WITCH (CONT'D) 
GO TO THE WOOD AND BRING ME BACK/ ONE: 
THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ TWO: THE 
CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,/ THREE: THE HAIR 
AS YELLOW AS CORN,/ FOUR: THE SLIPPER 
AS PURE AS GOLD./ BRING ME THESE 
BEFORE THE CHIME/ OF MIDNIGHT IN THREE 
DAYS' TIME,/ `TIS THEN THE BLUE MOON 
REAPPEARS,/ WHICH COMES BUT ONCE EACH 
HUNDRED YEARS./ BRING THEM AND I 
GUARANTEE,/ A CHILD AS PERFECT AS 
CHILD CAN BE. 
(SHE EXPLODES) Go to the wood! The WITCH flings her arms and a hundred-mile wind throws the couple and all of their belongings across the room as she disappears in a cloud of smoke -- or is it flour? 
EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - DAY 
An open-air carriage and horses wait in the courtyard. The STEPMOTHER, dressed to the nines, sweeps out of the house and impatiently calls over her shoulder. 
STEPMOTHER Ladies. Our carriage awaits! CINDERELLA darts out of the house holding out the bowl of lentils to her STEPMOTHER. 
CINDERELLA 
NOW MAY I GO TO THE FESTIVAL? 
STEPMOTHER The Festival! DARLING, THOSE NAILS!/ 
DARLING, THOSE CLOTHES!/ LENTILS ARE 
ONE THING, BUT/ DARLING, WITH THOSE,/ 
INTO THE WOODS-- BUT EVEN SO,/ I HAVE 
TO TAKE THE JOURNEY.

TO GET THE MONEY!-- 
EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL - DAY 
CINDERELLA drops down from the wall and runs off. 
CINDERELLA 
TO GO THE FESTIVAL-- 
EXT. WOODS - NATURAL ARCHWAY/STREAM - DAY 
LRRH enters an archway that frames the entrance into the woods. 
LRRH 
INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHER'S 
HOUSE.../ INTO THE WOODS TO 
GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE... 
INTERCUTTING: THE BAKER entering the same archway; CINDERELLA crossing a stream; and LRRH weaving her way down a gully. 
CINDERELLA/BAKER/LRRH 
THE WAY IS CLEAR,/ THE LIGHT IS GOOD./ 
I HAVE NO FEAR,/ NOR NO ONE SHOULD./ 
THE WOODS ARE JUST TREES,/ THE TREES 
ARE JUST WOOD./ NO NEED TO BE AFRAID 
THERE-- All THREE of them stop with sudden trepidation. 
BAKER 
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE GLADE THERE. The BAKER walks deeper into the woods. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD BY JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
The carriage carrying the STEPFAMILY crosses a small country bridge, then passes JACK'S MOTHER. One of the wheels turns in a puddle and splashes her with mud. 
ALL 
INTO THE WOODS WITHOUT DELAY,/ BUT 
CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE THE WAY./ INTO THE 
WOODS, WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY/ BE LURKING 
ON THE JOURNEY? 
EXT. WOODS - NATURAL ARCHWAY - DAY 
JACK enters the archway into the woods with his COW. 
ALL 
INTO THE WOODS TO GET THE THING/

EXT. WOODS - DAY 
VARIOUS ANGLES on each of our CHARACTERS in different woodland surrounds. 
STEPS 
INTO THE WOODS 
TO SEE THE KING-- 
JACK 
TO SELL THE COW-- 
BAKER 
TO MAKE THE POTION-- QUICK INTERCUTS between the characters: 
ALL 
MOTHER SAID,/ "COME WHAT MAY,/ FOLLOW 
THE PATH/ AND NEVER STRAY." 
WOLF 
JUST SO, LITTLE GIRL--/ ANY PATH./ 
SO MANY WORTH EXPLORING./ JUST ONE 
WOULD BE SO BORING./ AND LOOK WHAT 
YOU'RE IGNORING... He ushers LRRH off the path to a lush meadow blanketed with exquisite purple flowers and wild berries. 
WOLF (CONT'D) (working himself up) 
THINK OF THOSE CRISP,/ AGING BONES,/ 
THEN SOMETHING FRESH ON THE PALATE./ 
THINK OF THAT SCRUMPTIOUS CARNALITY/ 
TWICE IN ONE DAY.../ THERE'S NO 
POSSIBLE WAY/ TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU 
FEEL/ WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR 
MEAL! The WOLF picks a flower and hands it to LRRH. 
WOLF (CONT'D) For Granny. 
LRRH 
MOTHER SAID/ NOT TO STRAY./ STILL, I 
SUPPOSE,/ A SMALL DELAY--/ GRANNY 
MIGHT LIKE/ A FRESH BOUQUET.../ Goodbye, Mr. Wolf. 
WOLF Goodbye, little girl./ AND HELLO... The WOLF climbs to the top of a precipice where he is silhouetted by the red hot sun. He lets out a mighty howl. 
EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
LRRH goes about her business picking flowers further from her path. ANGLE ON THE BAKER who has been observing LRRH from a distance. Like a bat, the WITCH swings upside down from a tree above the BAKER: 
WITCH Why are you standing there?! Go get the cape! 
BAKER You frightened me! The WITCH swings to the ground. 
WITCH Get it! Get it! Get it! 
BAKER How am I supposed to get it? 
WITCH You go up to the little thing, and you take it. 
BAKER I can't just take a cloak from a little girl. Why don't you take it! 
WITCH It's the rules. Why do you think I asked you in the first place? I'm not allowed to touch any of the objects! We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound, swoons with delight. Then: 
WITCH (CONT'D) 
(YELLING) Get me what I need! Get me what I need! She wraps the cape about herself and disappears in such a strong blast of wind that it knocks the BAKER to the ground. 
BAKER This is ridiculous! ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over to her. 
BAKER (CONT'D) Hello there little girl. 
LRRH Hello, Mr. Baker. 
BAKER Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny? 
LRRH I ate all the sweets and half the loaf of bread. 
BAKER So I see! Now tell me...where did you get that beautiful cape? 
LRRH My Granny made it for me. 
BAKER Is that right? I would love a red cape like that. 
LRRH 
(GIGGLING) You'd look pretty foolish. 
BAKER May I take a look at it? He quickly unties it. 
LRRH No! 
He pulls it off her back, she grabs the other side. 
BAKER I need it badly. 
LRRH Please -- give it back! They have a tug of war. The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream. ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done, then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her shoulders. 
BAKER I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that you really loved this cape. Now off you go to Granny's -- and be careful that no wolf comes your way. 
LRRH I would rather a wolf than you any day. LRRH stamps on his foot. The BAKER hops on his good foot. 
BAKER 
(DISTRAUGHT) This is hopeless. I'll never get that red cape or find a golden cow and a yellow slipper -- or was it a golden slipper and a yellow cow? 
WIFE (O.S.) 
THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ THE CAPE AS 
RED AS BLOOD,/ THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS 
CORN,/ THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS-- He stops in his tracks. 
BAKER What are you doing here? The WIFE steps out from behind a thicket. 
WIFE You forgot your scarf. 
BAKER You shouldn't be here. It's not safe in these woods! 
WIFE I want to help. She goes to tie the WOOL SCARF around his neck but he pulls away. 
BAKER No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE-- 
WIFE 
EXT. WOODS - RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAY 
R-PRINCE POV An exquisite tower, surrounded by a thicket of tall rose bushes, with no entryway, just a lone window at its peak. At the bottom of the tower, the WITCH looks upward: 
WITCH Rapunzel. Rapunzel. Let down your hair to me. The PRINCE, hiding within the brush. 
R'S PRINCE (savoring the name) Rapunzel... At the window, the gorgeous young blonde girl, RAPUNZEL proceeds to lower the longest stretch of hair you've ever seen. The WITCH scales up the tower. (This causes more than a little discomfort for RAPUNZEL.) 
BAKER (V.O.) The old enchantress had given the name Rapunzel to the child she had hidden away and locked in a a doorless tower. But little did she know that the girl's lilting voice had caught the attention of a handsome Prince." 
R'S PRINCE Rapunzel... The PRINCE dashes back to his horse and gallops off. The WITCH arrives at the window. 
WITCH Don't you look lovely today, my dear. 
RAPUNZEL Thank you, Mother. 
WITCH I brought your favorite. Blackberries, fresh from the garden. 
EXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY 
LRRH walks over a rickety bridge that spans a brook. She stops and stares at the cottage which is built into a large 
OAK TREE. 
BAKER (V.O.) As the little girl approached her Granny's oak tree, she was surprised to see the door standing open. 
LRRH Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps it's all the sweets. 
INT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY 
LRRH makes her way down a curved staircase in the house. She sees the CURTAINS drawn around her GRANNY'S BED and, behind them, the SILHOUETTE of what "looks like" GRANNY. 
LRRH Granny? 
WOLF (In a granny voice) Come in, my deary. LRRH moves towards the bed with trepidation and slowly pulls back the curtain. The WOLF is revealed, lying under the covers, dressed in GRANNY'S nightcap and robe. 
LRRH My, Grandmother. You're looking very strange. What big ears you have! 
WOLF The better to hear you with, my dear. The handsome WOLF flashes a smile that reveals a set of gleaming white FANGS. 
EXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY 
The BAKER crosses the bridge and heads towards the cottage. He suddenly hears LRRH scream. Nervously he pulls the knife from his belt. 
BAKER (V.O.) And with a single bound, the wolf had devoured the little girl. Well, it was a full day of eating for both. 
INT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
The BAKER enters and hears a loud SNORE. Brandishing the knife, he moves towards the bed where he sees the WOLF DRESSED AS GRANNY, sound asleep, a piece of the red cloth sticking out of it's mouth. Squeamishly, he pulls back the sheet to see the WOLF'S SWOLLEN STOMACH. He raises his knife and as he brings it slashing down we hear a loud HOWL from the WOLF. 
CUT TO BLACK 
EXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER 
FADE UP ON THE BAKER, clearly shaken, leaving the cottage and walking away. 
BAKER I can't believe I just did that. LRRH and GRANNY appear at the doorway behind him. 
LRRH 
(CALLING) Wait! 
GRANNY Aren't you going to help us skin that beast? 
BAKER No thanks! 
GRANNY What kind of hunter are you? 
BAKER I'm a baker. 
GRANNY gives him a disdainful look and goes back into the house. LRRH in her cape runs after the BAKER as he approaches the rickety bridge. 
LRRH Wait a minute. I never thanked you. 
BAKER You need to be more careful, young lady. 
LRRH I'm sorry. I should have known better. 
MOTHER SAID,/ "STRAIGHT AHEAD,"/ NOT 
TO DELAY/ OR BE MISLED./ I SHOULD HAVE 
HEEDED/ HER ADVICE.../ BUT HE SEEMED 
SO NICE. 
AND HE SHOWED ME THINGS,/ MANY 
BEAUTIFUL THINGS,/ THAT I HADN'T 
THOUGHT TO EXPLORE./ THEY WERE OFF MY 
PATH,/ SO I NEVER HAD DARED./ I HAD 
BEEN SO CAREFUL/ I NEVER HAD CARED./ 
AND HE MADE ME FEEL EXCITED--/ WELL, 
EXCITED AND SCARED. LRRH relives her nightmare. 
INT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - NIGHTMARE 
LRRH walks down the staircase towards GRANNY'S bed. She sees the WOLF'S silhouette through the bed curtains. 
LRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
WHEN HE SAID "COME IN!"/ WITH THAT 
SICKENING GRIN,/ HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT 
WAS IN STORE?/ ONCE HIS TEETH WERE 
BARED,/ THOUGH, I REALLY GOT SCARED--/ 
WELL, EXCITED AND SCARED./ LRRH grabs hold of the bed curtains and pulls them around herself. 
INT. THE WOLF'S BELLY - NIGHTMARE 
LRRH falls down a dark cavernous void. 
LRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
(STARTLED) Yes. I just need to catch my breath. 
WIFE What a beautiful gown you're wearing. Were you at the King's Festival? CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue on her way. 
CINDERELLA Yes. 
WIFE Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are you in the woods at this hour? We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching. 
STEWARD (O.S.) This way! 
CINDERELLA Please. Don't let them know I'm here. She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls down to the WIFE. 
C'S PRINCE Have you seen a beautiful young woman in a ball gown pass through? 
WIFE (Breathless as she 
BOWS) I don't think so, sir. 
STEWARD 
(POINTING) If I may, my lord, I think I see her over there. The ENTOURAGE races off and CINDERELLA reappears and sits, catching her breath. 
WIFE I've never lied to royalty before. I've never anything to royalty before! 
CINDERELLA Thank you. 
WIFE If a prince were looking for me, I certainly wouldn't hide. 
CINDERELLA Well, what brings you here -- and with a cow? 
WIFE Oh, my husband's somewhere in the woods. 
(WITH PRIDE) He's undoing a spell. 
CINDERELLA 
(IMPRESSED) Oh? 
WIFE Oh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what was he like? 
CINDERELLA 
HE'S A VERY NICE PRINCE. 
WIFE 
AND? 
CINDERELLA 
AND--/ IT'S A VERY NICE BALL. 
WIFE 
AND? 
CINDERELLA 
AND--/ WHEN I ENTERED, THEY TRUMPETED. 
WIFE 
AND--?/ THE PRINCE--? 
CINDERELLA 
OH, THE PRINCE... 
WIFE 
YES, THE PRINCE! 
CINDERELLA 
WELL, HE'S TALL. The WIFE sits down next to CINDERELLA admiring her dress as they chat. 
WIFE 
IS THAT ALL?/ DID YOU DANCE?/ IS HE 
CHARMING?/ THEY SAY THAT HE'S 
CHARMING. 
CINDERELLA 
WE DID NOTHING BUT DANCE. 
WIFE 
YES--? AND--? 
CINDERELLA 
AND IT MADE A NICE CHANGE. 
WIFE 
NO, THE PRINCE! 
CINDERELLA 
OH, THE PRINCE... 
WIFE 
YES, THE PRINCE. 
CINDERELLA 
HE HAS CHARM FOR A PRINCE, I GUESS... 
WIFE 
GUESS? 
CINDERELLA 
I DON'T MEET A WIDE RANGE. 
AND IT'S ALL VERY STRANGE. 
DRAWS YOU CLOSE/ TO HER GIANT BREAST,/ JACK (in the tree). 
JACK (CONT'D) 
AND YOU KNOW THINGS NOW THAT YOU NEVER 
KNEW BEFORE,/ NOT TILL THE SKY. The BAKER listens intently. 
JACK (CONT'D) 
ONLY JUST WHEN YOU'VE MADE A FRIEND 
AND ALL,/ AND YOU KNOW SHE'S BIG BUT 
YOU DON'T FEEL SMALL,/ SOMEONE BIGGER 
THAN HER COMES ALONG THE HALL/ TO 
SWALLOW YOU FOR LUNCH. 
AND YOUR HEART IS LEAD AND YOUR 
STOMACH STONE/ AND YOU'RE REALLY 
SCARED BEING ALL ALONE,/ AND IT'S THEN 
THAT YOU MISS ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE 
KNOWN/ AND THE WORLD YOU'VE LEFT AND 
THE LITTLE YOU OWN. 
EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY - FLASHBACK 
JACK scurries down the BEANSTALK, with the large SACK OF COINS over his shoulder, occasionally looking up to see if he is being followed. 
JACK (V.O.) 
THE FUN IS DONE./ YOU STEAL WHAT YOU 
CAN AND RUN! 
(MORE) 
JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
AND YOU SCRAMBLE DOWN/ AND YOU LOOK 
BELOW,/ AND THE WORLD YOU KNOW/ BEGINS 
TO GROW: 
EXT. WOODS - DAY - PRESENT 
JACK looks down to the BAKER. 
JACK 
THE ROOF, THE HOUSE, AND YOUR MOTHER 
AT THE DOOR./ THE ROOF, THE HOUSE, AND 
THE WORLD YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO 
EXPLORE./ AND YOU THINK OF ALL OF THE 
THINGS YOU'VE SEEN./ AND YOU WISH THAT 
YOU COULD LIVE IN BETWEEN,/ JACK now scurries down the tree. 
JACK (CONT'D) 
AND YOU'RE BACK AGAIN,/ ONLY DIFFERENT 
THAN BEFORE,/ AFTER THE SKY. 
THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE SKY!/ THERE 
ARE BIG TALL TERRIBLE AWESOME SCARY/ 
WONDERFUL GIANTS IN THE SKY! JACK jumps from the tree and lands in front of the BAKER. He up-ends the sack and dumps the five gold coins on the ground. 
JACK (CONT'D) So, here's your money, sir! Five gold pieces. Where is my Milky-White? 
BAKER 
(HESITANTLY) Milky-White is back home with my wife. 
JACK Let's go find them! JACK grabs the BAKER and excitedly tries to pull him along. 
BAKER Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to sell. 
JACK But you said I could buy her back. Do you want more money? 
BAKER No, no, no! It's not that-- 
JACK 
(IGNORING HIM) You keep that. I'll fetch some more. 
BAKER Wait. I didn't say-- But JACK doesn't wait to listen. Taking the EMPTY SACK, he runs off excitedly. 
BAKER (CONT'D) Hey, come back! 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
The BAKER follows after JACK and collides into his WIFE, dropping his satchel and revealing the red cape. He hides the money sack. 
BAKER What are you doing here? 
WIFE Well... She doesn't want to tell him she's lost MILKY-WHITE. 
WIFE (CONT'D) I see you've got the red cape! 
BAKER Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left. 
WIFE 
(SHEEPISH) Three. 
BAKER Two. We've the cape and the cow. 
YOURS,/ WHEN YOU KNOW SHE WOULD GO 
WITH YOU,/ IF THERE ONLY WERE DOORS. 
BOTH 
AGONY!/ OH THE TORTURE THEY TEACH! 
R'S PRINCE 
WHAT'S AS INTRIGUING-- 
C'S PRINCE 
OR HALF SO FATIGUING-- 
BOTH 
AS WHAT'S OUT OF REACH? C-PRINCE studies his reflection in the water. 
C'S PRINCE 
AM I NOT SENSITIVE, CLEVER,/ WELL- 
MANNERED, CONSIDERATE,/ PASSIONATE, 
CHARMING,/ AS KIND AS I'M HANDSOME,/ 
AND HEIR TO A THRONE? 
R'S PRINCE 
YOU ARE EVERYTHING MAIDENS COULD WISH 
FOR! 
C'S PRINCE 
THEN WHY NO--? 
R'S PRINCE 
DO I KNOW? 
C'S PRINCE 
THE GIRL MUST BE MAD. The R-PRINCE scales a hanging vine as if it were RAPUNZEL'S hair. 
R'S PRINCE 
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MADNESS/ TILL 
YOU'RE CLIMBING HER HAIR/ AND YOU SEE 
HER UP THERE/ AS YOU'RE NEARING HER,/ 
ALL THE WHILE HEARING HER,/ "AH-AH-AH- 
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH--" 
BOTH 
AGONY! 
C'S PRINCE 
MISERY! 
R'S PRINCE 
WOE! 
BOTH 
THOUGH IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EACH. 
C'S PRINCE 
ALWAYS TEN STEPS BEHIND-- 
R'S PRINCE 
ALWAYS TEN FEET BELOW-- 
BOTH 
AND SHE'S JUST OUT OF REACH./ AGONY/ 
THAT CAN CUT LIKE A KNIFE! 
I MUST HAVE HER TO WIFE. PULL BACK to reveal the PRINCES side by side on a precipice, overlooking the distant castle. 
EXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - NIGHT 
The BAKER'S WIFE fights her way through a thicket. Her clothes are now ratty, her face scratched - but she approaches the tower with trepidation. 
WIFE Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me. The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side. 
RAPUNZEL 
(DUBIOUS) Is that you at this hour, my Prince? 
WIFE (in her best princely 
BASS VOICE) Yes. RAPUNZEL thinks about it for a moment, then lowers her hair. The WIFE approaches it gingerly. 
WIFE (CONT'D) Excuse me for this. She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing. She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling some of the hair from her head. 
EXT. PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Cinderella flees the castle. 
BAKER (V.O.) As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince. While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in pursuit. SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through wooded path. ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit. The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S attention. 
C'S PRINCE (O.S.) Over here! CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the ground. CINDERELLA rushes off. The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short, rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into thickets. 
C'S PRINCE (CONT'D) Who is she? Where did she go? 
WIFE 
(BOWING) I have no idea, sir. 
WIFE I'm going to get the slipper. 
BAKER The yellow slipper? 
WIFE The GOLDEN slipper! 
BAKER Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it? 
WIFE I have met a maiden with golden slippers these two previous nights. 
BAKER You think you could get one? 
WIFE Yes, I'm sure of it. I'll meet you back here. 
BAKER Right. 
(BEAT) Why are we always separating? 
WIFE Because we have to if we're going to be together... The BAKER and his WIFE start to go off in opposite directions when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet and look to one another. 
WIFE (CONT'D) What is happening? 
EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON 
The Giant lies still on the ground. 
BAKER (V.O.) The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk came crashing down, killing the Giant... 
EXT. KING'S CASTLE - PALACE STEPS - NIGHT 
The MOON is now half covered by SHADOW. DROP DOWN to find CINDERELLA running down the steps; commotion ensues as she is followed by the PRINCE and his retinue. 
BAKER (V.O.) ...as for Cinderella, she fled from the Prince... again. ANOTHER ANGLE. Suddenly, when CINDERELLA is MID-FLIGHT on the steps, she falters, unable to move. She looks down to see that there is TAR on this step and her shoes are stuck. ANGLE ON THE PRINCE. Smiling as he sees he has finally trapped his prey. We FREEZE the action as CINDERELLA considers the situation. 
CINDERELLA 
HE'S A VERY SMART PRINCE,/ HE'S A 
PRINCE WHO PREPARES./ KNOWING THIS 
TIME I'D RUN FROM HIM,/ HE SPREAD 
PITCH ON THE STAIRS./ AND I'M CAUGHT 
UNAWARES./ WELL, IT MEANS THAT HE 
CARES--/ THIS IS MORE THAN JUST 
MALICE./ BETTER STOP AND TAKE STOCK/ 
WHILE YOU'RE STANDING HERE STUCK/ ON 
THE STEPS OF THE PALACE. 
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?/ HAVE TO 
MAKE A DECISION./ WHY NOT STAY AND BE 
CAUGHT?/ SHOULD I GIVE THAT A 
THOUGHT,/ WHAT WOULD BE HIS RESPONSE?/ She turns around to see the PRINCE, frozen in time and staring at her. 
CINDERELLA (CONT'D) 
BUT THEN WHAT IF HE KNEW/ WHO I AM 
WHEN I KNOW/ THAT I'M NOT WHAT HE 
THINKS/ THAT HE WANTS? 
OR THEN WHAT IF I AM/ WHAT A PRINCE 
WOULD ENVISION?/ BUT THEN HOW CAN YOU 
KNOW/ WHO YOU ARE TILL YOU KNOW/ WHAT 
YOU WANT, WHICH I DON'T?/ SO THEN 
WHICH DO YOU PICK:/ WHERE YOU'RE SAFE, 
OUT OF SIGHT,/ AND YOURSELF, BUT WHERE 
EVERYTHING'S WRONG?/ OR WHERE 
EVERYTHING'S RIGHT/ BUT YOU KNOW THAT 
YOU'LL NEVER BELONG? 
AND WHICHEVER YOU PICK,/ DO IT QUICK,/ 
`CAUSE YOU'RE STARTING TO STICK/ TO 
THE STEPS OF THE PALACE. 
IT'S MY FIRST BIG DECISION,/ THE 
CHOICE ISN'T EASY TO MAKE./ TO ARRIVE 
AT A BALL/ IS EXCITING AND ALL--/ ONCE 
YOU'RE THERE, THOUGH, IT'S SCARY. AND 
IT'S FUN TO DECEIVE/ WHEN YOU KNOW YOU 
CAN LEAVE,/ BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WARY. 
THERE'S A LOT THAT'S AT STAKE,/ BUT 
I'VE STALLED LONG ENOUGH,/ `CAUSE I'M 
STILL STANDING STUCK/ IN THE STUFF ON 
THESE STEPS... 
BETTER RUN ALONG HOME/ AND AVOID THE 
COLLISION./ THOUGH AT HOME THEY DON'T 
CARE,/ I'LL BE BETTER OFF THERE/ WHERE 
THERE'S NOTHING TO CHOOSE,/ SO THERE'S 
INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
CINDERELLA has only just got back. Grubby again, and wearing her old clothes, she bundles her beautiful dress into a chest. 
STEWARD (O.S.) All young maidens are hereby commanded to remain in their home until they are visited by the Royal Guard. CINDERELLA goes to the window and looks out. 
EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
CINDERELLA'S POV: The C-PRINCE and the royal RETINUE arrive in the entry courtyard. BACK ON CINDERELLA. She smiles to herself. 
INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
The entire STEPFAMILY has assembled, in various stages of undress. LUCINDA stands and watches as the STEPMOTHER tries to force FLORINDA'S large foot into the tiny slipper. 
BAKER (V.O.) As the Prince anxiously waited, the Stepmother took matters -- and Florinda's foot -- into her own hands. 
FLORINDA 
CAREFUL, MY TOE--! 
STEPMOTHER 
DARLING, I KNOW-- 
FLORINDA 
WHAT'LL WE DO? 
STEPMOTHER 
IT'LL HAVE TO GO./ BUT WHEN YOU'RE HIS 
BRIDE,/ YOU CAN SIT OR RIDE./ YOU'LL 
NEVER NEED TO WALK! The STEPMOTHER takes a handkerchief and stuffs it into the girl's mouth and then pulls a large kitchen knife from her pocket and raises it over her foot-- 
EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - NIGHT 
Standing lanterns have been set up outside the house, bathing the area in light. The STEPFAMILY watches as the STEWARD helps FLORINDA up on to the back of the Prince's horse. In pain, she grits her teeth in a frozen smile. 
BAKER (V.O.) Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the Prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper. As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs sheepishly. 
INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
This time the STEPMOTHER tries to force LUCINDA'S foot into the slipper. FLORINDA looks on with a smirk. 
BAKER (V.O.) Lucinda was next. 
LUCINDA 
WHY WON'T IT FIT? 
STEPMOTHER 
DARLING, BE STILL./ CUT OFF A BIT/ 
OF THE HEEL AND IT WILL./ (she pulls out knife) 
AND WHEN YOU'RE HIS WIFE/ YOU'LL HAVE 
SUCH A LIFE,/ YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO 
WALK! 
QUICK SHOTS: FLORINDA'S hand over LUCINDA'S mouth. The KNIFE raised up by the mother. LUCINDA'S eyes in fear as we hear a muffled scream and the "WOOSH" of a knife-- 
EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - NIGHT 
The PRINCE and STEWARD wait impatiently in the torchlight. 
BAKER (V.O.) Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to swallow the pain. At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER and 
SISTER. 
STEPMOTHER It's a perfect fit, Your Highness! LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and gingerly picks up the bloody slipper. 
C'S PRINCE Have you no other daughters? 
STEPMOTHER Only a little stunted kitchen wench, which her late father left behind but she cannot present herself. She is too dirty. Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears. The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot. 
C'S PRINCE I would recognize these beautiful eyes anywhere. This is the true bride! The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to his horse. The two of them ride off. FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear a CAWING (the sound of birds) overhead. They look up, alarmed. BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together, dreading what is to come as the CAMERA rushes towards them. 
BAKER (V.O.) As punishment for their cruelty, Cinderella's birds swooped down upon the Stepsisters... and blinded them. The BIRDS enter the picture frame, more and more, their CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are all we see. 
EXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
RAPUNZEL is alone in a mossy bower on an isolated island in the middle of swamp waters filled with POISONOUS SNAKES. She hums a sad refrain. 
BAKER (V.O.) As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest. ANOTHER ANGLE. The R-PRINCE with a ragged scarf wrapped around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse. The R-PRINCE lifts his head as he hears RAPUNZEL'S singing. 
Could it be? The horse, seemingly knowing the way, follows the sound as the R-PRINCE calls her name. 
R'S PRINCE Rapunzel? Rapunzel? 
ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL She looks up and cries with delight when she sees her PRINCE across the water. 
RAPUNZEL My darling! She jumps into the swamp, fearlessly ignoring the SNAKES, until she reaches terra firma and her man. R-PRINCE falls from his horse onto the ground. 
R'S PRINCE Rapunzel? Is it you? RAPUNZEL reaches him and rips off his scarf. She kneels to cradle his face, weeping. 
RAPUNZEL How could she do this to you? EXTREME CLOSE-UP: RAPUNZEL'S TEAR falls into the R-PRINCE'S blind eye. The PRINCE'S vision is restored. 
R'S PRINCE 
(ASTONISHED) Rapunzel! 
RAPUNZEL What? 
R'S PRINCE I can see you! The two of them embrace. At the same time, we hear MOOING. 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT 
The BAKER is pulling a very obstinate WHITE COW through the woods. He looks up at the MOON which is almost completely covered in SHADOW. 
BAKER (to the COW) Come on! We don't have any time... Then the WIFE rushes in from another direction, carrying the 
SLIPPER. 
WIFE I've found you! (sees the cow) You've got the cow! 
BAKER You've got the slipper! 
JACK You can use the silky hair of the corn-- 
WITCH Yes! Pull it from the ear and feed it to the cow. Quickly! The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair from the corn and feeds it to the cow. JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin. Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN. 
WIFE It's working! 
JACK She's milking! The WITCH grabs the chalice. 
WITCH At last! The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek.. The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine- months-full of pregnancy. 
BAKER That was quick! The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has been restored to her former self, and she likes what she sees. The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROAD TO KING'S CASTLE/KING'S CASTLE - A NEW DAY 
GOLDEN ROSE PETALS fill the air, swirling across the screen. PULLING BACK we see that the petals are being thrown by CHEERING SUBJECTS who toss more into the air as they clamor to catch a glimpse of CINDERELLA and her PRINCE on their wedding day. MUSIC. CINDERELLA'S carriage resplendent in gold drawn by black stallions passes. She sits demurely smiling as her PRINCE plays to the PASSERS-BY. This comes easily to him. 
BAKER (V.O.) And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right. The Witch succeeded in reversing her mother's curse. Cinderella finally stopped running from her Prince. CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd. She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over- dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous "fascinator" hat. 
BAKER (V.O.) Jack was reunited with his beloved cow and his mother could now dress in the best a golden egg could buy. Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY. 
BAKER (V.O.) And the Baker and his Wife were proud parents of a strapping baby boy. The WIFE shows her the BABY. 
WIFE (calling to her) Thanks for the slipper. The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met by cheers. The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum. RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE. The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave. The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD quiets. 
STEWARD Let us cheer the newlyweds as they embark on their happy bliss today, and 
EVER AFTER-- 
BAKER (V.O.) And so with the kingdom filled with joy, those who deserved to were destined to live happily ever... 
Suddenly the earth SHAKES with a mighty force, tossing CINDERELLA and her PRINCE (mid-kiss), along with their ATTENDANTS and the entire CROWD to the ground. A piece of the CASTLE comes CRASHING DOWN. Chaos ensues. JACK'S MOTHER stands up and looks around. No sign of JACK. 
JACK'S MOTHER Jack? Jack...? ANGLE ON BAKER and his WIFE. 
BAKER 
(STUNNED) Are you alright? 
WIFE I think so. 
BAKER And the baby? 
WIFE Yes, he's fine. There is another AFTERSHOCK. ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs off through the crowd and disappears. 
STEWARD (speaking into the 
HORN) Attention! Attention! Let there be no panic. NO PANIC! The Royal Prince wishes to address his loyal subjects. Attention! The R-PRINCE searches the crowd for RAPUNZEL. Those who haven't fled, quiet and gather around. The C-PRINCE takes the horn. 
C'S PRINCE There's no need for worry. It was an earthquake in a far-off quadrant of our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all. As many of you know, we had another little shaker just days ago. I will personally investigate the disturbance. Now everyone, back to your villages, and on with your lives! 
EXT. KINGDOM - DAY 
A dense mist settles across the kingdom. In the distance a beanstalk stretches up to the sky. C'S PRINCE and his RETINUE gallop away from the destroyed castle into the woods. 
BAKER (V.O.) But as they made their way back into the woods, their familiar paths were nowhere to be found and their lives were about to take an unexpected turn. 
EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY 
The BAKER and his WIFE are walking down a path -- or the remnants of a path. 
WIFE What's happened? Everything's so different. They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a lush area, now trampled and broken. 
BAKER Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase? 
LRRH I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole village collapsed. I couldn't find my mother anywhere. And now I can't find my Granny's cottage. 
BAKER What do you mean? 
LRRH I went down the dell, and I didn't recognize anything. There was no path. (getting worked up) Where's the stream? Where's the bridge? Where's Granny? 
WIFE Calm down. 
BAKER We can help you find Granny's without the path. 
WIFE Yes. The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER. 
WIFE (CONT'D) Please take him for a few moments. The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They continue walking. The BABY begins to cry. 
BAKER Why does he always cry when I hold him? 
WIFE You needn't hold him as if he was so fragile. The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back. 
BAKER He doesn't want me. He wants his mother! 
WIFE I can't take care of him all of the time. 
BAKER I'll take care of him -- when he's older... They hear COMMOTION in the distance. 
WIFE Who might that be? 
BAKER It's the Steward and the royal family. 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Through a thick haze, the BAKER sees the STEWARD, the STEPFAMILY and a few SERVANTS carrying trunks and tending to the blind, hobbling STEPSISTERS. The BAKER makes his way to them with his WIFE and LRRH in tow. 
BAKER What brings you into the woods? 
STEWARD The castle has been destroyed. 
WIFE No! 
STEPMOTHER The kingdom is under attack. 
BAKER What is the Royal family going to do? 
STEWARD I have no idea! I don't make policy. I just carry it out. 
WIFE (to the Baker) I think it best we get back to the village. We'll take the girl with us. She holds out a hand for LRRH. 
WIFE (CONT'D) You come with us. LRRH takes her hand. But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their footing. The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other. The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE. Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs them. 
WIFE (CONT'D) It's a giant! 
BAKER A giant woman! Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT. We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her voice matches her size. 
GIANT Where is the lad who killed my husband? 
STEWARD There is no lad here! 
WITCH I was just trying to be a good mother! 
R'S PRINCE 
(URGING HER) Rapunzel... RAPUNZEL takes one look at her MOTHER then moves to the 
PRINCE. 
WITCH Rapunzel, no! You will never be safe with him. 
RAPUNZEL Take me away from here. R-PRINCE pulls RAPUNZEL up onto his horse. 
WITCH No! Rapunzel! 
RAPUNZEL Don't you understand? I never want to see you again. Ever! ANGLE ON THE WITCH watching RAPUNZEL ride into the woods. 
WITCH 
(TO HERSELF) 
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,/ CHILDREN 
WON'T LISTEN./ NO MATTER WHAT YOU 
KNOW,/ CHILDREN REFUSE/ TO LEARN. 
GUIDE THEM ALONG THE WAY,/ STILL THEY 
DON'T LISTEN./ CHILDREN CAN ONLY GROW/ 
FROM SOMETHING YOU LOVE/ TO SOMETHING 
YOU LOSE... 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DUSK 
At first, we just see TREES. 
BAKER (O.S.) BAKER'S WIFE (O.S.) Jack! Jack! 
LRRH (O.S.) Jack! Then the BAKER, the BAKER'S WIFE and LRRH appear, still looking for JACK. They come to a halt. 
BAKER We're never going to find him. 
WIFE We should fan out. It'll increase our chances. 
BAKER No. You can't be on your own. 
WIFE I'll be all right. 
BAKER What if we get lost? 
WIFE We'll count our steps from right here. 
LRRH I'll go, too. 
WIFE No. You stay with the baby. The WIFE hands LRRH the baby and sits her down. 
BAKER (pulling her aside) You would leave our son with her? 
WIFE Yes. He's asleep. He'll be safe with the girl. 
LRRH 
(ASSUMING MATURITY) I am very capable of caring for the baby. 
WIFE See? 
BAKER But what if the Giant comes back... 
WIFE What if, what if! Five hundred paces. Go! The WIFE turns and starts walking. 
WIFE (CONT'D) One, two... The BAKER stops her. He unties his SCARF. 
BAKER Wait! Take this. It might be cold. 
The BAKER wraps his scarf around her neck and looks at her, reluctant to let her go alone. The WIFE turns away and begins to count her steps as she walks off. The BAKER goes off in the opposite direction. 
WIFE/BAKER 
(OVERLAPPING) One...two...three...four... 
EXT. WOODS - ROOT HOLLOW - DUSK 
The PRINCE is watering his horse in a GIANT footprint. The WIFE enters counting. 
WIFE One eighty-one...one eighty-two... one eighty-three... one eighty-four... (looks up; startled; 
(BOWS) Hello, Your Royal Highness. 
C'S PRINCE Hello. 
WIFE You must be here to slay the Giant. 
C'S PRINCE The Giant? 
WIFE Yes. Surely you've heard there is a giant in our midst. 
(BEAT) Not an earthquake... 
C'S PRINCE Of course. A giant. 
WIFE Yes, it's a lady giant. Unusual, huh? 
C'S PRINCE I should think. And why are you alone in the woods? 
WIFE I came with my husband. We were ... well you see ... it's a long story. 
C'S PRINCE He would let you roam alone in the woods? 
WIFE No, actually it was my choice. 
C'S PRINCE How brave. 
WIFE Brave? 
C'S PRINCE Yes./ ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE 
WOODS./ MAY I KISS YOU?/ ANY MOMENT WE 
COULD BE CRUSHED. 
CHILD, BACK TO HUSBAND,/ NO ONE LIVES 
IN THE WOODS./ THERE ARE VOWS, THERE 
ARE TIES,/ THERE ARE NEEDS, THERE ARE 
STANDARDS,/ THERE ARE SHOULDN'TS AND 
SHOULDS. (she stops for a 
MOMENT) 
(MORE) 
WIFE (CONT'D) 
WHY NOT BOTH INSTEAD?/ THERE'S THE 
ANSWER, IF YOU'RE CLEVER:/ HAVE A 
CHILD FOR WARMTH/ AND A BAKER FOR 
BREAD,/ AND A PRINCE FOR WHATEVER--/ 
NEVER!/ IT'S THESE WOODS. She begins retracing her steps. 
WIFE (CONT'D) 
(SHE CONTINUES) 
FACE THE FACTS, FIND THE BOY,/ JOIN 
THE GROUP, STOP THE GIANT,/ JUST GET 
OUT OF THESE WOODS./ WAS THAT HIM? YES 
IT WAS./ WAS THAT ME? NO, IT WASN'T,/ 
JUST A TRICK OF THE WOODS. 
JUST A MOMENT,/ ONE PECULIAR PASSING 
MOMENT... 
MUST IT ALL BE EITHER LESS OR MORE,/ 
EITHER PLAIN OR GRAND?/ IS IT ALWAYS 
"OR"?/ IS IT NEVER "AND"?/ THAT'S WHAT 
WOODS ARE FOR:/ FOR THOSE MOMENTS IN 
THE WOODS. She stops to catch her breath and make sure she's on the right path. 
WIFE (CONT'D) 
OH, IF LIFE WERE MADE OF MOMENTS,/ 
EVEN NOW AND THEN A BAD ONE--!/ BUT IF 
LIFE WERE ONLY MOMENTS,/ THEN YOU'D 
NEVER KNOW YOU HAD ONE. (on the move again) 
FIRST A WITCH, THEN A CHILD,/ THEN A 
PRINCE, THEN A MOMENT--/ WHO CAN LIVE 
IN THE WOODS?/ AND TO GET WHAT YOU 
WISH,/ ONLY JUST FOR A MOMENT--/ THESE 
ARE DANGEROUS WOODS... 
LET THE MOMENT GO./ DON'T FORGET IT 
FOR A MOMENT, THOUGH./ The WIFE looks in the direction of where the C-PRINCE exited. 
WIFE (CONT'D) 
JUST REMEMBERING YOU'VE HAD AN "AND,"/ 
WHEN YOU'RE BACK TO "OR"/ She looks down to the BAKER'S scarf and pulls it from her waist. 
WIFE (CONT'D) 
MAKES THE "OR" MEAN MORE/ THAN IT DID 
BEFORE./ NOW I UNDERSTAND--/ AND IT'S 
TIME TO LEAVE THE WOODS! With newfound determination to return to her husband, she ties the scarf around her neck and begins to trace her steps 
BACK: 
WIFE (CONT'D) One eighty-four... one eighty-three... one eighty-two... 
She stops. An ominous expression crosses her face. We begin to hear the pounding steps of the GIANT moving closer. The WIFE scrambles up a steep incline trying to find a way to get out of the GIANT'S path. She makes it to the top, but realizes there is no way down on the other side. As the GIANT'S footsteps near, the WIFE is engulfed in darkness. Trees begin to fall around her and as the earth shakes, she loses her balance and falls backwards with a scream. 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT 
The BAKER is pacing back and forth. CINDERELLA is tending to the BABY. LRRH sits staring sadly into space. 
BAKER She should be back by now. 
LRRH She wouldn't get lost. 
CINDERELLA I'm sure she'll return. 
BAKER No, I must go and look for her-- They hear a commotion. It's the WITCH, who has JACK by the scruff of the neck. 
WITCH Look who I found! 
JACK You're hurting me! The WITCH continues pulling the boy along. 
BAKER Let go of him! 
WITCH I'll let go of him when I give him to the Giant. 
JACK Make her stop! 
LRRH Leave him alone! LRRH goes to try and pull JACK away from the WITCH. A tussle ensues, and the BAKER notices that JACK has dropped something. He goes over and picks up his SCARF. 
WITCH 
IT'S HIS FATHER'S FAULT/ THAT THE 
CURSE GOT PLACED/ AND THE PLACE GOT 
CURSED/ IN THE FIRST PLACE! 
LRRH 
OH./ THEN IT'S HIS FAULT! 
WITCH 
SO. 
CINDERELLA 
IT WAS HIS FAULT. 
JACK 
NO. 
BAKER 
YES, IT IS,/ IT'S HIS. 
CINDERELLA 
I GUESS... 
JACK 
(TO CINDERELLA) 
WAIT A MINUTE, THOUGH--/ I CHOPPED 
DOWN THE BEANSTALK,/ RIGHT? THAT'S 
CLEAR./ BUT WITHOUT ANY BEANSTALK,/ 
THEN WHAT'S QUEER/ IS HOW DID THE 
SECOND GIANT GET DOWN HERE/ IN THE 
FIRST PLACE?/ SECOND PLACE... 
CINDERELLA 
YES! 
LRRH 
HOW? 
BAKER 
HMM... 
JACK 
WELL,/ WHO HAD THE OTHER BEAN? 
BAKER 
THE OTHER BEAN? 
CINDERELLA 
THE OTHER BEAN? 
JACK 
YOU POCKETED THE OTHER BEAN. 
BAKER 
I DIDN'T!/ YES, I DID. 
LRRH 
SO IT'S YOUR FAULT--! 
BAKER 
NO, IT ISN'T/ `CAUSE I GAVE IT TO MY 
WIFE! 
LRRH 
SO IT'S HER FAULT--! 
BAKER 
NO, IT ISN'T! 
CINDERELLA 
THEN WHOSE IS IT? 
BAKER 
(TO CINDERELLA) 
WAIT A MINUTE!/ SHE EXCHANGED THAT 
BEAN/ TO OBTAIN YOUR SHOE,/ SO THE ONE 
WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED/ TO THE BEAN 
IS YOU! Moving on CINDERELLA. 
CINDERELLA 
YOU MEAN THAT OLD BEAN/ THAT YOUR WIFE 
--? OH, DEAR--/ BUT I NEVER KNEW,/ AND 
SO I THREW--/ WELL, DON'T LOOK HERE! 
YES, IF YOU HADN'T RAISED THEM IN THE 
FIRST PLACE--! They turn to the WITCH who has her back to them. 
LRRH/BAKER CINDERELLA 
RIGHT! IT'S YOU WHO RAISED YOU RAISED THE BEANS IN THE 
THE BEANS IN THE FIRST PLACE-- FIRST PLACE! 
JACK (CONT'D) 
IT'S YOUR FAULT! 
CINDERELLA/JACK/LRRH/BAKER (charging the WITCH) 
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE!/ YOU'RE THE ONE TO 
BLAME!/ IT'S YOUR FAULT! The WITCH turns on them. She is holding the BAKER'S BABY in her arms. 
WITCH Shhhhhhh! 
IT'S THE LAST MIDNIGHT./ IT'S THE LAST 
WISH./ IT'S THE LAST MIDNIGHT,/ SOON 
IT WILL BE BOOM--/ SQUISH! 
TOLD A LITTLE LIE,/ STOLE A LITTLE 
GOLD,/ BROKE A LITTLE VOW,/ DID YOU? 
HAD TO GET YOUR PRINCE,/ HAD TO GET 
YOUR COW,/ HAD TO GET YOUR WISH,/ 
DOESN'T MATTER HOW--/ ANYWAY IT 
DOESN'T MATTER NOW. She thrusts the BABY into the BAKER'S arms. 
WITCH (CONT'D) 
IT'S THE LAST MIDNIGHT,/ IT'S THE BOOM 
--/ SPLAT!/ NOTHING BUT A VAST 
MIDNIGHT,/ EVERYBODY SMASHED FLAT! 
NOTHING WE CAN DO--/ NOT EXACTLY 
TRUE:/ WE CAN ALWAYS GIVE HER THE BOY. She lunges for JACK, but LRRH and CINDERELLA put themselves in her path. 
WITCH (CONT'D) 
NO?/ NO, OF COURSE WHAT REALLY MATTERS 
IS THE BLAME,/ SOMEONE YOU CAN BLAME./ 
FINE, IF THAT'S THE THING YOU ENJOY,/ 
PLACING THE BLAME,/ IF THAT'S THE 
AIM,/ GIVE ME THE BLAME--/ JUST GIVE 
ME THE BOY. 
LRRH/CINDERELLA 
NO! 
WITCH No?/ YOU'RE SO NICE./ YOU'RE NOT 
GOOD,/ YOU'RE NOT BAD,/ YOU'RE JUST 
NICE./ I'M NOT GOOD,/ I'M NOT NICE,/ 
I'M JUST RIGHT./ I'M THE WITCH./ 
YOU'RE THE WORLD.

IT'S THE LAST MIDNIGHT,/ SO GOODBYE, 
ALL./ COMING AT YOU FAST, MIDNIGHT--/ 
SOON YOU'LL SEE THE SKY FALL. She pulls out some BEANS from her satchel and THROWS them to the ground where they flash upon impact. She knows that losing the beans will be her end. The OTHERS scramble to pick them up. 
WITCH (CONT'D) 
HERE, YOU WANT A BEAN?/ HAVE ANOTHER 
BEAN./ BEANS WERE MADE FOR MAKING YOU 
RICH!/ PLANT THEM AND THEY SOAR--/ 
HERE, YOU WANT SOME MORE?/ LISTEN TO 
THE ROAR:/ GIANTS BY THE SCORE--!/ OH 
WELL, YOU CAN BLAME ANOTHER WITCH. 
IT'S THE LAST MIDNIGHT,/ IT'S THE LAST 
VERSE./ NOW, BEFORE IT'S PAST 
MIDNIGHT,/ I'M LEAVING YOU MY LAST 
CURSE:/ I'M LEAVING YOU ALONE./ YOU 
CAN TEND THE GARDEN, IT'S YOURS./ 
LRRH/JACK 
OUR SIDE. 
CINDERELLA/BAKER 
OUR SIDE./ SOMEONE ELSE IS NOT./ WHILE 
WE'RE SEEING OUR SIDE-- 
LRRH/JACK 
OUR SIDE-- 
CINDERELLA/BAKER 
OUR SIDE-- 
ALL FOUR 
MAYBE WE FORGOT:/ THEY ARE NOT ALONE./ 
NO ONE IS ALONE. 
SOMEONE IS ON YOUR SIDE--/ NO ONE IS 
ALONE-- They're interrupted by the ominous sounds of the approaching 
GIANT. 
LRRH Here she comes! 
ANGLE ON JACK AND THE BAKER. 
BAKER Go, Jack! Be careful. 
ANGLE ON THE GIANT'S FEET Destroying everything in its path. ANGLE ON JACK, as he scurries up higher in the tree. 
WIDE SHOT The GIANT approaches LRRH and CINDERELLA. 
GIANT Where is the boy? 
LRRH We have him. 
GIANT Where? 
LRRH 
(POINTS) He's hiding in that tree! JACK pops up and reveals himself at the top of the tree. 
JACK Here I am! The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK. JACK and the BAKER load their slings. 
BAKER (calling up to JACK) Ready? 
JACK Ready! ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path. Suddenly, she steps into the expanse of the tar pit, which slowly stops her in her tracks. She fights to free herself as she begins to sink. 
SERIES OF SHOTS -- The BIRDS fly from the trees. -- BAKER'S POV through the tree branches as the BIRDS swarm around the head of the GIANT. -- CINDERELLA and LRRH watch and hear the GIANT'S screams. 
CINDERELLA Good birds! 
LRRH She doesn't look happy. -- the BAKER and JACK use their slings to fire stones at the 
GIANT. -- JACK shimmies to the end of a high limb for better aim. -- The GIANT reaches blindly towards JACK. 
LRRH (CONT'D) Look out Jack! -- The GIANT seizes hold of the branch where JACK is standing which knocks JACK off. JACK catches himself on the way down, grabbing the branch, and hangs on for dear life. Using one hand, JACK whirls his sling and delivers a knock-out blow to the GIANT'S forehead. -- The GIANT reacts and begins to sway. BAKER'S POV of the GIANT'S eye as she fall towards him. The GIANT'S hand grabs some tree branches, as she fights for her balance. We hear the crackling branches as the GIANT FALLS pulling the tree down with her, snapping it in a final deafening THUD. 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
CINDERELLA and LRRH run around the gigantic, exposed roots. 
CINDERELLA Where are they? 
LRRH Jack? Mr. Baker? 
CINDERELLA Jack? 
JACK Over here! 
LRRH Jack! 
LRRH (CONT'D) 
(TO LRRH) Will you take him. LRRH takes the BABY as CINDERELLA helps JACK out of the tree roots. 
CINDERELLA Oh, be careful, are you alright? 
JACK Where is he? 
CINDERELLA He's not with you? 
LRRH Mr. Baker? All three feverishly look for him. 
BAKER Jack, Jack! 
JACK Help me. Help me! 
BAKER Jack, I'm here. CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER, breathless, crawls out from beneath its grasp. He is scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY from 
LRRH. 
CINDERELLA Let me take him. 
BAKER (To Jack then LRRH) Are you okay? Are you alright? We did it! We did it! Come here. They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen tree. 
BAKER (CONT'D) Now we can all return home. 
JACK What home? I have no one to take care of me. 
LRRH (to the BAKER) And we have nowhere to go, so we'll move in with you. 
BAKER 
WELL -- He hesitates then: 
BAKER (CONT'D) -- of course you can come home with me. 
JACK 
(TO CINDERELLA) And you can come, too. 
BAKER If you want to.

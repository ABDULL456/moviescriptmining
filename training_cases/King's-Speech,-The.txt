THE KING'S SPEECH 
Written by 
David Seidler 
OPEN ON: 
1   INT. BATHROOM, YORK HOUSE, LONDON - DAY (MID-1930'S)              1 
A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs - bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's "Trumpet Volunteer". 
A head emerges. 
White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing naked wet body in white towels. 
2   INT.    DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY                        2 
The ritual continues with crisp military precision. 
CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp, thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown. 
This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white shirt. 
Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet and gartered legs to be inserted. 
Mirror-polished boots are laced tight. 
Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received. 
Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling field of ribbons and medallions. 
Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted. 
Polished buttons are fastened. 
Multi-coloured collar clasped shut. 
White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed and placed upon brilliantined hair. 
PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which he's been bedecked. 
Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    3. 
BERTIE You look like a Christmas tree. 
He smiles wanly. 
3   EXT.    INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY            3 
THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill. 
Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess. 
Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH - considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land, truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously, creating a happy chaos. 
Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave. 
Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and four, wave back from their nursery window. 
4   INT/EXT.    AUSTIN PRINCESS, HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY                 4 
Bertie nervously lights a cigarette.    Elizabeth pats his hand. 
ELIZABETH Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't rain. 
BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators, prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs, agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of the day. 
A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants. 
REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back. 
The first drops splatter against the glass.      Elizabeth sighs. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Never trust the wireless. 
Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour, which segues into a GARGLING sound. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     4. 
5   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                                5 
A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb, and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the control room. 
The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three... two... 
LIONEL (CONT'D) "How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees?" 
ELIZABETH Pardon? 
LIONEL Iago...world's greatest villain. Just wants to be bad. Sorry, no receptionist. 
He offers to shake hands.    She doesn't take it, even though she's gloved. 
ELIZABETH (with sang froid) I'd be more comfortable in your office. 
LIONEL That's for clients. Where's Mister J? 
ELIZABETH He doesn't know I'm here. 
LIONEL That's not a promising start. 
ELIZABETH My husband's seen everyone. They were all useless. He's given up hope. 
LIONEL A bit premature. 
ELIZABETH Because he hasn't seen you? 
Lionel doesn't disgree. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) You're very sure of yourself. 
LIONEL I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured. 
ELIZABETH Of course my husband wants to be cured! His position requires public speaking upon occasion. A torment. I fear the requirement may grow more frequent. 
LIONEL He should change jobs. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     8. 
ELIZABETH He can't. 
LIONEL Indentured servitude? 
ELIZABETH Something of that nature. 
LIONEL Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his personal history. I'll make a frank appraisal. 
ELIZABETH Doctor... 
Logue tries to object but she over-rides. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) ...I do not have a "hubby". We never talk about our private lives. Nor do we `pop'. You must come to us. 
LIONEL Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf, by my rules. 
The lady lifts her veil. 
ELIZABETH Perhaps you'll make an exception? 
He recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet refuses to be intimidated. 
LIONEL I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"? 
ELIZABETH A name used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't wish the enemy to know His Royal Highness was aboard. 
LIONEL I'm considered the enemy? 
ELIZABETH You will be, should you continue to be un- obliging. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  9. 
LIONEL For my method to succeed there must be mutual trust, complete honesty, and total equality. That process takes place in my consultation room. No exceptions. 
ELIZABETH In which case... (re-lowering her veil) I should have kept my pledge. I promised my husband I'd stop seeking "The Great Cure." I've wasted your time. And mine. 
She exits, closing the door firmly behind her. 
LIONEL Bloody hell, I buggered that. 
WACK! The sound of something solid meeting leather. 
11   EXT.    SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON              11 
A foot kicks a ball. Lionel is returning home from work. He's a well-known fixture locally. Some lads are playing footie. One of them passes the ball to Lionel who, despite briefcase and rolled brolly, dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and entering a modest brownstone. 
12   INT.    LOGUE'S ENTRYWAY AND STAIRWELL - LATE AFTERNOON       12 
As Lionel mounts the stairs he's set upon by three sturdy boys - VALENTINE, IAN, and PETER - with handkerchiefs tied around the lower portions of their faces and armed with broomstick swords. 
VALENTINE Stand and deliver! 
LIONEL (falling into the game) `ow dares molest...Jack The Ripper?! 
BERTIE Can I be a penguin instead? 
He drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like a penguin. The girls giggle, but are undeterred. 
LILIBET The horsie story, please. 
BERTIE Ah well. 
Called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. But the two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor impediment, and it fades. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) Once upon a time there were two horsies. A white horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The white horse said "neigh". The black horse said, "neigh". The white horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. The black horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the end of the story. Now off to bed. 
As the girls exit: 
LILIBET A silly story really. But Father tells it rather well. 
The girls have gone. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                               13. 
BERTIE David called. He said come round to The Fort on Friday and stay for dinner. 
ELIZABETH Will she be there? 
BERTIE I suppose. 
ELIZABETH Seriously? 
BERTIE Seriously, she'll be there. 
ELIZABETH I think I meant... is David serious? 
BERTIE About our coming? 
ELIZABETH About her! 
BERTIE A married American? Twice divorced? He can't be. 
ELIZABETH She can. 
15   INT. STAGE OF A LONDON THEATRE - NEW DAY                15 
Movements behind a curtain. 
MUFFLED VOICE (UNSEEN) Now? 
From the auditorium: 
DIRECTOR Now! 
Someone pushes through a gap. Its Lionel. 
LIONEL "Now..." 
Falters, begins again. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    14. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) "Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York..." 
His elocution is crisp and flawless. His acting, however, is unconvincing. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) "And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths..." 
DIRECTOR (interrupts crisply) Thank you. Beautiful diction...but I don't hear the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King. 
Lionel struggles to maintain a semblance of dignity. 
LIONEL What do you suggest? 
DIRECTOR Continue to do whatever you do, and hope it gives you a great deal of satisfaction. 
Crushed, Lionel retreats behind the curtain. 
16   EXT.   BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW EVENING                         16 
Cold and austere mausoleum illuminated by floodlights. 
On the parade ground, Grenadier Guards in red coats and black bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers. Viewing stands are beginning to fill. 
The King's voice is heard: 
KING GEORGE V (O.S.) Stride boldly up to the bloody thing, stare it square in the eye, and talk to it as you would to any decent Englishman. 
17   INT. THE KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - EVENING             17 
The King's study resembles a naval captain's cabin. Both men are uniformed for a state occasion. Bertie regards the BBC microphone as though it were an alien. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    15. 
ELIZABETH You know perfectly well. 
As they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads: PRINCE OF WALES TELLS MINERS "SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!" 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Neglects to tell them what must be done, how its to be done, and who's to do it. 
BERTIE David has `the touch'. They adore him. 
As the Austin halts for lights, people stare to see who's inside. Some point. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) I'll wager they're saying: There's the useless one who can't speak. 
23   INT. LOGUE'S WAITING ROOM - DAY                                23 
Bertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   19. 
ELIZABETH There's no receptionist. 
Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (loudly) The Johnsons. 
From the inner office. 
LIONEL (O.S.) Not finished yet. 
Elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav. 
BERTIE How'd you find this physician? 
ELIZABETH (poker-faced) Classifieds; next to "Saucy model, Shepherd's Market". 
Bertie smiles despite his mood. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Comes highly recommended. Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor. (realizes) Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?! 
BERTIE I'm not sure I want to see this fellow. 
ELIZABETH I'm not sure he wants to see you. 
The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman - ANNA - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are. She retreats rapidly back into the consulting room. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Perhaps this was a mistake. 
After an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be properly formal, and stutters: 
ANNA You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson". 
BERTIE I'm not actually Mr ... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   20. 
ANNA (whispers, terrified) I know. (then to Elizabeth) Dr Logue says... 
LIONEL (O.S.) Lionel! 
ANNA Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it being a pleasant day, take a stroll. (to the consultation room) Was that alright? 
LIONEL (O.S.) Bloody marvellous. 
ANNA (choking up) Thank you...Lionel. 
Anna flees quickly. 
LIONEL (O.S.) Mr. Johnson, do come in. 
The Yorks look at each other. 
24   INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                        24 
A totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Recording apparatus. The walls are pearl grey and smoky blue. 
BERTIE My wife's favorite colours. 
Here, in a doctor's office, Bertie's stutter returns. 
LIONEL Glad we have something in common. 
Bertie's head bangs into one of the models. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) My lads build them. Make yourself comfortable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    21. 
BERTIE Please... 
LIONEL What? 
BERTIE I beg your pardon? 
LIONEL First recollection of the world? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     24. 
BERTIE (stutter growing in intensity) I'm not here to discuss personal matters. 
LIONEL Why're you here then? 
BERTIE (exploding) Because I bloody well stutter! And you bloody well can't fix it!!! 
LIONEL Temper. 
BERTIE One of my numerous faults. 
LIONEL Do you stutter when you think? 
BERTIE Don't be ridiculous. 
LIONEL One of my many faults. How about when you talk to yourself? 
BERTIE I don't talk to myself! 
LIONEL Come on, everyone natters to themselves once in a while, Bertie. 
BERTIE Stop calling me that! 
LIONEL Shan't call you anything else. 
BERTIE Then we shan't speak! 
Silence. The jug has boiled.    Lionel makes himself a cup of tea. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) Must I pay for this? 
LIONEL Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do you stutter? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   25. 
BERTIE Of course not! 
LIONEL Proving your impediment isn't a permanent internal fixture. 
BERTIE When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!! 
LIONEL Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly, right here, right now. 
BERTIE (bitterly) Easy money. You're on. 
LIONEL See your shilling then. 
BERTIE Royals don't carry money. 
LIONEL How convenient. 
Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) I'll stake you. Pay me back next time. 
BERTIE If there is a next time. 
LIONEL Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on. 
During this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording device with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open book. Bertie glares at it defiantly. 
BERTIE I certainly can't read The Bard. 
LIONEL `Easy money'. 
Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse. 
BERTIE "To be or not to be, That is the question. Whether it is wiser..." There! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     26. 
Reaches for the coin. 
LIONEL Not so fast. 
BERTIE I proved I can't read. 
LIONEL You proved you can't listen. 
Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones.    Bertie doesn't want to take them. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) A princely bob is at stake. 
Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. Logue turns a dial. LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music stops. 
BERTIE What's your Myrtle got to do with me? Elizabeth doesn't much care for you either, but here I am. 
LIONEL That woman has style. 
BERTIE Which is why she dislikes you. You're far too familiar. (referring to the consultation room) May we discuss this properly? 
44   INT.   LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS                 44 
They enter: 
LIONEL You look dreadful. 
BERTIE Another example of exactly the sort of thing you don't say to a Royal. And you're too close. 
LIONEL But you're not Royal in this room. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    40. 
BERTIE Which is precisely why Elizabeth dislikes you. 
He starts to sit. 
LIONEL Not there! 
CRUNCH.   A model airplane was nestling in the armchair. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Curtis bi-plane, now a Curtis mono-wing. 
BERTIE Oh I say, I'm terribly sorry. Tell your lads I'll buy a new one. 
Lionel takes out the box of model building gear the boys left. 
LIONEL You don't have any money. I'll fix it. So, Bertie, what brings you here? Your father's death? 
Bertie is silent. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Mine lay rigid, fists clenched angrily at his sides, daring the Reaper: take me, you bastard! 
BERTIE What was he angry about? 
LIONEL I was a great disappointment. 
BERTIE Thought he'd be proud of you. 
LIONEL So did I. 
BERTIE A man of stature? 
LIONEL A clerk. 
BERTIE Oh. (pause) (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   41. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) I was informed, after the fact, my father's last words were: "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together." (pause) Couldn't say that to my face. (then) Your mother? 
LIONEL Coughed herself to death when I was young. 
BERTIE Oh. 
LIONEL I remember going to the theatre with her. Not real theatre...traveling players. 
BERTIE I've been to Australia. 
LIONEL Not where I lived. 
BERTIE (blurts) My brother. That's why I'm here. 
LIONEL What's he done? 
BERTIE Can't say. 
LIONEL I'm going home now. 
BERTIE You must undersand, I can't puh-puh-puh... 
His jaw and throat muscles constrict. 
LIONEL Try singing it. 
BERTIE Pardon? 
LIONEL Know any songs? 
BERTIE "Swanee River". TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  42. 
LIONEL Very modern. 
LIONEL Now dope the other wing. Did David tease you? 
BERTIE They all did. "Buh-buh-buh-Bertie". Father encouraged it. "Spit it out, boy!" Thought it would make me stop. Is this necessary?! 
LIONEL Otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue. 
BERTIE I mean the damn questions! 
LIONEL Mandatory. Tell me more about your storybook childhood. What was your earliest memory? 
BERTIE You asked that before. 
LIONEL This time I'd like an answer. 
BERTIE Being born. 
LIONEL How can you remember that? 
BERTIE December 14th. 
LIONEL I don't understand. 
BERTIE "Mausoleum Day". Prince Albert departed on that date. I was named Bertie to placate Great Grandmamma Victoria. In return, she hated me because it reminded her of her grief. (stutter growing in intensity) (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   46. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) Let's stick to medical history please. I'm naturally left handed, which was considered inappropriate. 
LIONEL And? 
BERTIE I was punished. Now I'm right handed. 
LIONEL Anything else? 
BERTIE Bandy legs. Also considered inappropriate. 
Lionel waits. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) Metal splints were made...worn night and day...very painful. Now I have straight legs. This is so...tawdry! I need your services as a Speech Therapist, not Grand Inquisitor. Are you available? Or will it be: "Myrtle says no?" 
LIONEL You sound angry. 
BERTIE Yes, I told you, I have a temper. 
LIONEL Angry at me, or at your brother? 
Bertie remains stubbornly silent.    Then blurts: 
BERTIE He's fallen in love! 
LIONEL How dreadful. 
BERTIE With the wrong sort of woman! 
LIONEL What's wrong with her? 
BERTIE She's American. 
LIONEL Some of them must be lovable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   47. 
BERTIE This one's divorced. Twice. Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore. I want David to be happy, but the family, the Church, the nation, won't have it. 
LIONEL Can't they fornicate privately like adults? 
BERTIE If only! David used to prefer married women because there was no possible attachment. But now... 
LIONEL "Queen Wallis of Baltimore"? 
BERTIE Please. 
LIONEL Does sound a bit iffy. 
BERTIE I made a smudge! 
LIONEL Touch it up. 
BERTIE You want me to beg for help? 
LIONEL I advise you never to beg. Especially if you might be King. 
BERTIE Don't say that! 
LIONEL I see. For reasons you cannot disclose, fearing ramifications you will not explain, you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith? You already owe me a shilling. 
Bertie takes a coin out of his pocket, hesitates, then offers it to Logue. 
53   INT. LOGUE'S STUDY - NEW DAY                               53 
Bertie stands shattered, lost in his painful memory. 
BERTIE I couldn't say anything! 
LIONEL You could've refused. Don't you know any rude words? 
BERTIE What a bloody stupid question! I just said one. Bloody. Bloodybloodybloody! 
LIONEL Perhaps a touch more vulgar? 
BERTIE Certainly not. 
LIONEL To prove you know how. 
BERTIE Bugger! 
LIONEL A public school prig could do better. 
BERTIE Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard! 
LIONEL Hardly robust. 
BERTIE Shit then. Shit, shit, shit! 
LIONEL See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue? You don't stutter when you swear. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                 57. 
BERTIE Because I'm angry! 
LIONEL Get angry more often. Do you know the f- word? 
BERTIE Fornication? 
LIONEL Oh Bertie... 
BERTIE Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck! 
LIONEL Bravissimo! Now a resounding chorus of... 
BERTIE Bloody, bloody. bloody! Shit, shit, shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck! 
A pounding on the wall. 
MYRTLE (O.S.) We have children...! 
BERTIE (whispers) This is your fault! 
LIONEL Sorry, pet! Won't happen again! 
MYRTLE (O.S.) I should hope not! 
BERTIE Apologies, Mrs. Logue. 
LIONEL First time I've heard you laugh. 
BERTIE Royals aren't allowed emotions in public. 
LIONEL Which explains a lot. 
Bertie is in no mood to be provoked. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    58. 
BERTIE What do you want me to do, dammit!? Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta?! 
LIONEL Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed. 
Without thinking, Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie supportively on the shoulder. 
Bertie pulls back in offended shock.   All the warning signals instilled in him are going off. 
BERTIE Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous man, Logue. Who sent you? 
LIONEL Anyone in mind? 
BERTIE The lurking shadows. Courtiers and peers...the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased. 
LIONEL Your wife was the one who sought me out. 
BERTIE Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me! 
LIONEL But you don't share her belief? Why come here? 
BERTIE I'm beginning to ask myself that very same question. Your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, Doctor Logue. 
LIONEL First class. 
A long pause as Myrtle digests this. 
MYRTLE What about your... 
LIONEL Willie's a problem...not much progress. The others have been referred. 
MYRTLE What'll you do when we get home? 
LIONEL Try not to act the toff. Teach perhaps. 
MYRTLE You could... 
LIONEL No! I'm not good enough! 
MYRTLE You gave it a try, Lionel. 
LIONEL Yes, I had a go. Thanks to your patience. (grief overwhelms him) I just bloody well wasn't good enough! 
MYRTLE (studying the tickets) Oh Lionel! This must've cost you. 
CHOP!   CHOP!    CHOP! The sound of an axe. 
56   EXT.    GROUNDS AND TERRACE, BALMORAL - NEW DAY                 56 
A woodsman's axe CHOPS into the thick trunk of a massive tree. 
Nearby, a bulldozer cuts into the green turf and rich soil. 
The felling and earth removal are being watched by Churchill and Lang from a distant terrace. In the background a jazz band in white tuxedos syncopates pertly. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    63. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Five hundred year old oaks! Part of the hill! Removed to improve the view! 
COSMO LANG How ever does she do it? 
Inside the ballroom, seem through open French doors, an afternoon dance is being held. Churchill and Lang look in. 
57   INT.   BALLROOM, BALMORAL - CONTINUOUS                       57 
At the epicenter, a dashing couple: David, the very picture of insouciance, and clinging to his arm, dripping in jewelry, a rather small, angular, dark haired woman, with a high brow and square jaw - MRS WALLIS SIMPSON. Her most attractive physical feature is her back, displayed fully by a dress that plunges to her nates. Surrounded by their entourage, they are the apex of chic. 
Watching from the sidelines: 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Erotic sexual techniques beyond polite imagination? I realize of course, that may be outside your personal experience. 
Winston exchanges his empty champagne flute for a full one from the tray of a passing footman. 
COSMO LANG You've the Devil in you today. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL If anyone should know, it would be Your Grace. 
COSMO LANG All aspects of mankind are within my venue. Did you know, HM has trouble with his glands? 
Churchill almost chokes on his champagne. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL I'd not appreciated Your Grace was so well versed concerning things testicular! 
COSMO LANG They were severely damaged by the measles when HM and his brother were naval cadets. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    64. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL A veritable encyclopedic font of scatological information. 
COSMO LANG Apparently it affects the quality, although not the quantity, of HM's endeavors. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL And the brother? 
COSMO LANG Unscathed. Two daughters. I shepherd my flock in all matters, Winston, including multiplication. 
They make their way inside. In the distance an Austin Princess can be seen making its way up the stately tree-line avenue. 
58   INT.   AUSTIN PRINCESS, BALMORAL ESTATE - CONTINUOUS         58 
Bertie and Elizabeth are dressed for the party. 
BERTIE We must try to be pleasant. 
ELIZABETH Your father not dead six months, and That Woman throws, "A garden potty." P-o-t-t-y. She's sleeping in your mother's bedroom. And I know perfectly well she calls me `the Dowdy Duchess", and "Cookie". 
59   INT.   BALLROOM, BALMORAL - DAY                              59 
At the buffet table Churchill helps himself copiously. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Has it occurred to you, as it has only occurred to me, that a Monarch with a gland problem, who realizes he cannot produce issue, might not wish to be King...? knowing his lack of issue may well become a major issue indeed. 
DAVID He's much maligned. By the Jews, according to Wallis. And she's very clever about politics. 
BERTIE The man's a monster! Our position must remain clear. 
DAVID Why's that, old chap? 
BERTIE We are a German family! 
DAVID Didn't bother anyone during WWI. And Kaiser Willie was our uncle. 
BERTIE Because we took an English name! Windsor. Because we are England. We are the heart and soul of this nation. That must never change. 
DAVID Are you already in charge? 
BERTIE I'm trying to warn you. 
DAVID Am I being threatened? 
BERTIE David, your role is to consult and to be advised. 
DAVID Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution. 
BERTIE Sounds like you haven't. 
DAVID I won't be a lackey to an unwashed politician like Stanley Baldwin! 
BERTIE He's your Prime Minister. 
DAVID And I'm his King! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   69. 
BERTIE If you refuse to listen to our Government, they have no choice but to resign. 
DAVID I'll form another. There's Winston. He'd love to be P.M. We'll create a King's Party. 
BERTIE To fight a general election in which your marriage is the only topic? 
DAVID I'd risk anything and everything for Wallis. Don't I have rights? 
BERTIE Privileges. 
DAVID Not the same thing. 
BERTIE No. 
DAVID Yet an ordinary man may marry for love. 
BERTIE We're not ordinary men, David! We were bred to be profiles on a coin. If you were ordinary, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?! 
DAVID What's the point then? Just to look posh? You know...your speech is much improved tonight. Hardly a hesitation. Yearning for a larger audience, are we? 
BERTIE Don't say such a thing! 
DAVID Is my young brother trying to push me off the throne? Sounds positively medieval. 
BERTIE I beg of you, don't do this to my wife, my daughters, to me. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     70. 
DAVID The politicians will give in. See you at my Coronation...Bertie. 
The champagne cork finally POPS. He strides off. 
61   EXT.   10 DOWNING STREET - NEW DAY                            61 
Establishing shot of the Prime Minister's residence. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.) Nice of you to invite me to your digs, Stanley. 
62   INT.   BALDWIN'S STUDY, 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY               62 
Baldwin and Churchill are alone together.    No love lost between these two men. 
BALDWIN As you may have guessed... 
Churchill is silent.   Balwin waits, then: 
BALDWIN (CONT'D) ...I intend to resign. The Royal scandal has weakened my position considerably. 
Churchill, on the edge of his seat, can't suppress an anticipatory grin. Baldwin takes pleasure in deflating it. 
BALDWIN (CONT'D) No need to volunteer your services, Winston. Neville Chamberlain will take my place, once this Royal matter is settled. As Chancellor of the Exchequer he already lives next door. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL My opportunity to redecorate will come soon enough, Stanley. 
BALDWIN Will it? Well, enough chit-chat. The question of a morganatic marriage, as a possible solution, has been put to the Dominion Prime Ministers. After all, HM is their King too. 
Elizabeth holds a finger to her lips: shush. 
DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) 
This has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother has one matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of you, and not bestowed on me -- a happy home with his wife and children. 
66   INT. LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT                                  66 
The glow of a radio dial. Lionel and Myrtle sit in armchairs, the radio on a side-table between them. 
DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love. 
Lionel gets up to turn it off as David's voice concludes: 
DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) (CONT'D) We all have a new King. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all! God save the King! 
Logue strokes Myrtle's hair. 
LIONEL I too "married the woman I love." TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   75. 
MYRTLE You married a shop girl. 
LIONEL A wonderful lass. Someone I can talk to heart to heart. 
MYRTLE Using simple words and short sentences. I'm very ordinary. 
LIONEL That's why we're suited. I'm just an ordinary bloke. 
MYRTLE Ordinary? You're a man with wild dreams, Lionel. Mine are so very small. A job, a husband, a home. Raising our sons. That's all I ever wanted. 
LIONEL Me too. 
MYRTLE Is that why, every day, you've spent hours with a man who's about to be King? 
LIONEL That relationship is now past tense. 
MYRTLE Yet, for as long as you could, you did what you wanted. 
LIONEL I wanted to be a great actor. That's what I wanted. 
MYRTLE And failing that... 
LIONEL I certainly failed! 
MYRTLE A great healer. Always...'great'. Where does a shop girl fit in? 
LIONEL Very snugly, into my heart! Always have, always will. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   76. 
MYRTLE Trouble is, Lionel, when you say that, I still believe it. 
67   INT.   INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE - DAY                    67 
The Royal standard on a gleaming car's bonnet. 
Bertie stands uneasily in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet as the driver opens the door. Bertie realizes its a Rolls. 
BERTIE Where's the Austin? 
DRIVER The Palace changed it, Your Highness. 
BERTIE I liked the Austin. 
DRIVER So did I, sir. 
The two girls wave from their open playroom window, and call: 
MARGARET ROSE You look like a chicken. 
LILIBET A rooster. 
He waves, and gets in. 
68   EXT.   ST. JAMES PALACE - THAT DAY                          68 
A formal voice announces: 
MASTER OF THE COUNCIL (O.S.) His Majesty will address the Accession Council and take his oath. 
69   INT.   ANTECHAMBER, ACCESSION COUNCIL - CONTINUOUS          69 
Bertie looks at himself in a full length mirror, making last minute adjustments to his uniform. Staring at his reflection: 
BERTIE How did this happen to you? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     77. 
BERTIE I believe this time a bit of begging might be required. Elizabeth says I must eat humble crow. 
LIONEL Its "crow" or "humble pie". Take your pick. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   80. 
BERTIE (gathering resolve) I was frightened and took refuge in being `Royal'. What I said was unforgivable. And... 
LIONEL And? 
BERTIE (blurts out) What's the one essential thing a King must do? He must believe he is King. How can I possibly do that? For pity sake, Lionel, I beg you: get me through! I'll pay you another shilling. 
LIONEL What're friends for? 
Logue steps aside, letting Bertie in. 
BERTIE I wouldn't know. 
74   INT. LOGUE BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  74 
The double bed is piled high with clothing, a suitcase at its foot. Myrtle is sorting. She hears Lionel enter behind her. At first, she doesn't turn. Lionel remains silent. 
MYRTLE I've got the boys sorting their things. Your office will be a chore... 
Realizing something is amiss, she turns, and knows instantly what Lionel's going to tell her. Her hand goes to her mouth to stifle her emotions. 
75   INT. BERTIE'S STUDY - DAY                                   75 
Bertie is with visitors: Churchill and Lang. There's a slight but discernible change in his demeanor. 
COSMO LANG We asked to see Your Highness because there's the urgent question of what to call your brother. Aside from the obvious. 
Bertie is not pleased with His Grace's joke, but lets it pass. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   81. 
BERTIE What do you suggest? 
COSMO LANG Mr. Edward Windsor? All he deserves. 
BERTIE What has my brother given up on his abdication, other than the throne? 
They look at each other, unsure. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me? He cannot be Mister, as he was born the son of a Duke. Which makes him a Lord at the very least. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Very well, Lord E.W. it is. 
BERTIE And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons. Heading a King's Party. 
COSMO LANG Unacceptable! 
BERTIE So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's Party? Is that acceptable? 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Certainly not. 
BERTIE But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords. 
COSMO LANG (realizing) Oh I say... 
BERTIE The Duke of Windsor it is. Gentlemen. 
He exits abruptly. 
Churchill and Lang gather their things stunned. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    82. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Not exactly a dummy, is he? 
76   EXT.   FACADE OF D.HENRY LTD. LEATHERGOODS, KNIGHTSBRIDGE - DAY 
Myrtle is in the shop window, arranging handbags, luggage, and briefcases. 
77   INT. D.HENRY LTD. - CONTINUOUS                                77 
In the store Myrtle can be seen dressing the window, while in his glass office the OWNER, a portly bald gentleman with a Dickensian air, is deep in concerned conversation with a man in trench-coat. The Owner keeps glancing worriedly in Myrtle's direction. 
The two men nod, shake hands. The fellow in the trench-coat leaves. The owner beckons another shop-girl over and whispers something to her. She heads towards Myrtle. 
BERTIE (O. S.) "Let's go gathering hearty heather with the gay brigade of grand dragons." 
78   INT. LOGUE'S STUDY AND PARLOUR - DAY                          78 
A wall divides the study from the living area, allowing the action in both spaces to be viewed. 
IN THE PARLOUR: Elizabeth waits, ill at ease. 
IN THE STUDY: 
ELIZABETH A previous engagement. 
LIONEL Some other time, love. 
Logue ushers Elizabeth into the study, giving Myrtle a nervous little wave. She glares and exits. 
IN THE STUDY: 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle. 
Bertie stifles a snort. Elizabeth glares at him. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) (to Elizabeth) Good of you to come. 
ELIZABETH Harley Street is far too public. What is my function here? 
LIONEL For me to show you how to pitch in. 
ELIZABETH Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type. 
LIONEL Piece of cake. (to Bertie) Please assume a supine position on the floor. 
ELIZABETH What?! 
LIONEL Firm support is needed. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                      86. 
Bertie dutifully lies on the floor. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now your stomach...deep into the diaphragm. Splendid. How do you feel? 
BERTIE Full of hot air. 
LIONEL Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker. Again... 
Bertie inhales deeply. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) ... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be so kind as to sit on your husband's stomach. 
ELIZABETH Good grief. 
LIONEL Gently of course. 
Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking solicitously: 
ELIZABETH Are you alright, Bertie? 
Bertie nods. 
LIONEL Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed, expanding your chest fully, extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm...and...up comes Princess Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I thought you'd prefer your wife to one of the staff. Now comes the fun part. 
ELIZABETH There's actually more? 
Bertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     87. 
LIONEL You will now shout the vowel sounds, all five of them, as loudly as possible, each to last no less than 15 seconds. There's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be the official timer. 
ELIZABETH Vowel sounds? Shouted at an open window? On a public street? 
LIONEL Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech. 
ELIZABETH They can also be considered quite dotty. Don't even contemplate it! 
BERTIE Sorry, dear, doctor's orders. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... (stops) She's right, those two chaps are staring at me. 
ELIZABETH They're always looking at you. 
LIONEL (startled) You're followed? 
ELIZABETH Royal scrutiny, Doctor, best get used to it. 
BERTIE ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... (to Elizabeth) Are you timing this? iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... ooooooooooooooooooooooooo... uuuuuuuuuuu. 
79   INT.   LOGUE'S DINING ROOM - LATER                            79 
The family eat in tense silence TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  88. 
VALENTINE May we be excused? 
LIONEL No. 
The unhappy meal continues. 
PETER (mumbles) We don't want to hear you fight. 
COSMO LANG They say he has epilepsy. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Patently erroneous. 
COSMO LANG Fragile, prone to illness... 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Some correctness in that. 
COSMO LANG ...and will die prematurely. They predict he'll be unable to complete the Coronation. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL What do you propose? Shorten the ceremony? Or no ceremony at all? 
COSMO LANG My idea exactly! 
WINSTON CHURCHILL I believed so. But what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world. 
COSMO LANG What we need, and what we'll get, may be two rather different things. Did you hear his pathetic attempt at the Accession Council? He'll never be able to speak in public. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL So, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet? Who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war? Who will address the far flung corners of the Empire, rallying all to our defense? 
COSMO LANG Well... 
WINSTON CHURCHILL The Head of our Church? Is that what you have in mind? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   92. 
COSMO LANG Would it be such a calamity? 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Best ask our new King. 
Bertie has entered with Logue. Lang spins around. 
COSMO LANG Your Majesty. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Excuse me, sir, duty calls. 
He exits quickly. Cosmo continues nervously as they walk through the Abbey, the Archbishop pointing out the preparations in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters. 
BERTIE Is this the scene of the crime? 
COSMO LANG What a peculiar thing to say. 
BERTIE Referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners. 
COSMO LANG Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box. I have, however, categorically said no to the BBC's new "radio-with-pictures" gadget. Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms. 
BERTIE Radio with pictures?! 
COSMO LANG It is called..."television". Happily, with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this "TV" thing has no future. We shall, however, be forced to permit cinema; the product of which I shall personally edit. 
BERTIE That'll keep you busy, removing all my stops and starts. 
COSMO LANG Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet ceremony? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   93. 
BERTIE What exactly do you mean? 
COSMO LANG Something...discreet...private. We could pre-record an edited version to be broadcast to the world. Or even find an actor with a similar voice. 
Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows. 
LIONEL A King based upon deception? 
Cosmo takes Bertie aside. 
COSMO LANG If your gentleman from Security would give us space, we could discuss this in private. 
BERTIE You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher?" 
Giving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to Bertie confidentially. 
COSMO LANG Fret not. As I assured our nation in my recent broadcast: "When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech. But to those who hear it, it need cause no sort of embarrassment, for it causes none to him who speaks." You see, I've paved the way. But should you wish to avoid further stress... 
LIONEL Why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins? 
COSMO LANG Pardon?! 
LIONEL If you wish to call attention to his anxiety. 
COSMO LANG Does your bodyguard know to whom he's speaking? He certainly doesn't know his place! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   94. 
BERTIE Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist. 
COSMO LANG Therapist?! I'd no idea! Had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance I would've made my own recommendation. 
BERTIE Dr. Logue is to be present at the Coronation. 
82   INT. AN OFFICE IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT                    82 
Lang is on the phone. The door is open. While talking he watches the work preparations. On the phone he tells someone: 
COSMO LANG I've made inquiries. 
83   INT. LOGUE DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                 83 
Logue enters and sits at the table. Myrtle serves him. 
MYRTLE A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm. 
LIONEL Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely. 
MYRTLE You look done in. 
LIONEL I've news for you. You're coming to the Coronation. 
MYRTLE I've news for you. I'm not! 
LIONEL You must. 
MYRTLE Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse? 
LIONEL Royal Box. You and I. 
Stunned silence, then. 
MYRTLE Lionel...I'd need a new dress. 
LIONEL Rather thought you might. 
Valentine calls from the next room: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     98. 
VALENTINE (O.S.) Dad! Phone! For you! 
LIONEL Won't be a sec. 
He exits. Myrtle waits. Looks at herself, bemused, reflected in a glass-fronted cabinet. Even does a curtsey. 
84   INT.   WESTMINSTER ABBEY - THAT NIGHT                         84 
The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang. He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself: 
COSMO LANG "The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of a King." 
He exits. 
THE CAMERA explores various elements: 
The Throne of Edward the Confessor. 
Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone. 
Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next Coronation rehearsal. 
Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs. 
Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use. 
Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen. 
This Abbey holds the history of a nation. 
Footsteps resonate. 
Lionel enters.   Trips over one of the gravestones. 
LIONEL Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron. Bertie...? 
Lights snap on skewering Lionel. Bertie steps into view wearing a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral. 
BERTIE This is not a rehearsal, "Doctor" Logue. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   99. 
LIONEL Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I wondered when that would happen. And I'd promised Myrtle a new frock. 
BERTIE (barely controlled) "Just call me Lionel"! Never did you call yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No diploma, no training, no credentials. Just a great deal of nerve. 
LIONEL Want to hear my side of the story? 
BERTIE There isn't a "your-side-of-the-story". This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life! 
LIONEL (softly) Wembley Stadium... 
BERTIE Because I have a right to be heard! 
LIONEL Heard as what?! 
BERTIE A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    103. 
LIONEL (quietly) Well then...you're cured. 
BERTIE Stop trying to squirm off the hook. 
LIONEL Bertie, you'll make a bloody good king. And you know it. 
Bertie stares at him. 
A familiar voice is heard from the shadows. 
VOICE Your Majesty? 
The Archbishop of Canterbury. 
COSMO LANG You'll be relieved to learn I've found a replacement specialist. Impeccable credentials. 
There's a long silence. 
BERTIE That won't be necessary. 
COSMO LANG The matter's already been settled. For your own well-being. 
BERTIE What did you say? 
COSMO LANG Your Majesty's function is to consult...and to be advised. You didn't consult, but you've just been advised. 
BERTIE Now I advise you, so listen carefully. ...in this personal matter I will make my own decision. 
COSMO LANG May I remind you, you do not place the crown upon your own head. 
BERTIE And may I remind you, it is my head upon which the crown is placed! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     104. 
COSMO LANG This will end badly. 
Lang turns on his heel. 
Lionel ignores what has just happened. 
LIONEL In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight. And you are King! 
The faint CLICKING WHIR of a film projector is heard. 
85   INT. ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S SCREENING ROOM - NEW DAY      85 
On the screen: archive footage of the Coronation, capturing the pomp and ceremony. Cigar smoke rises up. The voices of Churchill and Lang can be heard. 
COSMO LANG (O.S.) I was much moved 
WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.) There were tears in my eyes too, Your Grace, particularly when I saw you and the Dean of Westminster cannoning into each other. 
COSMO LANG (O.S.) That's been edited. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.) More tears when our new Monarch started towards his throne, only to be brought to an abrupt halt owing to one of the Bishops treading on his robe. 
COSMO LANG (O.S.) To the world, all went splendidly. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels, bobbing tiaras, and heaving bosoms. 
The footage freezes momentarily. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     105. 
COSMO LANG (O.S.) Now, Winston, I have something which will bring tears to your eyes. 
The archive footage continues, but it is not of the Coronation. David and Wallis visiting the Fuhrer in Germany: Hitler gallantly kissing Mrs Simpson's hand while Goring and the Duke of Windsor beam; David giving the Nazi salute. FREEZE FRAME. The lights come on. For once, Churchill is speechless. 
COSMO LANG (CONT'D) There's no doubt: David is planning a comeback. And will succeed if our King continues to falter. Though Bertie miraculously survived the Coronation he continues to stumble very badly indeed. Soon he must broadcast to the world. Hitler will be listening. David will be listening. Stalin and Roosevelt will be listening. Everyone will be listening. God help us. 
BERTIE (V.O.) (stuttering very badly) "In this grave hour... " 
86   INT.   LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - NEW DAY                    86 
Bertie and Logue are rehearsing. 
BERTIE "In this grave hour... " Sorry. 
LIONEL Try again. 
BERTIE "In this grave hour... " 
WILLIE (NO STUTTER) I would! 
LIONEL Why am I not surprised? 
87   INT.   KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW NIGHT          87 
The dreaded BBC microphone. 
The room has been transformed into an ad hoc broadcasting studio for this all-important occasion. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    109. 
The BBC News Reader and Floor Manager are there, along with a small cluster of technicians putting finishing touches to their equipment. 
FLOOR MANAGER Think he'll manage? 
BBC NEWS READER I've heard he may not even show. 
The Floor Manager tries to warn him with his eyes. 
Bertie has entered with Elizabeth and Logue. The Reader wishes he could sink into the floor. Bertie says nothing, but approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth watch nervously. 
BERTIE `Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare it square in the eye, man to man.' 
BBC NEWS READER (placating) If you'll be so kind, to let me show you... 
BERTIE I already know. My father taught me. 
He spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus with the little finger, thumb to chin. 
The Reader scurries off and tells the others. 
BBC NEWS READER His father taught him. I taught his father. 
BERTIE (testing the microphone) Bugger bugger bugger...bloody bloody bloody... 
ELIZABETH Bertie, do make sure that's not switched on! 
LIONEL You're going to be splendid. And if you're not? 
BERTIE They'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway. Right? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    110. 
LIONEL Bloody right. 
Lang and Churchill have entered. Elizabeth forces herself to greet them graciously. 
ELIZABETH Mr. Prime Minister, Your Grace, how kind of you to join us. 
COSMO LANG Wouldn't miss this for the world. (to Churchill) Congratulations. Neville didn't last long, did he? Talking to Hitler. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL My tenure will be shorter, if the King fails tonight. 
Bertie and Logue speak privately. 
BERTIE No matter how this turns out, I wish to thank you. For asking such dreadful questions. What can I do in recompense? 
LIONEL (lighty...yet seriously) I've always wanted to be knighted. 
BERTIE Sorry. That would raise too many questions. 
LIONEL (pause, then) Understood. 
Bertie takes something from his pocket. 
BERTIE Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back. 
LIONEL Keep it for good luck. 
BERTIE No, you won this, fair and square. 
The object is a silver medal. Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    111. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) Made from the melted coin. Designed it myself, hope you like it, Lionel old friend. May I call you that? 
LIONEL My greatest honour, Bertie. (then) One final question. 
BERTIE Oh dear. 
LIONEL Do you believe you're King? 
A very long pause. 
BERTIE Almost. 
The red light on the microphone starts to blink.   Logue joins the others.

Leo the Lion ROARS over the FANFARE, then 
FADE OUT: 
GLIDING OBJECTS IN A WIDE DARK VOID - (ANIMATION) 
Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until it becomes clearly visible, then drifts off as though moving in some huge orbit. 
Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space. 
As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER. 
A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean- while the sundial, hourglass and water clock return, drifting at diverse angles across the screen. 
THE SOUND of the various devices continues to MOUNT. 
A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E clock and the body carved like a drummer of the 14th century, BEATING the hour. 
A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL. 
ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G to mingle with all the drifting objects. 
The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H 
Then a GREAT BELL.                             J 
DEAFENING SOUNDS NOW COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, as the time K devices weave across the screen and, reaching CRESCENDO, STOP abruptly.  A mellow VOICE begins to SING THE THEME of L the picture, "The Land Of The Leal".  Simultaneously, the screen reveals the MAIN TITLE:                             M

THE TIME MACHINE 
"THE LAND OF THE LEAL" 
Words & Music by Peggy Lee 
When I was a wee lad                               L And dark was the night Afraid I would be Til the bright morning light And sometimes...for comfort Away I would steal Away I would go to the Land of the Leal. 
And soon I would be there It took me no time My heart would be soaring As I made the climb And there was the green grass So cool and so sweet So good to be run through With happy bare feet! 
And who was my teacher And how did I know? Just when to be going And which way to go? But always when wishing Away I would steal Away I would go to the Land of the Leal. 
And now that I'm older I try to be wise But when I am troubled I still close my eyes And just like the wee lad Away I will steal Away I will go to the Land of the Leal. 
For there are no questions And there are no lies And never a storm there To darken the skies The birds who are flying No freer they feel Than I When I live in the land of the Leal. 
After the CREDIT TITLES, the MUSIC SUBSIDES and we slowly 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN:                                               1 EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE) 
MRS. WATCHETT Dinner is served, gentlemen! 
BRIDEWELL (puts his glass down) First sensible thing I've heard all evening. 
He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others follow. 
FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8 
As they walk toward the DINING ROOM. 
FILBY This is peculiar.  He is usually very prompt, precise and punctual. 
DR. HILLYER He's making fools of us by inviting us here and then not showing up. It's not the behavior of a gentleman. 
KEMP To say nothing of the waste of time. 
DR. HILLYER (agreeing) To say nothing of the waste of time. 
Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the others settle down.  This time the chair at the head of the table is conspicuously unoccupied. 
BRIDWELL (arises, lifting his glass) One thing I will say for George, he keeps the best cellar in the south of England...and Mrs. Watchett is the finest cook in the world. - I think I'll drink to that! 
The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM. All look in the direction of another door across the room. 
THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9 
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room. The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm, she points toward the long corridor now revealed by the open door. 
MRS. WATCHETT (frightened) There!...there... 
All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife clasped in his hand. 
CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10 
We see the figure of a man approaching, a black silhouette against the pale glow at the end of the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes closer, his features still blacked out by shadows, but as he nears the doorway, the light from the room strikes first his legs, then his body and finally his face.  Here he stops. 
This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light and then takes another swaying step into the room. 
FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11 
They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller. 
FILBY Good lord! - What's happened? 
Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him. Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however, moves forward under his own power. 
TIME TRAVELLER I'm all right...just some food...a drink... 
He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth. The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile. 
TIME TRAVELLER Are you all right? 
A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time Traveller empties his glass. 
BRIDEWELL (a delayed answer) Of course.  I'm...all right... 
Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller like a mother hen. 
MRS. WATCHETT (half apology, half concern) I didn't recognize you!...it was so dark... 
The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup for him, but he pushes it away. 
TIME TRAVELLER Meat...I'm hungry for meat! 
Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr. Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge portion of beef and loads it onto his plate. 
GROUPSHOT                                              12 
The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward. 
DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT) How do you mean? 
TIME TRAVELLER Well, take that box.  It has the first three dimensions, as you said. But what if it didn't exist in Time? It wouldn't exist at all, would it? 
DR. HILLYER No. 
TIME TRAVELLER So - for an object to exist at all, it must exist in the fourth dimen- sion....and that fourth dimension is duration....Time! 
DR. HILLYER (impatiently) All right!  But what's in that box? 
TIME TRAVELLER I'm coming to that.  But first, consider!  Why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension?  Because we have no freedom to move in it.  We can move in the other three -- up, down, forward, backward, sideways. But when it comes to Time, we are prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony? 
GROUP SHOT                                             16 
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps. 
KEMP George!  You've given a most lucid explanation and all that!  But I don't think I entirely understand. 
TIME TRAVELLER Look!  There are a lot of things in the world you don't understand, aren't there? 
KEMP Of course!  Quite a number. 
TIME TRAVELLER But you don't refuse to believe in them because of that? 
KEMP Not if I can see the proof with my own eyes. 
TIME TRAVELLER Good!  All I'm asking you to do now is to witness a demonstration of the possibility of movement in the fourth dimension. (to Dr. Hillyer) Philip, will you please hand me that box? 
All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness, and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it with great care and brings forth a mechanical device 
[PAGE 13 MISSING FROM HARD COPY] 
TIME TRAVELLER I've told you.  The larger model can carry a passenger on a journey through Time. - Not through Space, mind you, but through Time. 
BRIDEWELL Oh, I say George!  If you start floating around in the future, aren't you likely to mess things up for the rest of us? 
DR. HILLYER The future is already there.  It's irrevocable and cannot be changed. 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                19 
He answers thoughtfully. 
TIME TRAVELLER That's the most important question to which I hope to find an answer. Can Man control his destiny?  Can he change the shape of things to come? 
[PAGE 16 MISSING FROM HARD COPY] 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE Imagine that this cigar is the Time Traveller.  Now, this lever in front of him controls movement.  Forward pressure sends the Machine into the future, backward pressure into the past.  And the harder the pressure the faster the Machine travels. 
GROUPSHOT - LOW ANGLE                                  24 
All eyebrows are raised. 
TIME TRAVELLER This experiment can be performed only once.  If it succeeds, I lose my model forever.  That is why I need witnesses. 
They look at each other, uncertain whether he is joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to examine the table. 
KEMP Go ahead. 
TIME TRAVELLER You're ready then? 
Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses. 
TIME TRAVELLER Doctor Hillyer, would you care to lend me your hand? 
Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling weakly. 
INSERT OF MODEL                                        25 
Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is heard. 
FILBY I saw a toy machine vanish.  But I'm certain there are a number of ways of doing that trick.  Any magician at the Hippodrome could probably do it. 
TIME TRAVELLER (angrily) It was no trick! - Would you care to see the full-scale model? 
FILBY No, I would not!  I have no desire to tempt the laws of Providence and I don't think you should.  It's not for man to trifle with. 
TIME TRAVELLER Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp. 
FILBY There is something in their common sense attitude to life. (and then) George, I speak to you as a friend. More, as a brother.  If that machine can do what you say it can...destroy it.  Destroy it, George, before it destroys you. 
Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD. 
TIME TRAVELLER You must have plans for New Year's Eve.  Don't let me keep you. 
FILBY Mary isn't well.  We decided to stay home with the baby.  But why don't you come home with me.  You haven't seen little Jaime for a long time. 
TIME TRAVELLER I can't. 
FILBY What's stopping you? 
TIME TRAVELLER I just want to see the old century out by myself. 
FILBY (rising) Have it your own way. 
He goes to the door. 
AT THE DOOR                                            60 
Filby stops, then turns around. 
FILBY Will you promise me that you won't leave the house tonight? 
TIME TRAVELLER I promise you, I won't walk out of the door. 
Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and steps up to him. 
TIME TRAVELLER David!  Please don't think me un- friendly! - Come over to dinner - next Friday.  Won't you? 
FILBY Very well. 
TIME TRAVELLER Fine...and will you bring the others with you? 
FILBY (with a warm smile) Whatever you say, George. - Happy New Year. 
TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands) And a very happy New Year to you, David. 
Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table and sits down. 
AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61 
The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century." He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett, with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears in the doorway and walks up to him. 
MRS. WATCHETT Will you be having supper in this evening, sir? 
TIME TRAVELLER (while ex- changing jackets with Mrs. Watchett's help) I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why don't you take the evening off and celebrate. 
MRS. WATCHETT Thank you, sir, but if you won't be needing me I think I'll turn in early and get some sleep... (indicating revelers outside) ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir. 
TIME TRAVELLER Goodnight. 
She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her. 
TIME TRAVELLER Oh, Mrs. Watchett! (as she responds) I've invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner next Friday. (and then) Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett. 
MRS. WATCHETT Happy New Year, sir. 
Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and places it prominently on the table.  He rises and mounts the steps that lead to: 
INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62 
TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74 
The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab- oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks up and squints. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE It was disconcerting to see the sun... 
INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (STOP MOTION OR        75 ANIMATION) 
As the sun arches majestically. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE ...arc in less than a minute... 
INSERT:  POT OF FLOWERS - (STOCK AND/OR STOP MOTION)   76 
As they close. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE ....to see flowers closing their eyes for the night, changes that normally took hours, occuring in seconds, was beautiful. 
During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood the scene. 
In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with the speed of wind streaks away. 
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77 
A trace of a smile, then apprehension. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE And as yet I was travelling very slowly! (challenging) What if I went faster?! 
His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the future position. 
THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls and looks at the dials. 
INSERT:  CLOSE ON DIALS                                78 
They are spinning. 
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 79 
As he looks up. 
INSERT OF SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)        80 
The sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster. 
VERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81 
His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of another day. 
He turns toward the: 
WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82 
Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring. While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around the window like a snake and the flowers open and close, we see the following through repeated fast flashes. 
The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a) 
The night falls and the stars circle    (b) the North Star. 
The sun appears and disappears be-      (c) hind the whirling clouds. 
At night the moon races through         (d) tumultuous clouds. 
On the following day the sky darkens    (e) with thunderheads.  There is a cataract of lightning and THUNDER. 
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83 
Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE It became intoxicating.  To see an entire storm in a few seconds. - So I pushed the lever on toward even greater speed. 
FILBY (smiles as he interrupts) I'm afraid you have me confused with my father, sir.  There was a remarkable resemblance. - I'm James Filby. 
TIME TRAVELLER Was? 
JAMES FILBY Were you a friend of father's? 
TIME TRAVELLER Yes...yes...I've been away. 
JAMES FILBY He was killed in the war...a year ago. 
TIME TRAVELLER (aghast) No!...it can't be... (then, as he realizes its truth) I'm sorry to hear that. (pause, then hesitantly points) And the gentleman who used to live across the street? 
JAMES FILBY Oh, him.  Some inventor who disappeared around the turn of the century. - If you're interested in that house, forget it.  You can't buy it or even go inside. 
TIME TRAVELLER Why is that? 
JAMES FILBY My father was executor of the inventor's estate and he refused to liquidate it. (adds with a smile) I often chided him on that account, but he felt positive that the owner would return some day. - Some people hereabouts think it's haunted. (stares at Time Traveller curiously, studying the strange cut of his clothes) Who are you, sir? 
TIME TRAVELLER Just a stranger who once knew your father. 
JAMES FILBY I see. (still curious at the Time Traveller's abstract attitude) Have you been at the front, sir? 
TIME TRAVELLER Front?  What front? 
JAMES FILBY Why the war, of course. 
TIME TRAVELLER What war? 
JAMES FILBY Great heavens, man, don't you know we've been at war with Germany since nineteen fourteen?  I thought perhaps you had seen action in France...or maybe... (noticing confusion, adds with a note of compassion) Perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better.  Won't you come in? 
TIME TRAVELLER No...no, thank you. 
JAMES FILBY You're sure you're alright, sir? 
TIME TRAVELLER Yes, I'm quite alright. 
JAMES FILBY (hesitantly) Then...goodbye, sir. 
The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the Department Store. 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                97 
He speaks almost to himself. 
TIME TRAVELLER Goodbye, Jaime. 
With the bitter taste of death for his old friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the street and returns to the cottage. 
INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                            98 
The Time Traveller approaches the Machine, steps up into the seat, throws his head back and grimly shoves the lever forward. 
SKYLIGHT - FULL SEOT - (STOCK AND ANIMATION)           99 
ACCENT on MUSIC, then as the HUMMING OF THE TIME MACHINE takes over, suddenly panes of GLASS BREAK one after another, giving a clear view of a sky full of SWIRLIING TURBULENT CLOUDS. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                100 
The FLICKERS of days and nights, as well as the HUMMING, INCREASES and DECREASES, in accordance with his manipulation of the controls.  Over this: 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE As I went along, I gained experience in handling the Machine.  I found that I could stop for a day, an hour, or even for a second to observe, then go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses. 
Something catches his interest.  He pulls back the lever to SLOW DOWN. 
EXT. STREET - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOP MOTION)      101 
With the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across the pavement.  The bright lights of the night pop out one after another leaving a sparingly illuminated street.  The HUMMING SUBSIDES.  The mannequin previously seen in the show window now wears the clothing of the "Roaring Twenties".  A distant CLOCK STRIKES ELEVEN. 
Smiling. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE It vas reassuring to find that she hadn't changed.  Only her costume. Provocative to say the least.  I wondered what she would look like ten years hence. 
With a grin he throws the lever forward. 
INSERT OF DIALS                                        114 
HUMMING INCREASES and the years spin; 1960, 1961 and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966. 
BACK AT THE MANNEQUIN                                  115 
Dressed in the sleek dress of the future.  First a distant, then a close AIR RAID SIREN HOWLS, menacingly. 
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 116 
His smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees. 
EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117 
People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder. 
The running is purposive, however.  All are entering particular buildings or, like those closest to the Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky- ward. 
A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers her up in his arms and rushes back to safety. 
In a few seconds the streets are deserted. 
TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118 
The Time Traveller gets out and looks around, confused. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE At first I wondered if my Machine and I were the cause of the panic.  I was to soon find out we weren't. 
He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair- way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s., a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly, until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's attention. 
EXT. STORE WINDOW - FULL SHOT                          119 
A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow. The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors fly wide open. 
He stops startled, looking about to see who opened them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120 
From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller enters and turns his attention to other products of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks off. 
REVERSE SHOT                                           121 
Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller. 
TIME TRAVELLER (shakes his head) I can't understand you. 
The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young man.  He is now in his mid-sixties. 
WARDEN (looking at helmet) Confounded radio in this thing. Makes more noise than it does sense. 
TIME TRAVELLER (recognizing him) Filby! 
WARDEN My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't you hear the air raid siren? 
TIME TRAVELLER You mean that horrible screeching? 
WARDEN It wasn't constructed for its aesthetic values, you know, but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter.  Now go on. 
TIME TRAVELLER But I'm perfectly comfortable and I find your store magnificent.  What splendid achievements, what gigantic strides mankind has taken, what... 
WARDEN (interrupting) Come on, young man.  We'd better be going before the mushrooms start sprouting. (looks at Time Traveller with renewed interest) You do look familiar.  Haven't we met somewhere before? 
TIME TRAVELLER Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many years ago. 
THE TIME MACHINE - LONG SHOT - (STOCK) - (PROCESS)     131 
Out of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns aside and leaps directly toward the Time Machine. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE Then I saw my own danger.  I too was to be engulfed! 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                132 
As he sees his great peril. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE But to go back was unthinkable. 
He jams the lever forward to its furthest position. The HUMMING SOARS TO A VERY HIGH PITCH. 
THE ENCROACHING LAVA - (STOCK)                         133 
It has been approaching with the speed of a torrent, but now it literally leaps forward in a blinding red haze that engulfs the entire scene. 
THE TIME MACHINE - MED. SHOT                           134 
The interior of the Machine is permeated with a dull red glow which seems to flow like mist all about the Time Traveller. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE Only my speed through time saved me from being roasted alive and encased in stone forever. 
INSERT OF DIALS                                        135 
They are spinning too fast to distinguish anything in the gradually fading red glow. 
EXTREME CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                        136 
His face is bathed in sweat.  His eyes search the growing darkness. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE The molten rock cooled. (he closes his burning eyes as the last of the light vanishes) I prayed...wondering how many centuries, how many eons must pass before the wind and rain could wear away the mountain that enclosed me. 
In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED BREATHING of the Time Traveller. 
Then a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward to look at the dials. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (whispering) Darkness...darkness for centuries. 
INSERT OF DIALS                                        137 
They roll very fast.  We can distinguish only the passing of years -- 70,000...80,000...90,000... 100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes out leaving only the dial's own faint glow. 
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 138 
Once again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM of the Time Machine.  He breathes heavily and tries to calm himself. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE I wondered if there was still war being waged on the ground above me... if man would still exist on earth, when I saw the sun again. 
As he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster. HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE The centuries rolled by. - I put my trust in time and waited for the rock to wear down around me. 
A white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing immense relief. 
WHAT HE SEES - (ANIMATION)                             139 
Rocks deteriorate and a bright blue sky bursts into view.  ACCENT ON MUSIC. 
EXT. TIME MACHINE AND GROUND NEARBY - LONG SHOT        140 (SPLIT, ANIMATION) 
Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its passenger.  The black rock on the surface slowly melts away and the flickering sunlight returns.  The Machine is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct object in the whirling transparent landscape. 
EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT                       141 
As he smiles gratefully up at the sky. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE I was free again! 
His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the Time Traveller crosses to: 
A TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155 
The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to this strange place.  There is none. 
Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS with it on the top of the table. 
TIME TRAVELLER (shouting) Anyone here? 
But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re- traces his steps and leaves the great hall. 
EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156 
Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along. Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes probe every bush and tree and object that could possibly conceal some person or thing. 
SERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161 
As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk, INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life or movement. 
The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum. 
EXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162 
As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees, he hesitates, then moves into the forest. 
SERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166 
The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks with continued wariness through the trees, glancing from left to right and occasionally stopping dead still and quickly darting a glance behind him at what he imagines to be some sound of movement. But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest. 
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out. 
EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167 
The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand. They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream emerges in a swift torrent. 
ANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168 
A beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep into the crystal water. 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                169 
He smiles philosophically and leans back against a tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured. 
TIME TRAVELLER (musingly, to himself) So this is man's future... 
GROUP SHOT                                             170 
The people, apparently without any cares of the world, play, romp and swim. 
TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.) ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in the clear streams and eat the fruits of earth with all knowledge of work and hardship forgotten. 
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171 
He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said. 
TIME TRAVELLER Well, and why not? 
Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool. He turns. 
THE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172 
The Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY. 
The other people turn their heads toward her, but make no move to help. 
CLOSE ON GIRL                                          173 
She has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two little men, their bare feet dangling in the water, sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight. 
TIME TRAVELLER I am returning to my time!  Not to tell of the uselessness of the struggle - not to tell of the hopeless future - but only so that I can die among men! 
He turns and strides toward the door. 
EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197 
The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She stands there, looking after him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198 
There are patches of mist and haze between the trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller strides across. 
EXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199 
Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con- sternation.  He raises the torch high to see: 
EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200 
There is no Time Machine. 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201 
In stunned shock. 
THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202 
Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn looking for his Machine, beating the branches with his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes, a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn where the Machine was last seen. 
(NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot where the Time Traveller's house once stood.) 
He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle. Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud- denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he had removed and looks at it with self-assurance. Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes the grass. 
THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203 
The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as though some heavy object had been dragged across. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot- prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned earth. 
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204 
He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed. Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow- ing the grooves. 
BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205 
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves straight across the lawn to the flagstones around the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the stones leading to the wide panel in the base of the pedestal.  Here the marks end. 
AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206 
The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND. 
The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free, he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success. 
Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair. 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207 
He senses he is under observation by an unseen presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up to: 
THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208 
The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in the torch light. 
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209 
He turns and peers toward: 
THE BUSHES                                             210 
In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the flame of the torch. 
TIME TRAVELLER (picks up dry branches) As a matter of fact, I'm from right here. (gesturing) There's where my house stood many thousands of years ago.  Here - to that monument, was my laboratory. About there was my library where I once sat talking with friends about my Time Machine. 
Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the bushes in the f.g. 
CLOSE ON WEENA                                         218 
She watches every move he makes. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (continuing) I hoped to learn a great deal.  I hoped to take back the knowledge, the advancement, mankind made... instead what do I find?  Vegetables! 
Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly from behind her. 
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219 
With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks. 
TIME TRAVELLER (continuing) The human race reduced to living vegetables! 
BACK TO WEENA                                          220 
The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream. 
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221 
He is about to light a match, but finds he needs more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena. 
TIME TRAVELLER Get me a few more twigs. 
When there is no answer he turns and looks. 
AT THE BUSHES                                          222 
Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena slowly disappearing under the brush. 
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223 
We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws her to the pile of dry branches. 
TIME TRAVELLER (after calming her) What was it? 
WEENA (low) Morlocks. 
TIME TRAVELLER (strikes match and holds it to twigs) This seems to keep them away. 
CLOSE ON WEENA                                         224 
She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the flame. 
TWO SHOT                                               225 
The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more amazement than pain. 
TIME TRAVELLER (while examining her hand) What ever made you put your hand in the fire? 
WEENA I never saw it before. 
Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits down beside her. 
TIME TRAVELLER (after a long silence) Do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire? (he looks at her) No, I suppose you don't. (pokes at fire) The next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel. (turns to her) Do you know what that is? (she shakes her head) I'm sorry I was angry with your people.  I had no right to be. No more than if I had visited the Island of Bali in my own time. You were safe inside your great house, yet you came out into the night to warn me.  The one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice.  You have that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all of your people have it.  All it requires is someone to reawaken it. I shall try if you'll let me.  Will you? 
WEENA I do not understand you, but I believe you. 
TIME TRAVELLER That's a good start. - Now try to tell me...who or what are the Morlocks? (Weena looks at him blankly) Are they people or animals? (her expression remains unchanged) What do you know about yourself?  The past?  Don't your people ever speak of the past? 
WEENA There is no past. 
TIME TRAVELLER Don't you ever wonder about the future? 
WEENA There is no future. 
Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books that the Young Man had previously shown him. 
She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone corridor.  He follows. 
INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233 
Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear around the corner. 
INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234 
The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is evidently a place that no one bothers to visit. 
TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235 
Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos- phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize objects and machines, some belonging to the early part of the twentieth century and still others take on the forms and shapes that the audience of today will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond comprehension. 
Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken case which contains several boxes of golden rings a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the nearest box and examines its contents. 
TIME TRAVELLER (picking up a ring) Are these the talking rings? 
WEENA Yes. 
TIME TRAVELLER They speak? 
WEENA Yes. 
TIME TRAVELLER Of what? 
WEENA Things no one here understands. 
TIME TRAVELLER How do you get it to talk? 
Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top. 
INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236 
A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono- graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the surface of one of our records. 
VOICE FROM RING Whomsoever chances upon these rings will probably hear the last recorded voice of civilized man.  This is the year four thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine. 
TWO SHOT                                               237 
The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and Weena in disinterested detachment. 
VOICE FROM RING (cont'd) The war between the East and West, which is now in its three hundredth and twenty-sixth year has at last come to an end.  There is nothing left to fight with and few of us left to fight.  The atmosphere has become so polluted with deadly germs that it can no longer be breathed.  There is no place on this planet that is immune.  The last surviving factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing and when they are gone, we must die... 
The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY. The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for the second ring and spins it. 
ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING This is the last day.  We, the last to survive, have had our final meeting. We have decided to split into two groups.  Each man and woman has made his own decision.  Some have chosen to take refuge in the great caverns and find a new way of life far down below the earth's surface.  The rest of us have decided to take our chances in the sunlight, small as those chances may be. 
The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE. 
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238 
As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill. Over this: 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE From the talking rings I learned how the human race divided itself and how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks began. 
He turns. 
GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239 
The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena hurries after him. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE By some quirk of fate the Morlocks had become the masters and the Eloi their servants.  The Morlocks main- tained them and bred them like cattle only to take them below when they reached maturity, which explained why there were no older people along them. 
They exit. 
GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240 
As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching. 
VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254 
In the open country now, the forest behind them. In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly across the green landscape. 
All are converging toward a single point somewhere ahead. 
WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255 
They walk close together, paying no attention to one another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF THE SIRENS. 
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256 
His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries to grasp the meaning of what he observes. 
EXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257 (MINIATURE) 
It is the source of the sound.  There are little bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe organ behind the Sphinx. 
TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258 
All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered. But the Eloi disregard him and march straight ahead, eyes forward. 
The Time Traveller breaks into a run. 
TWO SHOT                                               259 
The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass the shadows of the marching Eloi. 
TIME TRAVELLER What's happening?  Tell me! 
The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical. This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at him, releasing his grip. 
The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re- mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING SIRENS are now getting on his nerves. 
EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260 (DAY) 
The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in a trance-like state. 
EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261 
From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres- sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind is marching to some unknown doom. 
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262 
He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind. But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases her, then goes on again, covering his ears with his palms, fighting to retain command of his own reason. 
SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265

He still strives to control himself, moves forward, then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead. 
EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267 
It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open, revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal. 
And despite their previous repugnance to the Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across the lawn resolutely to it. 
AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268 
The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters the wide opening and starts descending into sub- terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among them. 
TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.) Weena! 
Without hearing him she passes through the entrance. 
He runs off.

He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b) 
The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c) of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller. 
EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279 
Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts to descend. 
Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be heard. 
SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280 
The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER. 
IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281 
As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as well. 
Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest, glancing upward. 
FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282 
A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching the Time Traveller's progress. 
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283 
A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers ahead. 
INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1 
The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g., pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall. The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver- ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and grotesque shadows. 
(NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this scene as well as the following sequence.) 
CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2 
Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously moves toward: 
INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3 
At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T. pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror. 
THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4 
This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks. In the flickering light we see stone tables and scattered around the floor far below the unmistak- able remains of human bones after the flesh has been carnivorously picked away. 
T.T.'S VOICE So, this was the destiny of the Eloi. 
CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5 
His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match. 
T.T.'S VOICE (continuing) They were being bred like cattle by the Morlocks who had degenerated into the lowest form of human life...cannibalism. 
The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale, spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g. descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise. 
MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6 
Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then hide. 
STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7 
The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T. is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock appears at the top of the stairs and follows. 
T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29 
He lights his last match and moves forward, looking for his lost torch. 
GROUPSHOT                                              283X30 
The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the light of the match his only weapon in keeping the Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and picks it up hurriedly. 
CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31 
His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre- hension while he applies the dying match to the intended torch. 
TIME TRAVELLER (muttering) Burn, will you! 
He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and lower without starting the wood.  In despair he turns to Weena. 
TIME TRAVELLER Quick, something to burn!  It's my last match! 
BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32 
As they are closing in. 
CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33 
With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds it out. 
BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34 
As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the dead match. 
He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it starts he again attempts to make his way by blind- ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway. 
GROUPSHOT                                              283X35 
As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway, one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand. 
A CORNER                                               283X36 
The torch rolls in and begins to sputter. 
BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37 
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins. 
[PAGE 90 MISSING FROM HARD COPY] 
Eloi below him. 
TIME TRAVELLER Weena!  Weena, get the torch! 
CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X5 
Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then turns searching for the flickering torch. 
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 351X6 
As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge. Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs on until he can scramble up on ledge again. He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his head against the rock wall, finally throwing him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor- lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he had previously kicked rises to menace him from the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor, trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon against the Morlocks. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7 
He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently too confused to move. 
TIME TRAVELLER Weena!  Go on!  Go on the steps! 
CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN             351X8 
Weena spots the still flickering torch and starts toward it. 
INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9 
WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379 
The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face toward him. 
WEENA (innocently) Would I be pretty? 
The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his. He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on his cheek. 
TIME TRAVELLER (slowly) Yes...you would be.  More than pretty. (his voice sinks to a whisper) I wish we could go back together, Weena, back to my own time...or to times before that when the world was young.  We could... 
EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They both look in the direction of the voices. 
EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380 
A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man in White, approach them, talking excitedly, pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The panel is open. 
TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381 
Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her, breaks into a run. 
GROUP OF ELOI                                          382 
The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze, then the Eloi follow them. 
EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383 (MATTE) 
The face is broken in half.  It is left with only a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time Traveller and Weena come through the charred bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop. 
THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384 
The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls, have not yet reached the Machine. 
TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385 
He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket and bring forth the lever without which the Machine will not function. 
TIME TRAVELLER (without looking at her) Come, Girl! 
He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow, hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this, the Time Traveller enters. 
INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386 
Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her radiant features. 
Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and starts to fit the lever into place. 
REVERSE ANGLE                                          387 
The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow starts sliding across his figure, moving more swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes with a CLANG. 
OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388 
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors. 
INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389 
The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles to open them.  From without he hears Weena's POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking, weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some- thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling bodies. 
INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390 
The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and finally grasps it. 
OMITTED                                                391-403 
INSERT OF DIALS                                        404 
Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire. There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total darkness. 
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405 
FILBY I don't think I can. 
GROUP SHOT                                             414 
A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on the table, stands up, looks around and then down to Kemp. 
DR. HILLYER Are you coming, Kemp. 
Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller. 
KEMP It's getting late and you look exhausted.  You had better get some rest. 
Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and starts to leave. 
COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415 
The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down from the sky.  The front door opens letting out the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats. They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage looking back to the Time Traveller who stands motionless in the doorway. 
FILBY Goodnight, George. 
AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416 
The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves. 
TIME TRAVELLER Thank you, David, for being such a good friend - always. 
With this he turns and goes into the house, closing the door slowly. 
AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417 
Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in, but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back. Kemp thrusts his head from the window. 
KEMP What do you think, Filby? 
FILBY (after a pause) One thing is certain.  Those flowers couldn't have possibly bloomed in the winter-time. 
HILLYER (in the b.g.) You don't really think that story was true? 
Filby reaches a decision. 
FILBY Look, you chaps go on.  It's just a short walk home for me. 
HILLYER (o.s.) Go on, driver! 
The WHIP CRACKS. 
THE DRIVEWAY                                           418 
As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage disappears, then retraces his steps to the front door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer. He steps back and looks off toward the: 
EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419 
No light shines through its windows. 
BACK TO FILBY                                          420 
He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house. 
INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421 
The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters the fully lit room, looking for his friend. Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at the doorway. 
DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422 
The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is 
FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423 
He calls into the darkness.

"An American Werewolf in London" -- by John Landis 
FADE IN 
1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT 
on the moon. 
EXT. MOON 
Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is superimposed. 
An American Werewolf in London 
We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it grows farther from us, continuing credits until the full moon is the size it appears to us from earth. 
2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT 
Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to have earned their literary reputation. 
The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER, mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler, climbs down. 
"Moon Shadow" ends. 
CUT TO: 
Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in Europe.  They are both in their late twenties. 
It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch. 
JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER 
They've been cramped for hours. 
TRUCK DRIVER Here, lads, East Proctor and all about are the moors.  I go east here. 
JACK Yes, well thank you very much for the ride, sir.  You have lovely sheep. 
TRUCK DRIVER (as he clambers back up on his truck) Boys, keep off the moors. Stay on the road.  Good luck to you. 
DAVID Thanks again! 
He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing towards East Proctor. 
EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT 
As they walk, their breath visible: 
JACK Are you cold? 
DAVID Yes. 
JACK Good. 
They walk on, finally: 
DAVID Jack. 
JACK David. 
DAVID You're not having a good time are you? 
JACK Oh, I don't know.  I mean look around.  Isn't this a fun place? 
The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold, foreboding. 
DAVID Well, I like it here. 
JACK I'm sorry.  Northern England first, Italy later. 
DAVID Hello. 
JACK Nice to see you. 
FACES 
Silent and staring. 
CUT TO: 
DAVID AND JACK 
DAVID (smiles) It's very cold outside.  May we come in? 
The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over to a table and very self-consciously remove their packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman finally comes over to them. 
JACK Do you have any hot soup? 
WOMAN No. 
DAVID Well, do you have any coffee? 
WOMAN No. 
JACK Hot chocolate? WOMAN We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea. 
JACK Then you have some hot tea? 
WOMAN No. 
JACK Oh. 
WOMAN But I can heat some up for you if you'd like. 
DAVID & JACK Yes, please. 
As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess and darts, and the boys breathe easier. 
JACK Nice looking group. 
DAVID Listen, at least it's warm in here. 
JACK Look at that. 
CUT TO: 
JACK'S P.O.V. 
On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed star) and on either side burns a yellow candle. 
DAVID What about it? 
JACK It's a five-pointed star. 
DAVID Maybe the owners are from Texas. 
The Woman brings them their tea. 
JACK (to Woman) Remember the Alamo? 
WOMAN I beg your pardon? 
DAVID He was joking.  Thank you. 
WOMAN Joking?  I remember The Alamo. I saw it once in London, in Leicester Square. 
Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS explains: 
CHESS PLAYER She means in the cinema, that film with John Wayne. (turns to board) Checkmate. 
DAVID Jack, we'd better go. 
JACK What do you mean?  I'm starving. 
DART PLAYER There's no food here. 
The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a bit urgent. 
DAVID Come on, Jack, shall we go?!! 
JACK Apparently so. 
The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door. 
WOMAN (to men) You can't let them go. 
DAVID (worried) How much do we owe you? 
CHESS PLAYER Nothing, lads.  Go, God be with you. 
DAVID Uh, thank you. 
WOMAN Wait!  You just can't let them go! 
DART PLAYER Go!  And stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors. 
DAVID Yes, well, thanks again. 
CHESS PLAYER Beware the moon, lads! 
David pushes Jack out. 
6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT 
It is very cold. 
JACK What the hell was that all about? 
DAVID I don't know.  Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road. 
JACK Beware the moon? 
DAVID Come on, I'm freezing. 
They start up the road into the night. 
7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT 
It is quiet. 
WOMAN You can't let them go. 
DART PLAYER (angry) Should the world know our business?! 
CHESS PLAYER It's murder then. 
DART PLAYER Then murder it is!  It's in God's hands now. 
The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the floor. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK 
walking on the road surrounded by darkness. 
DAVID That was weird.  I guess leaving was the best idea. 
JACK I don't know.  Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood- thirsty mob. 
FADE IN 
11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
David is in a small, clean and very white hospital room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma. There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls out.... 
DAVID Jack?! 
...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very beautiful.  She goes to the bed. 
ALEX Mr. Kessler? 
She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed. 
ALEX Mr. Kessler? 
David remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS GALLAGHER, comes in. 
MISS GALLAGHER He all right? 
ALEX Yes, I should think.  He called out just now. 
MISS GALLAGHER He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him. 
ALEX Chart says he's from New York. 
MISS GALLAGHER I think he's a Jew. 
ALEX Why on earth do you say that? 
MISS GALLAGHER I looked. 
ALEX (smiles) Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now. 
A voice startles the girls. 
DR. HIRSCH Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is quite right. 
DR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring presence.  The girls are embarrassed. 
ALEX Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago. 
DR. HIRSCH Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital. 
MISS GALLAGHER Yes, Doctor. 
DR. HIRSCH Then get on with it. 
MISS GALLAGHER Yes, Doctor. 
She exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex. 
DR. HIRSCH Can I be of service, Miss Price? 
ALEX Dr. Hirsch? 
DR. HIRSCH Go about your duties. 
ALEX Yes, Doctor. 
She starts to exit. 
DR. HIRSCH Oh, Miss Price? 
ALEX Yes, Doctor? 
DR. HIRSCH What exactly did he call out? 
ALEX He said `Jack'. 
DR. HIRSCH Thank you very much, Mr. Collins.  He'll rest now and I'm sure everything will be fine once he's adjusted.  He's had quite a shock. 
MR. COLLINS These dumb-ass kids never appreciate anything you do for them. 
Mr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed. 
DAVID How long have I been here? 
DR. HIRSCH You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago. 
DAVID Two weeks? 
DR. HIRSCH You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while.  You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow.  They say a mad man has the strength of ten. 
DAVID (softly, as the drugs take hold) Lunatic? 
DR. HIRSCH Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now.  Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now. 
Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers. 
DAVID (softly) It wasn't a lunatic. 
ALEX (puzzled) I beg your pardon? 
DAVID It was a wolf. 
ALEX (bends down close to hear) What? 
DAVID A wolf. 
David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch. DR. HIRSCH Did he say a wolf? 
ALEX Yes, I believe he did. 
Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully. 
14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY 
Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk calendar. 
DR. HIRSCH But Roger is so terribly boring.  Yes, dear, but couldn't we...I see. (he makes a note) Thursday at eight, dinner with boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I will; if I survived Rommel, I suppose I'll survive another excruciating evening with Roger Mathison.  Be a good girl.  Bye. 
He hangs up very disgruntled.  The intercom buzzes. 
DR. HIRSCH Yes? 
SECRETARY (V.O.) Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor. 
DR. HIRSCH Send them in. 
He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall, the other rather pudgy. 
LT. VILLIERS Dr. Hirsch? 
DR. HIRSCH Come in, come in.  Please sit. Some tea? 
The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a small notebook. 
LT. VILLIERS No, thank you. 
SGT. McMANUS I'd like some tea, please. 
Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look. 
SGT. McMANUS Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe later. 
DR. HIRSCH It's no problem. 
LT. VILLIERS No, thank you, Doctor. 
Again the handheld camera is running furiously through the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree. David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements, looking about. 
CLOSEUP 
of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his animalness. 
DAVID 
takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We see him completely as the animal, study his movement and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly he pushes some leaves aside. 
CLOSEUP 
of his eyes. 
DAVID'S P.O.V. 
Several deer in the forest; they sense something and freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The buck turns his head, feeling the danger. 
CUT TO: 
DAVID 
Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders tensing. 
CLOSEUP 
of David's eyes. 
CLOSEUP 
of the frightened deer. 
CUT BACK TO: 
CLOSEUP 
of David's eyes. 
CUT BACK TO: 
THE FAWN 
as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame, his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered with blood.  He howls in triumph. 
17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to David, turns on the bed light and touches him. 
MISS GALLAGHER Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please. 
DAVID (awakened) I was having a nightmare. 
Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the pills and pouring a glass of water. 
MISS GALLAGHER Yes, well these should help that.  That's right, drink up. 
David takes the pills. 
MISS GALLAGHER Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning. 
DAVID What time is it? 
MISS GALLAGHER It's nearly eight.  I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex. 
DAVID Alex? 
MISS GALLAGHER Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you. 
DAVID What are you going to see? 
ORDERLY What do you mean, `how did he look'? 
ALEX You know, did he seem depressed?  Do you think he'll eat the food? 
ORDERLY (annoyed) I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist!  I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them. 
ALEX Thank you. 
Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room. She hesitates, then peeks in. 
21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly. 
ALEX (softly) Mr. Kessler? 
DAVID (lifeless) Yes? 
ALEX You haven't eaten your lunch. 
DAVID I'm not very hungry, thank you. 
ALEX I'm afraid you have to eat something. 
DAVID Please, really.  I'm not hungry. 
ALEX You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler. 
DAVID How is that? 
ALEX (she shakes the paper cup) Well, you're to take these after you've eaten.  Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills? 
DAVID Leave the pills.  I'll take them later. 
ALEX Sorry. 
She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room. 
DAVID Aw come on, Miss Price! 
ALEX Call me Alex. 
DAVID Aw come on, Alex! 
ALEX Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler? 
David is getting interested. 
DAVID Call me David. 
ALEX Shall I be forced to feed you, David? 
DAVID This is absurd.  I'm not hungry.  I don't want any food. 
ALEX Right. 
Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork. David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth. 
ALEX Let's try a little harder, shall we? 
DAVID Will you give me a break? 
Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly, shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds up another bite. 
ALEX Will I have to take such drastic action again, David? 
David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles. She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each other up.  Finally: 
DAVID May I have a glass of milk? 
DAVID Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me?  You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that. DR. HIRSCH (rubs his forehead) David, please.  The police are satisfied.  I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly. 
DAVID You really think I'm crazy, don't you? 
DR. HIRSCH Believe me.  The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake. 
There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr. Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice. 
DR. HIRSCH Now really, David.  You're far too intelligent to go on this way.  When you return to America I want you to seek out a competent psychiatrist or psychologist or something and stop this nonsense.  You'll be leaving this hospital in three or four days, please remain sane.  At least until you are no longer our responsibility. 
Dr. Hirsch goes to the door. 
DAVID Dr. Hirsch? (pause) I'd rather not be by myself. 
DR. HIRSCH Of course not, David.  I'll fetch in young Miss Price. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair. The room is dark except for the lamp by which she reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns. She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and feet, fingers and toes stretch. 
DAVID (quietly) You're a very beautiful girl. 
ALEX (embarrassed) I thought you were asleep. 
DAVID I was.  What are you reading? 
ALEX `A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain. 
DAVID Do you like it? 
ALEX I've just started it.  My friend gave it to me. 
They look at each other. 
ALEX What do you dream about? 
DAVID I dream of death mostly. 
ALEX I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have asked you. 
DAVID It's okay.  I want to talk to you. 
They sit and look at each other for a while longer. 
DAVID How old are you? 
ALEX That's not really a very proper question. 
DAVID How old are you? 
ALEX Twenty-eight. 
DAVID I'm twenty-seven. 
ALEX I know. 
DAVID Now what do you want to talk about? 
ALEX Was Jack Goodman your good friend? 
DAVID (seriously) My best friend.  My very best friend. 
ALEX (embarrassed) Shall I read to you? 
DAVID What?  Oh, yes, please. 
ALEX (opens book) A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens.  This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right? 
Alex is relieved for something to break the tension. 
ALEX (looking through the book) Let me see here. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 
The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity. 
ORDERLY Ah you're up.  Good morning and a good day to you.  We've quite a meal for you here this morning.  Bacon, oatmeal, orange juice, and toast with jam.  Good stuff there.  Now eat it up and I'll be back for the dishes when you've finished. 
The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech, notices his exit. 
DAVID Good morning. 
He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly. 
DAVID (in mock English accent) Please, sir, I want some more. 
He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear Jack's o.s. voice. 
JACK (O.S.) Can I have a piece of toast? 
David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him at all. 
JACK (pleasantly) Nice to see you. 
DAVID (unbelieving) Get the fuck out of here, Jack. 
JACK Thanks a lot. 
DAVID (horrified) This is too much.  I can't handle this. 
JACK I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me. 
Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at Jack horrified. 
JACK David!  You're hurting my feelings. 
DAVID (astounded) Hurting your feelings?  Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger! 
JACK I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come. 
DAVID (aghast) Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace? 
JACK Yeah.  Your parents came to my funeral.  I was surprised at how many people came. 
DAVID (resigned) Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person. 
JACK Debbie Klein cried a lot. 
DAVID I can't stand it. 
JACK So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed. 
DAVID Rudy Levine the shmuck? 
JACK Life mocks me even in death. 
Jack takes another bite of toast. 
DAVID (to himself) I'm going completely crazy. 
JACK (loud) David! 
DAVID (louder) What?! 
31   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Alex rushing down hospital corridor. 
32   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
JACK Please don't cry. 
33   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Alex rushing to the door. 
34   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - CLOSEUP 
JACK (softly in looming closeup) Beware the moon, David. 
CUT TO: 
ALEX 
as she bursts into the room. 
CUT TO: 
DAVID 
laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly. He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits on the bed and hugs David. 
ALEX David?  David! 
David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe easier. 
ALEX David, what's wrong? 
David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss. 
DAVID (quietly) I'm a werewolf. 
ALEX A werewolf? 
Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is and backs off a little.  David composes himself. 
ALEX Are you better now? 
DAVID I'll let you know the next full moon. 
ALEX You're to be discharged tomorrow.  Will you be all right? 
David takes Alex's hand. 
DAVID My friend Jack was just here. 
ALEX Your dead friend Jack? 
DAVID Yeah.  He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think? 
ALEX What do I think?  You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends? 
DAVID I was dreaming again? 
ALEX I would think so. 
DAVID (resigned) Yeah, I would think so, too. 
Alex considers for a while, finally.... 
ALEX Do you have a place to stay in London? 
CUT TO: 
DR. HIRSCH I see.  You've heard nothing about the incident? 
DART PLAYER Incident? 
DR. HIRSCH The murder? 
CHESS PLAYER Are you a police officer? 
DR. HIRSCH (smiles) No, no, hardly.  I work in the hospital where the Kessler boy was brought. 
The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look. 
DR. HIRSCH He was talking about werewolves and monsters and as I was near here I thought.... 
DART PLAYER You thought what? 
DR. HIRSCH I thought I'd look into the boy's story. 
CHESS PLAYER (scoffs) A story about werewolves - now really, sir. 
Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player. 
DR. HIRSCH Would you like a game of chess? 
45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY 
We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door. Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously not going out.  Alex pulls away. 
ALEX Let me go now, you'll make me late. 
DAVID Do me an enormous favor? 
ALEX Anything. 
DAVID Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive. 
ALEX It's silly of you to be apprehensive. 
DAVID Werewolves simply do not exist. 
ALEX (serious) David, do you want me to stay here tonight? 
DAVID Yeah, I do, but go to work. 
He opens the door and they both go outside. 
46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND DAVID 
walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly. 
ALEX Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay? 
DAVID Okay. 
ALEX I've left those pills for you. 
DAVID A doper werewolf. 
They kiss again. ALEX I'm off.  There's food in the fridge. 
DAVID See you later. 
Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl and snarl. 
DAVID (to dog) What did I do? 
The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl tugging on his leash. 
DAVID Thanks a lot, dog. 
ALEX I thought not. 
She tucks him in. 
ALEX You sleep now and have sweet dreams. 
BENJAMIN & ALEX No! 
For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through the window. 
53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT 
David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain. 
DAVID Jesus Christ! 
He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor. 
DAVID (screams) What?  Christ!  What? 
He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of his head.  He trembles violently. 
DAVID I'm burning up!  Jesus! 
He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is dripping wet. 
DAVID (shouts out in pain and fear) Jack!?  Where are you now, you fucker!?! 
As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in anguish. 
DAVID Help me!  Somebody help me, please!  Jack!! 
David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at his legs. 
DAVID (pleading, whimpering) I'm sorry I called you a meat loaf, Jack. 
New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body. He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him. Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for air. 
He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change. 
The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward. 
The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window.  David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness. 
54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 
A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver and the cab drives off. 
WOMAN Which one, Harry? 
MAN Number thirty-nine, but let's go `round the back. 
WOMAN Why? 
MAN Come on, we'll give Sean a scare. 
WOMAN You're crazy, Harry. 
HARRY Come on. 
Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and quiet. 
55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
WOMAN Did you hear something? 
HARRY Just now? 
WOMAN Yes. 
rings loudly.  (This is a scare.)  It continues to ring unanswered. 
62   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up. 
DR. HIRSCH He's not there. 
Alex grows worried. 
ALEX He's not? 
DR. HIRSCH Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies? 
ALEX Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend. 
DR. HIRSCH Has his friend appeared to him again? 
ALEX Yes. 
DR. HIRSCH What did he say? 
ALEX David says Jack comes to warn him. 
DR. HIRSCH Warn him? 
ALEX Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is this more serious than I know? 
DR. HIRSCH I tried to investigate the attack.  There are no records. The case was closed and now they've `misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did.  The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us.  So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things. 
ALEX Yes. 
DR. HIRSCH They were lying.  There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic.  The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there. 
ALEX And what else? 
DR. HIRSCH I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret.  I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf. 
Alex is flabbergasted. 
DR. HIRSCH You've absolutely no idea where David might be? 
ALEX No.  He knows no one in London, besides me.  I shouldn't have left him alone. 
Suddenly. 
ALEX Surely you're not suggesting.... 
DR. HIRSCH David has suffered a severe trauma.  I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor.  If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon? 
ALEX (bewildered) Dr. Hirsch? 
DR. HIRSCH Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon.  But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others. 
ALEX What shall we do? 
DR. HIRSCH Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy. 
63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT 
The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its ears perk up and he growls in warning. 
DERELICT #1 Old Winston smells something. 
DERELICT #2 (calls out) Who's there? 
The dog begins to whine. 
DERELICT #2 Let `im go. 
DR. HIRSCH I'll have one of those, too. 
He pays for the papers.  The second one's headline, "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?" 
71   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY - BUS STOP 
in another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks at him oddly. 
DAVID (cheerfully) A lot of weather we've been having lately. 
The man studies David carefully. 
72   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY 
Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading. There is loud knocking on the door.  Alex rushes to open it and David enters quickly, closing the door behind him.  He is still wearing the woman's coat. 
ALEX David!  Where on earth have you been!?! 
DAVID I'm freezing. 
He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is excited, even euphoric. 
DAVID Alex, I've lost my mind.  I woke up at the zoo!  But you know what?  I feel terrific! 
ALEX The zoo? 
DAVID Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane.  Having no clothes on?  That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex? 
ALEX Don't you remember? 
DAVID I said goodbye to you.  I was locked out of the flat.  I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! (big smile) I guess I am out of my fucking mind. 
Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his shoulders. 
ALEX I worried about you.  We didn't know where you were. 
David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back with equal passion. 
ALEX Where did you get that coat? 
David laughs. 
73   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE 
Dr. Hirsch is dialing the phone. 
74   INT. ALEX'S FLAT 
The phone rings. 
ALEX I'll get it. 
Alex goes to the phone. 
ALEX Hello? 
The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and Dr. Hirsch. 
DR. HIRSCH Alex, have you heard anything? 
Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her. ALEX He's here. 
DR. HIRSCH (excited) Is he all right?  Why didn't you call me?  Where was he? 
ALEX He doesn't remember.  He woke up at the zoo. 
DR. HIRSCH The zoo?  Is he rational? 
ALEX Yes, he is.  He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean. 
DAVID Pull over. 
ALEX But.... 
DAVID (adamant) Pull over. 
77   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 
The cab pulls to the sidewalk. 
DAVID Pay the man. 
David gets out of the cab. 
ALEX David, wait! 
She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off after David. 
ALEX David, what are you doing? 
DAVID Six people mutilated?  It had to be me, Alex. 
ALEX David, stop! 
He turns and faces her. 
DAVID I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right.  I.... 
ALEX (angry) Jack is dead! 
DAVID Jack is dead.  Look, six people have been killed.  I'm going to the police. 
David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex has to jog to keep up with him. 
ALEX David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch. 
DAVID Rational!?!  I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake! 
He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner. 
DAVID Officer, I killed those people last night. 
BOBBIE (interested) You did, did you? 
Alex runs up. 
ALEX He's playing a stupid joke, sir. 
DAVID (dumbfounded) What? 
ALEX We had an argument.  He's being silly. 
DAVID (desperate) I swear, I don't know this girl. 
BOBBIE All right, you two, move along. 
DAVID Hey, you asshole!  I want you to arrest me! 
BOBBIE There's no call for that kind of language. 
DAVID (shouts) Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit! 
BOBBIE (losing patience) Now see here young man. 
DAVID Shakespeare was French!  The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss! 
The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians start to gather. 
BOBBIE That's quite enough! 
LT. VILLIERS (harried) Gentlemen, please.  We shall find Mr. Kessler as quickly as we're able. 
ALEX He tried to have himself arrested.  He.... 
LT. VILLIERS (interrupts) Getting arrested isn't all that difficult, Miss Price. 
ALEX He wants help.  He.... 
DR. HIRSCH (interrupts) What can we do to assist you? 
LT. VILLIERS (rising) Stay here.  If we need you, we'll know where to reach you. 
He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door. 
LT. VILLIERS I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders.  We will find him, however.  I can assure you of that. 
SGT. McMANUS We'll find him, not to worry. 
The two policemen exit.  Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex. 
ALEX (distraught) What shall we do? 
DR. HIRSCH (comforting) Tea would be nice. 
80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY 
David is in a telephone booth. 
DAVID Yes, operator.  I'd like to call the United States and reverse the charges.  David Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code 315/472-3402.  Thank you. (pause) Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes, you'll accept the charges. Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom or Dad home?  Where are they? Where's Max?  You're all alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me alone when I was ten. No, not ten and a half either. I'm still in London.  I'm all better.  Look, would you tell Mom and Dad that I love them? I don't care, Rachel, just do it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And, Rachel, don't fight with Max. Well, try.  Look, kid, please don't forget to tell Mom and Dad I love them.  I love Max and you, too.  Well, I do. No, I'm not being weird, you little creep.  You promise? Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love you.  Bye. 
He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then catches sight of something. 
81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V. 
There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles, walks across the intersection, and up to the box office. 
TICKET LADY Two and a half quid, please. 
David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's checks. 
DAVID Will you take a traveler's check? 
TICKET LADY No, sorry. 
David signs a $100 check and hands it to her. 
DAVID Keep the change. 
TICKET LADY Well, thank you, sir! 
She gives him a ticket.  David goes in. 
82   INT. CINEMA - DAY 
A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide- eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David goes and sits next to him. 
DAVID Hi, Jack. 
JACK Hi, David. 
They sit for a while watching the screen. 
DAVID What can I say, Jack? 
JACK You don't have to say anything. 
DAVID Aren't you going to say, `I told you so'? 
JACK If I was still alive, I probably would. 
DERELICT #3 So what?  Let `im choke. 
JACK Do you mind?  The man's a friend of mine. 
DERELICT #3 Well he ain't no friend of mine. 
BRINGSLY Gentlemen, please. 
HARRY A gun. 
DERELICT #1 I know where he can get a gun. 
DAVID Don't I need a silver bullet or something? 
JACK Be serious, would you? 
David puts his head in his hands. 
DAVID Madness.  I've gone totally mad. 
HARRY A gun is good. 
JUDITH You just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger. 
BRINGSLY If you put it in your mouth, then you'd be sure not to miss. 
DAVID Thank you, you're all so thoughtful. 
As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head suddenly. 
CUT TO: 
83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT 
The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up. 
84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle staring at him. 
DAVID (gasps out in anguish) Go away!  Please!  Go away! 
The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow more severe. 
DAVID (his face contorting) Run!  Please...run. 
His hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in fascination. 
85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady: TICKET TAKER I'll check on the house. 
He goes inside the theater. 
86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror. 
THE WOLF SPRINGS! 
CUT TO: 
87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT 
From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema through the busy traffic. 
88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

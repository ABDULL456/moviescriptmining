Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman 
adapted from the book 
THE ORCHID THIEF 
by 
Susan Orlean 
September 24, 1999 Second Draft 
EXT. ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY 
Endless barren landscape. No sign of life. The atmosphere is hazy, toxic-looking. Volcanoes erupt. Meteors bombard. Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water. Silence. 
INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CA, FOUR BILLION AND FORTY YEARS LATER 
Beamed ceilings and ostentatious fireplace. A few birthday cards on the mantel, two of them identical: "To Our Dear Son on His Fortieth Birthday." Charlie Kaufman, a fat, balding man in a purple sweater with tags still attached, paces the room. His incantational voice-over carpets the scene. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My toenails have turned strange. I am repulsive. How repulsive? I don't know for I suffer from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I am fat, but am I as fat as I think? My therapist says no, but people lie. I believe others call me Fatty behind my back. Or Fatso. Or, facetiously, Slim. But I also believe this is simply my own perverted form of self-aggrandizement, that no one really talks about me at all. What possible interest is an old, bald, fat man to anyone? I am repulsive. I have never lived. I blame myself. I -- 
EXT. STATE ROAD 29 - DAWN 
A lonely two-lane highway cutting through swampland. 
BRITISH NARRATOR As natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection. 
Suddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve.   It's followed closely by an old green Ford. 
SUBTITLE: STATE ROAD 29, FLORIDA, FIVE YEARS EARLIER 
INT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS 
John Laroche drives. He's a skinny man with no front teeth. The van is piled with bags of potting soil, gardening junk. A Writings of Charles Darwin audio cassette case is on the seat next to Laroche. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRITISH NARRATOR It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing... 
Laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing by. Almost too late, he spots the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road turn-off. The cassette case flies from the seat and half- buries itself in an open bag of peat. 
INT. GREEN FORD - CONTINUOUS 
Nirvana blasts. Russell, Vinson, and Randy, three young Indian men, pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead. 
RUSSELL Laroche is asleep at the wheel. 
RANDY Crazy White Man is now Drowsy White Man. 
They share a stoned laugh. 
EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
SUBTITLE: NEW YORK, TWO YEARS LATER 
Late night street. The click-click of typing. We move slowly up the building to the only glowing window. 
ORLEAN (O.S.) (wistful) John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and sharply handsome despite the fact that he is missing all his front teeth. 
In the window, lit by a single desk lamp, a woman types. 
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
We glide over the desk piled with books about orchids, past a photo of Laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board, and come to rest on a woman typing. It's Susan Orlean: pale, delicate and blond. We lose ourselves in her melancholy beauty. She turns to the camera and talks to us. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ORLEAN Two years ago I went to Florida to meet Laroche after reading a small article about a white man and three Seminole men arrested with rare orchids they'd stolen out of a place called the... 
INT. RANGER'S TRUCK - MID-MORNING 
Tony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license plate on the Ford. He pulls over down the road, and whispers into his C.B. 
TONY We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the swamp. I'm on Janes Scenic Drive just east of Logging Road Twelve. I repeat, Indians in the swamp. 
Tony waits for a response.   Nothing. 
TONY (cont'd) Indians in the swamp. 
Nothing still.   Tony clears his throat into the radio. 
KAUFMAN I think it's great. Your photo in the trades and everything. Pretty cool. 
MARGARET Anyway.    Yeah. So what's up with you? 
KAUFMAN I'm considering jobs. Mostly crap. There's one you might like, about flowers. 
MARGARET Flowers?   Really? What is it? 
KAUFMAN They want me to do an adaptation of a book called The Orchid Thief. 
MARGARET Oh my God! You're kidding?    I read that! I loved that book! 
Kaufman is thrilled; he's scored. Margaret pulls a copy of The Orchid Thief from her bookshelf. 
MARGARET (cont'd) See, see, see! I'm not lying to you! 
KAUFMAN I loved the book. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARGARET Oh, Charlie, orchids are the most amazing flowers. So complex. 
Margaret plops onto the couch next to Kaufman. 
KAUFMAN I know.   They're really great. 
MARGARET You should take this job. Doesn't it sound exciting, to immerse yourself in a real subject and learn everything about it? Blake wrote about seeing heaven in a wild flower. And after you learn all this stuff, you can teach me! 
KAUFMAN (thrilled but controlled) That'd be fun. 
MARGARET God, they're such beautiful flowers.    And so sexy. Y'know? (whispering) Did you know that orchid means -- 
KAUFMAN Testicle.     I just read that. 
MARGARET (shrieks with delight) Testicle! Can you believe it! 
Margaret giggles happily.    Kaufman giggles weirdly. 
MARGARET (cont'd) I swear, it'd be fucking great for someone to have the testicles to make that book into a movie, man. Instead of this bullshit all the time. Something not about sex and violence and car chases and love stories, people learning profound lessons. Jesus, isn't nature enough? 
EXT. SWAMP - MORNING 
Hot, dirty, miserable. Laroche leads the Indians through waist-high black water. He points out a turtle on a rock. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAROCHE Pseudemys floridana. Did you fellas know you fellas believe the world rests on the back of a turtle? Not you fellas specifically. Although, maybe you fellas specifically. That I can't speak to. 
The Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He stops, circles the tree. His eyes widen in reverent awe. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) Polyrrhiza Lindenii. A ghost. 
The Indians come around. Laroche stares at a single beautiful, glowing white flower hanging from the tree.   He tenderly caresses the petals. Then, business-like: 
LAROCHE (cont'd) Cut it down, Russell. 
Russell pulls out a hacksaw, begins sawing through the tree. 
INT. RESTAURANT - MIDDAY 
Kaufman still sweats as he talks to Valerie. 
KAUFMAN ...plus I love the idea of learning all about orchids. I really admire those guys who know everything about ants or fungus or whatever. I'd like to be more like that. See, I tend to write self- involved, self-loathing... even masturbatory stuff. VALERIE And it's wonderful, by the way. 
KAUFMAN Thanks. That's nice to hear. But I need to challenge myself as a writer. I've arrived at an age where I want to think about the world in a different way. 
VALERIE Adapting someone else's work is certainly an opportunity to think differently. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN Yes. And I welcome the challenge of taking a small subject, like orchids, something that would never draw people into a theater and making that fascinating. I want to show people heaven in a wildflower. As Blake wrote. 
INT. PET STORE (1972) - DAY 
SUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, TWENTY-SIX YEARS EARLIER 
A serious ten year old boy walks from cage to aquarium, studying the inhabitants. He turns to his frumpy mother, who's been following at a respectful distance. 
BOY Any one at all, ma? 
She nods sweetly. The boy returns to his search.        He stops at a small turtle in an aquarium. 
BOY (cont'd) I want this then. 
A man lies at the bottom of a cliff, clutching a flower. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) Schroeder fell to his death. 
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
SUBTITLE: RIO HACHA 
A man lies face down near an unplucked orchid. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) Endres was shot dead in Rio Hacha. 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
SUBTITLE: YANGTZE RIVER 
An emaciated, limping, wheezing man with a makeshift bandage wrapped around his head, docks his boat. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) Augustus Margary survived toothache, rheumatism, pleurisy, and dysentery... 
Someone steps from behind a bush, stabs him, steals his boat. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) ... only to be murdered when he completed his mission and traveled beyond Bhamo. 
The murderer sails down river. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) Laroche loved orchids but I came to believe he loved the difficulty and fatality of getting them almost as much as he loved the orchids themselves. 
EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - MORNING 
Tony steps out of his truck.   Laroche smiles warmly. 
TONY Morning. May I ask what you gentlemen have in those pillowcases? 
LAROCHE Yes, sir, you absolutely may. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Laroche goes back to directing the Indians.    Tony's confused. 
TONY Okay, I'm asking then. 
LAROCHE Oh, Okay then! Let's see... (peeking in bags) Five kinds of bromeliad, one peperomia, nine orchid varieties. About a hundred and thirty plants all told, which my colleagues have removed from the swamp. 
TONY You're aware that it's illegal to remove plants or animals from state owned land? 
LAROCHE And don't forget these plants are all endangered, sir. Every one of them. 
TONY Exactly. Well, that's exactly the issue. This is a state preserve. 
LAROCHE Yes, sir, it is. (afterthought) Oh, and my colleagues are all Seminole Indians. Did I mention that? You're familiar, I'm sure, with the State of Florida v. James E. Billie. Tony nods, even though he has no idea. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) So you know that even though Seminole Chief Billie killed a Florida panther, one of, what, forty in the entire world? 
Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation.       They give it. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) The state couldn't successfully prosecute him. Because he's an Indian and it's his right. As repugnant as you or I as white conservationists might find his actions. 
TONY But -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LAROCHE Not to mention the failed attempts on three separate occasions to prosecute Seminoles for poaching palm fronds, which, I believe, they use to thatch the roofs of their traditional chickee huts. 
Laroche again looks to the Indians for confirmation. 
RUSSELL He's right. That's exactly what we use them for. Chickee huts. 
Tony looks at the Indians. 
RANDY Yeah. 
VINSON Yeah. 
RUSSELL Yeah. 
TONY Yeah, but I don't... I can't let you fellas go yet. Just hold on while I... (into radio) Hey, Barry, can I get some help? Barry? 
INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY 
We watch Orlean as she drives out of the Miami Airport parking lot, onto the freeway, past congestion and billboards. Her mournful face glows beautifully, dramatically with golden sunlight. She talks to us. 
ORLEAN Nothing in Florida seems hard or permanent. The developed places are just little clearings in the jungle, but the jungle is unstoppably fertile, everything is always growing or expanding. At the same time, the wilderness disappears before your eyes. 
Orlean gets quiet.   Her eyes tear. 
LAROCHE I'm familiar with the New Yorker. The New Yorker, yes, the New Yorker. Right? ORLEAN Right. So I was interested in doing a piece about your situation down here. 
Laroche scowls, smokes furiously, then, a test: 
LAROCHE Yeah? Put this in: I don't care what goes on here. I'm right, and I'll take this all the way to the Supreme Court. That judge can screw herself. 
Orlean scribbles on her pad. Laroche twists his head to see that she's writing "Judge can screw herself." 
LAROCHE (cont'd) That for real would go in? 
Orlean nods.   Laroche smiles his toothless smile at Orlean. 
EXT. FIELD - MORNING 
MUSIC: lush, profound orchestral piece. 
A glorious orange, large-petalled orchid blooms in dramatic time-lapse. We slowly, lovingly circle the flower. 
SENSUOUS FEMALE NARRATOR The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient family of perennial plants with one fertile stamen and a three petalled flower. In most orchid species, one petal is enlarged into a lip and is the most conspicuous part of the flower. 
INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY 
Kaufman, in a booth, reads his orchid book, takes notes. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient... 
He's bored, looks up, watches a waitress with glorious, orange hair, pouty lips, soulful eyes, and a voluptuous form turning slowly around, scanning her station. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She sees Kaufman, approaches, and smiles warmly down at him. Her badge reads: Alice, Arcadia, CA. Kaufman sweats. 
ALICE So what looks good today? 
KAUFMAN Um. Hi. Thank you. The key lime pie, please. A small slice. I'm watching my... And a coffee, please. Skim milk. 
ALICE (sees book) Orchids! I absolutely love orchids. 
He goes blank. 
KAUFMAN Yes.   They're really great. 
He flinches at his response.    A small awkward pause. 
ALICE So, I'll be right back with your pie. 
She smiles warmly again and leaves.    Kaufman is humiliated. 
EXT. ORCHID SHOW - DAY 
Alice the waitress and Kaufman walk hand-in-hand, inspecting sexy orchids together. She smiles warmly at him. 
ALICE (I love you) I absolutely love orchids. 
INT. EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman finishes jerking off.   He lies lonely in the dark. 
INT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - EVENING 
Dark and muted. The seven year old girl is pushed on the swing by her father. From the air she sees her mother, tiny and lost, sitting across the yard smoking. 
EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Orlean leans against a car and smokes. A tiny, lost figure. There's a honk. Orlean snaps out of her reverie to see Laroche screeching to a stop in his banged-up van. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ORLEAN (to camera) A few days after the hearing, Laroche took me to an orchid show in Miami. 
She opens the passenger door. 
ORLEAN (cont'd) Hi.   Thanks for picking -- 
LAROCHE I want you to know this van is a piece of shit. When I hit the jackpot, I'll buy myself an awesome car, maybe an Aurora. 
Orlean nods, climbs in, and tries to rearrage some of the junk on the front seat so she'll have a place to sit. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) Sit on top of that. You won't hurt it. 
She situates herself on the seat.     Laroche lurches off. 
INT. VAN - DAY 
Laroche drives manically. Orlean watches the road and holds one hand against the dashboard. 
INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kaufman talks to the therapist. 
KAUFMAN I'm successful, right? I mean, I could say to a woman, I'm a screenwriter and she'd look at me differently. I could get laid. But I want someone to like me. For me. Y'know?    The way I like them. The way I'd do anything for that woman walking down the street. A million women walking down the street. I don't need to know what their jobs are. No one will ever love me like that. Like I love almost every woman I see. 
Kaufman glances down at his therapist's breasts. He does it fast and unintentionally. He quickly shifts back to her face. His therapist wraps her shawl around her. 
INT. SHOW HALL - DAY 
Crowded with orchid lovers. Noisy chatter and calliope music. Elaborate displays include orchids on a ferris wheel, plastic clowns, and a booth that looks like a circus big top. 
LAROCHE Once you get the sickness, it takes over your life. I started out just photographing 'em. Now look at me. (dramatic pause) It'll happen to you. You'll see. 
ORLEAN I don't think so.     I'm not prone to -- 
Laroche runs over to a flower. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAROCHE Angraecum sesquipedale! Beauty! God! Darwin wrote about this one. Charles Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello? 
ORLEAN (annoyed) I know who Darwin is. 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A depressed Kaufman fishes on his floor through an ever increasing pile of books: books about turtles, mirror resilvering, tropical fish, Hegel, etc. He picks up The Portable Darwin. The cover features a daguerreotype of Darwin. Kaufman paces and reads. 
INT. BOOK-LINED STUDY - NIGHT 
SUBTITLE: ENGLAND, ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEARS EARLIER 
Sepia.   A sickly Darwin writes at his desk. 
DARWIN (V.O.) Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed. 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman looks off into space, thinking. Silence. Suddenly, he grabs his mini-recorder and paces like a caged animal. 
KAUFMAN Okay, opening of movie. Four billion years ago. Life has not begun. Endless, barren terrain. Silence. Silence. 
EXT. SHOW HALL - DAY 
Blasting music.   Crowds.   Laroche shows the flower to Orlean. 
LAROCHE See that nectary all the way down there? Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose twelve inches long to pollinate it. Everyone thought he was a loon. Then, sure enough, they found this moth with a twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means nose, by the way -- and -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ORLEAN I know what proboscis means. 
LAROCHE Every one of these flowers has a specific relationship with the insect that pollinates it. There's an orchid that looks exactly like this particular insect. So the bug humps the flower and gets covered with its pollen. Thusly... 
Laroche mimes humping. 
ORLEAN I get it. 
LAROCHE That's called pseudo-copulation. These flowers are smart! You gotta fall in love with them. Once you learn anything about orchids, you'll devote your life to learning everything about them. 
Orlean looks around: people sniffing flowers, feeling petals, staring deep into nectaries. People jabber passionately, people buy plants, people carry boxes of purchased plants. Orlean looks deeply into various flowers, at a dizzying array of colors and shapes, but remains detached. 
INT. APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING 
Orlean stares at photos of orchids on her bulletin board. She can't find a way in. She looks over at her husband reading. He smiles at her. She smiles back, but there's a terrible distance between them. She looks at us sadly. 
ORLEAN I wanted to want something as much as people wanted these plants but it isn't part of my constitution. 
Orlean stares out the window at the empty street below.   A plastic bag dips and rises in the breeze. She inhales. 
ORLEAN (cont'd) I suppose I do have one unembarrassed passion. (beat, looks back at us) I want to know how it feels to care about something passionately. 
EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - NIGHT 
The seven year old girl swings sadly by herself. From high up she sees her mother in a window at one end of the house, her father in a window at the other end. Both stare blankly in opposite directions. The swing completes it's arc and the girl descends, losing sight of her parents. 
INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman types furiously.   He's a sweaty mess. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) ... then, after the entire history of life on the planet, in the last seconds of the montage, we see the whole of human history: tool-making, hunting, farming, war, lust, religion, self-consciousness. Yearning. Then, bam! cut to Susan Orlean writing a book about orchids. And the story begins. It's perfect! It's circular! It's everything! 
He reads back what he's written. 
KAUFMAN (CONT'D) I'm an idiot. I'm fat. I hate my-- 
CUSTOMER #2 Johnny baby! 
LAROCHE Henry! Look at that Dracula vampira! It's gorgeous, man. 
Other customers gather around. 
CUSTOMER #2 Take me in to the Fakahatchee. Show me a ghost in bloom, and it's yours. 
LAROCHE Cool. 
CUSTOMER #3 Mr. Laroche, would you be able to -- 
Laroche picks up a ringing phone. Customer #3 continues to try and get his attention while he talks. 
LAROCHE Bromeliad Tree. Hey, Dora! Good, good. Well, sure, you gotta watch the temperature. Don't want an odontoglossum above seventy-five. Uh-huh, that should be fine. Yeah, damp it down. Oh, I'm doing well. She's fine, too. Sure... 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
Laroche drives.    Orlean looks out at the dark night. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAROCHE I believe some folks'd call me up to talk and just talk because they were lonely. 
Orlean looks at him.     After a long silence, Laroche muses: 
LAROCHE (cont'd) You know why I love plants? Because they're so mutable, so adaptable. Adaptation is such a profound process. (beat) Adaptation means you figure out how to survive in the world. People aren't too good at that sometimes. 
INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kaufman sits with his agent Jerry in a glass-walled office. 
KAUFMAN I don't know how to adapt this. I should've just stuck with my own stuff. I don't know why I thought I could -- 
JERRY See her?   I fucked her up the ass. 
Jerry waves at a passing beauty. She waves back, keeps walking. Kaufman follows the girl's ass with his eyes. 
JERRY Just kidding. Hey, maybe I can help. What's the problem, buddy? 
Kaufman looks at Jerry.     Will he accept help from an agent? 
KAUFMAN It's about flowers. 
JERRY It's not only about flowers. It's got that crazy plant nut guy. He's funny, right? 
Kaufman pulls out a folded newspaper clipping, reads: 
KAUFMAN "There is not nearly enough of him to fill a book," blah blah blah, so Orlean "digresses in long passes" blah blah blah "no narrative really unites these passages." Blah blah blah blah blah. (looking up defiantly) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: KAUFMAN (cont'd) New York Times Book Review. I can't structure this. It's that sprawling New Yorker shit. 
Jerry gets distracted by another sexy woman walking by. 
JERRY Oh man.   I'd fuck her up the ass. 
KAUFMAN There's no story. The book has no story. 
JERRY So make one up. The book's a jumping off point. No one in town can make up a crazy story like you. You're the king. 
KAUFMAN I didn't want to do that this time. It's someone else's material. I have a responsibility... Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer, do something profound and simple. Show people how amazing flowers are. 
JERRY Are they amazing? 
KAUFMAN I don't know. I think they are. 
JERRY Look, what I tell a lot of guys is pick another film and use it as a model. I always thought this one could be like Apocalypse Now. The journalist spends the whole movie searching for the crazy plant nut guy -- what's his name? 
KAUFMAN John Laroche. 
JERRY She has to travel deep into the darkest swamps to find the mysterious "Laroche." 
KAUFMAN I need you to get me out of this. 
JERRY Charlie, at the end of the day, I think it would be a terrible career move. 
MONTAGE 
Jumble of images: Laroche talking, flowers, Indians, Orlean, the trial. The rapid fire click-click of typing. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) Okay, okay, we open with Laroche. He's funny. Okay, he says, okay, he says, I love to mutate plants, he says, mutation is fun... Okay, we show flowers and, okay, we have to have the court case. Okay we show Laroche, okay, he says, I was mutated as baby, that's why I'm so smart...that's funny. Okay we open at the beginning of time...no, okay, we open with Laroche driving into the swamp... 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman awakes with a start. Enthusiastic off-screen typing. Kaufman peers through the darkness at the books, papers coffee cups, and dirty plates all around. 
EXT. SWAMP - DAY 
The phone rings. 
KAUFMAN (CONT'D) What? 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Charlie?   It's Valerie. 
KAUFMAN Oh, hi.    Hi. Hey!   Hi! 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Sorry to bug you. We were just talking about you, how excited we are. 
KAUFMAN Yeah, me too. 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) So it's coming along good? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN It's good. It's complicated what I'm trying to do, but it's going very well. 
INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Orlean looks at a book called The Native Orchids of Florida. She comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the page. Orlean's husband walks by with a cup of coffee, caresses her shoulder. She tenses slightly, smiles up at him apologetically. He smiles back sadly. She returns to the photo. A line of text catches her eye: "Should one be lucky enough to see a flower all else will seem eclipsed." Orlean closes the book, sits there. She dials the phone. 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) Yeah. 
ORLEAN Hello, John? It's Susan. 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) Susie-Q! 
ORLEAN So I was thinking it'd be good for the article for me to go into the Fakahatchee to see a ghost. Would you take me? 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) I'd love to, but, hey, I'm banned for the next six months. Goddamn crucified me. Get one of them monkey-suited rangers to take you. 'Course, they wouldn't be able to locate a ghost, if it climbed off a tree and shoved itself up their ass. Hey, put that in the article. 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING 
A hollow-eyed Kaufman is zipping up a suitcase. 
KAUFMAN (calling off-screen) Travelling into the Fakahatchee, Donald, is a perfect metaphor for writing. I'm stepping into the confusion of the unknown. I'm taking the big risk here. 
INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Donald types cheerily on a lap-top computer at an ergonomic desk. Kaufman descends the stairs with his suitcase. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN It's dark, dangerous, as dense as steel wool. I don't know if I'll come out alive, but if I do, I'll have something true to give the world. That's the difference between writing and aping some moron's "principles." 
Donald looks up from his work.      He hasn't been listening. 
DONALD Hey, Charles, I'm thinking of putting a song in. Y'know like when characters sing pop songs in their pajamas and dance around. I thought it might be a nice way to break the tension. So, try to think of a song about split personality... 
INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING 
Orlean sits in her seat and addresses the camera. 
ORLEAN You would have to want something very badly... 
INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 
Kaufman reads The Orchid Thief. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) ... to go looking for it in the Fakahatchee Strand. 
He can't concentrate, closes the book and watches a stewardess tending to another passenger. 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Kaufman fixes a salad in the kitchenette. The door opens and the stewardess enters dragging her luggage on a little cart. 
KAUFMAN Hey!    How was Denver? 
STEWARDESS Oh, God, sweetie, I'm so glad to be home. 
She kisses him, looks lovingly at him. 
STEWARDESS (cont'd) Can I get you something to drink? 
INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman finishes jerking off, stands, pulls up his pants, adjusts himself, and exits the bathroom. 
INT. AIRPLANE - CONTINUOUS 
Kaufman steps out of the bathroom. The stewardess is there talking to another stewardess. She regards Kaufman blankly, then goes back to her conversation. He heads up the aisle. One of the stewardesses laughs. He tenses, takes his seat. 
INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING 
EXT. SWAMP - LATER 
Mike Owen holds a handful of peat.   Kaufman looks at it. 
MIKE OWEN The oldest carbon dating they've done on any of the peat out here is fifty-seven hundred years. That's with carbon-14. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MIKE OWEN (cont'd) That's in the right age where you can really date things accurately with carbon- 14, because it's half-life is fifty-five hundred years, so they must have found have of it gone and figured that... 
KAUFMAN Why isn't it wet? Orlean wrote about wading through black, corrosive water. She said it was the scariest experience of her life. And when I spoke to you on the phone, you said wear heavy boots, long pants and... 
MIKE OWEN There's usually water. We've been going through a bit of a drought. Say, have you seen that movie, Medicine Man? That's a good movie about protecting nature. It shows there could be something important in a rain forest we don't even know about, like a cure for cancer. 
KAUFMAN It's not even hot. I was expecting it to be awful. Sun beating down, wading through water, looking out for snakes, wild hogs. I was thinking it would be dramatic. Alligators. Something! 
MIKE OWEN The alligators are over by the lakes. The temperature's a blessing for us. This time of year can get uncomfortably hot. (pointing excitedly) Green anole. Florida's most common. 
Kaufman looks down and sees a plain-looking little lizard hanging on a tree. Mike Owen jots it down in his notebook. 
MIKE OWEN (cont'd) I try to keep a log of sightings. 
INT. TRUCK - DAY 
Mike Owen drives.    Kaufman stares out the window at boring trees. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) It had been a hard day and I hadn't seen what I'd come to see. Maybe the ghost orchid was a ghost after all. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) There are certainly ghosts in the Fakahatchee -- ghosts of rangers who were murdered years ago by illegal plume hunters, and of loggers who were cut to pieces in fights, and for years there has been an apparition wandering the swamp, the Swamp Ape, which is said to be seven feet tall and seven hundred pounds and have the physique of a human, the posture of an ape, and the body odor of a skunk. 
EXT. RANGER SHACK - DAY 
Kaufman and Owen stand by Kaufman's car. 
MIKE OWEN What Laroche did was wrong. Those flowers belong to all of us, all 250 million of us -- 250? I think it's up to 270 now -- And belonging to all of us means they belong to none of us. Nobody has a right to take them. Not me, not you, not John Laroche, not... 
Kaufman is desperate for something else.    He blurts: 
KAUFMAN Listen, um, Susan Orlean wrote about a legendary creature called a Swamp Ape. Have you ever heard stories or -- 
MIKE OWEN (pissy) Tourist garbage! I don't know why people need to invent silly creatures to make nature fascinating. Isn't nature amazing enough? 
KAUFMAN (shamed) I just asked because she mentioned it. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Orlean, still dirty from the swamp, holds a phone to her ear and talks to us. She has cute little dirt smudges on her face. 
ORLEAN That night I called Laroche. 
ORLEAN (into phone) I didn't see anything but bare roots. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ORLEAN (cont'd) And I had this thought. Maybe the ghost orchid only blooms in the minds of people who've walked too long in the swamp. 
INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Orlean types. It's pouring and sheets of rain beat against her window. She glances at her husband, across the room reading a book. She sighs, continues typing. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) What I didn't say to him is that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - EVENING 
Kaufman drives down a Florida strip-malled highway. He passes a Barnes and Noble, a Burger King, a Starbucks. He parks in front of a California Pizza Kitchen. 
INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN (FLORIDA) - EVENING 
Kaufman watches the waitresses. One approaches his booth. Her name badge reads: Caryn, Tampa, FL. She smiles at Kaufman as she looks right through him. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
A morose Kaufman sits on the bed reading The Orchid Thief. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) What I didn't say to him was that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach. 
Kaufman is deeply moved. He hi-lites the passage, then looks at the smiling photo of Orlean. He finds himself lost in it. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Orlean, dirty from the swamp, is on the phone. 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) (beat,clears throat) Jesus Christ, of course there are ghost orchids out there! I've stolen them! (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) (cont'd) (beat, a cleared throat) You should have gone with me. 
CLOSE-UP OF MAGAZINE 
The line: "... then he cleared his throat and said: 'You should have gone with me.'" VALERIE (O.C.) Beautifully written. A really unique piece. 
PULL BACK TO: 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LAROCHE We'll get into plant multiplication. Buy little ones, turn 'em into big ones, sell 'em at a profit. Simple plant multiplication for the masses. 
BAXLEY John, we're thinking maybe now's a good time for you to take a few weeks. 
LAROCHE I don't need a vacation, Buster. 
BAXLEY It's a good time.   Things are slow. 
Laroche stares at Buster.   Buster stares back. 
LAROCHE Y'know, the guys on my crew here, all they do is smoke weed all day. I been meaning to talk to you about that. So if it's a question of productivity -- 
INT. VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Laroche weaves through traffic.   Orlean holds on. 
LAROCHE They're gonna fire me. Goddamn politics. Crazy White Man's bad publicity. (pounds steering wheel) I can't believe I'm dealing with this! (pounds steering wheel) Like I could give a damn. If they fire me, I'll sue. I already did some legal research on this when I was doing the other shit. They can't fire me. And I ain't going to quit. 
MONTAGE 
Gray skies. Kaufman drives his rental car: he looks at the Seminole Nursery, the Collier County Courthouse, Laroche's house. He drives through swampy terrain. He walks around at an orchid show, he attends a slide-show orchid lecture. It's all dull. He ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach, staring out at the ocean. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Orlean dials the phone.   It rings for a long time.    Finally: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) (groggy) Yeah? 
ORLEAN John, it's Susan. (waits for response) Orlean. (waits) So, I was just wondering if you might be willing to talk some more. 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) What about? 
Orlean rolls her eyes. 
ORLEAN C'mon, John, I'm trying to put together a book. Don't just abandon me down here. 
LAROCHE I'm no longer interested in orchids. I'm pursuing other avenues. I apologize for any inconvenience this might cause you. 
Orlean is silent, taps her fingers on the bedside table. 
LAROCHE Thank you for your time. 
Laroche hangs up. Orlean sits there for a moment, flips through her list of orchid collector names. 
EXT. EMPTY BEACH - DAY 
Kaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean. An attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in German. He watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something. He doesn't get it. They're gone. A tan older man sits on the bench, lights a cigarette. Kaufman continues to look at the ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him. He doesn't want to engage. 
GUY ON BENCH We could use the rain, huh? 
Kaufman nods, looking at the ocean.      Pause. 
GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) So you from around here? 
Kaufman shakes his head "no."   Pause. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) So where then? 
KAUFMAN California. 
GUY ON BENCH (excitedly) Yeah? I'm moving to L.A. I just wrote a screenplay. I sent it to a lot of agents. But if they turn me down, I'll go there and market it myself. I used to be in marketing in New York, so I know exactly how to sell this thing. (beat) Where's a nice place to live if you don't have a car? 
KAUFMAN You kind of need a car. I guess West Hollywood would be okay. 
GUY ON BENCH So you recommend West Hollywood then. 
KAUFMAN I'm not recommending it. 
Pause. 
GUY ON BENCH I moved down here for a change, and I wrote the screenplay. Just like that. It's a great idea. 
The old guy waits for a response.    He gets none. 
GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) It's about a mob guy, but it's not your regular mob story. There's a twist. A cop tells this mob guy's wife that the mob guy's cheating on her. But the truth is, the cop's lying because he wants her for himself. See, they used to go together in high school. (waits for response, then:) You know anything about screenplays? 
Kaufman shakes his head. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: DONALD (cont'd) Oh, I made you a copy of McKee's Ten Commandments. I've posted one over both our work areas. 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Kaufman tears down MCKEE'S TEN COMMANDMENTS. Donald appears backlit in the doorway and seems oddly threatening. 
DONALD You shouldn't have done that. 
They look at each other.    Donald breaks the tension, smiles. 
DONALD (cont'd) 'Cause it's extremely helpful. (lies down on floor) Hey, any sign of that Swamp Ape? 
KAUFMAN There is no Swamp Ape. It was invented for people who can't find the actual world fascinating. Y'know? 
DONALD Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Sorry. Hey, I got a song! "Happy Together." I was worried about putting a song in a thriller, but Bob says, Casablanca, the greatest screenplay ever written, did exactly that. Mixed genres. 
KAUFMAN I need to go to bed, Donald.    I haven't slept in a week. 
DONALD Okay. 
Donald remains on the floor. 
MONTAGE SEQUENCE 
Mishmash of images: alligators snapping, Laroche jabbering, Orlean typing, 19th century orchid poachers slogging, orchids blooming, Mike Owen lecturing. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) ... so we open the swamp... okay, flashback to young Laroche had turtles... Okay, Susan says What Is Passion? And okay we open on a swamp and suddenly a white van comes tearing around... 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman lies half-awake in bed, sweating, his eyes darting back and forth. He looks over at the clock. It's 3:32. 
KAUFMAN Damn it. 
Donald snores happily off-screen.   Kaufman switches on a lamp, pulls The Orchid Thief from his bag, flips through it. There are now many yellow hi-lited passages. He reads one. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) There are too many ideas and things and people, too many directions to go. I was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size. 
KAUFMAN Such sweet, sad insights.   So true. 
Kaufman flips to the glowing, smiling author photo. 
KAUFMAN And you're... I like looking at you. 
He stares at the photo.   Its smile broadens.    It talks. 
ORLEAN PHOTO I like looking at you, too.   Charlie. 
The photo smiles warmly at him.   Kaufman begins to jerk-off. He closes his eyes. 
Then: Kaufman and Orlean are in his bed together, making love. She smiles at him throughout. They finish. 
Then: Kaufman is alone in bed, heaving. He looks at the still smiling photo. It somehow seems sleepy now. 
KAUFMAN I don't know how to do this. I'm afraid I'll disappoint you. You've written a beautiful book. I can't sleep. I'm losing my hair. I'm fat and repulsive -- 
ORLEAN PHOTO Shhh. You're not. Whittle it down, focus on one thing in the story, find the thing you care passionately about and write about that. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Kaufman studies her delicate, melancholy face.      He's in love. 
ORLEAN PHOTO (cont'd) (sweet, flirty smile) I figured there might be something... 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Kaufman paces and talks animatedly into his mini-recorder. 
KAUFMAN We see Susan Orlean, delicate, fragile, beautiful, haunted by loneliness, typing at her desk. She looks at the camera and talks to us: "John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch- shouldered..." 
Donald enters in his underwear, pours coffee. 
DONALD Morning. 
KAUFMAN Hey, hey. 
DONALD You seem chipper. 
KAUFMAN I'm good.     I have some new ideas. 
DONALD Cool. Me too. I'm putting in a chase sequence now. The killer flees on horseback with the girl. The cop is after them on a motorcycle. It's like a battle between motors and horses. 
KAUFMAN They're all still one person, right? 
DONALD Yeah, hey, that's the big pay-off. 
KAUFMAN (nice) Well, it sounds exciting. 
KAUFMAN Good.     I think really good now. 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Great.    So I spoke to Susan yesterday. 
KAUFMAN (beat) Oh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) I told her you were making terrific progress and she's really excited to read the script. 
Sweat appears on Kaufman's brow. 
KAUFMAN Oh.   Good. 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) And she said she'd love to meet you. 
All color drains from Kaufman's face. 
KAUFMAN Um, well, y'know, for me it's distracting to... or confusing to discuss what I'm exploring in the screenplay at this point... before I finish... it. So... 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) That's fair. I'll let her know. 
KAUFMAN Tell Susan I'd be very happy to meet her at a future date. As she sees fit. 
VALERIE (PHONE VOICE) Okay.   Good enough. 
KAUFMAN And tell her how much I love her book. Say I think she's such a great writer. 
VALERIE (cont'd) Will do.   Just keep us posted, Charlie. 
KAUFMAN Okay.   Nice talking to you.   Okay then. 
Kaufman hangs up and looks at the photo of Orlean. It's still smiling, but not at him. It's not glowing. Maybe it's even smirking. Kaufman paces frantically, holding his stomach. Donald's off-screen typing grows louder. 
INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Donald types at his desk on his computer.    Kaufman storms in. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN You can sit here and pretend to be a writer, mocking the seriousness of what I do, like some kind of fucking funhouse mirror version of me! But let me tell you, you don't know what writing is! 
Kaufman grabs his stomach, doubles over. 
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 
Kaufman is on a gurney and hooked up to an IV. He watches a slightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a small room across the hall. She glances over in his direction. He smiles. She looks through him. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) She thinks I'm repulsive. 
He lies there for a moment, then his eyes light up. 
INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY 
Kaufman types passionately on his computer. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) Movie opens.: Charlie Kaufman, fat, old, bald, paces the room. His voice-over carpets the scene. "I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My toenails have turned strange. I am repulsive. How repulsive? I don't know for I suffer from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder." 
INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kaufman, looking tired and wild-eyed, sits with his agent. 
JERRY ... we need to talk about the orchid script. Valerie called yesterday. They're getting antsy. 
KAUFMAN I think I've got it on track now. 
JERRY Good.   She said you sounded weird. 
KAUFMAN No Hollywood bullshit. Just raw truth. Sometimes that takes a while to find. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JERRY Okay.    What's the time frame here? 
KAUFMAN It's goddamned honest, Jerry.   It's true. 
JERRY Oh, hey, my friend sent me this fucked- up internet thing. It's a girl taking a shit, but a trout comes out. You got e- mail yet? I'll send it to you. 
KAUFMAN This is more honest than anything anyone's ever done before in a movie, I'll tell you that. The only truth we can offer is the truth that's our own experience of the world. "The great poet, in writing himself, writes his time." T.S. Eliot. 
JERRY It sounds good, buddy. But we do need to give Valerie a ballpark -- 
KAUFMAN I'm sick of their constant harassment! 
DONALD (cont'd) So would you show it to your agent? 
Kaufman grabs Donald's script and throws it on his bed. 
DONALD (cont'd) Thanks. Also, I wanted to thank you for your idea. It was very helpful. I changed it a little. Now the killer cuts off body pieces and makes the victims eat them.   It's, like, I once saw this picture of a snake swallowing it's tail -- 
Kaufman collapses, puts his head in his hands. 
KAUFMAN Ourobouros. 
DONALD I don't know what that means. 
KAUFMAN The snake is called Ourobouros. 
DONALD I don't think so. But it's cool for my killer to have this modus operandi. Because at the end when he forces the woman, who's really just him, to eat herself, he's also eating himself to death. 
KAUFMAN I'm insane. I'm Ourobouros. 
DONALD I don't know what that is. 
KAUFMAN I've written myself into my screenplay. It's eating itself. I'm eating myself. 
DONALD Oh.   That's kinda weird. 
KAUFMAN It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic. It's solipsistic. It's pathetic. I'm pathetic. I'm fat and pathetic. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DONALD I'm sure you had a good reason, Charles. You're an artist. 
KAUFMAN The reason is I'm too timid to speak to the woman who wrote the book. Because I'm pathetic. Because I have no idea how to write. Because I can't make flowers fascinating. Because I suck. 
DONALD Hey, am I in the script, too? 
KAUFMAN I'm going to New York. I'll meet her. That's it. That's what I have to do. 
DONALD Don't get mad at me for saying this, Charles, but Bob's got a seminar in New York this weekend. So if you're stuck -- 
Kaufman shoots Donald a look. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER 
The lights are off.   Orlean is in bed, sleeping fitfully. 
INT. PLANE - NIGHT 
Kaufman reads Ann Landers's column in a paper dated July 4th. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) Give yourself a reality check. Phoniness is transparent, and it is tiresome. Take pleasure in the beauty and wonders of nature. A flower is God's miracle. 
Out the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below, like small flowers blooming on the black earth. His eyes well with tears. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman sleeps fitfully. 
EXT. SWAMP - DAY 
Orlean walks through alone, panicked. All the vegetation is greener and crazier-looking than we've seen before. Things slither by in the water, brush up against her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate herself. She falls face forward into the black water. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Orlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs. She heaves, looks at the clock. It's 3:30. She stares at the ceiling. She looks at the clock again. It's 3:30. She looks at the clock again. It's 4:10. She closes her eyes. She opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with murky water, the bed an island of dryness. An alligator pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the bed. Orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard. The room is back to normal. The clock reads 4:23. She closes her eyes. The alarm goes off. 
EXT. LAROCHE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING 
Orlean pulls up to the curb where Laroche stands, dressed in a short sleeve shirt, thin pants, and his Miami Hurricanes hat. He opens the door and climbs in. 
ORLEAN Where are our supplies? 
LAROCHE Got everything I need right here. 
Laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering wheel. Laroche shrugs. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) Look, don't worry about it. We'll get crap at the Indian trading post on Alligator Alley. Hey, want me to drive? 
INT. CAR - A BIT LATER 
The sun has come up strong. It looks hot. Laroche speeds along with one finger on the wheel, paying little attention to the road. The car veers onto the shoulder, he lazily corrects it. Orlean is tense. 
LAROCHE I remember one time when I was a kid, fifteen or so, my mother and I came to the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to photograph. We walked for hours, through the most intense heat I'd ever felt.   We couldn't find one. I wanted to turn back. But my mom said, no. (MORE) 
LAROCHE We're not lost. 
EXT. NYC STREET - DAY 
Orlean window shops at a shoe store.   Kaufman takes notes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) Eyeing Stuart Weitzman pumps.    Okay. 
Orlean heads down the street. Kaufman follows. She enters the New Yorker building. Kaufman waits outside. 
EXT. SWAMP - DAY 
The sun is hot. Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean. She watches him march forward with great authority. She massages her eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Kaufman reviews his notes.       He is sweaty and wild-eyed. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) I have nothing. I am nothing.     I am fat. I am over. I am lost. 
EXT. SWAMP    - LATER 
The sun is high. Orlean and Laroche sit on dry ground. She stares at him. Laroche won't look at her. He busies himself opening the backpack and pulling out food. Finally, Laroche speaks without looking up. 
LAROCHE We're not lost. 
Laroche takes out a cigarette, lights it. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) I'm just turned around a little. 
He looks up at her, sees her staring at him. He pokes around on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) A sundial. I'll just set this up, wait a few minutes, and we'll be able to tell which way the sun is moving. We want to be heading southeast. 
Laroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) This is no big deal. You should eat something. 
Orlean takes a cracker. This relaxes Laroche. He stretches his legs, knocks over the twig. Without looking at Orlean, he puts the twig back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAROCHE (cont'd) So do you collect anything? 
ORLEAN (non-responsive) Not really. 
LAROCHE Well, y'know it's not really about collecting the thing, it's about -- 
ORLEAN The sundial isn't working. 
Laroche looks down at it. 
LAROCHE It is so working. 
Orlean stares at the twig in the ground. She looks at Laroche. Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean. Rage and panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls. Her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her brain. Laroche seems unaware. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) The thing about computers. The thing I like is that I'm immersed in it but it's not a living thing that's going to leave or die or something. I prefer having the minimum number of living things to worry about in my life. 
Orlean's anger softens.    She looks sadly at Laroche. 
ORLEAN So, John... 
LAROCHE Okay, fuck the sundial. We'll just go straight and eventually we'll get there. 
They rise. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) What I mean is we'll get somewhere. Out of here. I mean, logically, we have to get out as long as we walk straight. 
Laroche points them in a direction and they walk. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
Kaufman is sleeping. It looks like it's been a rough night. The phone rings. He reaches for it. 
KAUFMAN Hello? 
JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE) Hey, it's Jerry. I woke you? 
KAUFMAN No, it's okay. 
JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE) How's it going? Has it been helpful to talk to the writer? What's her name? 
KAUFMAN Yeah.    Susan Orlean. 
MCKEE God fucking help you! It's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character. You must present the internal conflicts of your character in image, in symbol. Film is a medium of movement and image. 
Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. "Any idiot..." writes the guy on one side of him. "Flaccid..." writes the guy on the other side. 
MCKEE (cont'd) Okay, one hour for lunch. 
EXT. NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Students exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman wanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound. 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 
McKee lectures. Kaufman sits and listens. A copy of Aristotle's Poetics sits on his lap. The book features a bust of Aristotle on the cover. 
MCKEE You want your writing to be original. You want to have an original voice like Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let me tell you something, my friends. The key to originality is not eccentricity. 
A guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative "mmmm." 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 
It's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now Kaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears his sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly planted on his face as he talks and talks. 
MCKEE Long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema. The Greeks called it stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of ideas. A long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute. Look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and you'll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience. The ontology of the screen is that it's always now and it's always action and it's always vivid. Life is rarely vivid. And that's an important point. We are not recreating life on the screen. Writers are not tape recorders. Have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop? Then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is. Real people are not interesting. There's not a person in this world -- and I include myself in this -- who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER STILL 
McKee faces the audience, holding a cup of coffee. 
MCKEE Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty. 
He pauses theatrically, sips his coffee, then: 
MCKEE (cont'd) (deadpan) Michelle Pfeiffer is proof, my friends, that there's a fucking God. 
The overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter. Kaufman, with dark circles under his eyes, giggles a little. 
MCKEE (cont'd) Okay. That's it for tonight. Remember, there'll be a Q and A tomorrow morning before class starts. 
INT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Kaufman tosses and turns in bed. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DREAM-LIKE FIELD - DAY 
The daguerreotype Darwin, the Aristotle sculpture, the Hegel engraving, and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight. 
INT. AUDITORIUM - MORNING 
Kaufman, bleary-eyed, sits in the back.   McKee paces. 
MCKEE Anyone else? 
Kaufman timidly raises his hand. 
MCKEE (cont'd) Yes? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN You talked about Crisis as the ultimate decision a character makes, but what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved. More a reflection of the real world -- 
MCKEE The real world? The real fucking world? First of all, if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis, you'll bore your audience to tears. Secondly: Nothing happens in the real world? Are you out of your fucking mind? People are murdered every day! There's genocide and war and corruption! Every fucking day somewhere in the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else! Every fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else! People find love! People lose it, for Christ's sake! A child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church! Someone goes hungry! Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman! If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don't know much about life! And why the fuck are you taking up my precious two hours with your movie? I don't have any use for it! I don't have any bloody use for it! 
KAUFMAN Okay, thanks. 
EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT 
The last of the students are filing out. Kaufman waits, leaning against the building. McKee emerges, carrying his brown leather bag. A shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him. 
KAUFMAN Mr. McKee? 
MCKEE Yes? 
KAUFMAN I'm the guy you yelled at this morning. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MCKEE (trying to recall) I need more. 
KAUFMAN I was the one who thought things didn't happen in life. 
DONALD (PHONE VOICE) I want to thank you for all your help. 
KAUFMAN I wasn't any help. 
DONALD (PHONE VOICE) C'mon, you let me stay in your place and your integrity inspired me to even try. 
KAUFMAN Well, look, I've been thinking, maybe you'd be interested in hanging out with me in New York for a few days. 
DONALD (PHONE VOICE) Oh my God, yes! I'm flattered! 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
Donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the script. Kaufman paces. Donald finishes, is quiet. 
KAUFMAN So, like, what would you do? 
DONALD Script kind of makes fun of me, huh? 
KAUFMAN Sorry.   I was trying something.   I -- 
DONALD Hey, I don't mind.   It's funny. 
KAUFMAN Okay.    So, what would you do? 
DONALD You and me are so different, Charles. We're different talents. 
KAUFMAN I know. Just for fun. How would the great Donald end this script? 
DONALD (giggling) The great Donald. (serious) Well, I mean... do you need the whole court case? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN Uh, it's what happened to Laroche.   It's kind of important. 
DONALD It's boring. No offense. A courtroom scene should be dramatic. Stick the ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe. 
KAUFMAN Um.   Okay. 
DONALD Too much about orchids. Get rid of it. Pare that stuff down to a minimum. Frankly, I'd focus more on the relationship between the brothers. I think that's the gold here. No one cares about orchids. 
KAUFMAN The book's about orchids. 
DONALD That's a problem. But don't let it ruin the movie. I mean, for example, use the orchids in a more dramatic way. Have some kind of bang-up, crazy action sequence in the swamp. Use the swamp better. It's a tremendous fictional world. A setting of great dramatic possibility. 
KAUFMAN That's true. But -- 
DONALD And put some twists in. Reveal some surprising thing about Laroche. God, what am I doing giving suggestions to you? I mean you're like a seasoned professional. You're an artist. 
KAUFMAN C'mon, you're the "mill-five" kid. 
DONALD (enjoying this) Shut up! (thinks) I love the Laroche porno web-site stuff. Is that real? Maybe make a bigger deal of that. I don't know. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
KAUFMAN I think it's real.   I haven't actually seen the site. 
DONALD It's sex, man! Incorporate it. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
The front door opens and Kaufman enters. The lights are off, but the room is aglow with light from Donald's laptop computer. Kaufman sees a silhouetted Donald masturbating in front of the computer. Donald looks up, caught. 
DONALD Oh, hi, I was doing some research.   I found Laroche's site and... I'm embarrassed. 
KAUFMAN Jesus, Donald. 
Kaufman passes Donald, glances at the grainy nude on the screen. He's stunned. It's Orlean smiling at him. 
DONALD What? She's kinda cute. You don't like her? I dunno, I think she's okay. It's not like I'm marrying her. 
Kaufman shows Donald Orlean's book jacket photo. 
DONALD (cont'd) Oh, wow.   That's kind of a twist, huh? 
KAUFMAN Jesus.   Jesus! 
DONALD I think this is maybe a good thing for the script. Go ask her about this. 
KAUFMAN I'm not gonna ask her about this. 
DONALD You want me to? I don't mind. 
KAUFMAN No, I don't want you to. 
DONALD I could easily pretend I'm you. 
ORLEAN (CONT'D) Johnny! Where are you going? 
Kaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house. Laroche cuts him off, grabs him, drags him into the house. 
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Laroche throws Kaufman down into a chair. The chair slides across the floor, tips over. Orlean seems uninterested. She kisses Laroche's leg. 
LAROCHE Who the hell are you? 
Kaufman notices Laroche has a set of beautiful, white teeth. 
KAUFMAN I just... nobody, I just -- 
Laroche shakes Orlean off his leg, kicks Kaufman in the gut. 
LAROCHE Who the fuck are you? 
KAUFMAN Um. I'm just. I was at the wrong house. I'm looking for the Johnson family. 
LAROCHE I got your Johnson family right here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head.     Orlean kisses Laroche's back. Kaufman whimpers. 
ORLEAN Honey, come back to bed. 
LAROCHE Who the hell sent you?      Rudy? 
KAUFMAN I'm not -- 
Again Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head.      His scalp bleeds. 
KAUFMAN (cont'd) I'm the screenwriter. 
LAROCHE What the fuck does that mean? 
KAUFMAN I'm the guy adapting her book.      Her book about you. 
This registers with Laroche. 
LAROCHE Jesus Fucking Christ. (then, trying to make sense) Why the fuck were you in my backyard? 
KAUFMAN I was, um, trying... I don't know. 
Orlean is unforgiving. 
ORLEAN Who's the bloody fat guy? 
LAROCHE This is the fellow adapting your book for the movies, darling'. 
ORLEAN (excited) Really? I wanted to meet -- (realizing) Oh. What does he know? 
KAUFMAN I don't know anything.   I swear. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LAROCHE He knows about the greenhouse. (to Orlean) We can't have this appear on the silver screen. 
KAUFMAN It won't.    I don't even under -- 
ORLEAN Johnny, I'm so tired now. 
Orlean lies down.   Laroche paces.   Donald peers, unseen, into the back window. 
LAROCHE He needs to be gotten rid of. 
KAUFMAN What?! 
Donald's eyes widen. Laroche paces. Orlean watches Laroche, fascinated by his every muscle movement. 
LAROCHE Small article in newspaper. 
Orlean snaps out of her muscle fixation, becomes fixated on his voice, his lips. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) Screenwriter doing research for movie about notorious orchid poacher was found drowned in the Fakahatchee after accidentally slipping and hitting his head on a rock. End of story. Is that credible from a journalistic standpoint? 
ORLEAN Johnny, come lie on top of me. 
LAROCHE Focus, darling'. Is this credible? 
ORLEAN (concentrates) Um, oh... this screenwriter was killed doing research in Jamaica a few years ago. (to Kaufman) Screenwriter, you have a car? 
(CONTINUED) 
Smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights.         Out of the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They follow Kaufman into the swamp. 
Mike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out, surveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground. 
MIKE OWEN Jesus, that writer guy. 
Owen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken. He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off. 
Kaufman limps through the dark water.       Laroche and Orlean follow the sound of his sloshing. 
ORLEAN Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon plastic jewels plopping onto a silver trampoline! Dontcha think? 
LAROCHE Darlin', please. 
ORLEAN Can we fuck now, baby?    Fuck like lemons? 
Owen tears along the dirt road. Up ahead, Kaufman limps out of the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused. He checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and skids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps over to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out. 
KAUFMAN You gotta help me.    You gotta help me. 
MIKE OWEN What the hell is going on here? 
KAUFMAN They're after me. They've got guns. They killed my brother. 
MIKE OWEN Who's got guns? What are you -- 
Before Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. Donald's body flies into the water. There, staring Kaufman and Owen down, is a giant man-like beast. It's repulsive, covered in algae-matted fur. 
MIKE OWEN (cont'd) Holy shit. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
The two men turn and run. 
MIKE OWEN (cont'd) It's real!     I can't believe it, I never -- 
The creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick. Kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder. He runs right into the arms of Orlean. 
ORLEAN Hey, it's the screenwriter! 
KAUFMAN There's a thing back there!    You don't want to be here. 
Kaufman, Orlean, and Laroche look back. Nothing there. 
LAROCHE You're right, I don't want to be here. I'm tired, let's get this over with. 
Laroche puts the gun to Kaufman's head. Kaufman tenses. Orlean studies Laroche's gun. Her nose is practically touching the barrel. 
ORLEAN I love your gun, baby.    Can we trade? 
LAROCHE Stand back, sweetness. 
Laroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away. Suddenly the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp. 
LAROCHE (cont'd) Susie!   Susie! 
Orlean looks around. 
ORLEAN Where'd Johnny go? 
LAROCHE (O.S.) Susie! 
Orlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the darkness. Something slumps forward in the water. Orlean steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on Kaufman. The creature is dead, so is Laroche. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (6) 
ORLEAN (crying softly) Oh, Johnny. 
She sits next to Laroche and pets his head.   Kaufman watches her. The sun is coming up. 
KAUFMAN I'd just stare at your picture, and you looked so sweet. I read your words and I thought you were smart and maybe lost and lonely like me. And the way you wrote about Laroche. You said he was handsome even though he had no front teeth -- 
ORLEAN Oh, Johnny. Johnny's teeth.     Oh... 
KAUFMAN I figured you could look at me and see something, even with all my flaws you could look at me and find something, you could maybe someday write a description of me that would be nicer than the one I write day in and day out in my head. (hopefully) Would it be? 
Kaufman takes Orlean's chin in his hand and directs her gaze to him. She stares at him for a long while, then: 
ORLEAN You're really so wonderful. 
KAUFMAN Really? 
ORLEAN So wonderful. I can see inside your soul. It glows with orange sadness. It's raining inside you. I want to run through your dripply dripples. It's so beautiful. I love you. I do. 
Kaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock.

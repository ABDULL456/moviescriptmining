He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her. 
MARY A new magazine! I never saw it before. 
GEORGE Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society. 
He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her.  She leans over, speaking softly. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Mary, whispering. 
MARY Is this the ear you can't hear on? George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die. 
She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said. 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY 
GEORGE I'm going out exploring some day, you watch. And I'm going to have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives.  Wait and see. 
He turns back to the cash register, whistling. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It is evident he has been drinking. 
GOWER George! George! 
GEORGE Yes, sir. 
GOWER You're not paid to be a canary. 
GEORGE No, sir. 
He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it. 
INSERT: THE TELEGRAM 
It reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions from you.  EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE." 
BACK TO SHOT 
George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower. 
INT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE  DAY 
CLOSE SHOT 
Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box. 
GEORGE Mr. Gower, do you want something... Anything? 
GOWER No. 
GEORGE Anything I can do back here? 
GOWER No. 
George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk.  Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Capsules spilling on floor at their feet. 
BACK TO SHOT 
George and Gower. 
GEORGE I'll get them, sir. 
He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George stands still, horrified. 
GOWER Take these capsules over to Mrs. Blaine's.  She's waiting for them. 
George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say.  His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George's fingers fumble. 
GEORGE Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir? 
GOWER Ummmm... 
Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns to him, the box in his hand. 
GEORGE Is it a charge, sir? 
GOWER Yes  charge. 
GEORGE Mr. Gower, I think... 
GOWER Aw, get going! 
GEORGE Yes, sir. 
INT. DRUGSTORE  DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT 
George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says: 
INSERT 
"ASK DAD HE KNOWS"  SWEET CAPORAL 
BACK TO SHOT 
With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the street. Mary follows him with her eyes. 
EXT. STREET  DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT 
George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two- story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs. 
INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY 
FULL SHOT 
The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a door marked: 
"PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands, obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk.  The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm. 
UNCLE BILLY Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'? 
GEORGE Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy. 
UNCLE BILLY Some other time, George. 
GEORGE (frightened) Yes, sir, I... 
Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open hands.  George tries to protect himself as best he can. 
GOWER What kind of tricks are you playing, anyway? Why didn't you deliver them right away? Don't you know that boy's very sick? 
GEORGE (in tears) You're hurting my sore ear. 
INT. FRONT ROOM DRUGSTORE  DAY 
CLOSE SHOT 
Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces. 
INT. BACK ROOM DRUGSTORE  DAY 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND GOWER 
GOWER You lazy loafer! 
GEORGE (sobbing) Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing. You put something wrong in those capsules. I know you're unhappy. You got that telegram, and you're upset. You put something bad in those capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower... 
George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy venomously. 
GEORGE Just look and see what you did. Look at the bottle you took the powder from. It's poison!  I tell you, it's poison!  I know you feel bad... and... 
George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. Gower steps toward him. 
GEORGE Don't hurt my sore ear again. 
But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is crying too. 
GOWER No... No... No... 
GEORGE Don't hurt my ear again! 
GOWER (sobbing) Oh, George, George... 
GEORGE Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't. 
GOWER Oh, George. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LUGGAGE SHOP  DAY  (1928) 
MEDIUM SHOT 
It is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an assortment of luggage. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store  he is showing a suitcase. 
JOE An overnight bag  genuine English cowhide, combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs... 
CUSTOMER Nope. 
AS CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to him, he turns and we get our first glimpse of George as a young man. CAMERA HAS MOVED UP to a CLOSEUP by now. 
GEORGE Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, Joe.  Now, look, I... I want a big one. 
Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes a still. Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from Heaven: 
CLARENCE'S VOICE What did you stop it for? 
JOSEPH'S VOICE I want you to take a good look at that face. 
CLARENCE'S VOICE Who is it? 
JOSEPH'S VOICE George Bailey. 
CLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist. 
JOSEPH'S VOICE That's the kid. 
CLARENCE'S VOICE It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills? 
JOSEPH'S VOICE Not a soul. 
CLARENCE'S VOICE Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring? 
JOSEPH'S VOICE Well, wait and see. 
CLOSE SHOT  THE SCREEN 
The arrested CLOSEUP of George springs to life again. 
GEORGE Big - see!  I don't want one for one night.  I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big one. 
JOE I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second- hand job, would you? 
He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter. 
GEORGE Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost? 
JOE No charge. 
GEORGE That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge. 
JOE (indicating name on suitcase) That's right. 
GEORGE (as he sees his name) What's my name doing on it? 
JOE A little present from old man Gower. Came down and picked it out himself. 
GEORGE (admiring the bag) He did? Whatta you know about that  my old boss... 
JOE What boat you sailing on? 
GEORGE I'm working across on a cattle boat. 
JOE A cattle boat? 
GEORGE (as he exits) Okay, I like cows. 
WIPE TO: 
INT. GOWER'S DRUGSTORE  DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT 
The place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little tables have been added. It has become the hangout of the local small fry.  There are now three kids jerking sodas. Gower is a different man now  sober, shaven and good-humored. He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face lights up when he sees George. 
GEORGE Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted. 
GOWER Aw, forget it. 
GEORGE Oh, it's wonderful. 
GOWER Hope you enjoy it. 
George suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter. He closes his eyes and makes a wish. 
MOTHER Oh, my lands, my blood pressure! 
CLOSE SHOT 
Harry, as he sticks his head through the kitchen door. 
HARRY Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things. 
MOTHER What plates? 
HARRY Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen. 
MOTHER Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland. 
She follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. As she goes: 
GEORGE Oh, let him have the plates, Mother. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and his father, eating at the table. There is a great similarity and a great understanding between them. 
POP Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you. 
GEORGE I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired. 
POP Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today. 
GEORGE Oh... 
POP I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit. 
GEORGE I wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway? 
POP Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick.  Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess. 
MEDIUM SHOT 
The dining room. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his head.  CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross. 
HARRY Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop. 
POP So long, son. 
GEORGE Got a match? 
HARRY Very funny. Very funny. 
MOTHER Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together. 
HARRY Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George? 
GEORGE What do you mean, and be bored to death? 
HARRY Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too. 
GEORGE I hope it works. 
POP No gin tonight, son. 
HARRY Aw, Pop, just a little. 
POP No, son, not one drop. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and Pop at the table. Annie comes in with some dishes. 
ANNIE Boys and girls and music. Why do they need gin? 
She exits. 
GEORGE Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school? 
POP Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night. 
GEORGE We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go. 
POP He's pretty young for that job. 
GEORGE Well, no younger than I was. 
POP Maybe you were born older, George. 
GEORGE How's that? 
POP I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college. 
GEORGE Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things... design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about. 
POP Still after that first million before you're thirty. 
GEORGE No, I'll settle for half that in cash. 
Annie comes in again from the kitchen. 
POP Of course, it's just a hope, but you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you? 
Annie stops serving to hear his answer. 
GEORGE Well, I... (to Annie) Annie, why don't you draw up a chair? Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on. 
ANNIE I would if I thought I'd hear anything worth listening to. 
GEORGE You would, huh? 
She gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen. Bailey smiles and turns to George. 
POP I know it's soon to talk about it. 
GEORGE Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office. 
He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father. 
GEORGE Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important. 
POP (quietly) You know, George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important.  Satisfying a fundamental urge. It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office. 
GEORGE (unhappily) I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But I've been hoarding pennies like a miser in order to... Most of my friends have already finished college. I just feel like if I don't get away, I'd bust. 
POP Yes... Yes... You're right, son. 
GEORGE You see what I mean, don't you, Pop? 
POP This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here. 
GEORGE Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy. 
To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls: 
FREDDIE'S VOICE ...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was because they'd be scared. They know... 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP 
Mary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George. 
FREDDIE ...what kind of... 
MARTY (interrupting) You remember George? This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you. 
GEORGE Well... Well... Well... 
FREDDIE Now, to get back to my story, see... 
Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing. 
FREDDIE Hey, this is my dance! 
GEORGE Oh, why don't you stop annoying people? 
FREDDIE Well, I'm sorry. Hey! 
MOVING SHOT 
Following George and Mary as they dance. 
GEORGE Well, hello. 
MARY Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me. 
GEORGE Well, I don't. 
MARY You've passed me on the street almost every day. 
GEORGE Me? 
MARY Uh-huh. 
GEORGE Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you. 
A WHISTLE is heard offscreen, and the MUSIC stops. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Harry on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand. 
HARRY Oyez  oyez  oyez... The big Charleston contest. The prize? A genuine loving cup.  Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor. Let's go! 
CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY 
As the MUSIC starts and couples begin dancing once more, they look at each other. 
GEORGE I'm not very good at this. 
MARY Neither am I. 
GEORGE Okay  what can we lose? 
They start their Charleston. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad. 
CLOSEUP  FREDDIE 
Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him. 
MICKEY What's the matter, Othello  jealous? Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor? And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?  And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?  And I've got the key? 
Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool.  George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for cheers. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and Mary dancing. 
GEORGE They're cheering us. We must be good. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
The crowd watching George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
George and Mary still trying to dance in the water  the crowd on the edge cheering them  some of the crowd leap into the pool  the principal trying to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN: 
EXT. TREE-LINED RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
George and Mary. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bath robe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera we hear them singing: 
GEORGE AND MARY (singing) Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight.  Can't you come out tonight. Can't you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon. 
GEORGE Hot dog! Just like an organ. 
MARY Beautiful. 
CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street. 
GEORGE And I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours. 
He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other. 
MARY Do I look as funny as you do? 
GEORGE I guess I'm not quite the football type.  You... look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town. 
MARY Well, why don't you say it? 
GEORGE I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway? 
MARY Eighteen. 
GEORGE Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen. 
MARY Too young or too old? 
GEORGE Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you.  Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on. 
Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on: 
GEORGE I mean, without a dress. You look older...  I mean, younger. You look just... 
In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her. 
GEORGE Oh-oh... 
MARY (holding out her hand) Sir, my train, please. 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY 
GEORGE Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come on back out here, and I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you... 
Mary runs off scene. George has been once more standing on the belt of her bath robe, so as she goes, her robe comes off. 
GEORGE (looking around) Mary... 
He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe. He cannot see her anywhere. 
GEORGE Okay, I give up. Where are you? 
CLOSEUP  BUSH AT EDGE OF SIDEWALK 
We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves. 
MARY Over here in the hydrangea bushes. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY 
George walks toward the bush. 
GEORGE Here you are. Catch. 
He is about to throw her the robe, when a thought strikes him. 
GEORGE Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a very interesting situation. 
MARY (from the bushes) Please give me my robe. 
GEORGE Hmm... A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day. 
MARY (impatiently) I'd like to have my robe. 
GEORGE Not in Bedford Falls, anyway. 
Mary thrashes around in the bushes. We hear her say: 
MARY Ouch! 
GEORGE Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here. 
MARY (getting mad) George Bailey! Give me my robe! 
GEORGE I've heard about things like this, but I've never... 
MARY (interrupting) Shame on you. I'm going to tell your mother on you. 
GEORGE Oh, my mother's way up the corner there. 
MARY (desperate) I'll call the police. 
GEORGE They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too. 
MARY I'm going to scream! 
GEORGE (thoughtfully) Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's see. No, the point is, in order to get this robe...  I've got it! I'll make a deal with you, Mary. 
Headlights flash into the scene, and the old Bailey automobile drives in, with Harry at the wheel, and Uncle Billy beside him. 
UNCLE BILLY George! George! Come on home, quick! Your father's had a stroke! 
George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the car. 
GEORGE Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go. 
HARRY Come on, George, let's hurry. 
GEORGE Did you get a doctor? 
UNCLE BILLY Yes, Campbell's there now.

INT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE  DAY 
CLOSE SHOT  DIRECTORS MEETING 
There are about twelve directors seated around a long table. They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate salesman, etc.  Prominently seated among them is Henry F. Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on which they have been reporting.  Before each of the directors there are individual reports for them to study. 
DR. CAMPBELL I think that's all we'll need you for, George. I know you're anxious to make a train. 
GEORGE (rising) I have a taxi waiting downstairs. 
DR. CAMPBELL I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months.  Good luck to you at school, George. 
GEORGE Thanks. 
DR. CAMPBELL Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey. 
POTTER Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose. 
MAN Wait just a minute now. 
POTTER Wait for what?  I claim this institution is not necessary to this town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver. 
UNCLE BILLY (angrily) George, you hear what that buzzard... 
LAWYER Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to discuss chloroforming the Building and Loan. 
MAN Peter Bailey died three months ago. I second Mr. Potter's motion. 
DR. CAMPBELL Very well. In that case I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. 
Dr. Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy start to collect their papers and leave the table. 
DR. CAMPBELL But before you go, I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey. 
GEORGE Thank you very much. 
DR. CAMPBELL It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization. 
POTTER I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan. 
Everyone looks at him surprised. 
UNCLE BILLY (trying to control himself) Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave. 
POTTER Peter Bailey was not a business man. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.  He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town. (picking up papers from table) Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi.  You know... I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why? 
George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave. 
GEORGE She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go. 
HARRY Oh, wait. Wait... Wait a minute. 
CLOSE SHOT 
The group, including Ruth Dakin. This is the young lady who came off the train with Harry. In the excitement of greetings she has been momentarily forgotten. She stands, smiling, waiting. 
GEORGE Hello. 
UNCLE BILLY How do you do. 
HARRY Ruth Dakin. 
RUTH Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind. 
George and Uncle Billy stare, astounded. 
UNCLE BILLY Huh? 
HARRY Well, I wired you I had a surprise. Here she is. Meet the wife. 
George is thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand. 
UNCLE BILLY Well, what do you know  wife. 
GEORGE Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing? 
He kisses Ruth.  CAMERA MOVES WITH them down the platform. 
GEORGE Harry, why didn't you tell somebody? (to Ruth) What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine? 
RUTH (smiling) Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary. My father offered him a job. 
George stops, with a sinking feeling. Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot. Harry stops with George. 
UNCLE BILLY (as he moves off) Oh, he gets you and a job? Well, Harry's cup runneth over. 
HARRY George... about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it. You've been holding the bag here for four years, and... well, I won't let you down, George.  I would like to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags. I'll be right back. 
He runs out of the shot, George watching him. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth. He is thinking deeply. 
UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE It was a surprise to me. This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife. Old, old friend of the family. 
RUTH'S VOICE Oh, of course. I've heard him speak of you. 
UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE And I want to tell you, we're going to give the biggest party this town ever saw. 
CAMERA MOVES WITH George as he comes into the scene. Ruth detaches herself from the group and offers George some popcorn. 
RUTH (to George) Here, have some popcorn. George, George, George... that's all Harry ever talks about. 
GEORGE (quietly) Ruth, this... what about this job? 
RUTH Oh, well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo. He wants to get Harry started in the research business. 
GEORGE Is it a good job? 
RUTH Oh, yes, very. Not much money, but a good future, you know. Harry's a genius at research. My father fell in love with him. 
GEORGE And you did, too? 
Ruth nods, smiling.

Cousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch. Flash bulbs go off, and the group breaks up. The crowd enters the front door of the house, leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch. 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND UNCLE BILLY 
The latter is tipsy. He feels very high. 
UNCLE BILLY Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so good I could spit in Potter's eye. I think I will. What did you say, huh? Oh, maybe I'd better go home. 
He looks around for his hat, which is on his head. 
UNCLE BILLY Where's my hat? Where's my... 
George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to him. 
UNCLE BILLY Oh, thank you, George. Which one is mine? 
GEORGE (laughing) The middle one. 
UNCLE BILLY Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.  Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction... would you do that?  George? 
GEORGE Right down here. 
They descend the porch steps, and George turns his uncle around and heads him down the street. 
UNCLE BILLY Old Building and Loan pal, huh... 
GEORGE Now you just turn this way and go right straight down. 
UNCLE BILLY That way, huh? 
He staggers out of the scene, and as George turns away, we hear Uncle Billy singing "My Wild Irish Rose." There is a CRASH of cans and bottles, then: 
UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE I'm all right. I'm all right. "... the sweetest flower that grows... " 
EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
George is standing at the garden gate. He takes some travel folders from his pocket, looks at them and throws them away. He is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events. His mother comes out of the house and kisses him. 
GEORGE Hello, Mom. 
MRS. BAILEY (as she kisses him) That's for nothing. How do you like her? 
She nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a crowd of other couples, are dancing to the MUSIC of a phonograph, and can be seen through the front door. 
GEORGE She's swell. 
MRS. BAILEY Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes. 
GEORGE Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway. 
MRS. BAILEY Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school? 
GEORGE Uh-huh. 
SAM'S VOICE I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans? 
GEORGE Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah... soybeans. Yeah. 
SAM'S VOICE Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that? 
Mary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious of her, close to him. 
GEORGE Rochester? Well, why Rochester? 
SAM'S VOICE Well, why not? Can you think of anything better? 
GEORGE Oh, I don't know... why not right here?  You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down. 
SAM'S VOICE That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen.  Have you got any money? 
GEORGE Money? Yeah... well, a little. 
SAM'S VOICE Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear?  And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary...  Mary... 
MARY (nervously) I'm here. 
SAM'S VOICE Would you tell that guy I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, you hear? The chance of a lifetime. 
As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips. 
MARY (whispering) He says it's the chance of a lifetime. 
George can stand it no longer. He drops the phone with a crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders and shakes her. Mary begins to cry. 
GEORGE (fiercely) Now you listen to me! I don't want any plastics! I don't want any ground floors, and I don't want to get married  ever  to anyone! You understand that? I want to do what I want to do. And you're... and you're... 
He pulls her to him in a fierce embrace. Two meant for each other find themselves in tearful ecstasy. 
GEORGE Oh, Mary... Mary... 
MARY George... George... George... 
GEORGE Mary...

Cousin Tilly's face fills the screen as she cries: 
COUSIN TILLY Here they come! 
CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we hear the SOUND of the Wedding March. People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors. There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we see that it is raining.  Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group. George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from the curb.

MARY I feel like a bootlegger's wife. (holding up the money) Look! 
GEORGE You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife! 
ERNIE That does it! Then what? 
GEORGE (to Mary) Then what, honey? 
MARY After that, who cares? 
GEORGE That does it  come here. 
The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people around the door. He stops the cab.

PASSERBY Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry. 
MARY George, let's not stop. Let's go! 
George gets out of the cab and looks down the street. 
GEORGE Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh... 
MARY Please, let's not stop, George. 
GEORGE I'll be back in a minute, Mary. 
George runs off up the street, toward the Building and Loan.

CLOSE SHOT  SIDEWALK 
ED But, George, I got my money here. 
CHARLIE Did he guarantee this place? 
GEORGE Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.  We don't need Potter over here. 
Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene. Mary stands watching silently. 
CHARLIE I'll take mine now. 
GEORGE No, but you... you... you're thinking of this place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here. Your money's in Joe's house... (to one of the men) ...right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and a hundred others. Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can. Now what are you going to do? Foreclose on them? 
TOM I got two hundred and forty-two dollars in here, and two hundred and forty-two dollars isn't going to break anybody. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  ANOTHER ANGLE 
GEORGE (handing him a slip) Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are. You sign this. You'll get your money in sixty days. 
TOM Sixty days? 
GEORGE Well, now that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares. 
There is a commotion at the outer doors. A man (Randall) comes in and makes his way up to Tom. 
RANDALL Tom... Tom, did you get your money? 
TOM No. 
RANDALL Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents on the dollar for every share you got. (shows bills) 
CROWD (ad lib) Fifty cents on the dollar! 
RANDALL Yes, cash! 
TOM (to George) Well, what do you say? 
GEORGE Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement. Now give us sixty days on this. 
TOM (turning to Randall) Okay, Randall. 
He starts out. 
MRS. THOMPSON Are you going to go to Potter's? 
TOM Better to get half than nothing. 
A few other people start for the door.  CAMERA PANS WITH George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people. 
GEORGE Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now listen... now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank.  He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us.  Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.  And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides. 
The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them. 
GEORGE Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack? (to Ed) Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it? (turns to address the room again) Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not.  That's why. He's picking up some bargains.  Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other. 
MRS. THOMPSON But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money. 
WOMAN How am I going to live until the bank opens? 
MAN I got doctor bills to pay. 
MAN I need cash. 
MAN Can't feed my kids on faith. 
During this scene Mary has come up behind the counter. Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out 
MARY How much do you need? 
George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary. 
GEORGE Hey! I got two thousand dollars! Here's two thousand dollars. This'll tide us over until the bank reopen. (to Tom) All right, Tom, how much do you need? 
TOM (doggedly) Two hundred and forty-two dollars! 
GEORGE (pleading) Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over till the bank reopens. 
TOM I'll take two hundred and forty-two dollars. 
George starts rapidly to count out the money. Tom throws his passbook on the counter. 
GEORGE There you are. 
TOM That'll close my account. 
GEORGE Your account's still here. That's a loan. 
Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie. George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom, and speaks to Ed, the next in line. 
GEORGE Okay. All right, Ed? 
ED I got three hundred dollars here, George. 
Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got. 
GEORGE Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till the bank reopens? What do you need? 
ED Well, I suppose twenty dollars. 
GEORGE Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. Fine.  Thanks, Ed. (to Mrs. Thompson, next in line) All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How much do you want? 
MRS. THOMPSON But it's your own money, George. 
GEORGE Never mind about that. How much do you want? 
MRS. THOMPSON I can get along with twenty, all right. 
GEORGE (counting it out) Twenty dollars. 
MRS. THOMPSON And I'll sign a paper. 
GEORGE You don't have to sign anything. I know you'll pay it back when you can. That's okay. (to woman next in line) All right, Mrs. Davis. 
MRS. DAVIS Could I have seventeen-fifty? 
GEORGE Seven... (he kisses her) Bless your heart, Of course you can have it. You got fifty cents? (counting) Seven...

The Martini family is moving. The family consists of Martini, his wife and four kid of various ages, from two to ten.  George and Mary are helping the Martinis move. About a dozen neighbors crowd around. Martini and George, assisted by three of the Martini children, are carrying out the last of the furniture.

A buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk. 
SECRETARY'S VOICE Congressman Blatz is here to see you. 
POTTER (to dictaphone) Oh, tell the congressman to wait. (to Reineman) Go on. 
REINEMAN Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses stuck here and there. (indicating map) There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies. Used to hunt rabbits there myself. Look at it today. Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw.  Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that. And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks! 
POTTER Oh, they are, are they? Even though they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it. 
REINEMAN You know very well why. The Baileys were all chumps. Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build. If I were you, Mr. Potter... 
POTTER (interrupting) Well, you are not me. 
REINEMAN (as he leaves) As I say, it's no skin off my nose. But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job. 
Reineman exits.

MARY To keep from being an old maid. 
GEORGE You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.

UNCLE BILLY (exhausted) I've been over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked ever since I lost Laura. 
Uncle Billy starts sobbing hysterically. George grabs him by the lapels and shakes him. 
GEORGE (harshly) Listen to me! Listen to me! Think! Think! 
UNCLE BILLY (sobbing) I can't think any more, George. I can't think any more. It hurts... 
George jerks him to his feet and shakes him. Uncle Billy stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets hanging out, empty. George's eyes and manner are almost maniacal. 
GEORGE (screaming at him) Where's that money, you stupid, silly old fool? Where's the money?  Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal, and prison! 
He throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, and still shouts at him: 
GEORGE That's what it means! One of us is going to jail! Well, it's not going to be me! 
George turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes. Uncle Billy remains sobbing at the table, his head in his arms. 
MARY (worried) George, what's wrong? 
GEORGE Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call this a happy family? Why did we have to have all these kids? 
PETE (coming in) Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"? 
GEORGE (shouts) I don't know. Ask your mother. 
George goes toward doorway. 
MARY Where're you going? 
GEORGE Going up to see Zuzu. 
We hear his footsteps as he leaves. Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete. 
PETE He told me to write a play for tonight. 
MARY F-R-A-N-K-I-N... 
INT. HALL  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE STARTS UP THE STAIRS 
The knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room. Then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs. 
INT. ZUZU'S BEDROOM  NIGHT 
FULL SHOT 
The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu (aged six) is sitting up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding her prize flower.  George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed. 
ZUZU Hi, Daddy. 
GEORGE Well, what happened to you? 
ZUZU I won a flower. 
She starts to get out of bed. 
GEORGE Wait now. Where do you think you're going? 
ZUZU Want to give my flower a drink. 
GEORGE All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink. 
She shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few petals fall off. She picks them up. 
ZUZU Look, Daddy... paste it. 
GEORGE Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together. 
She hands him the fallen petals and the flower. He turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu. 
GEORGE There it is, good as new. 
ZUZU Give the flower a drink. 
George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed. 
GEORGE Now, will you do something for me? 
CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ZUZU 
They whisper. 
ZUZU What? 
GEORGE Will you try to get some sleep? 
ZUZU I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower. 
GEORGE I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden. 
ZUZU It will? 
GEORGE Uh-huh. 
She closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. George pulls the covers over her. He bends down and his lips touch a tendril of the child's hair. Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
Janie is still pounding with grim determination at the piano. Pete is seated at the table writing. Tommy is playing with his toy vacuum cleaner. The telephone rings. 
JANIE AND PETE Telephone. 
INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
Mary comes in and picks up the phone. 
MARY I'll get it. (on phone) Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey. 
George enters shot, and stands listening to her. 
MARY Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure she'll be all right. The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner. 
GEORGE Is that Zuzu's teacher? 
MARY (hand over receiver) Yes. 
GEORGE Let me speak to her. 
He snatches the phone from Mary. 
GEORGE (on phone) Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?  This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway?  What do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked?  Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you? 
MARY (shocked) George! 
She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off. She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God. Over the phone we hear Mrs. Welch's voice sputtering with protest. 
GEORGE Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for  to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes... 
Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand. 
GEORGE Aw, that stupid... 
Mary speaks quickly in to the phone. 
MARY Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...  hello... hello... (to George) She's hung up. 
GEORGE (savagely) I'll hang her up! 
But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling: 
MR. WELCH'S VOICE Now, who do you think you are? 
George is out of the door by now.  CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Potter. 
POTTER (on phone) Bill? This is Potter. 
EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
George comes out of the bank into the falling snow. He crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off. 
EXT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
An attractive little roadside tavern, with the name "Martini's" in neon lights on the front wall. 
INT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles sparkle.  There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place. George is seated at the bar  he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to. 
MARTINI'S VOICE (greeting new customers) Merry Christmas. Glad you came. 
MAN'S VOICE How about some of that good spaghetti? 
MARTINI'S VOICE We got everything. 
During this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. Nick, the bartender, is watching him solicitously. Seated on the other side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of beer. George is mumbling: 
GEORGE God... God... Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God. 
NICK (friendly) Are you all right, George? Want someone to take you home? 
George shakes his head. Martini comes over to his side. 
MARTINI (worried) Why you drink so much, my friend? Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve. 
The ugly man next to George, who has been listening, reacts sharply to the name "Bailey." 
MAN Bailey? Which Bailey? 
NICK This is Mr. George Bailey. 
Without any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick and several others rush to pick him up. 
MAN (to George) And the next time you talk to my wife like that you'll get worse. She cried for an hour. It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write, and you have to bawl her out... 
MARTINI (furious) You get out of here, Mr. Welch! 
Mr. Welch reaches in his pocket for money. 
WELCH Now wait... I want to pay for my drink. 
MARTINI Never mind the money. You get out of here quick. 
WELCH All right. 
MARTINI You hit my best friend. Get out! 
Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding. 
NICK You all right, George? 
GEORGE (stunned) Who was that? 
MARTINI He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch.  He don't come in to my place no more. 
GEORGE Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying. 
MARTINI The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick? 
NICK Yes, you bet. 
GEORGE Where's my insurance policy? (finds it in pocket) Oh, here... 
He starts for the door. 
MARTINI Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey. 
GEORGE I'm all right. 
Nick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off. 
MARTINI Oh, no  you don't feel so good. 
GEORGE I'm all right. 
MARTINI Please don't go away  please! 
George opens the door and exits to the street. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT 
George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house.  George gets out to look at the damage, and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running out. 
OWNER What do you think you're doing? 
CLOSE SHOT 
George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident. The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages. 
OWNER (with indignation) Now look what you did. My greatgrandfather planted this tree. 
George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man. 
OWNER Hey, you... Hey, you! Come back here, you drunken fool! Get this car out of here! 
EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT 
MEDIUM LONG SHOT 
George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him. 
DRIVER Hey, what's the matter with you? Look where you're going! 
The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge. The snow is now falling hard. 
EXT. RIVER  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
GEORGE Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me? 
GOWER No. No. 
NICK (to his bouncers) Throw him out. Throw him out. 
The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes back to the bar. 
GEORGE (bewildered) Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick... Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist? 
NICK You know, that's another reason for me not to like you. That rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid. If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself. (to his bouncers) Would you show these gentlemen to the door. 
BOUNCER Sure. This way, gentlemen. 
EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow. 
INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell. 
NICK Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings! 
EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they landed, looking at each other. 
CLARENCE You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the... 
GEORGE What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly... 
George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE" instead of "MARTINI'S." 
George and Clarence get to their feet. 
GEORGE (exasperated) What the... hey, what's going on around here?  Why, this ought to be Martini's place. 
He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested look. 
GEORGE Look, who are you? 
CLARENCE (patiently) I told you, George. I'm your guardian angel. 
George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm.  It's flesh. 
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What... are you a hypnotist? 
CLARENCE No, of course not. 
GEORGE Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things? 
CLARENCE Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born. 
GEORGE Then if I wasn't born, who am I? 
CLARENCE You're nobody. You have no identity. 
George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but without success. 
GEORGE What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey. 
CLARENCE There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy... (he says these things as George searches for them) George looks in his watch pocket. 
CLARENCE They're not there, either. 
GEORGE What? 
CLARENCE Zuzu's petals. 
George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out. 
CLARENCE You've been given a great gift, George. A chance to see what the world would be like without you. 
George is completely befuddled. 
GEORGE (shaking his head) Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute here. As, this is some sort of a funny dream I'm having here. So long, mister, I'm going home. 
He starts off. Clarence rises. 
CLARENCE Home? What home? 
GEORGE (furious) Now shut up! Cut it out! You're... you're... you're crazy! That's what I think... you're screwy, and you're driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing things. I'm going home and see my wife and family. Do you understand that? And I'm going home alone! 
George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes. 
CLARENCE How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks. (pause) No, I didn't have a drink! 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. STREET  NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE 
The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville." George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops: 
GEORGE Hey... hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to? 
COP The Building and what? 
GEORGE The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there. 
COP They went out of business years ago. 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP 
George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon. 
GEORGE Hey, Violet! (to the cop) Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick! 
COP I know. I know. 
GEORGE I know that girl! 
The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by. 
GEORGE Hey, Ernie  Ernie! 
EXT. STREET  NIGHT 
BERT Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had him right here. 
Ernie's hair is now standing on end with fright. 
ERNIE (stammering) I need a drink. 
He runs out of the scene. 
BERT Well, which way'd they go? Help me find 'em. 
EXT. BAILEY HOME  NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT 
George runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass, when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: "Ma Bailey's Boarding House." 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AT THE DOOR 
The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him. 
MA BAILEY Well? 
GEORGE Mother... 
MA BAILEY Mother? What do you want? 
It is a cruel blow to George. 
GEORGE Mother, this is George. I thought sure you'd remember me. 
MA BAILEY (coldly) George who? If you're looking for a room there's no vacancy. 
She starts to close the door, but George stops her. 
GEORGE Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it. 
MA BAILEY Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know. 
GEORGE (desperate) Well, I know everybody you know. Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy. 
MA BAILEY (suspiciously) You know him? 
GEORGE Well, sure I do. 
MA BAILEY When'd you see him last? 
GEORGE Today, over at the house. 
MA BAILEY That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.  And if you ask me, that's where you belong. 
She slams the door shut in George's face. 
EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand. 
CLARENCE Strange, isn't it?  Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he? 
GEORGE (quietly, trying to use logic) I've heard of things like this. You've got me in some kind of a spell, or something.  Well, I'm going to get out of it. I'll get out of it. I know how, too. I... the last man I talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini. 
CLARENCE You know where he lives? 
GEORGE Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park. 
They walk out of scene. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. CEMETERY  NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT 
George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be. 
CLARENCE Are you sure this is Bailey Park? 
GEORGE Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses? 
The two walk into the cemetery. 
CLARENCE (as they go) You weren't here to build them. 
CLOSE MOVING SHOT 
George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to stare with frightened eyes at: 
CLOSE SHOT  A TOMBSTONE 
Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription, and we read: "IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED SON  HARRY BAILEY  
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND CLARENCE 
CLARENCE Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine. 
George jumps up. 
GEORGE That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport. 
CLARENCE (sadly) Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry. You see, George, you really had a wonderful life.  Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away? 
CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE 
GEORGE Clarence... 
CLARENCE Yes, George? 
GEORGE Where's Mary? 
CLARENCE Oh, well, I can't... 
GEORGE I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she? 
George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him. 
CLARENCE I... 
GEORGE If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is. 
CLARENCE I'm not supposed to tell. 
GEORGE (becoming violent) Please, Clarence, tell me where she is. 
CLARENCE You're not going to like it, George. 
GEORGE (shouting) Where is she? 
CLARENCE She's an old maid. She never married. 
BERT Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you.  I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe... Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right? 
GEORGE What did... 
George touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, laughs happily. His rapture knows no bounds. 
GEORGE (joyously) My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's bleed... (feeling in watch pocket) Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's... they're... they're here, Bert! What do you know about that? Merry Christmas! 
He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at top speed toward town. 
LONG SHOT George runs away from camera yelling 
GEORGE Mary! Mary!

CLOSE SHOT 
George sees that the "POTTERSVILLE" sign is now replaced by the original "YOU ARE NOW IN BEDFORD FALLS" sign. 
GEORGE Hello, Bedford Falls! 
He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. He passes some late shoppers on the street

He grabs his hand and shakes it. 
CARTER (surprised) Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit! 
GEORGE I know. Eight thousand dollars. 
SHERIFF (reaching into pocket) George, I've got a little paper here. 
GEORGE (happily) I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest. Isn't it wonderful? Merry Christmas! 
The photographer sets off a flash bulb. 
GEORGE Reporters? Where's Mary? (calling) Mary! 
George runs to the kitchen. He gets no answer. As he goes: 
GEORGE Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty house! Mary! Mary!

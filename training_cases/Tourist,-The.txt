EXT. PARIS - DAY 
CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day.   Cool, gray and beautiful. 
A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people hurrying about their business. 
The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out. 
INT. GARE DE L'EST, PARIS - DAY 
WE FOLLOW the legs up the steps, across the concourse, through the station. Men turn and stare. 
CARA MASON (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. She wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one hand, a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the other. 
INT. BRASSERIE, GARE DE L'EST - DAY 
A YOUNG WAITER wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart. 
An OLDER WAITER approaches her. They exchange a few words and he walks toward the bar. 
WAITER She's waiting for someone. 
YOUNGER WAITER Probably waiting for me. 
WAITER The door's waiting for you if you don't get back to work. 
A MESSENGER clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet, enters the cafe and looks around. He consults a photograph. 
His eyes land on Cara. He walks over and holds out a document-sized envelope. 
MESSENGER C'est vous, Mademoiselle? 
CARA Oui. 
As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents. There is a ticket for the Orient Express and a handwritten letter... 
She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map. Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads... 
ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (English accent) They are following you Cara. 
She looks up. Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds it in front of her face to glance around behind her... 
ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D) They think you'll lead them to me. But if you follow my instructions closely, there is a way for us to get away... 
Cara scans the rest of the letter. 
CAMERA glides down to see the signature at the bottom: "Love, Alexander." 
We barely have time to read this before Cara's perfectly manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer and sets fire to it. 
The YOUNG WAITER hurries over, alarmed. 
YOUNGER WAITER Mademoiselle!    Je vous en prie-- 
Cara is already gathering her things and walking away. 
INT. GARE DE L'EST STATION - MOMENTS LATER 
As Cara walks toward the platform... 
ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) Take the 4:25 Orient Express to Venice. En route select a man my approximate height and weight... 
Her eyes scan the platform. 
ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Have faith Cara. I'll be with you soon. 
CARA'S POV 
ACKERMAN Our target's name is Alexander Pearce. British citizen, born in London into an ordinary middle class family. The only thing remarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers. 
Ackerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen behind him: a fuzzy photo of a British schoolboy with a shy grin. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Which he used to hack into a computer and fix the test results his final year at school. 
JEAN LUC (French Interpol liaison) looks up skeptically. 
JEAN LUC Your mastermind couldn't pass his exams on his own? 
ACKERMAN He didn't fix his test scores; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class. It made him very popular. 
A ripple of laughter through the group. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) (severely) What started as school pranks eventually became something much more serious. After a year in the training program at Goldman Sachs, he decided that gambling suited him better than working for a living. That, in turn, involved him with some rather unsavory people and ultimately led him to put his financial genius to work in his true calling: money laundering. 
QUINN is the Swiss Interpol liaison. He speaks with the crisp accent of a man who is fluent in several languages. 
QUINN You've assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer, Mr. Ackerman. 
ACKERMAN There is nothing common about Alexander Pearce. Quiet simply, he has turned money laundering into an art form. His greatest innovation: The False Lawsuit. 
He clicks through a series of flashy Powerpoint slides illustrating Pearce's financial dealings. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Pearce sets up two companies: one is a Casino in Arizona for example and the other is a shell company in the Cayman Islands. (MORE) 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) The Cayman Islands company files a lawsuit against the casino, claiming copyright infringement or some other complaint. They "succeed" in winning the case and the casino pays the shell company an enormous settlement. 
QUINN (understanding) The money travels from America to the Cayman Islands... 
ACKERMAN Yes, but now the money is legal. 
JONES Not quite legal. The I.R.S. has been cheated out of the revenue. (beat) We calculate that Mr. Pearce's tax bill currently stands at $743.7 million dollars. 
Jean Luc leans toward his colleague. 
JEAN LUC (whispers in French) That explains what the American harridan is doing here. 
Ms. Jones gives him a glacial stare. 
JONES Exactement, monsieur. 
Jean Luc reddens. Oops.   Apparently not every American fits the stereotype. 
ACKERMAN Mr. Pearce has some other debts as well. Most of you will recognize Ivan Demidov... 
Click: A PHOTO of a balding RUSSIAN OLIGARCH emerging from a limo. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) ...Pearce laundered over a billion dollars for Demidov. At some point Pearce decided he'd rather steal from Demidov than help him steal. (MORE) 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) (beat) Given Demidov's ties to organized crime, I'd say that was a mistake. 
JONES (clears her throat) The U.S. Government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the Russian parliament; our target is Alexander Pearce. 
Ackerman smiles coolly at her. 
ACKERMAN Of course. 
An INTERPOL OFFICER from Germany raises his hand. 
GERMAN INTERPOL Has Mr. Pearce ever been in custody? 
Ackerman looks down for a moment, as if it pains him to answer. 
ACKERMAN Almost. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALEXANDER'S SEA SIDE VILLA, VENICE - NIGHT 
SUPER:   ONE YEAR AGO 
Fog covers the skyline, exposing only the slate rooftops of buildings that haven't changed in centuries. We hear the sound of water gently lapping the shore. 
From out of the mist emerges... 
A GUARDACOSTE -- a patrol boat, lights dimmed. It gently touches the beach. A CARABINIERI officer lowers a ramp. 
An INTERPOL TACTICS TEAM in Kevlar and headgear pours out of the patrol boat. 
Ackerman steps off, pulling on a vest.     He nods to Goyal. 
She wears Alexander's WATCH.... 
QUINN (V.O.) What does this Alexander Pearce look like? 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERPOL CENTRAL BRIEFING ROOM - RESUME 
Ackerman closes the file in front of him on the podium. 
ACKERMAN Nobody knows. He disappeared after his escape. He's had extensive plastic surgery to alter his appearance since then. Drug lord Amado Carillo did the same thing in the 90s to successfully elude authorities. 
QUINN How do you know about it? 
ACKERMAN Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time. He treated them so well that they're virtually all completely loyal. None of them would cooperate. We've questioned the ones we could find, and the only thing we learned is that Pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the surgery. 
JEAN LUC So nobody knows what he looks like? 
ACKERMAN Correct. 
JEAN LUC Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance...  What makes you think you can catch him now? 
Ackerman regards him with aplomb. 
ACKERMAN His girlfriend was recently released from custody. He'll come for her. We'll be waiting. 
QUINN What makes you so certain? 
Ackerman clicks on a slide. 
Cara's face fills the screen behind him.   A murmur runs through the room. Every man stares. 
ACKERMAN He'll come for her. 
Ackerman himself glances up at her face with a look of longing. 
HOLD ON CARA'S IMAGE for a moment before we... 
MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. VENICE TRAIN STATION - MORNING 
CARA stands alone on the platform amid the bustle of the station. The gleaming train stretches out behind her. 
INT. TRAIN CAR - SAME 
Frank's eyes drift open. He glances out the window and as his vision comes into focus he sees that the train is stopped. He sits bolt upright. 
A CONDUCTOR'S VOICE over the loudspeaker is saying something in Italian. 
Frank stumbles over himself to collect his things:      book, sweater, pills, etc. 
INT. TRAIN AISLE - MOMENTS LATER 
Frank struggles down the aisle, bumping into fellow passengers and apologizing as he goes. All the while looking around for a sign of Cara... 
EXT. VENICE TRAIN STATION - MORNING 
Frank steps off the train and glances about at the hive of activity. 
Frank brushes past the GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN from the Paris station. Finally he spots her... 
FRANK'S POV - Cara with her back turned. 
Frank hurries over. 
FRANK I was afraid I'd missed you. I wanted to ask where you're staying in Venice... I'm supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but I thought maybe-- 
CARA (without turning) I've got a better idea. 
She holds out her valise for him. 
He takes it hesitantly. She peers at him over the rims of her sunglasses with a very slight smile... 
HARD CUT TO: 
EXT. VENICE, GRAND CANAL - DAY 
A beauty shot of the Grand Canal: magnificent palaces and churches soar upwards on either side in all their glory. 
PUSH IN ON A launch labelled Danieli, travelling fast over the water. Cara shakes her head to let the wind ruffle her hair. 
FRANK No, no, no. The sofa's fine. Perfect in fact. 
Before he can say more, the buzzer sounds. 
CARA The luggage. 
FRANK I'll get it. 
He goes back inside to answer the door. 
Cara remains alone on the balcony, immobile, as if holding her breath. She's waiting... listening. 
INT. DOGE'S SUITE - DAY 
Frank walks across to the door. There is a small spyhole and he looks through it. The porter stands there with a trolley. Frank opens the door. 
The porter wheels the trolley in and starts to carry the bags into the bedroom. 
EXT. BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER 
Cara relaxes again as she hears Frank approach.   He steps outside on the balcony. 
FRANK I've put my things in the other bathroom. 
She turns to face him. 
CARA Have you ever been to Venice before? 
He shakes his head. 
CARA (CONT'D) Then we need to go out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY 
CAMERA TRACKS WITH GOYAL as he weaves through a sprawling mess of personnel and equipment, cell phones, computers and cables from various national agencies. The United Nations-aspect of the Task Force gives it impressive scope but also results in a Tower-of-Babel effect. 
The calm eye of the storm is Ackerman. 
GOYAL She's checked into the Danieli... she's not alone. 
ACKERMAN Good. (to the room) Maintain surveillance but keep your distance. (MORE) 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Don't try to get clever: remember that Pearce is smarter than most of you put together. 
ANGLE ON QUINN who quietly slips out of the room. 
EXT. PRIVATE LANDING STRIP, VENICE - DAY 
A Gulfstream G550 executive jet banks over the Venetian coast and comes in for a landing... 
Wheels down. Stairway unfolds. The man who steps off the plane is dressed in a hand-tailored Italian suit and shoes that cost more than some cars. He's flanked by two bodyguards. 
IVAN DEMIDOV.   In the flesh. 
EXT. VENICE - DAY 
CAMERA floats over the rooftops toward the penthouse of a ultra-high end business hotel. 
INT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Demidov sips a glass of red wine. The view from his room rivals the one at the Danieli but Demidov pays no attention. He's busy scanning his emails on his Blackberry. 
Knock, knock. A thick-necked BODYGUARD in the background goes to answer the door. A moment later... 
He ushers in Quinn, the Swiss Interpol agent. 
DEMIDOV Take a seat, Mr. Quinn. Can I offer you a glass of Brunello? It's a '97... 
QUINN No thank you, Mr. Demidov. 
Demidov swirls his glass. 
DEMIDOV You know I'd never admit this at home, but Vodka is for peasants. There's much we could learn from the Italians. 
He smiles pleasantly at Quinn, then, on a dime, he turns back to business. 
DEMIDOV (CONT'D) Tell me I'm not going to be disappointed. 
Quinn takes out an envelope and passes it over. 
She looks up at him. 
CARA You're smarter than you look, Frank. 
She runs her fingertip over the face of the watch. Then, impulsively unclasps it and reaches for Frank's hand. 
CARA (CONT'D) And you're right. Here, take it. 
She puts it on Frank's wrist, over his protests. 
FRANK What? No, I can't. This thing must be worth a fortune-- 
CARA I insist. You're doing me a favor. (firm) Take it or I'll toss it in the ocean. 
He hesitates.   She means it.    He closes the clasp. 
FRANK I'll wear it until you regain your senses. 
He feels the heft of it on his wrist. Admires it for a moment. It really is a beautiful watch. She settles back in her chair, pleased with herself. 
He looks up and sees her smiling at him. 
FRANK (CONT'D) What? 
CARA It suits you. 
LONG SHOT of Frank and Cara framed by the sunset. A romantic dinner for two. They could easily be lovers or honeymooners... 
In the foreground REVEAL somebody watching them.   The good-looking Englishman is there, hovering... 
INT. DOGE'S SUITE - NIGHT 
The key sounds in the lock and the door swings open. Frank and Cara tumble in together, laughing, a little tipsy. 
He glances at the sofa and that sobers him up, reminding him where he's going to sleep. However... 
He watches Cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off her shoes. She throws open the French doors to the balcony. 
Frank bypasses the sofa-bed and follows her outside. 
EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT 
Cara looks out across the lagoon. 
Frank appears beside her. 
FRANK I could get used to this. 
A movement in the street down below catches her eye. She studies the Ponte del Vin intently, seeing something. 
Cara turns abruptly to Frank and presses her body against his. He's taken by surprise but willingly responds to her advance, wrapping his arms around her back. 
They exchange a long, passionate kiss. 
VIDEO POV OF THE SAME 
REVEAL the lens of a PALM-SIZED VIDEO CAMERA peering out from behind a vendor's cart in the street below. 
Frank, his face slightly obscured, kisses Cara. 
WE HEAR the WHIRRING of the video camera. 
I/E. DOGE'S SUITE/BALCONY - RESUME 
Still kissing, Cara leads Frank back into the hotel room... 
EXT. VIDEO POV FROM THE STREET - CONTINUOUS 
The silhouettes of Cara and Frank disappear into the hotel room as... 
INT. DOGE'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Cara closes the curtains.   She pulls away from him. 
Her composure changes; the passion is gone.   The expression on her face is matter-of-fact. 
CARA You should leave Venice tomorrow. (softer) It's a city for lovers Frank; no place to recover from a failed engagement. 
She turns and walks toward her bedroom... 
Frank stares after her in stunned disappointment. 
INT. CARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Frank strolls into the room, barefoot, in his boxers. The bed is unmade. 
Cara has left a shirt over a chair... he picks it up and holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering scent. 
He notices a newspaper... a copy of The International Herald Tribune is open on her bedside table. He lifts it to see what Cara had been reading. 
There is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with a ball point pen. The message is just a list of words: 
"TOM CORRY NOW IN A MICA CAN IF FEELING PEST STILL AROUND." 
The dots single out letters in a code... Frank picks up the pen and puts a faint line through the groups of unselected letters to reveal the message: 
"Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro" 
Frank studies this for a moment. 
THE BUZZER SOUNDS 
Laying the paper on the table, Frank walks to the door. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Breakfast. 
Frank reaches for the doorknob... then pauses.   Breakfast again? 
He quietly slides the chain on.    Peers through the spyhole. 
SPYHOLE POV -- Two tough-looking men in suits stand there: most definitely not hotel staff. One has a scar on his face... Demidov's BODYGUARDS. 
Frank is frozen. 
Scarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters something in Russian to his partner. He produces a LOCK PICK SET and crouches out of frame. 
Frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking tumblers inside the lock. He looks around wildly. Sees the KEY on the entryway table and reaches for it... 
Ch-chunk. The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts to open the door. The chain stops it. A pause. 
A moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts to slide the chain... 
Frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast... 
Frank throws his shoulder against the door. The knife clatters to the floor as the door slams shut. Frank jams his KEY into the lock and turns the bolt into place. 
There's angry confusion on the other side of the door. 
Frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock. 
Frank scrambles out of the way... 
The sound of metal scraping in the lock. Russian CURSING can be heard just outside. A heavy blow as they try to shoulder the door open... 
Frank looks around desperately for an escape. 
The bathroom?   The sitting room?   Adjoining doors?   None. 
There's nowhere to go. 
Frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet. 
He scrambles outside as... 
POP! POP! POP! Bullets rip through the wood and metal, blasting the lock assembly apart. The door bursts open. 
EXT. BALCONY - DAY 
Frank looks down and stares at the 
DIZZYING SIX STORY DROP 
to the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below. 
Guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee. 
Three balconies over, Frank sees the rooftop of the modern wing of the hotel. 
IN THE SUITE 
The two TOUGHS rapidly move through the room, searching. Nyet, Nyet. 
The one place they haven't checked... 
INT. LEATHER SHOP - DAY 
Ducking inside a leather shop, Frank heads straight for the back entrance and finds it. 
He stands on the cobblestones. Blood streams from his forehead as well as his hand. He has 
SECONDS 
to decide which way to go. The alley is long and narrow on either side. An awning above. Clear sight lines. 
The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal. 
EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 
The Russians burst out the back. 
There is no sign of Frank. 
Scarface looks at the Canal. He walks to the edge of the water and SPRAYS gun fire atop it. Nothing. 
CUT TO: 
HIGH ANGLE OF SCENE 
Frank lies huddled on his back IN THE AWNING behind the leather shop, barely able to control his frantic breathing. He's mere feet away from the men who are trying to kill him... 
He looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian WOMAN peering out over her window box. 
Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips.    A prayer that she won't give him away. 
She looks at him disapprovingly.     Then disappears back inside. 
CLOSE ON FRANK as he waits, his heart pounding. 
Seconds tick past...   is he safe? 
Rrrrrip! A black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun, tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's head. 
He cries out. The awning rips and dumps him down hard onto the cobblestones below... 
A MOMENTARY BLACKOUT 
Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots that belong to... A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him. One of them holds a nightstick. 
They stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants lying at their feet. They've seen stranger things. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLIZIA "QUESTURA" (POLICE STATION) - DAY 
Frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders. Most of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a rough bandage on his head. 
From down the hallway a cheery stubble-faced POLICE OFFICER, DOMENICO (30's, animated), walks into the room where Frank is waiting. 
Domenico laughs, talking on his cell phone as he enters. 
DOMENICO (in Italian) You can't let them stay over, man. You start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car. Stop cuddling, Tomaso! 
Frank stands. 
FRANK Excuse me... 
DOMENICO (suddenly noticing him) Hey, what are you doing in here? 
FRANK The officers told me to wait here. I've been sitting here for over two hours... 
Dominico glances over his shoulder. 
DOMENICO I think they forgot about you. 
Frank sits back down heavily.    Domenico sits on the edge of a desk. 
DOMENICO (CONT'D) What happened to you, anyway? 
FRANK Somebody tried to kill me. 
Domenico picks up Frank's statement and glances at it. 
DOMENICO Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a day. Eh? We got chasing, we got shooting. 
Domenico looks at mild-mannered Frank sitting there in his boxers. The story seems unlikely. 
An immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's page fills the screen. The caption reads: 
#6 on INTERPOL'S MOST WANTED LIST. 
In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of a man's head. 
Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room where he was left... 
DOMENICO enters carrying a garish SWEAT SUIT.   He hands it to Frank. 
DOMENICO (CONT'D) Here.     Put these on. Time to go. 
Frank looks at the clothes. 
FRANK Um... thanks.   Where are we going? 
DOMENICO I'm taking you to the hospital, Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take a look at you. 
FRANK I'd really rather just go-- 
DOMENICO Don't worry. I put you in Padua, away from Venice. You'll be safe. (scribbles his number) Any worry, you call me. I give you my home number. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL SCANNING ROOM, PADUA - EVENING 
Frank lies flat on his back. 
A NURSE leans over him with a kindly expression. 
NURSE Relax signore. We're just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head. 
She slides him slowly into the mouth of an MRI scanning machine head first. It hums to life. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, DANIELI - EVENING 
Domenico whistles as a hotel clerk escorts him to to the Doge's suite. 
CLERK (in Italian) Unfortunately we've already re-let the room. (nervous) We'd rather the guests didn't know about the incident. 
DOMENICO Don't worry.   I'll be discreet. 
CLERK Grazie. 
The Clerk knocks.   The door is opened by Ivan Demidov. 
CLERK (CONT'D) I beg your pardon, Signore, but this is a police officer. He needs to briefly examine the room. 
DEMIDOV Of course. 
Demidov steps back, holding the door open. 
INT. DOGE'S SUITE, DANIELI - EVENING 
Demidov watches Domenico, who sniffs around. 
DEMIDOV (casually) What happened, officer? 
DOMENICO That's what I'm trying to find out, Signore. 
Domenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks around. He spots something under the sofa and fishes it out with his penknife... a spent bullet casing. 
He puts it in a plastic bag, pleased with himself. Demidov catches his eye. He smiles at him. 
DEMIDOV You are a good detective. 
DOMENICO I do my best. 
Domenico stands and takes his leave. 
DOMENICO (CONT'D) Sorry for the inconvenience. Enjoy your stay. 
As he and the clerk exit, Scarface steps out from the other room. Off Demidov's look, he leaves the suite to follow... 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, PADUA - NIGHT 
Frank lies on the bed. There are clean bandages on his injuries. 
The television drones on the wall: an Italian reality show. A WOMAN holds her hands over her eyes. The HOST taunts her: 
THE HOST (V.O.) (in Italian) Now remember, I said you were in for a surprise... a big surprise. 
The footsteps move away slightly... there is the sound of a door opening. The door across the hall. 
Seconds pass. The door is closed again.      The footsteps move down the hall, slowly fading away. 
Frank punches in the policeman's number and grips the receiver. It rings. 
INT. DOMENICO'S TERRACE FLAT - NIGHT 
A saucepot simmers on the stove. The phone RINGS. Behind it is a WINDOW - pierced by one circular bullet hole. 
The music still plays. 
As our gaze drifts downwards we see Domenico's bare feet, prone behind the kitchen island. 
The phone RINGS and RINGS... 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Frank is struggling into his clothes. Everything seems to stick and take forever. 
He opens the door a crack and looks down the ward. Nothing. He moves along the passage, slipping into doorways and out of the light. 
He finds the elevator and jabs at the button. 
The light shows it is approaching the floor. It stops. The doors open. Frank is about to enter it, when suddenly SOMEBODY STEPS OUT... 
An ORDERLY exits and brushes past. 
Frank breaths a sigh of relief and steps in. 
INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR, PADUA - NIGHT 
Frank presses the button for Receptione et Terre and waits an interminable four seconds for the doors to close. 
Slowly the elevator descends... and stops. 
The doors open. A big MAN stands with his back to us, blocking the exit. Frank shrinks away, with nowhere to hide. The man turns. 
He's a MALE NURSE, waiting to get into the lift. He stands aside to allow Frank to leave. Frank takes a step out... 
...and sees SCARFACE talking to the receptionist. Hurriedly, Frank reverses back into the elevator. 
FRANK (to the Nurse) Wrong floor. 
Then, just before the doors close, Scarface turns... his eyes meet Frank's. He starts towards the elevator... but the doors shut first. 
The lift stops again. The doors open on the first tier of the subterranean car park. 
Frank leaps off. 
INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK, PADUA HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Limping and terrified, Frank jogs towards the ramp marked Uscita in the far corner. 
An ENGINE ROAR splits the silence. The lights blind Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him. 
He falls to his knees. 
The car skids to a stop. 
The door flies open. He squints. Sitting behind the wheel, calm and beautiful as ever, is CARA. He stares. 
CARA What are you waiting for?    Get in. 
INT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT 
He climbs into the car.    She turns to him as she pulls out. 
CARA Did you miss me? 
FRANK A little. 
He glances anxiously over her shoulder. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Um... you may not believe this but there are some people trying to kill me-- 
CARA (calm) I know. 
Cara drives toward the ramp.     He looks at her. 
FRANK Do you know why? 
CARA He's the most interesting man I've ever known. When I first met him, I wasn't expecting that. He took me by surprise. 
She shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if reliving a memory of sensual pleasure. 
CARA (CONT'D) If I'd been prepared, I might not have loved him. But I wasn't. So I did. 
She frowns into her empty wine glass.    Frank slides a little closer. 
FRANK (soft) I don't regret it, you know. 
CARA Regret what? 
FRANK Kissing you. 
He looks into her eyes. They are sitting very close on the sofa. The lights are low. The mood is romantic... 
Frank puts an arm over her shoulders and leans in for a kiss-- 
Cara stands abruptly. 
CARA What are you doing? 
He looks   up at her, questioningly. 
FRANK I thought... 
CARA You thought what? That I saw you on the train and my heart stopped? That all my life I've been waiting for a math teacher from the Midwest to sweep me off my feet? 
Frank doesn't respond. 
CARA (CONT'D) I picked you because of your height. Do you understand? 
He does. His humiliation complete, he rises with as much dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the kitchen. 
Cara looks after him... exasperated yet already sorry for being so blunt. She is about to say something when... 
Her CELL PHONE RINGS.     A special ring. 
She answers right away. 
EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING 
The ENGLISHMAN strolls the Piazza San Marco.    FOLLOW HIM from behind as he speaks into his phone. 
THE ENGLISHMAN Have you been reading the newspaper? 
IN THE SAFE HOUSE 
Cara narrows her focus. She walks away from Frank, stealing away into the bedroom. Her heart is beating. 
CARA Yes... there was nothing there today. Is... is it you? Alexa-- 
THE ENGLISHMAN No names.    Not on the phone. 
INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - EVENING 
The WAVE PATTERNS of the man's voice shimmer on a computer monitor. Goyal and Ackerman stand watching, hanging on every word. 
THE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.) (from the speakers) It's been a busier weekend than I expected. 
ACKERMAN Place him.   Place him! 
A HORN-RIMMED AIDE zeroes in on a MAP screen. 
The screen gives him a map of VENICE.      Then zooms into a map of the SAN MARCO district... 
INT. BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - CONTINUOUS 
Cara holds one finger in her ear, listening intently. 
THE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.) There's a recipe in a Tuscan cookbook there I need. Would you look it up for me? 
CARA Do we really need another "recipe?" 
THE ENGLISHMAN I want to make sure our guests are surprised. 
EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING 
The Englishman passes the Lagoon to his left, and enters an enormous courtyard, the Arco Foscari. He looks down at his watch... 
THE ENGLISHMAN You're a brave and loyal girl. I'm in awe of you. 
ON FRANK 
His eyes are open. 
EXT. VENICE - MORNING 
Establishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the winter time. 
Boats are pushed out into the canals... 
Trash is hosed from the cobblestone streets... 
Tables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes, waiting for the tourists to come... 
INT. SITTING ROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - MORNING 
With an unfamiliar gentleness, Cara approaches Frank sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder. 
CARA Frank... I have to go. 
He opens his eyes and looks at her. 
CARA (CONT'D) Don't go out. All you need is here. In four or five days everything will be resolved... 
FRANK Resolved? 
CARA It will all be over. I'll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life. This will be a great adventure you can look back on. 
FRANK When will I see you again? 
CARA Never. 
She looks at him evenly; one last glance between two people from two completely different worlds. 
CARA (CONT'D) Good-bye, Frank. 
She leaves. 
INT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - DAY 
She has started down the stairs when Frank appears on the landing. He leans over the balustrade. 
FRANK Is he worth it? 
CARA Get back inside. 
She has stopped mid-flight. 
FRANK You're going to risk everything for him. Would he do the same for you? 
She is quite straightforward in her response. 
CARA It doesn't matter. I love him. 
FRANK He doesn't deserve it. 
She shakes her head. 
CARA None of this is your business anymore. Now get back inside Frank! 
Just as she raises her voice a door opens below them in the hall, and an old man comes out. He looks up at Cara. 
OLD MAN Signorina. 
This is exactly what she did not want. But she controls her annoyance, nods in greeting and continues towards the front door. 
CARA (to the neighbor) Mi dispiace, Signor. 
The Old Neighbor nods as Cara walks out the door. 
He admires Cara's shapely form as she crosses the cobblestone streets and disappears into the alley. 
He glances back up at Frank and whistles appreciatively. Frank turns and goes back inside. 
INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY 
Ackerman sits in an office chair, gently revolving. Jones, Goyal and Jean Luc are there as well. 
ACKERMAN Why do women find these con men so appealing? 
Jones is the only woman nearby... 
DEMIDOV (CONT'D) Except that you don't! 
Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face! 
Blood explodes from THICK NECK's nose.     He falls down to one knee, clutching his face in pain. 
Scarface looks on in fear. Demidov calms himself almost as quickly as he lost his temper. He drops the gun on the carpet and steps back in disgust. 
DEMIDOV (CONT'D) If you did your job properly, I wouldn't have to get my hands dirty, you piece of shit. 
He turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY 
Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani. She checks her watch. Then walks faster. 
She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat) floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo. 
Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant. 
INT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY 
From a second story SUITE of rooms, The ENGLISHMAN peers through the curtains. He sees Cara seat herself at a TABLE between the pool and the lagoon. 
His eyes settle on the transporto. Workers step on and off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel. 
He leaves the window. 
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY 
There is a small cabin on the deck. 
Inside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics officer huddle. 
Ackerman stares out the tinted window. 
ACKERMAN'S POV - he can just see Cara sitting at the table. 
EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY 
Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps... 
Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool. 
She turns away. 
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY 
Squinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements. 
- A WAITER, idling at his bussing station, his eyes roaming the palazzo. 
- A VAPORETTO CAPTAIN, who quietly turns away requests for a ride into St. Marks Square, his finger to his ear. 
- An OLDER COUPLE sitting a few seats away from Cara. 
And an AGENTE DI POLIZIA (police patrolman) loud and jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his earpiece. 
He speaks into the air. 
AGENTE DI POLIZIA (V.O.) (from the speakers) Eh, we do not know any further...characteristics? 
ACKERMAN (pressing a button) You know what we know. 
EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY 
The VIDEO CAMERA swivels to follow a MAN, elegantly dressed, with trim hair who swiftly approaches Cara's table... 
IN THE TRANSPORTO 
Standing up, Ackerman holds his hand up. 
ACKERMAN (into the speaker) Hold...wait for my signal... 
AT THE RESTAURANT 
Cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant man approaching. 
The WAITER walks quickly toward Cara's table... 
Frank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Well I'm not playing the role anymore. I'm going to confront him. He's supposed to meet you here, isn't he? I'm going to tell him exactly what I think of him. 
CARA Wonderful. Another macho idiot. (to the waiter) Conto, per favore! 
Frank leans in. 
FRANK What's the lure, Cara? Obviously not his character. Is it the money? The luxury? What's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail? 
CARA I'm leaving Frank. 
FRANK He's smooth, right? He probably has mistresses in every European city, too. 
CARA It's really a shame you've scared him off-- 
She tosses some Euros on the table. 
CARA (CONT'D) The two of you make a nice couple. 
The THIN WAITER arrives with a PLATTER.   He sets it down in front of Cara. 
The UNDERCOVER WAITER now moves toward the table with a grim expression... 
The THIN WAITER removes the platter.   Cara looks down. 
Spelled out in SALT and PEPPER on the plate is the following: 
"MY VILLA.    TONIGHT. 8PM." 
Cara no sooner reads it than the Thin Waiter, who we now see is THE ENGLISHMAN... 
...BLOWS on the platter, scattering the salt and pepper granules to the wind. 
FRANK What the hell? 
As Frank looks up. 
The Englishman has already turned away, but the Undercover Waiter is moving quickly toward Cara's table. 
The Undercover Waiter picks up speed, changing course slightly. WE SEE he's after The Englishman who is about to enter the restaurant kitchen... 
Then FRANK steps in front of The Undercover Waiter, mistaking him for Pearce. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Is this him? 
CARA Frank! 
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY 
Ackerman slaps the cabin table. 
ACKERMAN Abort!   Abort, goddammit! 
THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT 
The Undercover Waiter tries to move past Frank. 
FRANK You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you? Not much of a tough guy, are you? 
Frank SHOVES him back. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Where I come from, we don't treat women like that! 
Frank grabs the Undercover Waiter's collar with unaccustomed strength. 
Cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant. She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward the Palazzo Vendramin. 
In the midst of his scuffle, Frank looks around and realizes she's gone. 
The Undercover Waiter's earpiece falls out in the melee... Frank sees it and hesitates. Maybe this guy isn't Pearce. 
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY 
Getting up from his seat in the cabin, Ackerman gestures for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock. 
ON THE MONITOR: Frank looks around and sees Cara:     fifty feet away. Walking with purpose. 
ACKERMAN That goddamn fool. 
Ackerman rubs his face and squats down, frustrated beyond measure. 
INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY 
Ackerman leads Frank through the maze of desks and police. Various members of the task force follow their progress... Jean Luc, Jones, etc. 
They arrive at a central INTEL area where Goyal sits in front of several computer monitors. 
He looks up as Ackerman and Frank arrive. 
ACKERMAN (to Goyal) Pull up the CID Academy graduating class for 2002. 
Goyal raises an eyebrow, but does as he's told. A few moments later a photo of POLICE RECRUITS in uniform comes up on screen. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Take a good look. 
Frank peers at the screen. He spots the instructor-- Ackerman seven years younger. 
FRANK You? 
ACKERMAN Take a look at the second row. 
INSERT CLOSE UP on the screen. 
Frank examines the second row. One of the young women is... CARA MASON. Her hair is pulled back. She looks more the determined police cadet than the sexy siren...  but it's definitely her. 
FRANK Cara... 
He is dumbfounded. 
ACKERMAN We've been watching you this entire time. 
FRANK (dawning) You saw those men try to kill me and you didn't intervene? 
ACKERMAN I'm trying to apprehend a major criminal. I'm not a babysitter. 
Frank grows angry. 
FRANK I want to speak with somebody at the American Embassy. I'm going to tell them that you and your undercover officer knowingly and recklessly endangered the life of an American citizen! Let's see what my government has to say about that! 
Jones clears her throat from a chair across the room. 
JONES We're aware of the situation, Mr. Taylor. But we take a long view of these things... fortunately you are unhurt... 
Frank is incredulous. 
FRANK Then I'll go to the press. I'll tell the entire story to the New York Times. 
ACKERMAN (quietly) No.   I don't think you'll do that. 
FRANK Why not? 
ACKERMAN Because I don't think you want to see Cara's entire career destroyed. 
Frank falls silent. Ackerman puts an arm around his shoulder and leads him away from the others. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Espresso? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY 
Frank stands on a balcony overlooking a waterway. Ackerman emerges with two cups of espresso. Hands one to Frank. 
ACKERMAN Women like Cara don't come along very often. 
FRANK In my case, they don't come along at all. 
ACKERMAN She's the worst combination: stunning looks and a brilliant mind. 
FRANK If she's so smart, how did she get caught up with Pearce? 
ACKERMAN It started out as a straightforward placement... 
INT. DOGE'S PALACE - DAY [FLASHBACK] 
Cara (younger) poses as an art student, sketching a SCULPTURE in the Anticollegio. 
ACKERMAN (V.O.) ...we ran her deep cover to build a case against Pearce. It took. He hired her as an assistant. 
She turns her face and smiles at an UNSEEN MAN. 
EXT. YACHT - DAY [FLASHBACK] 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY 
Ackerman strides into the room, calling for attention. 
ACKERMAN Okay everybody, listen up. 
Jones, Quinn, Jean Luc and the rest of the team assemble. Goyal has Frank with him, dragging him around like a lost puppy dog... 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) We have a location and time for the next meet.    Pearce's villa. Eight o'clock. We have to move fast-- 
JONES Pearce's own villa? Why would he risk going back there? He must know we'd be watching. 
JEAN LUC Perhaps he's nostalgic. 
ACKERMAN I doubt that. Maybe there's something of value still there. He left in a hurry after all. 
JONES Call in a search team. 
ACKERMAN We searched the place after the raid last year. If there's anything hidden there, only Pearce knows where it is. 
He picks up his coat. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) We need to get agents in place all around the villa. 
Frank speaks up unexpectedly. 
FRANK If you're all around his house, will he show up? 
A dozen heads turn to look at him. 
ACKERMAN If I needed your advice Mr. Taylor, I'd ask. 
Frank shrinks down in his chair. 
A beat.   Ackerman turns back to the rest of the room. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Establish a wide perimeter. We'll keep our distance and wire the entire villa for video surveillance. 
The meeting breaks up.   Everybody jumps into action. 
ON QUINN as he slips out a side door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY 
A standard hotel room-- no lavish suite this time. 
Cara stands in front of the mirror. Her shirt is unbuttoned as she works to attach a TINY MICROPHONE to her bra. 
The tape gets stuck to itself and she has to start over... 
A KNOCK on her hotel room door. 
CARA Come in. 
Frank enters the room.    Sees her half-dressed-- 
FRANK I'm sorry. 
CARA It's okay.   Come over here.    I need your help. 
In an echo of their first meeting on the train (but without the false flirtation) she turns to him and hands him a piece of tape. 
Their eyes meet.   A flicker of a smile passes between them. 
Frank's fingers are perfectly steady this time as he helps her secure the microphone and do up her shirt. 
FRANK Ackerman told me everything. 
She takes a deep breath. 
CARA I'm sorry Frank. 
FRANK There's no apology necessary. 
He steps back from her.    She smooths her blouse.   Turns to him. 
CARA (re: the wire) How do I look? 
EXT. BACK OF THE VILLA - NIGHT 
The black boat slips underneath some moorings. 
A gloved hand tosses a grappling hook up to a beam ten feet overhead. It catches. The boat is tied off. 
Silently, a masked figure begins to climb from the boat up into the bottom floor of the villa in the semi- darkness. 
INT. SURVEILLANCE OUTPOST IN CHURCH 
ON THE MONITOR WE SEE 
PEARCE'S ENTRY HALL. Cara unlocks the front door with a key and walks inside. 
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA/VIDEO MONITORS - CONTINUOUS 
TRACK from screen to screen as WE FOLLOW Cara moving through the deserted rooms. 
Everything is cold and lifeless.   Like a palace that has been turned into a museum. 
INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 
While everyone is focused on the monitors showing Cara's progress, Frank notices some movement in a monitor far off to one side... 
It shows the lower floor of the house. 
FRANK (points) Who's that? 
They all turn to look. A male figure, his face masked, approaches the lens of the surveillance camera... 
BLINK!   The FEED shuts off. 
Ackerman barks at a technician. 
ACKERMAN What happened? Get it back on line! 
The surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons, etc. 
JONES Was that Pearce? 
GOYAL How did he know there would be a camera? 
BLINK!   Another monitor goes dark.   Then another. 
JONES He's taking out the entire surveillance system-- 
ACKERMAN Stop him. 
TECHNICIAN I can't! He's cutting the feed at the source. 
Frank looks anxiously at Cara on the monitor climbing the stairs... 
Blink! She disappears from view as well.      Everybody starts talking. 
JEAN LUC How can one man move through the house that fast? 
GOYAL (overlapping) What should we do? 
ACKERMAN Shut up!    Everyone. 
They quiet down.   Ackerman turns to the tech. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Do we still have audio? 
The tech nods. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Turn it up. 
Everybody in the Church stands stock still.    Staring at the dark monitors. Listening. 
Cara's footsteps click up the stairs and then slow... 
They move tentatively across the floor. 
WE HEAR A THUMP.   A door or a heavy footstep? 
Cara's breathing gets louder.    There's somebody else in the building. 
CARA (V.O.) Alexander? 
No response.   Click, clack, click... She takes a few steps. 
Everyone in the room flinches. 
DEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D) You know... I have a feeling he is around here somewhere. And if he cares about you... if he wants to see your lovely face again... he should show up before it's too late. 
ANOTHER SLAP - MORE VICIOUS THAN THE FIRST.      This time Cara cries out in pain. 
Goyal turns to Ackerman. 
GOYAL Sir? 
ACKERMAN Demidov's right. He's here somewhere... 
Another SLAP.    Another scream. 
Jean Luc looks to his colleagues-- Jones, Quinn... then turns to Ackerman. Every one of them is about to burst. 
JEAN LUC We have to do something-- 
ACKERMAN We have to wait. 
JEAN LUC Yes but-- 
ACKERMAN (harsh) She's my agent. She's my responsibility. 
A muffled THUD. Cara groans and WE HEAR her body hit the floor. That wasn't a slap. 
Every cop in the room is clenching his weapon. Desperate for the order to move. To jump in and stop this. 
They are all looking to Ackerman to give the order. 
As the silence wears on, even Jones starts to waver. She speaks quietly to Ackerman. 
JONES What if he doesn't come? 
Ackerman doesn't respond. 
The lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing than before. 
Suddenly Goyal notices... 
GOYAL Where's Taylor? 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Frank runs for all he's worth.    Panting for breath. 
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT 
Frank bursts through the front door.      Races to the steps without hesitating... 
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
Cara lies on her side at Demidov's feet.     Blood trickles from the side of her mouth. 
Her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the room half-askew. Then they suddenly come into focus as she sees... 
A figure walks into the room.    FRANK. 
He stand motionless in the doorway, surprisingly calm. 
Demidov turns. 
DEMIDOV (leans down to Cara) Good news. He loves you. 
Demidov's men take Frank by either arm and roughly drag him forward. 
Cara lifts her head with an effort. 
CARA That's not Alexander Pearce. 
Demidov ignores her and walks up to Frank. 
DEMIDOV You know, Mr. Pearce, I thought I was finished with this sort of thing. But in your case, I've been forced to make an exception. 
He holds out his hand and one of his THUGS gives him a PISTOL and a SILENCER. 
CARA He is NOT Alexander Pearce! 
Demidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel.

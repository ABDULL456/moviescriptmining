The Crying Game 
The Crying Game 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY 
A loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris Wheel turning round and round. 
A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings around a bowling pin. 
JODY And that's cricket, hon. 
An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in his huge hands. He gives it to the girl. 
JODY You want it? 
GIRL Sure. 
JODY Doesn't matter if you don't. 
He puts his arm around her and drags her on. 
JODY Jody won't be offended. Jody's never offended. What'd you say your name was? 
GIRL Jude. 
JODY Jude. Suits you, Jude. 
JUDE The teddy bear? 
JODY No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June. 
He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET. 
JODY Gotta piss, Jude. 
He holds her hand. 
JODY Don't run off, Jude. 
JUDE You don't know me, do you? 
Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the canvas, looking bored. 
JODY (inside) What if I did? 
JUDE You'd know I wouldn't run off. 
She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark- haired man in a dark jacket. He nods. 
JODY Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude. 
JUDE You didn't? 
JODY And you know what? 
JUDE Tell me, Jody 
He staggers out, buttoning up. 
JODY It's nice. 
He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away. 
JUDE Not here. 
JODY Who gives a fuck. 
JUDE You never know. 
She pulls him over toward the water. 
JODY I never know nothing. 
JUDE People. They could be looking. 
Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle. 
JUDE Come and get me, soldier -- 
JODY Whatever you say, Jude... 
He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow falls across them. 
CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly. 
JUDE Fucking do. I had him all over me. 
He touches her face. 
FERGUS Tough work, that. 
JUDE Someone's got to do it. 
She rubs her hand on his chest. 
JUDE Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of you. 
She sidles closer, coming on to him. 
JUDE And you know what, Fergus? One of you made me want it... 
She puts her lips to his neck. 
FERGUS Which one? 
She doesn't answer. They embrace. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING. 
A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward a greenhouse. 
INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY 
Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap. Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He holds one out toward him. 
FERGUS Eat something, would you? 
JODY Can't. 
FERGUS What do you mean you can't? 
JODY Can't eat through a canvas bag. 
Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats, slowly. 
JODY This is a farce, man. 
FERGUS How is it a farce? 
JODY I seen your fucking face. 
FERGUS So, what do I look like? 
JODY You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face. 
FERGUS Am I? 
JODY Yeah. And the brown eyes. 
Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth. 
JODY You're the handsome one. 
Jody eats the last bits. 
JODY Thank you, handsome. 
FERGUS My pleasure. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 
Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She is carrying a pot of tea and two cups. 
INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY 
It is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat. 
JODY I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a Christian, will you? 
Jude comes into view. 
JODY Tell him to take the hood off, honey... 
Jude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground. 
FERGUS How did you know it was her? 
JODY I can smell her perfume. 
Jude pours out the tea. 
JUDE See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance. 
JODY Nope. Not handsome at all. 
FERGUS You trying to hurt my feelings? 
JODY No. It's the truth. 
FERGUS Well, I could say the same about you. 
JODY Could you? 
FERGUS But I won't. We're more polite around these parts. 
JODY So I've noticed. 
Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on his lap. 
JODY Hey -- 
FERGUS What is it now? 
JODY You're going to have to do it, aren't you? 
FERGUS Do what? 
JODY Kill me. 
FERGUS What makes you think that? 
JODY They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me. 
FERGUS They won't let him die. 
JODY You want to bet? 
FERGUS I'm not a gambling man. 
JODY And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose. 
FERGUS Why can't we? 
JODY Not in your nature. 
FERGUS What do you know about my nature? 
JODY I'm talking about your people, not you. 
FERGUS What the fuck do you know about my people? 
JODY Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go. 
FERGUS Shut the fuck up, would you? 
JODY And you know the funny thing? 
FERGUS No, what's the funny thing? 
JODY I didn't even fancy her. 
FERGUS Didn't look like that to me... 
JODY She's not my type. 
He looks at Fergus. 
JODY C'mere. 
FERGUS No. 
JODY Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something. 
FERGUS What? 
JODY My inside pocket. 
Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's inside pocket. 
JODY Take out the wallet. 
Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet. 
JODY Open it. 
CLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification photograph. 
JODY Inside. There's a picture. 
Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites, smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles. 
JODY It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I prattle on, do you? 
Fergus shakes his head and says nothing. 
JODY I will take it by your silence that you don't. 
He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody. 
JODY Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the frog. Ever heard of them? 
Fergus says nothing. 
JODY Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would not be in my interest to sting you since as I'll be on your back we both would drown." Frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. Takes the scorpion on his back. Braves the waters. Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?" Scorpion replies, "I can't help it, it's in my nature." 
Jody chuckles under his hood. 
FERGUS So what's that supposed to mean? 
JODY Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man. 
FERGUS Why? 
JODY 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature. 
Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles up at him. 
JODY See? I was right about you. 
FERGUS Don't be so sure. 
JODY Jody's always right. 
INT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON. 
Both men dozing in the heat. 
JODY Where would you most like to be now, man? 
FERGUS Doesn't matter where. 
JODY Come on, man. If this shit was all over. 
FERGUS Having a pint in the Rock. 
JODY You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring. 
FERGUS Like what? 
JODY Like having a pint in the Metro -- 
Fergus laughs. 
FERGUS Having two pints in the Rock. 
JODY Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita. 
FERGUS Who's Dil? 
JODY My special friend. 
FERGUS Oh, yeah. 
JODY We got simple tastes, you and me. 
FERGUS The best. 
JODY But you fellas never get a break, do you? 
FERGUS Do you? 
JODY Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you? 
FERGUS We don't look on it like that. 
JODY I've often wondered how you do it. 
FERGUS Depends on what you believe in. 
JODY What do you believe in? 
FERGUS That you guys shouldn't be here. 
JODY It's as simple as that? 
FERGUS Yes. 
Jude enters. 
Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others. 
MAGUIRE We've had word. They've used every trick in the book on him. He's starting to talk. You're going to have to do it in the morning. 
Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods. 
MAGUIRE You OK about that? 
FERGUS I'm a volunteer, am n't I? 
MAGUIRE Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days. 
JUDE Not the only one -- 
MAGUIRE Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus. 
FERGUS Peter. 
MAGUIRE What? 
FERGUS Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight -- 
JUDE You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter. 
MAGUIRE Shut the fuck up, Jude. 
He turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's shoulder. 
MAGUIRE Why do you want to do that for? 
FERGUS Would make me feel better about it. 
MAGUIRE You sure about that? 
FERGUS I'm sure. 
MAGUIRE Okay. You're a good man, Fergus. 
Fergus leaves. 
INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. 
Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody. 
Jody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound of crying. 
FERGUS Don't. 
JODY I'm sorry. 
The crying stops. 
JODY Help me. 
FERGUS How can I? 
JODY I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette. 
Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's hood so he can smoke. 
JODY Don't even smoke, you know that? It just seemed the right thing to do. 
Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips. Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth. 
FERGUS Go to sleep now. 
JODY I don't want to sleep. Tell me something. 
FERGUS What? 
JODY A story. 
FERGUS Like the one about the frog? 
JODY And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything. 
FERGUS When I was a child... 
JODY Yeah? 
FERGUS I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things... 
JODY What does that mean? 
FERGUS Nothing. 
JODY Tell me something, anything. 
Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him. 
JODY Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit more wind -- 
Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on him again. 
JODY Bit of fun, Fergus, eh? 
And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to Fergus. 
JODY Told you I was fast -- 
Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody 
JODY Don't do it. 
And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt and the huge wheels grind over him. 
Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns and runs. 
EXT. TREES - DAY 
Fergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as he runs. 
INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY 
Tinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it, shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 
Bullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the others on the floor, scrambling for weapons. 
EXT. TREES - DAY 
Fergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging branches till eventually he is hidden from sight. 
EXT. CARNIVAL ON THE MONAGHAN BORDER - DAWN. 
A forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields. 
An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car appears; and Fergus gets out of it. 
TOMMY Fergus! 
FERGUS You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping? 
INT. CARAVAN - DAY 
The old man pouring whiskey into a teacup. 
TOMMY You'll notice I've asked you nothing. 
FERGUS That's wise, Tommy. 
TOMMY All right, then. I like to be wise. 
He pours Fergus more whiskey. 
TOMMY So what do you need, Fergus? 
FERGUS Need to go across the water. 
TOMMY Do you now. 
FERGUS Need to lose myself awhile. 
TOMMY Aha. 
He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette. 
He puffs. 
TOMMY There's a man I know ships cattle to London. 
EXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING. 
The ferry, churning into the sunset. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. BUILDING SITE - DAY 
FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and relentlessly, like a machine. 
We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole. 
Fergus's face, as he works. 
Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them is empty. 
DIL That should make her happy. 
FERGUS Who's she? 
DIL Don't know. Who is she? 
EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. 
Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway. 
The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro. Fergus follows. 
INT. METRO - EVENING. 
Half full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way through it. 
BARMAN Hi, Dil 
DIL Hiya, hon. 
She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat. 
BARMAN What'll it be? 
FERGUS A bottle of Guinness. 
Dil, looking at Fergus. 
DIL See that, Col? 
COL See what, Dil? 
DIL He gave me a look. 
COL Did he? 
Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink. 
DIL Just cut his hair, you know. 
COL Yeah? 
DIL What you think? 
COL Nice. 
Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face turned away, but sees him in the mirror. 
DIL There, he did it again. 
COL Saw that one. 
DIL What would you call it? 
COL Now, that was a look. 
She eyes Fergus in the mirror. 
DIL Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking. 
The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus. 
COL She wants to know do you want to know what she's drinking. 
Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up. 
DIL A margarita. 
The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink. 
DIL Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col. 
COL She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair. 
FERGUS Tell her I'm very happy with it. 
DIL He's Scottish, Col. 
COL Scottish? 
FERGUS Yeah. 
DIL What'd he say, Col? 
COL He agreed that he was. 
Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way. 
COL Take it out, if you want. 
Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and drinks with the other. 
COL You came to see her, didn't you? 
Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to his left smiles at him. 
COL Something I should tell you. She's -- 
FERGUS She's what? 
The barman looks up toward the stage. 
COL She's on. 
THE JUKEBOX. 
A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by Dave Berry, "The Crying Game." 
AT THE BAR. 
Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins, making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands. 
The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of approval or derision we can't be sure. 
Fergus watching. 
Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song. The crowd cheers. 
Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar, toward him. 
DIL He's still looking, Col. 
COL Persistent. 
DIL Good thing in a man. 
COL An excellent quality. 
DIL Maybe he wants something. 
COL I would expect he does. 
DIL Ask him. 
COL Ask him yourself. 
She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him. 
DIL So tell me. 
Fergus says nothing. He shrugs. 
DIL Everybody wants something. 
FERGUS Not me. 
DIL Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col? 
Col shrugs. 
DIL You old-fashioned? 
FERGUS Must be. 
The burly man comes up to her. 
MAN Got the money, Dil? 
DIL Fuck off, Dave. 
DAVE You fucking promised. 
DIL Did I? 
DAVE You fucking did. 
He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink. 
DAVE Didn't you? Well, come on! 
He drags her through the crowd. In the mirror, Fergus watches them go. The barman eyes him. 
COL It takes all types. 
They walk out of the alley. 
FERGUS You all right? 
DIL Yes, thank you. 
FERGUS What was that all about? 
DIL He wants me to perform for him. 
FERGUS Perform? 
DIL You know. 
FERGUS You on the game? 
DIL God no. I'm a hairdresser. 
Fergus looks back. Dave is rising. 
FERGUS He's getting up. 
DIL You can't leave me then, can you? 
EXT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE DIL'S FLAT 
Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs. 
DIL You want me to ask you in, right? 
FERGUS No, I didn't -- 
DIL But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap. 
There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave, holding his neck. 
DAVE Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt. 
Dil leans close to Fergus. 
DIL If you kissed me, it would really get his goat. 
She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly. 
DIL Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane. 
FERGUS Where? 
DIL Half-five. At Millie's. 
She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down at Dave, who turns to leave. 
EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY 
Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus. 
DIL Give me that look again. 
FERGUS What look? 
DIL The one you gave me in the Metro. 
Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She holds them, with theatrical feeling. 
DIL Darling, you shouldn't have. 
She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon pull back a curtain, and they all clap. 
FERGUS What's that about? 
DIL They're jealous. 
FERGUS Why? 
DIL I wonder. 
She takes his arm and walks off with him. 
INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 
Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks on their table, then leaves. 
DIL Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it? 
FERGUS Like what? 
DIL Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes? 
DAVE Fucking mad! 
Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of rejection with his things in his arms. 
DAVE Don't chuck my clothes out! 
DIL Take your fucking goldfish, too! 
Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the street. 
DAVE You fucking bitch! 
He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands. 
DAVE Murderer! 
Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut. 
DIL Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace? 
FERGUS Must be in love to manage that. 
DIL Doesn't know the meaning of the word. 
Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass. 
FERGUS He lived here with you? 
DIL Tried to. Sit down, will you? 
Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from her to the picture. 
FERGUS What about him? 
He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink. 
DIL He was different. 
FERGUS How different? 
DIL As different as it's possible to be. 
FERGUS Tell me about him. 
DIL No. 
FERGUS Shouldn't I go? 
DIL Yes. 
And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently passionate. 
They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress with his hands. She suddenly pulls away. 
DIL No -- 
FERGUS Did you do that to him? 
She comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close to his ear. 
DIL You want to know how I kissed him? 
FERGUS Yes... 
DIL Are you jealous of him? 
FERGUS Maybe. 
DIL That's good... 
She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes. 
FERGUS What would he think? 
DIL Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool. 
She sits in front of the mirror. 
FERGUS Do you miss him? 
DIL What do you think? 
FERGUS I think you do. 
DIL (dreamily) You say that like a gentleman. 
FERGUS Do I? 
Col, the barman, pours her drink. 
DIL One for him, too. 
Col pours and smiles. 
DIL Drink. 
FERGUS What is this? 
DIL I'm superstitious. Drink. 
He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one. 
DIL Can't leave me now. 
FERGUS Aha. 
DIL The thing is, can you go the distance? 
FERGUS Depends what it is. 
DIL No, depends on nothing. 
She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She slams it back. He sips. 
DIL In one. 
She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT. 
She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs. 
DIL What you thinking of, hon? 
FERGUS I'm thinking of your man. 
DIL Why? 
FERGUS I'm wondering why you keep his things. 
DIL Told you, I'm superstitious. 
She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her shoulders. 
FERGUS Did he ever tell you you were beautiful? 
DIL All the time. 
Fergus runs his hand down her throat. 
DIL Even now. 
FERGUS No... 
DIL He looks after me. He's a gentleman too. 
She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him down. They kiss passionately. 
DIL Give me one minute. 
She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks extraordinarily beautiful. 
He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward him. He begins to kiss her face and neck. 
FERGUS Would he have minded? 
She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders. 
CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness. Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a close-up, that she is a man. 
Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her. 
DIL You did know, didn't you? 
Fergus says nothing. 
DIL Oh my God. 
She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch him. Fergus smacks the hand away. 
FERGUS Jesus. I feel sick -- 
He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet. 
DIL Don't go, Jimmy -- 
Fergus leaves. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT. 
Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We hear the song "The Crying Game." 
Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and sticks it in the letter box. 
EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY 
A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine. 
Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working. 
INT. SITE - DAY 
Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out. 
Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus . 
DEVEROUX How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum? 
FRANKNUM Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux. 
DEVEROUX Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid. 
FERGUS Sorry. 
DEVEROUX Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum? 
FRANKNUM Not in my experience. 
DEVEROUX Off his wages. 
FERGUS Do you mean that? 
DEVEROUX He wants to know do I mean that. 
FRANKNUM I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux. 
DEVEROUX Bloody right I do... 
Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at her, looking up her skirt, etc. 
She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him. 
DEVEROUX Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart? 
FERGUS She's not a tart. 
DEVEROUX No, of course not, she's a lady. 
FERGUS She's not that either. 
Fergus walks out of the room. 
Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves, sits on some bricks and opens the hamper. 
DIL Darling -- 
She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She pecks him on the cheek. 
DIL Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say. 
FERGUS What you doing here? 
DIL Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon. 
FERGUS Don't call me that. 
DIL Sorry, darling. 
FERGUS Give it over, Dil -- 
DIL Apologies, my sweet. 
Fergus smiles in spite of himself. 
DIL That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa. 
She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea. 
FERGUS You're something else, Dil, you know that? 
DIL Never said a truer word. 
She hands him a neatly cut sandwich. 
DIL Make it up to me, then. 
FERGUS How? 
DIL Ask to meet me again. 
FERGUS Will you meet me again? 
DIL When? 
FERGUS Whenever. Tonight. 
She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site. 
EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. 
Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling. Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach. 
FERGUS Do they know? 
DIL Know what, honey? 
FERGUS Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that. 
DIL Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings. 
FERGUS Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl. 
DIL Details, baby, details. 
FERGUS So they do know. 
DIL All right, they do. 
She takes his arm as they walk off. 
FERGUS Don't. 
DIL Sorry. 
FERGUS I should have known, shouldn't I? 
DIL Probably. 
FERGUS Kind of wish I didn't. 
DIL You can always pretend. 
FERGUS That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he? 
DIL Absolutely. 
FERGUS Won't be quite the same though, will it? 
DIL Are you pretending yet? 
FERGUS I'm working on it. 
Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look. 
FERGUS There's Dave. He knew too. 
DIL Stop it, Jimmy. 
FERGUS Am I becoming repetitious? 
DIL A little. 
FERGUS Sorry. 
They reach her door. The car stops. 
FERGUS Don't ask me in. 
DIL Please, Jimmy. 
FERGUS No. Can't pretend that much. 
DIL I miss you, Jimmy. 
FERGUS Should have stayed a girl. 
DIL Don't be cruel. 
FERGUS Okay. Be a good girl and go inside. 
DIL Only if you kiss me. 
FERGUS What the fuck do you know, Jude? 
She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth. 
JUDE You fucking tell me, boy -- 
Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly: 
FERGUS She's nobody. She likes me. 
JUDE So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us. 
She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple. 
JUDE Keep the faith. 
She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness. 
EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. 
Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand. 
He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then the chair turns and we see it is Jude. 
Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil 
INT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. 
JUDE He your boyfriend? 
Jude, turning in the chair. 
JUDE Lucky you. 
INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 
DIL Carnations. 
FERGUS What? 
DIL He'd bring me carnations. 
FERGUS So I got it wrong, then. 
DIL Not at all, honey. 
FERGUS Don't. 
DIL Okay. 
She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly. 
He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog- marches her out. 
FERGUS Come on. 
DIL Why, honey -- 
FERGUS Come on. 
DIL You gonna tell me why? 
FERGUS No. 
As they pass Jude, she smiles. 
EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 
Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away. 
DIL What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong 
FERGUS Not here. 
They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising. 
INT. METRO - NIGHT. 
Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar. 
DIL You gonna tell me what it is? 
A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude. 
JUDE What was it? 
DIL You know her, Jimmy? 
There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand and begins to wipe her face. 
DIL Don't. My makeup. 
She sits down; he joins her. 
DIL She own you, Jimmy? 
FERGUS Yes. 
DIL She from Scotland too? 
FERGUS You could say that. 
DIL And you're not going to tell me more? 
FERGUS I can't. 
He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more. 
DIL What you doing, Jimmy? 
FERGUS I'm not sure. 
DIL Do you like me even a little bit? 
FERGUS More than that. 
Dil's face, staring at him. 
FERGUS Come on, let's go for a walk. 
She allows herself to be led out. 
EXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT. 
Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window. 
FERGUS You do something for me, Dil? 
DIL Anything. 
FERGUS You'd do anything for me? 
DIL Afraid so. 
FERGUS You got the keys to the shop? 
They walk inside. 
INT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT. 
Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness. 
DIL You want another haircut, baby? 
FERGUS No. Sit down. 
He sits her down in one of the chairs. 
FERGUS You'd do anything for me? 
Dil nods. 
DIL Anything. 
Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head leaps back. 
DIL No way -- 
FERGUS You said anything, Dil 
DIL A girl has to draw the line somewhere -- 
FERGUS Want to change you to a man, Dil... 
She stares at him. 
DIL Why? 
FERGUS It's a secret. 
DIL You'd like me better that way, Jimmy? 
FERGUS Yes. 
DIL And you wouldn't leave me? 
Dil smiles woozily. 
DIL Yes. 
FERGUS I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died. 
DIL Died... 
FERGUS Did you hear me? 
DIL You killed my Jody? 
FERGUS In a manner of speaking. 
DIL It was you... 
She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere. 
FERGUS You should scream. You should beat my head off. 
She woozily tries to hit him round the face. 
DIL You killed my Jody 
FERGUS No. 
DIL You didn't. 
FERGUS I suppose I tried. 
DIL You tried. 
FERGUS Don't you want to kill me? 
Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him. 
DIL Bang... 
He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily 
DIL Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too. 
FERGUS Okay. 
Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks down at her, almost fondly. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING. 
They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes. She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the gun. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING. 
Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT. 
Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to wake him. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING. 
Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT. 
She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking so it is secure. 
FERGUS What the fuck -- 
Dil speaks unnaturally quietly. 
DIL So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING. 
Jude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and slips it in her handbag. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING. 
Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand. 
DIL Didn't really listen last night. I heard but I didn't listen. 
Fergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings. 
DIL That won't do you no good. Dil knows how to tie a body. 
She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus. 
The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT - DAY 
Dil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck -- "The Crying Game" song. She comes to the bed, and points the gun at Fergus's head. 
DIL You like me now, Jimmy? 
FERGUS I like you, Dil -- 
DIL Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more. 
FERGUS More what? 
DIL More endearments. 
FERGUS I like you, DIl 
DIL Love me. 
FERGUS Yes. 
DIL Tell me you love me. 
FERGUS Whatever you say, Dil. 
DIL Then say it. 
FERGUS Love you, Dil. 
DIL You do? 
FERGUS Yeah. 
DIL What would you do for me? 
FERGUS Anything. 
She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest. 
DIL Say it again. 
FERGUS I'd do anything for you, Dil. 
She pulls on his bindings to release him. 
EXT. STREET. 
Two police cars, sirens wailing. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT. 
Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound his hands are nearly undone. 
DIL And you'll never leave me? 
FERGUS Never. 
DIL I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it. 
His arm is free. He strokes her hair. 
FERGUS I'm sorry, Dil. 
She shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the background. 
Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a gun. 
JUDE You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough. But twice. 
Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude. 
DIL You didn't knock, honey -- 
Dil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the floor. 
FERGUS Dil! 
JUDE Get that thing off me, Fergus -- 
Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude. 
DIL What was that she called you, Jimmy? 
FERGUS Fergus. 
DIL What's Fergus?

FRANKENWEENIE

John August 
WHIRS and HUMS.    The screen flickers. 
Splices pop through the gate. 
And then, today's feature film: 
MONSTERS FROM BEYOND! 
The title card is made from cut cardboard, and very blurry. 
MOM (O.S.) Victor, I don't know that it's... 
VICTOR (O.S.) Mom, you have to wear the glasses. 
MOM (O.S.) Oh!     Yes of course. 
Thick frames slide past. Now we're looking at the title card in real 3D. It's very homemade, but charmingly done. 
The next card: 
STARRING SPARKY 
DAD In 3D honey. 
Reveal that we are... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Victor's MOM and DAD share the couch with SPARKY THE DOG, 30-odd pounds of canine goodness. They're watching the homemade movie through vintage 3D glasses. 
Behind them run two projectors, manned by the filmmaker himself, VICTOR. He's more mad scientist than film auteur -- he built this twin projector system himself. 
MOM So that's where my candlestick went. 
DAD Oh, isn't that your grandmother's table cloth. 
MOM That looks great! 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   2 
BACK TO THE SCREEN 
The pterodactyl swoops across town. People run in fear and panic. The monster attacks! 
DAD Oh that is so...Woah! I just felt I was attacked. 
MOM Oh. That's scary. 
Troops and tanks spring into action. 
DAD Send in the marines! 
ARMY FIGURE Over here men. This way. 
To no avail. 
MOM Oh! Watch out! 
DAD Whoah! 
Victor raises his hand. 
TOSHIAKI But it's not rare. Lightning happens to people all the time here. There's a thunderstorm almost every night. 
BOB My dad got hit twice. 
WEIRD GIRL They built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine... 
TOSHIAKI I heard it was a cemetery. 
WEIRD GIRL That's where they buried the miners. 
NASSOR It's the windmill that does it. 
REVEAL a view of the windmill through the classroom window. 
We PUSH IN on Nassor, the intense look in his eyes. 
NASSOR Turning, turning the air until the sky itself rages against the night. 
A beat. 
WEIRD GIRL No.   Cemetery. Definitely. 
EXT. BACK YARD - DAY 
Sparky amusing himself while Victor is at school by playing with a tennis ball. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   9 
But "catch" doesn't work too well without Victor and the ball rolls through a broken plank in the bottom of Mr Burgemeister's fence. 
Assuming it is lost forever, Sparky sits dejectedly looking at the fence until he is startled to see the ball suddenly roll back towards him. 
He BARKS and goes to investigate. 
Another dog BARKS BACK. 
Surprised, Sparky backs off.   There's not usually a dog next door. 
He BARKS. 
An ANSWERING BARK. 
He SNIFFS the fence thoroughly. As he reaches the broken plank, his nose touches ANOTHER DOG'S NOSE. 
He jumps back. 
Lies low in the grass to peer through. 
On the other side of the fence is a similarly-sized poodle named PERSEPHONE -- Elsa's dog. She's beautiful. 
She drops the ball on the grass, staring back. 
Sparky suddenly rolls over on his back, completely submissive. 
Persephone grabs the ball and runs away. 
Sparky pops up, looking after her. 
INT.   CLASS - DAY 
The bell RINGS.   Students head for the door. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI Students on your way out, take a permission slip for the Science Fair. 
VICTOR You can keep it. 
The class bell RINGS.     Side-stepping around her, Victor heads in to class. 
She holds the cat to her face. 
WEIRD GIRL One day you'll dream about me, won't you kitty? 
Mr. Whiskers offers nothing. 
EXT.   TOWN - DAY 
Victor hops off his bike and goes into the backyard where Sparky has been waiting for him to come home. 
VICTOR Hey boy. How you doing? 
Suddenly the backyard gate bursts open. 
E You'll be my partner, right, Victor? (MORE) 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   12 
E (CONT'D) Because you have to have a partner for the science fair and whoever's your partner is going to win. You know the most about science. So pick me as a partner. I have lots of ideas. We could make a death ray! 
Victor holds up a permission slip, which lists all the prohibited projects, including explosives, lasers, nuclear devices and death rays. 
VICTOR It says no death rays.    See? 
E Ah, man. I still want to do it. (and yet...) C'mon. Who else would be your partner? You don't have friends and neither do I. 
He has a point.   Victor gives in. 
VICTOR I'm sorry Edgar. I just don't need a partner. I like to work alone. 
INT.   DINING ROOM - DAY 
Dad is examining the permission slip. Mom is bringing food in from the kitchen -- they're having fondue. 
VICTOR Will you sign my permission slip? 
MOM Dinner's ready. 
DAD Victor, have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living? 
VICTOR You're a travel agent. 
DAD I sell dreams. I tell people, you can sail to Italy. You can do the hula in Hawaii. 
VICTOR Will you sign my form? 
DAD I'm getting to that. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   13 
VICTOR Okay. 
Dad picks up two long fondue forks, using them to illustrate his point. 
DAD In my job, sometimes you have people who don't want quite the same thing, right. Say the husband wants to play golf in Scotland, but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon. Alright you've got two conflicting ideas here. (holding forks apart) And it's my job, Victor, to help them meet halfway. Say, Scottsdale, Arizona. He gets to golf, she gets Indians. 
MOM But there's no river. And no jungle. 
VICTOR Nobody gets what they want. 
DAD Exactly. And wrong. They both get what they want because they compromise. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI When conducting an experiment, trying is the important thing. It is OK to fail as long as you keep trying. 
EXT.   BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 
Back on the field at the bleachers Weird Girl arrives with Mr Whiskers. She sits by Elsa and Peresphone. They exchange a glance. 
MOM Come on Victor- you can do it! 
Toshiaki pitches again and again Victor misses. 
GYM TEACHER Strike two! 
TOSHIAKI Yes. 
MOM Come on honey! 
Elsa, Weird Girl and Mr Whiskers will Victor on. 
This time when Victor swings - 
He hits! 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2      16 
He almost forgets to run until Sparky BARKS at him. 
DAD (CONT'D) Victor run! 
Sparky pulls on his lead and it works loose. 
The ball rolls out of the park. 
Sparky goes after it, his stubby legs bounding. 
MOM Oh Sparky! 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
The ball rolls into the street and Sparky manages to grab it in his mouth. 
Proud of himself, Sparky turns to look back at Victor. Just then... 
A CAR 
SCREECHES up at him.      Sparky reacts.    We CUT AWAY as the car hits. 
EXT.    BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 
Every player, every kid, every parent is stunned. Horrified. We end CLOSE ON Victor. 
VICTOR Sparky! Noooooo! 
EXT.    PET CEMETERY - EVENING 
Dad buries a wooden box. Victor watches at the grave side, devastated. His Mom and Dad give him a quiet moment to grieve. 
EXT.    BACKYARD - EVENING 
Persephone nudges the tennis ball through the gap in the fence. She's waiting for Sparky. 
Disappointed, she leaves the ball and slowly walks away. 
INT. BEDROOM - EVENING 
Victor lies in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Mom and Dad sit on the edge of the bed, trying to comfort him. 
INT. VICTOR'S HOUSE - DAY 
Victor raids the kitchen for some household appliances. Mom sits on the couch reading and only barely registers what he is up to. 
MOM Hi Victor, how was school? 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   19 
VICTOR Ok. 
Victor heads upstairs with a box of the appliances he has just collected. 
EXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT 
A full moon.    HOOTING owls. 
Over the top of the fence, we see a shovel blade moving past. 
The shovel digs into the soft earth.   Again.   And again. 
Victor is digging up Sparky's grave. It's tough work, especially because he's trying to be quiet. 
A black cat perches on a nearby gravestone.     SCREECHES. 
Spooked, Victor waves him off. 
He's uncovered the box. He opens it and gingerly loads the wrapped bundle into shoulder. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Victor's parents are sitting on the couch watching a movie. Though the movie isn't really scary, Mom looks for any excuse to snuggle closer to her husband. He playfully encourages it and puts his arm around her to pull her closer. 
As Victor sneaks behind them, carrying the wrapped corpse, he inadvertently knocks into a lamp causing it to flicker. 
Dad turns and sees what's back there but can't see Victor who is hiding, frozen, just out of sight. 
Dad turns back to the TV. 
Relieved, Victor tiptoes past them, heading for the stairs. 
INT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT 
EXTREMELY CLOSE ON the eye of a needle.   Thread pushes through. 
Victor is making repairs to Sparky's corpse. We don't see any of it directly, just shadows on the wall. 
He rummages through a bucket of nuts and screws, picking two oversized bolts. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     20 
He places Sparky onto Mom's ironing board and pushes it directly under the skylight. The storm is just reaching a fever pitch. 
As HOPEFUL MUSIC rises, Victor climbs a ladder out the window where we see that he has attached his metal swing set to the roof. Victor checks the wind direction and lets fly two balloons attached to the umbrella and fastens the ends to the swing set. This will serve as the conductor. 
EXT. BURGEMEISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Burgemeister is drawing his drapes shut when he sees the movement on the Frankenstein roof. He can't make out Victor, but it's enough to make him suspicious. 
INT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT 
Victor climbs down and checks his notes and his equipment. 
We see a whole host of household items that Victor has re- purposed to become part of his elaborate apparatus. 
- A series of Mom's colanders and pans and appliances, 
MOM (O.S.) Victor! 
INT.   BEDROOM - DAY 
Victor's Mom opens the door to find Victor's bed empty. Pretty sure where he must be... 
MOM Victor!     Breakfast! 
INT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY 
Sparky licks Victor's face waking him up. He sits up, rubbing his eyes. 
INT. ATTIC STAIRS- DAY 
Mom is walking up the stairs to the attic looking for Victor. 
MOM Victor?     Are you up here? 
INT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY 
Victor hears his Mom climbing the steps and panics. 
VICTOR Ssssh! Quiet down boy! Ssssh! 
MOM (O.S.) Victor? 
Victor picks up Sparky and carries him around a curtain to the back of the attic. 
VICTOR Sparky! Sssh! Quiet. 
Mom enters but can't see Victor and Sparky behind the curtain. 
MOM (O.S.) Victor? 
Looking around for somewhere to hide Sparky, Victor finally grabs a big tin bucket and puts it over Sparky just as - 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   23 
Mom pulls the curtain back. 
MOM French toast or waffles? 
VICTOR Waffles. 
MOM Then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director. 
Spotting her waffle iron amid the leftover set decoration, she heads right for Sparky. The bucket suddenly moves, shifting away. 
She looks at Victor.   Thinking quick: 
VICTOR It's my science project.   It's a robot. 
MOM A robotic bucket? 
VICTOR Yes. 
MOM For mopping, I suppose. 
VICTOR Yes. 
MOM Then maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it. 
She takes her waffle iron and heads back downstairs. 
Victor closes the curtain, then lifts the bucket off Sparky. 
EXT BOB'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Mr Whiskers leaps onto a garbage can, and clambers up onto the roof to safety. 
Sparky unable to follow is distracted by a fly buzzing around the knocked over garbage can. He gulps it down and then suddenly stops. He feels a funny tickle in his throat, neck and tummy before the fly emerges from the stitches on his side. 
Sparky continues to chase the fly into Bob's yard where Bob's Mom is hanging out the laundry. 
As she turns, she sees Sparky's shadow cast on a bed sheet. The shadow is double his size and his teeth look huge. Bob's Mom thinks it's a hideous monster and runs screaming into the house. 
BOB'S MOTHER What! *screams* 
Sparky can't understand why she is so upset but he just heads out on his way. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    26 
EXT.   SUBURBAN STREET / SIDEWALK - DAY 
Two MOMS sit on a park bench talking, while their toddlers nap in their strollers. 
FIRST WOMAN I know, and Helen said she thought he was putting up some kind of tv antenna on top of the roof! 
SECOND WOMAN In the middle of a thunderstorm? 
FIRST WOMAN That's what she said! 
Neither mother notices as Sparky trots up. One of the babies starts to fall asleep and drops his pacifier on the floor. 
SECOND MOTHER And did you get that big power surge in the night? Jack thought it was a fuse box but apparently it effected the whole neighbourhood. 
The baby looks round and sees Sparky guilelessly sucking on the pacifier. 
SECOND MOTHER (O.S.) Sometimes I wonder just what goes on in that house. I just don't feel safe walking by there. 
Seeing Sparky up close, the baby is horrified.   It SCREAMS. 
FIRST WOMAN Sweetie are you ok? Here you go. 
Sparky hides under the bench out of sight as the first woman tries to calm her little one and pops the pacifier back in the babies mouth. 
SECOND MOTHER So anyway Jack loves it here but if the schools weren't so great sometimes I wonder if we would be better of... 
Both Mommies get up and start to walk away they don't notice Sparky cowering under the bench. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   27 
EXT.   NEAR THE SCHOOL - DAY 
Sparky trots past the front of the school as the school bell rings. Sparky heads for the garbage cans around the back. 
On his way home, E walks behind the cafeteria and sees Sparky sniffing around the garbage cans. He can't believe his eyes. 
E Sparky? 
Sparky stops short and looks right at E before running off home. 
E's eyes narrow.     Isn't Sparky supposed to be dead? 
We end on a shot of E, hatching a plan. 
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 
Sparky arrives home and heads straight to the backyard fence to see if Persephone is around. 
Seeing that she is, he peeks his head through the broken slates. Persephone is overjoyed but she seems to know that there's something different about him. 
E Hey! 
VICTOR Edgar. What are you doing here? 
E I know. 
VICTOR What? 
E I know. 
VICTOR Know what? 
E You know. 
VICTOR No. 
E I think I know what you know I know. 
VICTOR Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it. 
Mom exits the kitchen and Edgar leans in, barely able to hide his excitement. 
E Your dog is alive. 
Victor looks shocked and checks to see if Mom has gone. 
VICTOR That's impossible. 
E I know. I know it is so impossible but you did it. You did it. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   30 
Victor stalls, trying to think of an explanation. 
E So show me how, or I'll tell everyone. Oh Mrs Frankenstein... 
VICTOR Ssssh! 
Mom comes back into the kitchen. 
E .. May I have a cookie please? 
MOM Oh- yes. Of course. 
VICTOR Alright. Come on. 
Victor reluctantly agrees and beckons Edgar to follow him up to the attic. 
INT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY 
Sparky and E watch as Victor draws his findings on the chalkboard for E. It's a mess of symbols and variables, all connected by arrows. 
VICTOR I think the wind and the lightning are part of the same thing, some kind of strange force. But the wind isn't strong enough to bring an animal back from the dead. For that, you need lightning. 
E So when can I do it? 
VICTOR You can't. This isn't an experiment. It's my dog. 
E Show and tell Victor:   you show me and I won't tell. 
INT.   PET STORE - DAY 
E stares into a tank of swimming goldfish, the PET STORE OWNER appears next to him. 
PET STORE OWNER Can I help you young man? 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   BOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT 
Toshiaki and Bob stand in the door way of the garage examining E's jar with healthy skepticism. 
TOSHIAKI How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish? 
E Put your finger in.       You can feel it. 
Toshiaki and Bob trade a look -- this feels like a prank. But with a shrug, Bob does. 
Nothing.   He swirls his finger around. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   33 
And then... 
BOB Aaah! 
He yanks his finger out. 
BOB It bit me. 
TOSHIAKI Let me see it. 
Toshiaki takes the jar from E. He walks over to a table and places the jar down. He shines a table lamp through the jar. 
The invisible goldfish casts a shadow on the wall. In the shadow, you can see it actually has Jurassic-sized teeth. It's pretty scary. 
TOSHIAKI/BOB *GASP* 
Toshiaki turns off the lamp and takes a closer look at the jar. 
E takes the jar back.    Screws on the lid. 
E It's my science project and it's top secret. 
Toshiaki looks over to Bob and gives him a flick of the head. Bob takes the hint and starts to push E out of the garage. 
BOB Yeah, well, our science fair project is even cooler. 
E What is it? 
TOSHIAKI Double top secret. 
Toshiaki pulls the garage door shut in Edgar's face. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   TOSHIAKI'S GARAGE - NIGHT 
Toshiaki and Bob take a critical look at their science fair project: SEA MONKEYS - THE TRUTH REVEALED! 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    34 
BOB Sea monkeys. We gotta come up with something better. Bigger. 
TOSHIAKI I know. 
BOB The science fair is in two days! 
TOSHIAKI I know. 
BOB You're the smart one. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   36 
PUSHING IN ominously... 
NASSOR I don't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing. But that trophy will be mine! 
E *Gasp* 
A beat. 
EXT.   STREET - DAY 
E runs as fast as he can with his jar outstretched in front of him, catching up to Victor. It's just the two of them. 
E Victor! Something's wrong with my fish. 
VICTOR What is it? 
E It's not there anymore. 
VICTOR Maybe it just hopped out.   Did you have the lid on? 
E Yes! Ever since...since I left your house. I mean, it was there when I went to bed. 
Victor ponders the possibilities. 
E I'm thinking, maybe they don't last. They're only there for a little bit and then they're gone. 
Suddenly panicked, Victor runs back to his house. 
INT.   HOUSE - DAY 
Victor runs up the stairs. 
INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY 
Victor runs through the attic. He pulls the curtain back his eyes go right to where he left Sparky tied up. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   37 
The rope is still there.    But his dog is gone. 
VICTOR *Gasp* No!    Sparky! *Gasp* 
A BARK. 
Victor turns to find Sparky drinking out of his bowl. 
He scratches his ear and it falls off. 
VICTOR (O.S.) Sparky! 
Victor rushes over to him. Sparky's not sure what all the drama is about but does seem slightly concerned with his lost ear. 
VICTOR Oh! Don't worry. I can fix that too. 
INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Victor is in bed.    He reaches under the bed to pat Sparky's head... 
VICTOR Good night, boy. 
...then switches off the light. 
TRANSITION TO: 
BOB'S MOTHER What were you boys doing on the roof!? 
Bob and Toshiaki exchange a glance. 
BOB AND TOSHIAKI Science. 
INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT 
Mom and Dad arrive at the meeting as Mr Burgemeister starts to speak at the podium. 
BURGEMEISTER As mayor of New Holland, you have entrusted me with your safety. So I can't sit idly by while a teacher endangers our children. 
Bob's Mother is also on the stage with Bob whose arm is still in a sling. 
BOB'S MOTHER The man is a menace! 
A lot of agreement from the PARENTS in attendance. 
Another father stands up in the crowd. 
ANOTHER FATHER Have you looked through this "science" book they're using? Apparently, Pluto isn't good enough to be a planet anymore. (MORE) 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   40 
ANOTHER FATHER (CONT'D) When I was a kid, Pluto was a great planet. This guy comes along and rewrites the rules. 
MOM In fairness, he didn't write the textbook. 
DAD Mr Mayor, Edward Frankenstein, your neighbour of course. I would just like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher. Thinks he's great. 
ANOTHER MOTHER My Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions. About things I've never even heard of! 
DAD Shouldn't we at least give the man the chance to explain himself? 
BURGEMEISTER Yes. Please come up. Mr...Menace. 
He points to Mr. Rzykruski, who has been lingering at the back of the assembly room. 
He comes up front to the microphone. 
He clears his throat. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI Ladies, Gentlemen. I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant. 
A sea of stony faces. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI Is this right word, "ignorant?"    I mean simple. Primitive. Unenlightened. 
Not winning them over. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI You do not understand science, so you are afraid of it. Like a dog is afraid of thunder, or balloons. To you, science is magic and witchcraft because you have such small minds. (MORE) 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     41 
MR. RZYKRUSKI (CONT'D) I cannot make your heads bigger, but your children's heads -- I can take them and crack them open. This is what I try to do. To get at their brains. 
MOM Oh my! 
Mr. Rzykruski somehow convinced he did a good job... 
MR. RZYKRUSKI Thank you. 
Mr Rzykruski leaves the stage. 
DAD Oh, geeze. 
Elsa kneels down and pets Persephone lovingly. 
ELSA I feel so sad for him, Persephone. He really misses his dog. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    43 
She tenderly kisses Persephone on the head and holds her a little closer. 
EXT. SCHOOL 
Mr Rzykruski walks out of the school doors carrying a cardboard box full of all his school things. 
INT.   CLASSROOM - DAY 
The Gym Teacher, who is serving as substitute teacher scrubs the board clear of Mr Rzykruski's name. 
VICTOR Where's Mr. Rzykruski? 
GYM TEACHER All I know is, I'll be teaching the class for the rest of the semester. 
She begins erasing the messy blackboard. 
ELSA Do you know anything about science? 
GYM TEACHER I know more than you do. 
BOB Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot. 
GYM TEACHER Well, sometimes knowing too much is the problem. 
Victor looks out the window as Mr Rzykruski is packing up the trunk of his car. 
VICTOR What about the science fair? 
GYM TEACHER Oh, it's still on. But it will be judged by someone who is not insane -- Me! 
The class look skeptical. 
GYM TEACHER Now get cracking and may the best person win. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    44 
EXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY 
Mr. Rzykruski is packing his strange little car with all his things from the classroom. 
Victor races up to him in the car park. 
VICTOR I can't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge. She's not even interested in science. 
Mr. Rzykruski turns back to see his favorite student. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI Back home, everyone is scientist. Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize. Your country does not make enough scientists. Always needs more. You should be a scientist, Victor. 
VICTOR Nobody likes scientists. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no, not the questions that science asks. 
VICTOR Actually I have a question. 
MR. RZYKRUSKI That is why you are scientist. 
Victor smiles, a little. 
VICTOR I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great. But the next time it didn't. I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't. And I don't know why. 
TOSHIAKI Impossible. 
E I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog. 
He tries to swallow his words but the boys lean in closer. 
TOSHIAKI He brought back Sparky? 
E nods and the boys exchange a look. 
TOSHIAKI Hmmmm. 
NASSOR Victor will win the science fair. Unless we can do better. Bigger. 
Toshiaki turns his steely gaze towards Edgar and a sly smile spreads across his face. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   47 
TOSHIAKI You say you know Victor's secret. Now is your chance to prove it. 
INT.   KITCHEN - DAY 
Mom's recipe book is opened to a page that reads - 
- DOUBLE DUTCH CHERRY MUFFINS 
MOM Now, where is my muffin tin? 
She checks inside the oven but no muffin tin. 
MOM (realizing) Victor. 
INT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY 
VICTOR'S MOM goes up into the attic to find... 
Nothing out of the ordinary. 
She enters, taking a look around for her missing muffin tin. She walks over to Victor's chalk board and sees his diagrams for bringing Sparky back to life. 
MOM Sparky? 
Sparky walks around the curtain and stands panting next to Mom. 
She turns, startled and sees - Sparky. 
His NECK BOLTS. 
His STITCHES. 
Mom falls backwards and onto the floor and - 
SCREAMS. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Dad enters the house to hear Mom screaming in the attic. 
INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Dad runs in and see's Sparky desperately trying to get closer to Mom. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    48 
MOM Sparky? ... Sparky's alive! 
MOM Sparky! 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   50 
DAD Sparky! 
As they go in their respective directions we see Toshiaki, Edgar, Nassor and Weird Girl skulking in the bushes. 
Toshiaki nudges Edgar forward and motions to the front door which has been left ajar in their haste. 
INT.   ATTIC WORKSHOP - NIGHT 
We see the shadows of all five of them slowly climb the attic stairs. 
E pulls the curtain back to reveal Victor's sanctum sanctorum. The apparatus glistens in the moonlight. 
BOB Cool. 
Nassor and Weird Girl check out the equipment - pushing and pulling on the wires with clumsy curiosity. 
Edgar tries to confer with Toshiaki who turns his back dismissively. Its clear there are no more partnerships. Its every man for himself. 
Toshiaki examines the formulas and theorems on the blackboard. 
TOSHIAKI Interesting. 
E It has something to do with the lightning. I don't really understand it. 
TOSHIAKI Ah-but I do. 
PUSHING IN on his eyes... 
NASSOR Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life. 
EXT.   NEAR THE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 
Victor runs around the baseball field shining the flashlight under the bleachers and into the dug out. 
VICTOR Sparky!    Where are you? Sparky! 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   51 
EXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Sparky narrowly avoids some kids running towards the town center by backing into an open gate. 
As the revelers pass he looks around at where he is and sees that he is surrounded by ominous looking headstones. 
An eerie Cat 
A giant turtle 
A flock of bats fly out from behind a tombstone and force him up the hillside where he finds himself at the foot of his own grave. 
He can't read, but he seems to recognize what it is. What it means. 
He lays down, looking up at the moon. 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT 
Back in town we see Victor's parents searching under the stage as the crowd starts to assemble for Dutch day. 
MOM Sparky? Sparky? 
The crowd applauds as Mr. Burgemeister steps up to the microphone. 
Nassor enters the mausoleum and attaches two clips onto the grave of Collosus. He exits the mausoleum and sends four Mylar balloons off into the sky. 
EXT.   TOSHIAKI'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Toshiaki exits the gardening shed and walks over to his bundle. He attaches two clips and hooks these up to a kite by using a series of extension cords. 
INT.   WEIRD GIRL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
We pull back through a skylight to see Mr Whiskers delivering a dead bat to Weird Girl who sits on her bed combing her doll's hair. Weird Girl's room is impossibly girly with pink fluffy flowers all around. 
She untwists metal coat hangers and attaches them to each other, making a long lightning rod. 
She lays the bat on her bed and attaches two   clips to its wings. She then grabs a large butterfly wall   hanging from above her bed. She attaches the butterfly to   the coat hanger pole and solemnly feeds it out of the   window into the night sky. 
The balloons, butterfly and kite can be seen floating over New Holland in the storm.

While she stares out the window at the approaching storm, Mr Whiskers sniffs curiously at the bat and starts to take a bite. 
EXT.   TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT 
Elsa finishes her song: 
ELSA (singing) Praise be New Holland, May your windmill spin forever more. 
The crowd APPLAUDS. 
MR. BURGEMEISTER Isn't she adorable. 
Motioning with his hands, Burgemeister signals for bigger applause but a big clap of THUNDER gets everyone's attention - 
And then lightning strikes. 
INT.   WEIRD GIRL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The lightning hits the butterfly and flies down the coat hanger rod. It hits the bat which is still in Mr Whisker's mouth. The bed explodes. 
EXT.   BACKYARD POOL - NIGHT 
Lightning hits the propped-up pool skimmer, then CRACKLES across the surface of the pool. 
Bob leaps back blinded by the light. 
INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT 
The lightning strikes the school building, SURGING through the power line to the electrodes on the rat.         We see the flattened sections start to balloon out. 
EXT.   SKY ABOVE THE CEMETERY - NIGHT 
The Mylar balloons are FRIED by lightning. The balloons burst, sending the surge hurtling down towards the mausoleum. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    55 
EXT. TOSHIAKI'S YARD - NIGHT 
Lightning surges down from the heavens, striking the disinterred bundle. The turtle bundle explodes. Toshiaki ducks for cover into the garden shed. 
EXT.   WEIRD GIRL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Weird Girl looks up she sees Mr. Whiskers. His fur is smoking but he just seems a little dazed. 
WEIRD GIRL Mr Whiskers? 
He starts licking his paws when suddenly -- 
VICTOR Sparky? Sparky? 
Victor pushes open the gate. His flashlight casts long, scary shadows. 
He is drawn towards Sparky's grave and as his flashlight sweeps across the tombstone, he sees Sparky's frightened face peeking out from behind. 
Could it be... 
VICTOR Sparky? 
Sparky peers around the edge of the tombstone and realizes that it's Victor and hangs his head in shame. 
VICTOR Sparky! 
Sparky is nervous and confused but slowly rests his head in Victor's arms. 
VICTOR Sparky it's OK boy, it's just me. I thought that you were gone. I never want to lose you. Promise you'll never go running off. Okay? 
Victor hold him tightly and Sparky licks him happily. 
VICTOR Come on boy. 
Victor leads Sparky away through the cemetery when he sees the open grave of Shelley and the Colossus mausoleum door ajar. 
VICTOR Was someone else here? 
EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS 
Bob runs past the pet cemetery and hides behind a mail box to avoid the phalanx of sea monkeys who charge past like supernatural hooligans, craving mayhem and destructive mischief. 
Panting with relief, Bob turns to see Victor in the cemetery. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   58 
BOB Victor! I need your help. 
VICTOR Did you see those things? They were like.... 
BOB Sea Monkeys. You know how on the package, they're like in a happy kingdom and everyone's smiling? 
VICTOR Yeah. 
BOB They're not like that at all. 
Toshiaki runs up, yelling from the sidewalk. 
TOSHIAKI Victor!     I need your help! 
BOB I asked him first! 
TOSHIAKI My problem's bigger! 
Toshiaki points to the distance - a towering, giant Turtle is walking past. Its a suburban Gamera. Sparky barks defensively. 
Bob has to admit -- 
BOB Yeah.    He's right. 
A beat. Victor has to think fast. This is all his fault. 
He looks down at Sparky and gets an idea. 
VICTOR Ok let's go! 
Victor, Sparky and Bob rush off. Toshiaki starts to laugh and reveals his video recorder. He is secretly quite pleased with his science project. 
NASSOR Collosus? 
The angry turtle roars in Nassor's face knocking him clear across the square. 
Nassor flies with such velocity that he gets tangled up in the banners and bunting that festoon the street and he lands in an upright display of Russian nesting dolls. 
As he smashes into the case we see that now he too is wrapped up like a mummy. His scowling eyes are all that is visible as the lid closes like a sarcophagus and collapses to the ground.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE 
E flees the sea monkeys and runs straight into the Wererat who is still howling at the foot of the gym teacher's pole. 
E Ah! Get away from me! Get away from me! Ah! 
The Wererat immediately turns his attentions to E and chases him past a beer stall were the sea monkeys continue to cause havoc at a beer stall, spilling beer everywhere. 
One of the sea monkeys grabs a carton of pop corn and devours it in one bite. No sooner has he swallowed, when he begins to fizz and expand and suddenly explodes - splattering goop everywhere. 
Victor and Bob are watching from behind a stall and Victor gets an idea. 
VICTOR Your sea monkeys, were they freshwater or saltwater? 
Bob knows this -- 
BOB Freshwater! 
VICTOR Freshwater animals can't tolerate salt. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - POPCORN TENT - NIGHT 
Victor empties a sack of pop corn kernels into a pop corn machine in the pop corn tent. Bob adds the salt. Victor turns the machine on. 
The boys try and lure the sea monkeys into the tent by waving popcorn. 
VICTOR Hey over here! 
The sea monkeys follow them and start to gorge themselves on the freshly made popcorn. 
Victor, Bob and Sparky zip up the tent and stand by the beer stall to see what happens. 
January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   62 
The sea monkeys greedily consume the popcorn with feverish abandon and the boys watch in amazement as the tent stretches and grows. The canvas sides stretch and strain from the pressure. 
Victor and Sparky duck behind a nearby keg just as tent suddenly explodes splashing pop corn (and sea monkey parts) all over the street. 
BOB Cool! 
Bob haughtily celebrates a little too quickly and gets completely drenched in pop corn goop 
E (O.S.) *screams* 
Victor and Sparky look over to see that ... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOWN / VARIOUS 
Elsa, Persephone and E are being attacked by the Wererat. 
ELSA Help!

WARNER 
The reason I wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future. Elle is on the edge of her seat. 
ELLE 
I ' m fully amenable to that discussion. 
WARNER 
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I ' m at Harvard Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious. 
ELLE 
Of course. 
WARNER 
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I .plan on running for office some day. 
ELLE 
And I fully support that. 
(CONTINUED) 
WA R N ER 
But the thing is, if I ' m gonna be a senator by the time I ' m thirty -- I can't keep dicking around. 
ELLE 
I completely agree. 
WARNER 
T hat 's why I think it's time for us to-- Elle takes a deep breath, filled with anticipation. 
WARNER (CONT'D) 
( ot n ig . . · > . ' . c n iu n ) I think we should break up. Elle's champagne glass drops from her hand and CRASHES onto the patio. 
ELLE 
What? Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard. 
WARNER 
I ' m sorry, Elle, I just -- 
ELLE 
You're breaking up with me?! (tearing up) I thought you were proposing. 
WARNER 
Proposing?! Elle, If I ' m going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn. 
ELLE 
(stunned) You're breaking up with me because I ' m too -- blonde? 
WARNER 
T hat' s not entirely -- 
ELLE 
Then what? My boobs are too big? 
WARNER. 
Elle -- no --· your boobs are fine -- Her tears start. 
(CON TINUED ) 
i 
CONTINU ED: 
ELLE 
So when you said you'd always love me, you were just "dicking around"? Warner looks around the restaurant nervously. 
WARNER 
I do love you, Elle. I just can't marry you. You have no idea the pressure I ' m under. My family has five generations of senators. My brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He                · just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes. Elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face, then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out. 
WARNER (CONT'D) 
(continuing) It's not like I have a choice, sweetheart 
He follows her out. 
8   EXT.' STREET - NIGHT                                                 8 
Elle teeters down the sidewalk as best she can in her three inch heels, sobbing. Warner pulls up alongside her in his convertible Saab. 
WARNER 
C'mon.   Let me take you home. 
ELLE 
No. 
WARNER 
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus. Elle stops, thinks a minute, then gets in, still crying. Catching her poofy little purse in the door. She re-opens i t, yanking the purse back in. Warner pulls out. 
9   EXT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - USC - NIGHT                                 9 
Warner pulls up in front. It's a starry, romantic night. Everything should be perfect. It's not. Elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke out. 
WARNER 
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
How can it be the right thing if we're not together? 
WARNER . 
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me. 
ELLE 
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me? (through her tears) Everybody likes me! 
We still love you.      Sisters forever! 
ELLE 
(sniffling) Thank you. I love you, too. As they go, Margot looks at Serena. 
MARGOT 
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I ' m serious enough?    . 
SERENA 
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you. 
(TV VERSION) 
Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.                                             · 
MARGOT 
You're right. Phew! As the girls go, they shut the door behind them. Elle gets up and grabs a FRAMED PHOTO of Warner, then lies down on her bed, clutching it to her heart. Underdog leaps up and gives her little doggy kisses. 
12     EXT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY                                         12 
The sun rises on a sad day.     "HOPELESSLY DEVOTED" by Olivia            · Newton-John plays.                                           .

Amy knocks on Elle's door. 
AMY 
Elle? ANOTHER SISTER passes. 
ANOTHER SISTER · 
(whispering) Didn't you hear? She leads a reluctant Amy down the hall. 
14     INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY                                   14 
Spread out on the bed are PICTURES of Elle and Warner: The Sigma Chi formal; their Homecoming Queen and King "wave"; 
(CONTINUED) 
a 60's party; Mardi Gras night; beach weekend at Coronado. Next to the pictures are thirty dried Ecuardorian long- stemmed pink roses, remnants of their one year anniversary. In the center sits Elle, wearing Warner's old oversized Sigma Chi t-shirt, clutching a Gund teddybear. Depressed and looking like hell, she speaks to an unseen confidante. 
ELLE 
I just love him so much! I loved him the first moment I saw him. He's beautiful and smart and someone I totally respect. And I did everything I could to make him love me, but it wasn't enough. Now what am I supposed to do? I planned my whole future around him. My life was going to be all about Warner. Now what's it going to be about? She looks up -- waiting. Staring back at her is Underdog -- who sadly has no answers for her. 
15   INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY                                   15 
Elle remains in bed, Underdog now clutched to her chest, soaps on the TV. 
TV SOAP STUD 
(on TV) "Oh, darling.     I'll love you forever." 
ELLE 
(teary) Bullshit! Serena and Margot enter, bearing Jamba Juice. 
MARGOT 
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week. 
ELLE 
So? 
S erena sits down on the edge of the bed, trying to psyche Elle up. 
SERENA 
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?                                   . 
MARGOT 
Cunnilingus? 
(CONTINUED) 
Elle lets out a wail, realizing what she'll be missing. Serena shoots Margot a stern look. 
SERENA 
No -- the thing after that, 
16   INT. UPSCALE MANICURE SHOP - DAY                                   16 
A row of uniformed manicurists and their classy clients. Chattering away. Therapy in full session. Serena sits in front of her regular nail technician. 
SERENA 
It was awful. We all thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle and now she's totally adrift. 
The nail technician shakes her head in shared girl-power- angst -- looking over at Elle, who sits in the waiting area, shell-shocked, but showered. 
Elle picks up the only magazine left on the table -- "Town & Country". She wrinkles her nose. An OLD LADY next to her reads "Seventeen". Elle looks at her, begrudging the access to teen beauty tips, and flips through "Town & Country" n oisily until she freezes on-- the Engagement Section. She gasps. 
ELLE 
Oh, my God!                    . She looks at a PHOTO of a horse-faced YOUNG WOMAN standing next to a THREE-YEARS-OLDER VERSION OF WARNER. She turns to the old lady next to her. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Do you know who this is? 
The old lady looks. 
OLD LADY 
No. 
ELLE 
It's Warner's older brother! 
OLD LADY 
Who? 
Elle continues, undaunted. 
(CONTINUED) 
EL LE 
He just got engaged to this -- this very unfortunate-looking girl. (reading) "Third year Yale Law student Putnam Bowes Huntington III and his fiance Layne Walker Vanderbilt, first year Yale Law." She turns to the old lady. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final. 
MARGOT 
(duh) Yeah, luckily.

ELLE (CONT'D)

ELLE 
(to the camera) I ' m able to recall hundreds of important details at the drop of a hat. We reveal Margot on a raft beside her. 
MARGOT 
(badly acting) Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday? 
ELLE 
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been              . brainwashed by the evil Stefano --

Elle takes a practice LSAT exam as Serena, Margot and a few other Delta Gammas do their butt-crunches in the Delta Gamma living room. Serena, while clenching her tush, hits a stop watch and Elle starts writing furiously. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Margot is now on all-fours, doing donkey kicks as she grades Elle's practice exam. She writes "143" on top and holds it up to Elle. Elle slumps with frustration.

Elle gazes out the.window to see ---Warner and some BARE- CHESTED FRATERNITY BOYS carrying a keg across the quad. Her eyes light up and she looks at Amy pleadingly. Amy shakes her head no. Elle slumps, then rises and goes to the window, closing the shades and getting back to work.

ELLE 
I feel confident using legal jargon in daily life.

ON.VIDEO, Elle jogs while she addresses the camera. 
Pale, studious LAW STUDENTS clad in earth tones, move into their dorm, carrying in their spartan belongings (coffee makers, books, computers). In the distance, a HAPPY POP SONG (perhaps "Heaven Tonight by Hole) is heard. As it gets louder, heads turn to see -- A silver, convertible Boxster driving up, Elle at the wheel,/ MUSIC BLASTING. A large MOVING VAN follows the Boxster. Peop le lean out of their windows, buzzing with interest as-- Elle's car stops in front of the dorm. She hops out, scooping up Underdog and looking every inch the LA-Fred-Segal- glamour-queen, as she looks around with a smile. Elle looks at Underdog. 
ELLE 
We're here! She bends down to pour some Evian into his inflatable doggy dish, inadvertently revealing cleavage to a passing BESPECTACLED BOY (several yards away). He trips, dropping his I-MAC. It shatters into a million pieces. Not noticing/ Elle stands and turns to two MOVING GUYS/ who are hauling a pink, faux-fur love seat and a potted palm tree out of the truck.

Class schedule, map, book list. 
ELLE 
H a s Warner Huntington checked in yet? 
F U Z Z Y 2L

ELLE 
W a i t -- my social events schedule is             . mis sin g.

Elle sits at the outdoor table, ignoring her slice of pizza, as she looks around for Warner. Not finding him, she turns her attention to the Group Leader, a BURNED OUT 2L in a red t- shirt. 
BURNED OUT 2L 
Okay. Welcome to law school. This is the part where we go around in a circle and everyone says a little bit about themselves. Let's start with you. He gestures at a guy with glasses, DORKY DAVID. 
DORKY DAVID 
I have a Masters in Russian Literature, a Ph.D in Biochemistry, and for the last eighteen months, I've been de- worming orphans in Somalia. 
BURNED OUT 2L 
Awesome.   How about you, Enid? 
ENID, a militant feminista, looks up. 
ENID 
P h.D from Berkeley in Women's Studies-- emphasis in the History of Combat. And last year, I led the march for Lesbians Against Drunk Driving. 
BURNED OUT 2L 
Killer. 
(CONTINUED) 
He looks at an intense guy in his late twenties, IVAN. 
INTENSE IVAN 
I've got an MBA from Wharton, worked on Wall Street for four years, mushed in three ididarods and I ' ve figured out how to crash the stock market in Sri Lanka if any of you want to get together later. 
BURNED OUT 2L 
Sweet.    What about you? He looks at Elle.   She sits up straight. 
ELLE 
I ' m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree from USC, where I was Sigma Chi Sweetheart and president of Delta Gamma, and last year '· -- I was Homecoming Queen . 
She smiles, as the group leader nods, waiting. 
ELL E (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Oh! (dramatically) Two weeks ago, I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal -- and talked her out of buying a truly heinous angora sweater! Whoever said that orange is the new pink is seriously disturbed. 
She looks around, pleased. Enid' snickers as the rest of the group stares at Elle, dumbfounded. 
38   INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - DAY                                        38 
A grey, dingy, cell-block style room -- now crammed with Elle's clothes, the pink fluffy love seat and potted palm, along with an Elliptical Cross-Trainer, pink flamingo party lights and a neon pink margarita glass sculpture. 
Elle tries to shove a large law textbook into her tiny Prada backpack to no avail. She gives up and tosses the book onto the bed where Underdog leaps away to miss being squished. 
ELLE 
Wish me luck, Underdog. It's my first class as a serious law student. 
She kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate skimpy Gucci outfit, which she accents by putting on trendy, wire-rimmed glasses. 
(CONTINUED) 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) -- his life? 
DORKY DAVID 
(scared) I don't know. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking.. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt. 
As she turns away -- 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) And you were right. It was Aristotle. 
The class half-laughs in relief. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) I assume you've all read pages 1- 48 and are now well-versed in subject matter jurisdiction. Elle looks around, surprised, as students open their books. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Who can tell us about Gordon v. Steele? 
Silence.   Stromwell looks down at the seating chart. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Ivan Greenstein? 
Intense Ivan straightens in his' seat. 
IVAN 
Gordon sued her doctors for malpractice. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
And what did the dispute entail? (looking at her chart) Let's call on someone in the hot zone. Elle Woods? Elle looks up, distressed. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
Uh... I wasn't aware that we had an assignment. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
(looking at her chart) Sarah Knottingham? 
SARAH KNOTTINGHAM -- a prim and preppy blue-blood brunette, dressed in pearls and a sweater set -- looks up. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Do you think it's acceptable that Ms. Woods is unprepared? Sarah looks over at Elle. Elle gives her a mortified smile. Sarah turns back to Professor Stromwell. 
SARAH 
No, I don't. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
Would you support my decision to ask her to leave and return to class only when she is prepared? 
SARAH 
Absolutely. Elle can't believe that this girl would betray her. Having no choice,, she gathers her purse and goes, completely humiliated. Professor Stromwell returns to the matter at hand. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
Now, Ms. Knottingham, did diversity jurisdiction'exist in this case?

EMMETT -- a shy and quirkily handsome 28-year-old who could pass for younger -- sits on a bench, going over some papers. He looks up and spots Elle -- sitting across from him -- looking traumatized. 
EMMETT 
Are you okay? Elle looks up, snapping out of her stupor. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time? 
EMMETT 
The professors? Yeah, they tend- to do that. Socratic method. 
ELLE 
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out? He smiles. 
EMMETT 
You have Stromwell. 
ELLE 
(hopeful) Did she do that to you, too? 
EMMETT 
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers . 
ELLE 
(stricken) Neat .             ·    '   ,   ' 
EMMETT 
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have? Elle looks at her schedule. 
ELLE 
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson. 
EMMETT 
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability. Elle makes a face.      He smiles.   Liking her.

EMMETT (CONT'D)

A downscale, blue-collar salon, with five hair chairs and two manicure stations. Old ladies and young waitresses get perms. PAULETTE --early 40s, lower-middle class, hard-edged, plus- sirzed -- looks up as a defeated Elle sinks into the manicure chair.(The manicure station is plastered with pictures of RUFUS, a big, slobbering pit-bull). ·

Bad day? 
Elle holds out her hands. Paulette dips them into a dish of soapy water. 
ELLE 
You can't even imagine.

PAULETTE

Elle lets it all out in a rush. 
ELLE 
I worked really hard to get into law school -- I blew off Spring Break and Greek Week to study for the LSATs, I completely neglected my Homecoming Queen duties, I hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video -- all so I could get my boyfriend Warner back and now he's engaged to this awful girl Sarah so it was all for nothing! I wish I ' d never even come to Harvard. 
Paulette dries Elle's hands and begins filing. 
PAULETTE 
After you went to all that trouble? 
ELLE                                           : 
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six-carat on her bony, unpolished finger. 
PAULETTE 
You're asking the wrong girl. I ' m with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out." 
ELLE 
(horrified) What'd you do? 
PAULETTE 
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap. She looks at a picture of the pit-bull.

ELLE 
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club. 
PAULETTE 
Is she as pretty as you? Elle looks down.

Hello, ladies. Paulette looks up to see the UPS GUY, a strapping hunk of a man in his late 30' s . She blushes and smooths down her hair, knocking over a bottle of nail polish in the process. Trying to play it off as she signs for the package.

(hating herself)                               . Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? (beat) So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"? 
ELLE 
Definitely! I love him! Paulette looks at her. 
PAULETTE 
If a girl like you can't hold on to her man -- then there sure as hell isn't any hope for the rest of us. What're you waiting for? Steal the bastard back. 
45   INT. DORMITORY - WARNER'S ROOM - DAY                          45 
Elle knocks on Warner's door, bottle of wine and two glasses in hand. 
ELLE 
Warner? When she gets no answer, she write a message on his memo board -- CLOSE ON-- "Call me! Love, You Know Who". She leaves the wine bottle and two glasses and goes. 
46   EXT. HARVARD LAW CAMPUS - DAY                                 46 
Elle is in her push-up bikini, reclining in her beach chair, pink frozen margarita in one hand, Underdog in the other, law book in her lap, pretending to study. We PULL BACK to reveal that she's sitting on the sidelines of a touch-football game that Warner is playing with a group of other 1-L's. Warner scores easily because the other male eyes are all on Elle. He shakes his head and smiles. 
47   INT. CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - DAY                                   47 
Elle sits, glaring at Sarah, who keeps waving her "The Rock" in Elle's direction, as she plays footsie with Warner. 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN -- 40s, a big fan of himself, salt and pepper hair, no time for bullshit -- stands before the class. 
Before you voted against me and called me a dyke behind my back? 
ELLE 
I don't use that word. Only mean people use that word. You must've heard it from Sarah.                     . She looks back at Warner's table and walks off. As she does., she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of NERDS led by DORKY DAVID, who knock the muffins out of her hands. She stands there, even more depressed. 
51   INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - DAY - LATER                              51 
Elle sinks down onto her bed, deflated.    She picks up the phone and dials. 
52   INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY                                           52 
Serena, with a new hairdo, and Margot are surrounded by wedding dresses. Margot talks on her cell phone. We 
INTERCUT. 
MARGOT 
(to Serena) It's Elle! (into phone) Guess what I ' m doing right this second? 
ELLE 
Power yoga? 
(CONTINUED) 
MARGOT 
Picking out my wedding dress! 
ELLE 
· What?! 
MARGOT 
Josh proposed! 
ELLE 
(startled) N o way -- Serena grabs the phone. 
SERENA 
(into phone) ;;po you have The Rock yet? Elle lies. 
ELLE 
Almost. 
SERENA 
Well, hurry up so you can come home!   We miss you! 
ELLE 
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks! 
SERENA 
Oh, my God!   I completely forgot to tell you! 
ELLE 
What? 
SERENA 
I got bangs! 
ELLE 
(hurt and annoyed) Re a ll y -- Margot grabs the phone back. 
(CONTINUED) 
MARGOT                              : 
(into phone) Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love. 
ELLE 
Iwl. il.   .    . Margot hangs up and Elle follows suit.      Even more deflated. 
53   INT. ELLE'S DORM - HALLWAY - DAY - SAME TIME                        53 
Sarah and Claire walk past Elle's room, the door of which is ajar. 
SARAH 
It's not just any Halloween party. It's a "Come as Your Favorite Defendant" party. 
CLAIRE 
That-'s genius. Elle pops her head out of the room. 
ELLE 
(excited) No way! Someone at this school is actually having a party? Sarah and Claire turn around.      Elle's face falls when she sees that it's them. 
SARAH 
No. 
CLAIRE 
You must've heard us wrong. 
SARAH 
Sorry. Looks like you'll be staying home ton ig ht. Alone. They continue on as Elle goes back into her room, snubbed. 
54   INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  54 
Elle shuts the door behind her and looks at Underdog. 
ELLE 
I can't believe this. Not only do I not have Warner, but I ' m --unpopular! The realization hits her hard. Underdog barks.       She looks at him. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) But I wasn't invited. 
He barks again. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) You really think I should? 
DORKY DAVID 
Two and a half? 
He throws in his twenty as well. 
SARAH 
If she spreads her legs, maybe -- 
ARROGANT AARON 
(adjusting his crotch) Only if I ' m feeling generous. 
ELLE (O.S.) 
What is this? 
They turn around to find Elle standing there. 
CLAIRE 
We're betting on how much longer you're going to last. 
ELLE 
(stung) What? 
SARAH 
Look around, Elle.      Do you actually think you belong here? 
They all stare at her. 
ELLE 
(hurt) Why wouldn't I? 
ENID 
Because the rest of us provide some worthwhile value to society? 
ARROGANT AARON 
Hold on, now -- every society needs a bimbo. Who are we supposed to sleep with after we get rich? 
(CONTINUED) 
Elle looks like she's been slapped. The others laugh at Aaron's esteemed wit. 
ELLE 
You know what? All of you can just kiss my ass. She yanks off her Bunny tail and throws it at them. Hurt and anger in her eyes. Then walks out of the room. 
'                          ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing; to herself) You're about to see just how valuable Elle Woods can be. She stomps out of the house. 
A GIRL-POWER SONG STARTS TO PLAY AS A MONTAGE BEGINS: 
60   INT. HARVARD BOOKSTORE - NIGHT                                    60 
A hot pink laptop is yanked off the shelf. 
CUT TO: 
Elle, still in her Bunny suit, minus the tail, stands in line, paying for the laptop. People gape at her, but she's oblivious in her resolve. 
EMMETT walks up behind her in line.   He clears his throat, trying not to look at her costume. 
Elle turns, seeing him. 
ELLE 
Don't ask. 
EMMETT 
Wasn't gonna.                                -

61   INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT                                     61 
A pony-tailed Elle types a brief, coffee next to her. Underdog sleeps nearby, belly-up. Legs twitching in a nightmare. Typing furiously, Elle breaks a nail, then struggles to forge on, despite her instinct to stop and repair it. 
62   INT. LAW LIBRARY - DAY                                           62 
Elle -- arms full of books -- walks past the Warner/Sarah study group. Sarah and Claire scowl at her, but Elle passes with her head held high. 
63   INT. STUDY LOUNGE - DAY                                          63 
Enid is surrounded by study materials and notecards. When she gets up to use the ladies' room, Elle casually walks over and slips a notecard into the middle of Enid's stack. Then quickly walks on. ' 
64   INT. BEAUTY OASIS - DAY                                          64 
Pau lett e quizzes Elle from a law textbook as her nails dry. As she waits for Elle's answer, Paulette showers Underdog with kisses, showing him pictures of Rufus. 
65   INT.   CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - DAY                        ..        65 
Donovan is in the midst of a lecture.     He points at Elle. 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
And the purpose of "diminished capacity" is? She swallows nervously, then speaks. 
ELLE 
To negate mens rea? Donovan nods affirmatively and continues.      Elle hides a smile. 
66   INT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         66 
Elle reaches for a book on a high shelf, but she's not tall enough. She tries a running start and leaps for it. Still missing it. FROM THE LEFT, she runs and leaps again, missing again. FROM THE RIGHT, she runs and leaps again, missing again. Dorky David walks up and sets down a step-stool at her: feet. Now winded, she smiles her thanks, stepping up to retrieve her book. 
67   INT. STUDY LOUNGE - DAY                                        67 
Enid flips through her notecards, memorizing, when she comes upon a picture of a NAKED MAN. Oh, the horror. She throws it down in disgust as if her eyes have been burned. Looking around, Enid sees Elle smiling and waving at her from across the room. 
68   INT. LAW LIBRARY - DAY                                         68 
Elle walks past Arrogant Aaron, as he sleeps at his study cubicle, head back on the chair. She stops, backs up, and waves her hand over his face. When he doesn't stir, she takes a magic marker out of her knapsack and leans over to write something on his forehead. 
INT. ELLE1S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Elle works out on her Elliptical Crosstrainer as she listens to a lecture tape and watches Court TV on mute.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
It's pink. 
ELLE 
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? . (smiling) See you tomorrow! 
(CONTINUED) 
She walks on.     Emmett walks up, handing the file to Donovan. 
EMMETT 
I brought you the Windham notes. 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
(watching Elle go) You think she just woke up one morning and said, "I think I'll go to law school today!"? Ei timett looks after Elle,    bemused. 
EMMETT 
Aside from that lapse in judgement -- she's got potential. 
75   INT. ELLE'S CAR-DAY                                               75 
Elle drives. Paulette is shotgun.                                      · 
PAULETTE 
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah. 
ELLE 
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard- ass. Elle stops the car and turns off the ignition. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
You ready? 
PAULETTE                         · 
No.                                                          '

The door opens. DEWEY(40s) and his beer gut emerge. Paulette is on the porch. Trying to exude confidence, but failing.

9/172000 Revision (Blue)                                58.

That's not what -- 
DEWEY 
How many times you gonna show up here, beggin1 me to take you back?        ' 
Paulette reddens -- flustered and humiliated.    Elle appears next to her. 
ELLE 
Dewey Newcomb? 
DEWEY 
Who's askin' 
ELLE 
. I ' m Elle Woods. Ms. Bonaf ante's                  ·        . attorney. 
Paulette looks at Elle in surprise, Elle keeps going. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
Under state law, you and Ms. Bonaf ante had a common law marriage which entitles her to the benefits of property law and an equitable division of assets. 
(CONTINUED) 
Paulette watches Elle, mouth hanging open. 
DEWEY 
(confused) Come again? 
ELLE 
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately. 
DEWEY                       : 
Huh? 
ELLE 
Tell him, Paulette. A still-stunned Paulette looks at Elle, then turns to Dewey, fire in her ass.                 '. 
PAULETTE                                         · 
Elle scans the racks of conservative clothes. She holds up a cashmere twinset and wrinkles her nose, but throws it over her arm anyway. 
83   INT. NORDSTROM'S - HANDBAGS - DAY - LATER                          83

84   INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - LOBBY - DAY                  84 
The elevator door opens and Warner and Elle emerge. Elle is sporting her new, boring "lawyer" clothes. Warner is baffled and impressed by her transformation. 
WARNER 
You look -- nice. 
ELLE 
Thank you. 
She gives him an aloof smile and walks off. Warner watches her go. Sarah stands in the lobby. None too happy to witness this. 
85   INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER     85 
Donovan strides through the office, his four interns behind him. He points as he walks. 
DONOVAN 
There's your office, there's the bathroom, there's the coffee machine. There's Gerard, Dick and1Bobby. 
GERARD, smarmy and trim, DICK, short and bald, and BOBBY, black and bespectacled, wave as the interns pass by. 
DONOVAN (CONT'D) 
(continuing) They're the other associates on the case. Ask them all your stupid questions, save the smart ones for me. 
86   INT. AUSTEN, JARET, PLATT AND DONOVAN - CONFERENCE ROOM     86 
Professor Donovan opens his briefcase as Elle, Sarah, Enid and Warner hang on his every word. 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
We're defending Brooke Windham, whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion. 
SARAH 
Gold digger? 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
You'd think so, since the stiff was sixty, but she was rich on her own. Some kind of fitness empire. You can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials. Elle frowns. 
ELLE 
Wait a minute -- are we talking about Brooke Daniels? Donovan checks his papers. 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
M a i d e n name--Daniels. (looking up) You know her? 
ELLE 
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated ,five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing! The others looks at each other and roll their eyes. 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
Amazing how? 
ELLE 
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted! 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body. 
(CONTINUED) 
WA RN ER 
B y who? 
SA RAH 
(correcting him) Whom? 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy. 
ELLE 
Maybe she found him like that. 
P RO F ES S OR DONOVAN 
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it. 
Emmett walks in and sits. 
EMMETT 
Sorry I ' m late. Elle looks at him, confused. 
P R O FE S SO R DONOVAN 
This is Emmett Kerrigan, another associate. Top three in his class and former editor of H a r v a r d Law Review. You've probably seen h i m lurking around campus doing my research. 
EM ME TT 
Or napping on the quad.          . Elle smiles at him.    He smiles back.   Almost shy. 
WARNER 
(to Donovan) What about the murder weapon? 
P R O FE S SO R DONOVAN 
The gun is missing. The coroner said he'd been dead thirty minutes dead when the cops arrived -- giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it. 
ELLE 
There's no    way Brooke could've done this - - exercise    gives you endorphins, endorphins    make you happy -- happy people don't kill    their husbands! Sarah and Enid snort. 
( CON TINU ED) 
PROFESSOR DONOVAN 
You don't really believe she's innocent? 
ELLE 
Of course, I do! 
The UPS GUY stands in the doorway with a package, sun streaming in around him. 
UPS GUY 
Afternoon, ladies.

PAULETTE 
It's him! Paulette smooths down her hair. 
ELLE       ' 
It's who? She turns to look as we go to -- 
BUTT-CAM -- CLOSE ON the crisp brown shorts of a regulation UPS uniform, as they stretch across the taut, muscular buttocks of UPS GUY, as he strides through the shop. 
(CO NTINUE D) 
When the butt stops moving, we WIDEN to reveal the UPS Guy now standing in front of Elle and Paulette. 
UPS GUY 
I've got a package. Elle turns to Paulette, eyes wide. 
ELLE 
(agreeing) He's got a package.                            · Paulette is frozen.   Blushing and nervous.

UPS Guy smiles kindly at Paulette and heads out. 
UPS GUY                                               . 
Take it easy. Paulette watches him go, hand over her heart. Elle looks at her, concerned.                              , 
ELLE 
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had? 
PAULETTE 
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine". 
ELLE 
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage? 
PAULETTE 
What's the point? (matter of factly) Look at me. 
ELLE 
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman. 
(CONTINUED) 
Paulette snorts. 
PAULETTE 
Good one. 
ELLE 
Trust'me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual. Elle stands.                                                 , 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
I ' m going to.show you a little maneuver my mother taught me when I was in junior high. In my experience, it has a 98% success rate in getting a man's attention an d when used appropriately--an 83% rate of return on a dinner invitation. The HAIRSTYLISTS and CLIENTS listen, intrigued.                      . 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) It's called the "Bend & Snap". (acting) "Oh, look! There's something on the floor that I need to pick up!" Bend... She slowly BENDS down, as if to pick up something, sticking out her tush, knee cocked. She slids her hand down her cocked leg until her hand touches the floor and she SNAPS back up, boobs a'bouncing. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) And snap! Now you try. Paulette stands up repeating the maneuver. 
PAULETTE 
Bend...and snap! I t ' s a spastic version of what Elle just did. 
ELLE 
Good. Now this time, put a little arch in your back and maybe get your footing more solid. Paulette does it again. This time, getting it right. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Perfect! A HAIR CLIENT walks over, head full of curlers. 
HAIR CLIENT 
Like this?                  . She tries. 
ELLE 
Good. She adjusts her like a yoga instructor would. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
But cock that knee. ANOTHER CLIENT calls over. 
ANOTHER CLIENT 
Am I doing it right? Elle walks over to her. 
ELLE 
More snap, less bend. She turns to the rest of the clients. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
C'mon -- everyone try! Clients hop up out of their chairs as someone reaches over and cranks the transistor radio, blaring "BRICK HOUSE" by the Commodores. 
All the clients and technicians, no matter what their age, or how many foils are in there hair, are up and doing the "Bend & Snap", repeating the mantra as they do. 
Elle walks around them, continuing to adjust them. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
DONOVAN 
Covered. She was in Aspen at the time. Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club. 
ELLE 
Al l I know is-- it's not Brooke. 
DONOVAN 
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi. Elle thinks about this.

He means well.      He's really brilliant and all. Brooke sits, not looking convinced. 
BROOKE 
He better be, for what I ' m paying him. Elle pushes her basket forward. 
ELLE 
I brought you some necessities. Pink sheets. Aromatherapy candles. Loofah. And The Bible. She holds up a "Cosmopolitan". 
BROOKE 
You're an angel. Elle squirms in her seat.

But I have to tell you the real reason I ' m here. Professor Donovan says we really, really need your alibi. 
Brooke tears up.

Elle, I can't. You don't understand. 
ELLE 
Who could better understand than me? 
Brooke dabs her eyes with a corner of the pink Ralph Lauren sheets.

ELLE 
Whatever it is -- it could save you. 
BROOKE

(continuing) -- getting liposuction. Elle gasps. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
Sarah enters. 
SARAH 
(re the depo) You done with that yet? Elle hands the deposition over. 
ELLE 
Take it. I've read it twenty times. She grabs another one off of the stack and begins reading. Sarah lingers. 
SARAH 
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique. 
ELLE 
Too bad you and I are the only ones. 
SARAH 
I ' m still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi. Elle looks up, defensive. 
ELLE 
It's not my alibi to tell -- 
SARAH 
(interrupting) I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.          . 
ELLE 
(surprised) Really? Thanks. Sarah starts to go, then stops. 
(CONTINUED) 
SARAH 
y                   Have you ever noticed that Donovan never asks Warner to bring him coffee? He's asked me at least a dozen times. Elle shrugs. 
ELLE 
Men are helpless.     You know that. Sarah lingers, leaning on the edge of the couch. 
SARAH 
Warner can't even do his own laundry. 
ELLE 
I know.     He has it sent out. 
SARAH 
Did you know he got wait-listed when he appli ed? His father had to make a call. 
ELLE 
(stunned) You're kidding! A KNOCK sounds on the open door and Margot and Serena poke their heads in. 
MARGOT AND SERENA 
Surprise! 
ELLE 
Oh, my God!                       ' -. Sarah watches as Elle jumps up to hug the girls, who each have a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in their hands. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) What're you doing here?! 
SERENA 
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night. 
MARGOT 
(tempting her) We have a limo downstairs and lots more of these. She wiggles her champagne bottle. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial. 
SERENA 
Where's Warner? 
SARAH 
(confused) At the office ~ Margot and Serena look over at her. 
MARGOT 
Oh, how sweet!        You made friends with a nerdy girl. 
ELLE 
Margot! 
SERENA 
Bring her, too. (to Sarah) C'mon. You can wear one of Elle's outfits. 
SARAH 
T ha t ' s okay -- 
MARGOT 
(to Elle) Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K-Mart. 
ELLE 
(torn) I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I --      promise. I really want to do a good job. Margot and Serena stare at her, realizing she means it. 
SERENA 
Okay. . . Call us if you change your mind. They start to head out. Margot hands Sa-rah the bottle of champagne. 
MARGOT 
Here. 
(CONTINUED) 
She spots The Rock on Sarah's finger and grabs her hand. 
MARGOT (CONT'D) 
BROOKE 
What's going on? 
ELLE 
Enrique's gay. I ' m sure of it.' 
(CONTINUED) 
BROOKE 
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once -- Donovan scoffs. 
DONOVAN 
While I appreciate your masterful legal theory, I have a murder trial to attend to. He grabs Emmett's arm and pulls him aside as they confer on more serious matters. Emmett looks at her as if to say "Sorry", before he looks back at Donovan. Brooke looks at Donovan, then back at Elle, rolling her eyes. Elle sits down, pissed. Warner is next to her. 
ELLE 
Thanks for the backup. 
WARNER 
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on? She looks at him like he's a complete idiot, as the judge takes his seat. 
110   INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                          110 
Donovan is in front of Enrique, who is at the stand. 
DONOVAN 
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair? 
ENRIQUE 
Just the love in my heart. Women in the audience openly sigh.     Elle makes a puke gesture. Enid concurs. Donovan smiles a smug smile. 
DONOVAN 
If that's all the proof that he has, your Honor, I think I'm done here. Emmett stands. 
EMMETT 
I have a couple of questions, Your Honor? 
(CONTINUED) 
Donovan glares at him. 
EMMETT (CONT'D) 
(continuing; sotto to Donovan) Give me two minutes. 
He approaches Enrique and starts firing questions at rapid speed. 
EMMETT (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date? 
ENRIQUE 
Yes. 
EMMETT 
Where? 
ENRIQUE 
A restaurant in Oakland.      Where no one would recognize us. 
EMMETT 
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham? 
.                 ENRIQUE 
Three months. 
EMMETT 
And what is your boyfriend's name? 
ENRIQUE 
Chuck. The audience lets out a gasp.      Elle looks up, shocked, then delighted. 
Enrique begins to sweat. 
ENRIQUE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) I ' m sorry, I misunderstood.   Chuck is just a friend. 
CHUCK, scrawny and angry, stands up in the audience. 
CHUCK 
If I ' m just your friend, why have we been doing the slippy-slap every night for the past six months? 
(CONTINUED) 
The courtroom ERUPTS and the judge bangs the gavel. 
Elle smiles victoriously from her seat.   Emmett grins back at her. Donovan shakes his head, smiling in amazement. 
111   EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                           111 
Elle and Emmett walk down the stairs together in high spirits. Donovan catches up. 
DONOVAN 
Good work today, Ms. Woods. 
ELLE 
Thank you! 
He walks on.   She looks at Emmett, excited.   He high-fives her. 
112   INT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT                                       112 
Paulette is closing up as Elle follows her around. 
PAULETTE 
(in a giddy, rush) And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun! 
ELLE 
(hugging Paulette) I ' m so happy for you! 
I ' m a man who knows what I want. Elle rises, stung.       She stares at him for a beat. 
ELLE 
And I ' m a law student who's finally realized her professor is a pathetic asshole. 
She walks out. 
DONOVAN 
(calling out) Too bad. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer. 
Elle keeps walking. 
117   INT. AUSTEN, JARET, PLATT ETC. - ELEVATOR - MOMENT LATER      117 
Elle is in the elevator. Flushed and upset. As the doors start to close, Sarah sticks her arm in, blocking them. 
SARAH 
You almost had me fooled. 
ELLE 
What? 
SARAH 
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case. Sarah steps back, letting the doors shut. 
118   INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT                                    118 
Elle stomps out of the elevator, as Emmett gets in. 
EMMETT 
(smiling) He y -- 
ELLE 
I'm quitting. She marches past.   He follows, catching up. 
EMMETT 
Whoa -- Why? 
ELLE 
Law school was a mistake.   Getting this internship was a mistake. 
EMMETT 
What're you talking about? You earned it- She snorts. 
ELLE 
I didn't earn anything. I got this internship because Donovan liked the way I looked. Which he made clear .tonight when he tried to feel me up. Emmett looks pissed as he processes this. 
(CONTINUED) 
EMMETT 
(mind reeling) So now you're --? 
. ELLE 
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty-hose. No more trying to be something I ' m not. 
EMMETT 
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay. 
She stops, giving him a sad smile. 
ELLE 
Thanks for not treating me the way everyone else here does. Call me if you're ever in California. 
She walks out.   Emmett watches her go, hating it. 
119   EXT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT                                       119 
Elle's Boxster, packed with suitcases and the potted palm, pulls up. 
120   INT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT                                       120 
Elle sits in front of Paulette, dejected.   Not even bothering with a manicure. 
PAULETTE 
(upset) You can't go home! 
ELLE 
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law s chool don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding mys elf -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
Just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a j oke. 
She stands up. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) The hell with law school. I just came to say goodbye. 
IN A NEARBY CHAIR 
Professor Elspeth Stromwell spins around, nails drying, facing Elle. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
If you let one stupid prick ruin your life, you're not the girl I thought you were. 
Elle looks at her, shocked, as Professor Stromwell stands and goes. 
121   INT. JAIL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT                                 121 
CLOSE ON A TV -- Donovan is being interviewed is on the evening news. 
DONOVAN ON TV 
Enrique Salvatore has been discredited as a witness. 
REPORTER #2 ON TV 
Did you go in there knowing how you were going to discredit Mr. Salvatore? 
ELLE 
Elle Woods, your honor. Rule 3:03 of the Supreme Judicial Court states that a law                     · student may appear on behalf of a defendant in criminal proceedings. 
DA JOYCE RAFFERTY 
(stoked) I have no problem with this. 
DONOVAN 
I do.   I'm not allowing it. 
ELLE 
(pointedly) But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"? 
The implication lingers in the air, as Donovan glares at her. 
JUDGE 
(reading the casebook) The ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. Donovan? 
DONOVAN 
That, I won't agree to. 
Emmett steps forward. 
EMMETT 
I ' m supervising, Your Honor. 
Elle smiles at him. Donovan looks from Emmett to Elle, completely derailed. 
JUDGE 
Well, then, Ms. Woods.    Proceed. 
Elle walks back to the table with a grin.       Warner looks shocked. 
(CONTINUED) 
IN THE AUDIENCE 
Paulette beams, the UPS Guy in the nose brace, next to her. 
Serena and Margot, now in attendance, STAND clapping and squealing in a completely inappropriate way. 
SERENA 
Go, Elle! Donovan takes a seat in the audience.    As he passes by Brooke: 
DONOVAN 
Enjoy prison. 
The judge looks at Brooke. 
JUDGE 
Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you're doing? 
BROOKE 
Absolutely. As Donovan sits, Margot leans over. 
MARGOT 
Don't fuck with a Delta Gamma. 
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE 
Sarah leans forward to Elle, who gathers her notes. 
SARAH 
Kick some butt. 
Elle looks at her, surprised. 
JUDGE 
Ms. Woods, call your first witness. 
ELLE 
I'd like to recall Chutney Windham as a defense witness. The crowd murmurs.     Donovan rolls his eyes. 
125   INT. COURTROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                           125 
Chutney takes her hand off of the Bible and sits. 
JUDGE 
Ms. Woods, begin your questioning. 
(CONTINUED) 
9/18/2000 Revision (Pink)                                108. 
ELLE 
First, your Honor, I ' d like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there's a complete lack of mens rea, which by definition tells us that there is no crime without a vicious will. The DA rolls her eyes, as do the lawyers present. 
JUDGE                                           · 
I am aware of the meaning of mens rea. What I am unaware of is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson instead of questioning your witness. Flustered, Elle turns to Chutney. 
ELLE 
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there? 
CHUTNEY 
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.           '   , 
ELLE 
And when you came downstairs, what happened? 
CHUTNEY 
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood. 
ELLE 
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun? 
CHUTNEY 
No, she'd stashed it by then. Brooke rolls her eyes. 
Because they got wet. 
ELLE 
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate? 
Chutney pales. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHUTNEY 
Yes -- Elle continues. 
ELLE 
And wouldn't someone who's had -- thirty perms ? -- throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule? 
Chutney doesn't answer.     She just glares at Brooke. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) And if you, in fact, were not washing your hair, as I suspect you were not, since your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot? 
Chutney continues to glare. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right? 
CHUTNEY 
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you? 
ELLE 
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father? 
Brooke looks at Chutney in horror, realizing. 
CHUTNEY 
I didn't mean to shoot him --                                · (to Brooke) I meant to shoot you! 
Pandemonium erupts.     The gavel pounds. 
BROOKE                            .'..' 
I knew it! 
(CONTINUED) 
Elle looks at Emmet t., elated at what's just happened. 
ELLE 
(shocked) Oh, my God! 
EMMETT 
(even more shocked) Oh, my G^d.! ! 
126   INT. COURTHOUSE FOYER - DAY                                    126 
Reporters mob Elle and Brooke as they make their way out of the courtroom. 
REPORTER 
Elle, how did you know Chutney was lying? 
BROOKE 
Because she is brilliant. 
ELLE 
(humble) The rules of haircare are simple and finite . Any Cosmo girl would ' ve known . 
The reporters laugh as they snap pictures of her and a happy Brooke.

What the --? Daniel, Elle 's father, watches TV as he does his morning workout on the treadmill. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) 
Honey, stop! (proud) Bile's on TV! He looks next to him, where Sapphire is upside down on a yoga inversion machine. SAPPHIRE'S POV -- the upside-down television with Elle on it. 
SAPPHIRE 
Oh, my God! What happened to her tan?                      '

SERENA 
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game. 
ELLE 
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl! 
MARGOT 
Hello!   You're like, a lawyer. 
ELLE 
(grinning) Not yet. 
Enid walks up to the girls. 
ENID 
(to Elle) Even though you knew your shit today -- you're still a product of the patriarchy and a creation of the male-dominated media. And so are your friends. 
She looks at Serena. 
ENID (CONT'D) 
(continuing; to Serena) Although -- you're kinda hot. Call me. 
She walks off.   Serena looks alarmed. 
ELLE

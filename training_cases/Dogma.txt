DOGMA 
EXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAY 
Jersey spring day. Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier, the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline. 
An OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away from besmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat. His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrises than one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small, satisfied smile cross his face. 
Behind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the boardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing a street hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views them briefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean. 
The skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up to their faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod. 
Their skates glide out of frame. 
P.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach. We get closer and closer to him until... 
One of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhales violently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagely beating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them. Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head. 
OC VOICE 
I don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on the writings Lewis Caroll? 
The three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse. Satisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk. 
INT AIRPORT - DAY 
LOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through the metal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can. 
LOKI 
Leaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the Looking Glass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the metaphorical meaning? 
NUN 
I wasn't aware there was one. 
LOKI 
Oh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized religion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers to either the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a carpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what do they do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the oysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and devour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says to you, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological figures insures the destruction of one's inner-being. 
BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats popcorn and stares at... 
A steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family. 
OC LOKI 
Organized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says "No, no!" 
Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him, kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun. 
LOKI 
'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale? I think not. 
NUN 
(really dazed) 
I've... I've never really thought about it like that... 
(beat; shocked; off her cassock) 
What have I been doing with my life...?'. 
LOKI 
Don't look back. Just get out there and taste life. 
(off donation can) 
Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible - it's another way the church is trying to control you. You take that money you've been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice piece of ass. You deserve it. 
The Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something. A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the still-transfixed Bartleby. 
BARTLEBY 
(looking OC) 
Here's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God. You've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I just heard you claim to be an atheist. 
LOKI 
C'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that shit I was telling her. I just like to fuck with the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her head stops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the Just again. But oh. will she have a bunch to confess. 
(looks around) 
Now here's what I don't get about you: why do you feel the need to come here all the time? 
BARTLEBY 
(off travelers) 
I like to watch. This is humanity at it's best. Look at them. 
A reunited FAMILY share a group hug and move on, making way for two young LOVERS to embrace and kiss passionately. 
OC BARTLEBY 
All that tension, all that anger and mistrust, forgotten for one perfect moment when they come off that plane. See those two? The guy doesn't even know that the girl cheated on him while he was away. 
OC LOKI 
She did? 
Bartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals. 
BARTLEBY 
Uh-huh. Twice. But it doesn't matter at this moment because they're both so relieved to be with one another. I like that. I just wish they could all feel that way more offen. 
LOKI 
Maybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would. Now what was so friggin' important that I had to miss cartoons this morning? If it was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments, I'm going to slug you. 
BARTLEBY 
(still looking OC) 
You're never going to believe this: we're going home. 
LOKI 
(off Bartleby's popcorn) 
Let me have some? 
BARTLEBY 
(pulls out envelope) 
Look what somebody sent us in the mail. 
(hands him a newspaper article and corn) 
LOKI 
Did you say we're going home? 
(reads) 
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on 'Catholicism - Wow!" 
Campaign." 
(to Bartleby) 
And? 
BARTLEBY 
Keep reading. 
LOKI 
(reads) 
"Updating the church... television spots... Papal consent... rededication... 
(to Bartleby) 
Again - and? 
BARTLEBY 
(snatches article) Give me this 
(getting up; reading) 
"The Re-dedication of Saint Michael's Church on it's hundredth anniversary is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Church back into the mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance to the centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of pleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all who pass through it's arches a morally clean slate." 
(looks at Loki) 
You still don't get it, do you? 
LOKI 
No, I don't get it. Are we leaving now? 
What's that? 
LOKI 
Let's kill people. 
A guy beside Loki reacts. Loki smiles at him as the elevator doors close. 
OPENING CREDITS 
Between black cards with white credits there are shots of the OLD MAN from the boardwalk being wheeled into a hospital on a gurney, being treated in the emergeny room, being hooked up to life support system, and finally resting in an intensive care wing. 
EXT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY 
The church sits on a grassy knoll in Mc Henry - a suburb of Chicago. Some kids tear by on bikes and egg it. 
OC PRIEST 
The greater Illinois chapter of the Right to Life foundation will be holding it's bi-annual softball game against the Cook County Pro-Choice league next Sunday at two. 
INT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY 
The PRIEST speaks from the lectern, addressing semi-filled rows of the faithful. 
PRIEST 
Those who find the weekly demonstration outside of 
the Twelfth Street Planned Parenthood Clinic hard to make due to work schedules are urged to show their support in the fight against the thoughtless and wanton destruction of life by cheering on our boys on the field. Refreshments. as always, will be served. 
Dollying down the rows while the Priest rattles on. we pass the parishoners. Some listen intently, others are nodding off. One surreptitiously listens to a Walk-man; a man and a woman quietly argue while their kid colors in a coloring book, going off the page and marking the pew; two kids play cards; one guy leafs through a copy of Hustler hidden by his hymnal book. 
OC PRIEST 
Today's second collection will be donated to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund. For those of you who haven't been following the news, an unidentified homeless man who was accosted and severely beaten at the New Jersey shore last Tuesday lies in critical but stable condition in one of that area's hospitals. He lacks identification and police have had no luck in tracking down any possible family. While he shows no signs of recovery, the Arch-Bishop of the Trenton Diocese has disputed the state's decision to remove the indigent man from life support systems, asking that Catholics all over the country join in this protest against Euthanasia. And finally - will whoever keeps parking in my spot, stop doing that. Thank you. Now, please rise for the recession of faith. We believe in one God, the father... 
As the congregation flatly joins in the prayer, we stop on BETHANY - a beautiful twenty-something woman who struggles to stay awake. She checks her watch and exhales softly. 
OC VOICE 
I don't really want to be here. 
ENT PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC - DAY 
A small gaggle of signcarrying RIght-to-Lifer's march in front of the sterile looking building. 
OC VOICE 
But then again, I guess nobody ever does... except maybe you. 
INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY 
The source of the voice - a GIRL - sits beside Bethany's desk, stretching out her gum. Bethany offers her an understanding smile. 
GIRL 
You know, I've done this three times now; and each time the counselor tells me I should be more careful in the future, I should show' some responsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the first time the counselor wasn't some ugly as hell old bitch. It's kind of hard to take abortion advice from a woman who's too gross to get laid in the first place. 
BETHANY 
I'm not here to lecture you - I'm here to make sure you really want to go through with this. 
GIRL 
I'd rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and down he was sterile. Short of that, there aren't many choices left, now are there? 
BETHANY 
Ever think about having it? 
GIRL 
(beat) 
What woman doesn't on some level. 
BETHANY 
I never did. 
GIRL 
(incredulous) 
You had an abortion? 
BETHANY 
(lights a smoke) 
My first year in college. All through high school, I'd dated the same guy - Walter Flanagan. We were really in love, right? So much so. that we decided to go Carnegie Mellon together... that's this college in Pittsburgh. So there we are -away at school, and there's suddenly no parents to worry about anymore, so we're screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing it. And I wound up getting pregnant. So he begs me to have it. He says we should quit school and get married, and I'm telling him that that'lI screw up our educations. We fought about it for a week - my arguement being there was no rush to have kids, you know? We could always have a baby in a couple of years - after school. So I got the abortion against his wishes... I mean, what the hell - it was my body, right? After graduation, we got married and immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hell for the first six months, and... nothing. So I went to a gynocologist to see if everything was okay on my end. 
(beat) 
It wasn't. 
(takes a drink) 
My uteran wall had this fissure. It seems that the doctor who performed the procedure on me years before had somehow botched it. I'd never be able to have a child. 
The Girl's face says it all. Bethany takes a drag and continues. 
BETHANY 
So there I am - devastated. And now I have to go home to break the news to my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby - his baby. And after I explain it to him through my tears, he sits on the couch and rubs his eyes. And in the calmest, most rational voice I've ever heard anybody use in my life, he asks me for a divorce. And I fought him, you know? I tried to talk him out of it; told him there were alternatives - like we could adopt. And all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his children. 
GIRL 
(beat) 
What happened? 
BETHANY 
He remarried. He had two kids in two years with his new wife. We never spoke again. And now I do this. 
GIRL 
That's like... such a sad story. 
BETHANY 
I dated this guy a year or two ago - he was really into comic books. He told me I had the stock superhero story -I wanted to prevent a wrong that had happened to me from ever happening to anyone else. Kind of like Batman, he said. The only difference is I don't put on tights to do it... unless all my other clothes are in the wash. 
(smiles and puts out her smoke) 
So... let's go over your paperwork. 
EXT CLINIC - DAY 
A well-dressed LIZ maneuvers through the small thrall of Right-to-lifer's. They shake their placards at her accusingly. 
PROTESTOR 1 
You should be ashamed of yourself! 
PROTESTOR 2 
Child killer! 
LIZ 
(looking over their shoulders) 
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE POPE!! 
As the thrall turns excitedly in an effort try to spy the imaginary pontiff, Liz ducks inside the clinic. 
INT CLINIC COFFEE ROOM - DAY 
A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE fills the frame - "CHURCH SAYS NO TO DEATH OF JOHN DOE". It's lowered to reveal Bethany, reading. Liz enters and hangs up her coat. 
LIZ 
Jesus! You're a Catholic, aren't you? Can't you talk 
to them or something? 
BETHANY 
They hate me more than you, no doubt. At least you have an excuse - you're ]ewish, 
you don't know any better. 
LIZ 
I don't think they'd accept that one - we already used it as our excuse for killing Christ. So where were you yesterday morning - a bunch of us went out for brunch? 
BETHANY 
I went to church. 
LIZ 
That kills me. You and church. We work in a field that specializes in pissing off the cloth and you add insult to injury by breaking bread with them every week. 
BETHANY 
METATRON 
No, that's the stupid part: they have no idea what their actions will result in. As far as they know, they're just going home. Isn't that sweet? 
BETHANY 
If this is so major, why are you talking to me? Why doesn't God do something? 
METATRON 
He could. He could blink them out of existence, destroy that church, turn them into plants. But He'd rather see you take care of this one personally. 
BETHANY 
Why me? 
METATRON 
Because of who you are. 
BETHANY 
And who am I? 
METATRON 
The girl in the p.j.'s. Don't ask so many questions just serve your purpose. 
BETHANY 
I'll pass. 
METATRON 
I beg your pardon? 
BETHANY 
When some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God? When my 
husband decided he couldn't be with a wife that couldn't bear his children - where was 
God? Now all the sudden, after all these years of quiet noninvolvement in my life, He 
sends one of His lackey's my way who tells me I should save the world, and as what - 
some sort of test? To Hell with Him. 
METATRON 
Do yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor: let go of your petty crap. It's served you precious little in the past, and it serves you even less now when the fate of existence 
hangs in the balance. Don't allow eons of history and life to get blinked out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator. 
BETHANY 
A grudge? Do you know why I work in that clinic? It's my own private way of saying 
"fuck you" to God. 
METATRON 
And any other day I'd say that's your business and your life, and enjoy yourself and goodnight. But this isn't about you - this is about eve~body. So you lost the abiliry to make life. You're being offered the chance to play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving it. 
(swigs her drink and spits it out) 
But I can't make you. You'll do what you will. However, if you should decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility, you won't be alone. You'll have support. 
BETHANY 
What, more angels? 
NIETATRON 
Prophets - although they don't quite get it yet. You'll know them right away - one speaks, the other listens. The one who speaks - and he will at great lengths, whether you want him to or not - will make mention of himself as a prophet. The other one won't say anything, but he'll be helpful 
just the same. 
(looks at watch) 
I have to go. You'll do what you will, but try to remember that we're working in a time frame here. 
Metatron moves to exit. 
BETHANY 
(beat) 
Hey. 
(Metatron turns) 
You work for God. 
METATRON 
They tell me it's God. If it's not, I'm going to be severely pissed - what with all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and expectorating perfectly good tequila. 
BETHANY 
What's he like? God? 
METATRON 
(thinks) 
Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor. 
BETHANY 
I'll bet. 
METATRON 
Look at sex. Sex is funny. One time I asked him why you people had to look so stupid while procreating. He said if you didn't, you'd do it all the time, just for fun. 
BETHANY 
But we do. 
METATRON 
I know. And you all look so damn stupid doing it. It kills us upstairs. 
BETHANY 
Sex is a joke in Heaven? 
METATRON 
The way I understand it, it's mostly a joke down here too. 
And with that, Nietatron is gone. Bethany looks at her drink. A three-man mariachi band surround her and begin playing Prince's 'Little Red Corvette'. 
INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bethany startles awake. The radio on her night-table plays 'Little Red Corvette'. She lays back down. 
INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Bethany sits at her desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girl speaks, butBethany's not really listening. She's extremely preoccupied. 
INT CLINIC - NIGHT 
Bethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms. She packs up her bag and turns on the alarm. 
EXT CLINIC - NIGHT 
Bethany exits and locks the door behind her. She starts walking. 
As her feet tread lightly toward her car, three small shadows move toward her. 
Bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse for her keys. She hears something and stops. Roller blades can be heard moving slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot. Bethany turns quickly. 
Nobody's there. She looks around, a bit peturbed. 
BETHANY 
(calling into the darkness) 
God, what time do you people quit and go home?! Let's just save it for tomorrow, alright? 
There's no response. Then there's the noise of wood being tapped against the ground. Bethany peers into the darkness, looking for the source. 
Suddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of her knee. Bethany goes down. Another skater whips in and slashes at her, but she ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through her purse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with his stick. Bethany looks up. 
The Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her. They tap their hockey sticks in unison on the ground. Bethany jumps up and faces them defensively. The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her. 
And from out of nowhere, a large figure swoops down from above, landing on the ground between Bethany and her menacers. The Triplets stop short and regard the figure curiously. The large figure whips into a defensive stance, Batman-style. 
The Stygian Triplets look to one another. They shrug and charge anew. 
From behind the rock-still large figure, a smaller figure leaps into the streetlight, shrieking, flying through the air, busting into a flying kick. He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in the face, grabbing his stick from the falling child's hand and tossing it into the air behind him. 
The stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of the large figure, who twirls it under his arm, and then back Out like a sai. He swings it out before him, knocking the other two Triplets off balance. The smaller figure back flips into the larger figure's arms and kicks his feet into the faces of the two wobbling Triplets. They go down, and the smaller figure leaps forward with a shriek, landing between the fallen pair, elbows into their backs. 
The flrst struck Triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large figure, screaming something unholy. The large figure catches the kid by the throat and quickly 
Batman never uses guns. 
(off gun) 
I don't know. It feels impersonal. 
BARTLEBY 
Then don't use a gun. Just lay the place to waste like Sodom and Gommorah. Now that was something. 
LOKI 
Oh yeah, for you maybe. You got to stand there and read. I had to do all the work. 
BARTLEBY 
What work? You lit a few fires. 
LOKI 
I rained down sulfur, man. There's a subtle difference. 
BARTLEBY 
Sure. 
LOKI 
Are you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire. Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance. Mass genocide is the most exhausting activity one can engage in, next to soccer. 
(to Salesman) 
I'll take this one. 
SALESMAN 
Five seventy five to walk with it right now. 
Loki starts sifting through his wallet. 
BARTLEBY 
Soccer? 
INT DINER - NIGHT 
An English muffin is covered with a knife-full of jam. Bethany raises the bread to her mouth and takes a bite. She glances at the OC pair and stops chewing. 
Jay and Silent Bob study her intently. Jay smiles widely, anticipatory, and nods. 
All three sit at a small table near a window. Bethany puts the English muffin down and brushes off her hands. Jay's feet are moving a mile a minute. 
BETHANY 
Are you both from around here? 
JAY 
I'm hard as hell. 
BETHANY 
Do you live in the city? 
JAY 
Do you have a friend for Silent Bob, or are you going to do us both? If so, I'm first. I hate sloppy seconds. 
BETHANY 
You're a man of principle. Where do you come from? 
JAY 
We used to live in a small town in Jersey. Real small town. We practically knew everybody. 
BETHANY 
What brought you to McHenry? 
JAY 
Hollywood. 
BETHANY 
(beat) 
Hollywood? 
JAY 
Oh yeah. See, we used to sell smoke in front of this video store. And one day this fuck wants to rent a video. So we did, only we didn't have anyplace to watch it. So we went to the mall and popped it into a VCR at Macy's and sat on the floor and watched it. It was called 'Sixteen Candles'. Did you ever see it? 
BETHANY 
Yes. 
JAY 
So the next day we rented 'The Breakfast Club', and then 'Weird Science' where these two fucks have a chick that'll do anything for them and they don't do nothing because it's a PG movie. But then we got thrown out of Macy's when we watched 'Pretty in Pink', because of this bitch. 
(points to Silent Bob) 
BETHANY 
(to Silent Bob) 
What'd you do? 
JAY 
You know how at the end the red-headed bitch gets together with her dream guy at the prom? 
(Bethany nods) 
Well pussy here starts fuckin' sobbing all sorts of loud and shit. And the manager's like "Get the hell out of here!" And I'm like "Fuck you, you bald cocksucker! I'll kick your lard.. 
BETHANY 
(speeding him along) 
So what exactly brought you to Illinois? 
JAY 
Oh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a town called Shermer, in Illinois. And there's all this fine bush running around, and we could kick all the dude's asses because they're all whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson - he was harsh. But best of all, there was no one selling weed. So I says to Silent Bob "Man, we could live phat if we were the blunt-connection in Shermer, Illinois!" So we collected some cash we were owed, and caught a bus. But when we got here, 
you know what we found Out? There is no Shermer in Illinois. What kind of shit is that?! Fucking movies are bullshit! 
BETHANY 
And now you live here? 
JAY 
Fuck that. This berg sucks. Everyone talks with a stupid accent so you don't know what they're saying, and it's too fuckin' cold. We were talking about taking off. Until we met you, that is. 
(kisses her hand) 
BETHANY 
(retracts her hand) 
Right. So how much longer are you staying here? 
JAY 
Until you're ready to skip out and make with the sex. 
BETHANY 
No. How long are you staying in McHenry? 
JAY 
We're leaving tomorrow. 
BETHANY 
Where are you going next? 
JAY 
(to Silent Bob) 
Jesus - this broad asks alot of questions. 
(to Bethany) 
Back to Jersey. We've been going straight for like five 
years now. It's about time for us to retire or something. Enjoy our salad years. No more adventures. 
BETHANY 
I see. 
(defensively) 
Well what do I know from shifting?! Like I ever drove before! 
Silent Bob shrugs and smokes. Bethany walks away, shaking her head. 
JAY 
Chicks. 
Silent Bob nods and extracts a tool from his jacket. He begins working on the engine as a cross~ountry bus races by. 
INT BUS - NIGHT 
Bartleby and Loki sit in the back. Bartleby reads a map and Loki stares at the gun in his lap. A COUPLE makes out in the seat in front of them. 
BARTLEBY 
We have to pass through three more states to get to New Jersey: Indianna, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. 
LOKI 
With a very important stop in Cleveland. 
BARTLEBY 
Oh right. The Angel of Death Returns. Sounds like a bad movie. 
LOKI 
Movies are bullshit. And don't start with me, airight. The last time you bugged me about my job, you got us sentenced to life in Wisconsin. 
(looks out window) 
All this time we've been down here, why didn't we ever leave the Cheese? 
BARTLEBY 
He said to stay where he put us. We feared worse punishment if we disobeyed Him again. 
LOKI 
Where were we afraid He'd send us? 
BARTLEBY 
New Jersey. 
LOKI 
Now that, my friend. is irony. 
BARTLEBY 
(beat) 
You know, maybe you're wrong about this slaughter. How can you even be sure of what incurs the Lord's wrath these days? Times change. Remember when eating meat on Friday was supposed to be a Hellworthy tresspass? Or when people weren't even supposed to shop on Sundays? 
LOKI 
That stuff was small potatoes. The major sins never change. And believe me - I can spot a commandment breaker a mile away. 
BARTLEBY 
Sure. 
LOKI 
You don't believe me? 
(looks around; eyes fall on kissing couple) 
There. There's one. 
BARTLEBY 
(off couple) 
So what? They're kissing. 
LOKI 
Adultery. 
BARTLEBY 
That's a stretch. How do you know they're not dating? 
LOKI 
You'd know better than me - let's hear it. 
BARTLEBY 
Oh, I know the truth. But let's see how boned up on the job you really are. 
LOKI 
A test? 
BARTLEBY 
Of sorts. So what's your proof? 
LOKI 
He's wearing a wedding band. 
BARTLEBY 
So? Maybe that's his wife. 
LOKI 
No married man kisses his wife like that. You get married and the passion dies, man. Don't you ever watch talk shows? 
BARTLEBY 
What are you talking about? 
LOKI 
A guy makes his best plays when wooing. When the object of his desire is won, there's no need to expend the effort anymore. He relaxes, satisfied with the spoils of victory, which he then decides isn't so victorious because he's saddled with a life-mate. 
BARTLEBY 
Very romantic sentiment. 
LOKI 
That's the problem - romance. You think about it :back in the old days, nobody got married out of quote, unquote, love. People married for property', dowries, or to procreate - to immortalize oneself through offspring. When did all this love stuff start? What the hell happened to the status quo? 
BARTLEBY 
The Troubadors. 
LOKI 
Lionel Richie's old group? 
BARTLEBY 
No, that's the Commodores. The Troubadors were wandering minstrels and dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy songs of undying love. 
LOKI 
Sounds like the Commodores. 
BARTLEBY 
The Troubadors made 'love' fashionable. And their influence altered the balance in a significant fashion. Until them, people got married because they had to. After them, people started 'falling in love'. Romantic courtships became the norm. What started out as simple entertainment made such a dramatic impact as to forever alter the way society operates. 
LOKI 
That's human beings for you - easily misled. From the Garden of Eden to the 'Thigh Master' - thev believe what they're told. I'm telling you - one day they're all going to watch one too many John Hughes flicks and start looking for Shermer, Illinois. 
BARTLEBY 
Be fair. Humans are dumb, but not that dumb. 
(off couple) 
So is it adultery or not? 
LOKI 
(thinks; to couple) 
Excuse me. 
The Couple stops kissing. The MAN looks at Loki. 
LOKI 
Are you married? 
MAN 
BETHANY 
I think he was aiming a bit further south. 
(to Rufus) 
Speaking of which, you're awfully nude - Rufus, is it? 
RUFUS 
Rufus it is, Miss. 
(to Silent Bob) 
Hey, tubby... how's about lending a brother your coat 'till I can find my own threads? 
Jay looks at Silent Bob. 
JAY 
Dude, he fell out of thin air! 
Silent Bob shrugs and passes his coat to Rufus. Jay bugs. 
JAY 
Dude, his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the inside of your armor! 
RUFUS 
(to Silent Bob) 
I'll do my best to tuck it back, brother. 
Silent Bob nods. Something OC catches his eye. He stares OC and exits. 
BETHANY 
Where exactly did you fall from? 
RUFUS 
Some might say grace. 
JAY 
(to Silent Bob) 
Dude, he's talking about your mom. 
Jay turns to see that Silent Bob isn't there. 
Silent Bob peers at a large bush at the road side. The bush rustles slightly. 
OC BETHANY 
You know, normally I'd have a hard time with this, but somehow you falling out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff I've been deaiing with. 
OC RUFUS 
Believe me - you ain't seen nothing yet. 
Silent Bob peers closer at the bush. Suddenly - a Stygian Triplet leaps out at him, pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick. 
The other two Triplets leap on top of Jay and BETHANY 
Rufus grabs the one off Bethany and hurls him to the side. 
Jay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of Penthouse. He rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it. 
Silent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it up hard, into the Triplet's forhead, knocking him off. He rushes to Jay's side and plies the other Triplet from his throat, hurling him OC. 
The Triplet Silent Bob fought 'punctures' the air with his stick and rips downward, creating a 'hole'. He grabs his friend and leaps into it, disappearing. 
Jay and Silent Bob look at eachother, blink, and embrace passionately. 
The Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick in lancing position. Without looking back, Rufus reaches behind himself, grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in an arch, letting go. The last Triplet goes sailing through the 'hole', and it seals shut. 
Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock. 
JAY 
Alright - what's with you, lady?! That's the second time you got attacked by the fucking Mighty Ducks! 
RUFUS 
(wiping off hands) 
Man, they're onto you bad, already. I got here just in time. 
BETHANY 
How can you be so composed? We were almost killed. 
RUFUS 
Death is a worry of the living. The dead only worry about decay and necrophiliacs. 
JAY 
See! I told you he was the undead! 
RU FUS 
Not the undead, the dead. I died. Christ told me the secret to resurrection once when we were at a wedding in Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it. 
BETHANY 
(incredulous) 
Wait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew Christ? 
RUFUS 
Knew him? I saw him naked. 
BETHANY 
Let me guess - you're another angel? 
RUFUS 
No, I'm a man - just like you and him. 
(looks at Jay) 
Well, maybe not like him. At least I was a man. Been dead for nearly two thousand years. Here. 
(pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear) 
JAY 
No wonder he saw Jesus - homey's rockin' the ganj. 
BETHANY 
(unrollingit) 
It's not a joint. 
(looks at it) 
I can't read this. 
RUFUS 
It's Sanskiit. It says "Rufus - see you in two years. Jesus." Freaked me out because he basically told me when my number was up. Took the flavor out of the remaining years. Look, we gotta keep moving. If we stay in one place long enough, those things are liable to come back. What say we continue this discussion over something to eat? 
BETHANY 
(snaps) 
WAIT A SECOND! 
(inhales deeply) 
I'm a rational woman, okay. All I want to know is where you, and those... kids came from?! 
RUFUS 
They came from Hell. I came from Heaven. 
(walking away) 
Let's start walking. 
JAY 
Walk? Do you know how far we are from anywhere? 
RUFUS 
Back in the old days with J.C., we walked everywhere. Did you ever hear of a fat apostle? 
(exits) 
Bethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability. 
See? You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys, I might add. But no mention of Rufus. And why? Cause I'm a black man. But that's just my pet peeve. I mainly want to correct a major error that you people are basing a faith on. 
BETHANY 
What's that? 
RUFUS 
Jesus wasn't white; He was black. 
Rufus bites into his sandwhich. Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob look at him and then each other. 
JAY 
Bullshit. I've seen pictures of Jesus, and He has blonde hair and blue eyes. 
RUFUS 
(wiping hands) 
That's what's particularly insulting. Between the time when He established the faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-be decided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He was black was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric, even though the brother was blacker than Jesse. 
BETHANY 
If that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out? 
RUFUS 
Well He is the Son of God, right? It's kind of hard to have the New Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on His ethnicity. Leaving me out's okay because there's still Twelve apostles to choose from. 
JAY 
I don't buy it. 
RUFUS 
That's what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my ass. 
BETHANY 
You were martyred? 
RUFUS 
That's one way of putting it. Another way is to say I was bludgeoned to shit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the world and spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christian following, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing about Jesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was black, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressed the point, and before I know it, I'm wearing stones - although not to accessonze. 
BETH ANY 
Why didn't you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting? 
RUFUS 
Because it's part of the facts. White folks only want to hear the good shit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they're getting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - is called Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior. 
(to Silent Bob) 
You going to eat that hash brown? 
BETHANY 
So you went to Heaven? 
RUFUS 
Shit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep and followed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time, did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into His message. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that He was black. That's why I'm going to help you find stop those angels from getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign. 
BETHANY 
How do you know about that? 
RUFUS 
Heaven's a pretty boring place, and anything that breaks the tedium is news. The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great tediumbreaker. Besides, there isn't much I don't know about you. 
BETHANY 
I find that hard to believe. 
RUFUS 
When you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand. 
JAY 
(shocked) 
You did that? 
BETHANY 
Yeah... but I never told anyone about it. 
RUFUS 
Neither did he. He died of Leukemia two years later. His name was... 
BETHANY 
...BryanJohnson. 
RUFUS 
Your exploits - no matter how inane - are well-known in Heaven. Probably in Hell, too. 
Bethany rubs her temples and exits OC. Rufus watches her go. 
JAY 
(intrigued) 
Tell me something about me. 
RUFUS 
(preoccupied with the OC Bethany) 
You masturbate more than anybody else on the planet. 
JAY 
Shit, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows. 
RUFUS 
You think about guys when you do it. 
Rufus gets up and exits. Silent Bob looks at Jay, shocked. 
JAY 
Not all the time! 
Bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym, shaking her head. Rufus joins her. 
RUFUS 
I'm sorty if I spooked you. 
BETHANY 
I just feel... violated. Like my life isn't mine exclusively. 
RUFUS 
That's the way it goes with celebrities. 
BETHANY 
What are you talking about? I'm a nobody. I'm just a quiet girl from the suburbs who counsels pregnant teens. 
RUFUS 
You sound like Christ. He had the same reaction when He found out who He was, minus the quiet girl from the 'burbs angle. And like Him, I'm sure you'll come to terms and do what you're supposed to. 
BETHANY 
Why not get the pope or someone holy like that? 
RUFUS 
Just because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn't make him the right man for the job. Only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of destruction. last time it was Jesus - this time it's you. 
BETHANY 
Why me? 
RUFUS 
Can't say yet. But the question is - are your hands capable enough to carry the burden. It all rides on you. 
BFTRANY 
(rubbing her temples) 
Two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home. You know, yesterday I wasn't sure God even existed. And now I'm upto my ass in Christian Mythology. 
RUFUS 
Because you can't get shit stains out of flannel. What I'm saying is that you got shit for brains. 
The Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment. 
GANG LEADER 
Well I appreciate you breaking that down for me, but I got it without the explanation. 
JAY 
No. No, I don't think you did get it. See, there's gonna he some nine's firing in here, and when the bullets stop flyin', your cunt-lip ass is gonna be all holes and smoke. You think you can draw on me and walk away? Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you a monkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you, I'll bring a coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave; stick a straw through it and stick the other end in the ground. Your lips'll reach. 
The Gang stares, mystified. Rufus and Bethany can't move they're so frightened. 
JAY 
You think every white boy cowers at your ass? Shit, if I don't fucking plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will. 
(thumbs at Silent Bob) 
What do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he's gotta be with me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn't talk in words - he speaks in bullets. Re's all quiet cause he's thinking about how he's gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets in your bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he likes to see the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down. Come to think of it, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably don't even understand big words like 'piss'. Tell you what - I'll let him explain it to you. 
(to Silent Bob) 
Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches. 
Silent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion. Jay looks at him. 
JAY 
What are you waiting for?! 
Silent Bob shrugs. 
JAY 
(flabbergasted) 
YOU DON'T RAVE A GUN?!? 
Silent Bob kind of nods 
JAY 
(shocked) 
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN? ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN?!? 
Silent Bob indicates the negative, sheepishly. 
JAY 
THAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT! DO YOU THINK I 
WOULD'VE SAID ALL THAT IF I'D KNOWN YOU 
DIDN'T HAVE A GUN?!? 
(beat) 
HUNHH?!? 
Silent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles. 
GANG LEADER 
What was that about a coconut? 
Jay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob. 
JAY 
No gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?! All this time and you got no gun! 
GANG LEADER 
Oh boys! We have some unfinished business here. 
JAY 
(sheepishly) 
Can we talk this over? 
GANG LEADER 
Tell you what - you got thirty seconds. Then I cap you. Talk all you like. 
Bethany goes to make a move, but Rufus holds her back, shaking his head. He puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action, smiling. 
Jay fumes. 
JAY 
(to Silent Bob) 
I can't believe you. 
(to Gang Leader) 
Do me a favor. 
(points to Silent Bob) 
Shoot this piece of shit first. 
(to Silent Bob; disgusted) 
No gun! 
Suddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance. Zombie-like, Jay and Silent Bob step to the turntables behind them. Jay puts on headphones and begins scratching a record. A familiar tune begins. 
The Gang watches, perplexed. 
Silent Bob whips around, microphone in his hand, and begins to sing. 
SILENT BOB 
HEY, HEY, HEY!!! IT'S FAT ALBERT! 
AND I'M GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU!! 
AND BILL'S GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO!! 
WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN, NOW! 
WITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG! 
LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER - 
WHILE WE DO OUR THANG! 
The Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softens and smiles, adding a slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up. 
JAY 
NA , NA, NA! GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME! 
SILENT BOB 
(as Fat Albert) 
HEY! HEY! HEY! 
JAY 
NA. NA. NA! GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME! 
Bethany and Rufus look on. amazed. 
RUFUS 
I thought she looked familiar. 
BETHANY 
Who? 
RUFUS 
(he nods toward the stage) 
Serendipity. 
Bethany looks to the stage. 
The Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question. She wipes sweat from her brow. 
INT. MOOBY CORP. BOARDROOM - DAY 
Oh, this isn't your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby, the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on Barney: sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits in the middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls are adorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in a stupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated statue of the insipid creature. 
Doors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men, one woman. They chatter and take their seats. After a beat, WHITLAND, the CEO, enters, taking his place at the head of the conference table. 
WHITLAND 
Good morning, shoppers. 
BARTLEBY 
(not liking his job) 
Mister Pereira disowned his gay son; Mister Turran put his mother in a third-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her house to purchase an oriental rug for himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipines on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy; Mister Bloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe and toxic materials because it was less costly. 
Bartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her, relieved. 
BARTLEBY 
You, on the other hand, are an innocent. You lead a good life and have never misused your power here. 
She stares at Bartleby. Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby on. 
BARTLEBY 
But you, Mister Whitland. You have more skeletons in your closet than this assembled party. I can't even mention them aloud. 
Bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitland's ear. Whitland goes green. Bartleby steps back. Loki stands beside Whitland. 
LOKI 
You're her father, you sick fuck. 
Whitland begins sobbing. 
BARTLEBY 
(to Loki) 
Can I go now? 
LOKI 
(cheerily rubbing his head) 
Go on, you crazy kid. 
Bartlebv exits. Loki turns menacingly on the others. 
LOKI 
With the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not a decent human being amongst you. Do you know what makes a human being decent? 
(beat) 
Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to fear anymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding behind your false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even from one another. But not from God. 
Loki goes to exit but pauses. He turns around. 
LOKI 
I forgot my little voo-doo doll. 
(looks at Whitland) 
Wow. It really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough... 
Loki begins moaning menacingly, slowly waving an open palm over the figure. Whitland looks at it horrified, then at Loki, then back at the figure. He sweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure. Loki lets out a shriek and smashes the figure with his fist. Whitland freezes, eyes closed. Slowly, he opens his eyes - unharmed. 
LOKI 
I don't believe in voo-doo. 
Loki swiftly exits. The Board Members sit in awed silence. Then the doors burst open and Loki storms back in. 
LOKI 
But I do believe in this. 
Gun blazing, he takes out the male board members, including Whitland, in a flurry of bullets. The remaining female Board Member covers her head with her arms. Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair. 
LOKI 
(smiling) 
It's okay. You've done nothing wrong. They were bad men. You are a pure soul. 
She looks at him, terrified. He smiles back. Then his expression hardens. 
LOKI 
But you didn't say 'God Bless You' when I sneezed. 
He quickly puts the gun to her head. She slams her eyes shut. 
OC BARTLEBY 
(cautionary) 
Loki! 
Loki freezes and looks OC. He grimaces and holsters his piece. 
LOKI 
(to woman) 
Sorry. Force of habit. 
He surveys his handiwork and exits. The female Board Member slowly opens her eyes and looks around. 
INT STRIP JOINT - LATER 
Jay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table, surrounded by the other gangsters and Silent Bob. They laugh and chug their '40's. 
GANG LEADER 
(to Gang) 
Watch this shit. 
(to Jay) 
Do it again, G. Do the Mush-mouth. 
JAY 
(swigs his beer; as 'Mush-mouth') 
Hey-buh, Fat-buh, Al-buh-bert. 
The Gang laughs hysterically. 
GANGSTER 1 
Fat Albert like a mother fucker and shit! 
Bethany, Rufus, and Serendipity huddle around a table further away. 
RUFUS 
(elated) 
I forgot you were down here! How long now? 
SERENDIPITY 
Three years this August. What about you - is this another temporary expulsion? You and your 'Christ was down' campaign? 
BETHANY 
What does that mean - another expulsion? I thought you came down here specifically to help me? 
SERENDIPITY 
Is that what he told you? Rufus gets thrown out constantly; at least once a month, ethereal time. They always bring him back, but only after a few days of peace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric. 
RUFUS 
(joking) 
Artsy-fartsy bitch. 
SERENDIPITY 
Who you calling artsy-fartsy? 
RUFUS 
(to Bethany) 
Serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem. 
BETHANY 
Let me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left out of the bible because she's a woman. 
RUFUS 
The girl's not a woman. 
(to Serendipity) 
No offense. 
BETHANY 
INT BASEMENT 
Our heroes cower beneath the floor door. 
JAY 
What is that thing? 
SERENDIPITY 
You ever hear of Golgotha? 
BETHANY 
Skull place. The hill where Christ was crucified. 
SERENDIPITY 
(peering above) 
Yeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybody on that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers, brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, their bodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in the process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: the Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you, girlie. 
Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit drips through it. 
BETHANY 
What are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blasting through that door! 
SERENDIPITY 
Shit's brainless. If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes, he'll forget what he came for. 
Suddenly another drop falls. Then another. Then a steady stream. Silent Bob taps Rufus and points. Rufus reacts. 
RUFUS 
(indicating trickling shit) 
Looks like it's been taking memory training courses... 
SERENDIPITY 
(off trickle) 
JUMP!!! 
The five leap from their perch on the steps, just as the doors explode, dumping a torrent of crap on the steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan anew. NoMan lumbers toward them. The group, attempting to gain their bearings on the floor, crawls backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself off, rolling it around in It's hands. 
SERENDIPITY 
If anybody still remembers any prayers, I suggest you start whipping them out. 
Silent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon. And then, something occurs to him. He stops backing up and stands. The others continue moving back. 
BETHANY 
Bob, get down! Jay! 
JAY 
(to Silent Bob) 
You tubby retard! Get your ass back on the floor! 
Silent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothan's path. The demon snarls a smile, moving ever closer. Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls a small canister out. He points it at the beast. A mist shoots out into the face of the Golgothan. It pauses, looking confused. The shitball in It's hand drops to the floor, and then so does It. 
Bethany, Rufus, Serendipity, and Jay climb to their feet and crowd around Silent Bob. They look to the fallen, unconscious behemoeth, then to Silent Bob. 
BETHANY 
(off Bob's canister) 
What was that? 
Silent Bob holds the can out to them: it's a small, trial size can of Glade Air Freshener. Jay looks at it, then at Silent Bob. 
BETHANY 
(reading can) 
'Knocks strong odors out.' 
RUFUS 
Way to go. tubby. 
BETHANY 
Why would you ever carrs this? 
Jay farts. Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass. The others look at jay. 
JAY 
What?! 
RUFUS 
(to Serendipity) 
Who has dominion over this thing? 
SERENDIPITY 
Only Lucifer can order a killing. But something doesn't make sense: this thing never travels alone - with it's intelligence level, Lucifer'd never allow it. It usually has some kind of backup. 
RUFUS 
Can you get some answers? 
SERENDIPITY 
I can give it a shot. 
BETHANY 
What's going on? 
RUFUS 
Serendipity's going to talk to that demon. 
JAY 
Cool! Can we watch? 
SERENDIPITY 
Not a good idea. Demon's can wreak havoc on the weak-minded. 
JAY 
Fuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own language! See...? 
(makes the universal metal sign) 
he'd understand this. 
SERENDIPITY 
(shakes her head; to Rufus) 
Whoever sent this might send mor~. I suggest you take the princess and get as far away as possible. 
(to Bethany) 
I'll do what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here. If there's anything helpful. I'll get it to you somehow. 
BETHANY 
(hugs her) 
Thank you. And... you're a great dancer. 
SERENDIPITY 
I'm a better juggler. 
(to jay and Silent Bob) 
You know you're supposed to be prophets. right? Start acting like prophets. You should have seen that thing coming. 
JAY 
(to Bethany) 
Why the hell are we getting yelled at?! 
SERENDIPITY 
Just watch out for Bethany. Go. 
Bethany leads Jay and Silent Bob up the stairs. 
JAY 
(to Silent Bob) 
You had to drag that judgement out. You couldn't just hit and run. 
(to Woman) 
When's the next one? 
WOMAN 
Same time tomorrow. 
BARTLEBY 
What?! Doesn't this place warrant at least two buses a day? 
WOMAN 
I take it you've never been to the Garden State. Next. 
Bartleby and Loki look around. 
LOKI 
There's no one else here. 
WOMAN 
Then I guess it's lunch time. 
(she shuts her window) 
LOKI 
We should have learned to drive a long time ago. Infinite celestial power and we can't catch a bus. 
BARTLEBY 
Just shut up, this is your fault. 
LOKI 
You can either lament over our mass transit folly, or you can listen to my suggestion. 
BARTLEBY 
It's your suggestions that prevent us from negotiating what should be a simple matter of catching or staying on a bus! 
LOKI 
Why fall victim to gravity when we can just as easily rise above? 
BARTLEBY 
(stares at him) 
Fly? 
LOKI 
We got wings, right? Let's use them. 
OC VOICE 
I wouldn't suggest that. 
The pair spin and gawk. 
AZRAEL leans in the doorway. He removes his hat, revealing two stubby horns. 
AZRAEL 
You wouldn't want to stand out, now would you? 
INT STRIP JOINT BASEMENT - DUSK 
NoMan is tied to a chair in the middle of the floor. Serendipity draws a circle around him with lipstick. Once finished. she takes a glass of water and throws it into No Man's face. It roars to life. The Golgothan shakes of his daze, turning his attention on Serendipity. 
NoMAN 
The Muse. They told us you were up here. 
SERENDIPITY 
Matter of perspective. NoMan. I like to think of it as 'down here'. I have a few questions for you, sir. 
NoMan 
Free us from these binds, that you may have answers. 
SERENDIPITY 
(heads toward it) 
Okay. 
(stops; sarcastic) 
Oh wait. I'm smarter than that. 
NoMan lets out a bellow. 
SERENDIPITY 
Face it, big guy - I'm not releasing you until I get answers. This can go hard or easy. The sooner I get what I want, the sooner you'll be free. Now, you can start by telling me why you're on this plane? 
NoMAN 
(beat) 
Liquidate the Last Scion. 
SERENDIPITY 
See? That wasn't so hard. Now - who sent you? Was it Lucifer? 
NoMan laughs in a sinister fashion. 
NoMAN 
Our master is no one and all. For a time, he will be prince of this world - and the fate of those who dwell in it will be at the mercy of his whimsy. And then he will sever reality and crush existence, like a thumb punctures a fontanell, giving peace to those who've been without for so long. 
SERENDIPITY 
Did Bartleby and Loki send you? 
NoMAN 
Resist no further, Muse. Deliver over to us the conflicted one, that this world may die screaming. No power - divine or inherited - threatens the crusade. You cannot win. Soon will rise of the cry of the abandonned, begging your God to put an end to the madness. And only as being becomes not, will they know that the God of Abraham lay dormant while the dream perished in a blink. Your God is not dead - He's brain dead. 
SERENDIPITY 
She, you chauvinist bastard - She's brain dead. And no She's not. Stop trying to be so spooky. Tell me who sent vou, or I'll use whatever influence I have below' to make Hell even worse for you. 
NoMAN 
You speak of Azrael. 
(he laughs) 
We pity you. Muse. You're still playing the old game. The one that could have made good on your threat is gone. 
SERENDIPITY 
What do you mean. gone? He escaped? 
NoMAN 
No soul escapes Hell, but one. 
(beat - as if It's heard something) 
Would that I could cross the threshold of your confining circle, I would crush your half-life throat. But my Master does not abandon me to this mockery of a prison. We will come back for the girl. And when we do, it will take more than fragrant mist to keep our hands from crushing her head. 
NoMan goes stiff and then limp. His body begins to melt. 
INT TOY STORE - DAY 
Azrael leads Bartleby and Loki through the aisles, passing tons of stuffed animals. 
BARTLEBY 
Jesus Christ, Azrael - how'd you get out of Hell? 
AZRAEL 
I told them I was coming up on a routine possession. I don't have much time. If they figure out my ruse, they'll come looking for me. 
BARTLEIBY 
You lied? 
LOKI 
Go figure. Him. A demon. 
(to Azrael) 
Why'd you bring us in here? 
He was big on life? 
RUFUS 
It was more than that. He was the only person I ever knew who never engaged in that most ancient of life-affirming activities. 
BETHANY 
Sex. 
RUFUS 
Debate. That's the only way people know how to reaffirm that they're alive - by debating. In all it's forms. People spend their whole lives debating: we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight each other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights. We believe that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and give up. People say that life's a struggle, but it's not. Life is living. I'm even guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity, fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the only way I know how to live is through debate. That's sad, isn't it? 
BETIIANY 
Not if you believe it's important for people to know. 
RUFUS 
A belief's a dangerous thing, Bethany. People die for it. People kill for it. The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the Catholic Belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit. And whether they know it or not, Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief, and if they're successful, you, me. all of this... ends in a heartbeat. 
(beat) 
All over a belief. 
Bethany nods. Rufus looks around. 
RUFUS 
I haven't seen the moron twins in awhile. 
BETHANY 
They went to the lounge car to smoke. 
(getting up) 
I'll go find them; make sure they're not getting into any trouble. 
RUFUS 
I'm going to catch a few z's. Forgot how tiring living can be. 
Bethanv heads off Rufus looks out the window, then shuts his eyes. 
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT 
Bethany enters and spots jay and Silent Bob, talking to an unseen party. 
BETHANY 
You two aren't getting into any trouble, are you? 
JAY 
Nope. Just about to smoke a bowl with our new friends. You in? 
BETHANY 
And who are your new friends? 
JAY 
They just got in at the last stop. 
Silent Bob moves over, revealing the new friends. 
JAY 
This is Larry and Barry. 
Bartleby and Loki smile at Bethany. 
LOKI 
Jay tells us you're going to sleep with him. 
EXT TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT 
The train rushes over head. 
INT LOUNGE CAR - LATER 
Loki, Jay, and Silent Bob pass a joint under the table and take quick hits, trying to remain casual. Jay pounds the table happily. 
Bartleby and Bethany lay on either side of the table in their booth. 
BETHANY 
You can smoke up with them if you want. You don't have to keep me company. 
BARTLEBY 
It's a long trip. There'll be plenty of time later. 
(beat) 
So why are you heading to Jersey? 
BETRANY 
There's just this thing there I'm supposed to do. How about you? 
BARTLEBY 
We're going home. 
BETHANY 
Do you two live together? 
BARTLEBY 
Unfortunately. Do you live with those guys? 
B ETHANY 
God, no. Not they just sort of adopted me. 
BARTLEBY 
They're funny as hell. The big one never says a word. 
BETHANY 
I wish the little one would take a cue from him. But they're okay, as far as stoner's go. 
BARTLEBY 
Lo... Larry's taken an immediate shine to them, and he usually hates people. 
BETIIANY 
How long've you two been together? 
BARTLEBY 
Awhile. He's great company. He can be a little flaky sometimes, but we've got a lot in common. 
BETHANY 
How'd you meet? 
BARTLEBY 
We were stationed together. 
BETHANY 
See? That's beautiful. And everyone's always up-in-arms about this 'out-in-the-military' issue. 
BARTLEBY 
What do you mean? 
BETHANY 
Well there's all that macho bullshit about it being 'This Man's Army'. And you two meet and hook up while in the service, which is so special - because it's so hard to meet anyone you can seriously relate to... 
BARTLEBY 
(catches on) 
You think we're lovers?! Oh no. No, we're not gay. 
BETHANY 
(laughs) 
Oh God, I'm sorry'. I just assumed... 
BARTLEBY 
No. We live together and all, but at the end of the night, I go to my room. and he goes to his. 
(beat) 
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT 
Bethany and Bartleby talk further. Bartleby's intrigued. 
BETHANY 
I was told that I'm supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering the church. They're trying... 
(laughing) 
This sounds so stupid... They're trying to get back into Heaven. 
INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT 
Rufus passes through another car and opens the door at the end. 
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT 
Bartleby grows very tense. Bethany rattles on, half-toasted. 
BETHANY 
See, they got tossed out of Heaven years ago, right? And if they get back in, it proves God wrong. And since God is infallible, to prove Her wrong would... 
(laughing hard) 
..would unmake existence! I feel so stupid just saying it. 
Bartleby's eyes are wide. He looks scared. Then, a calm falls over him. 
BETRANY 
(laughing) 
But the thing I don't get... is how do I stop an angel? Two, even! I guess I'm supposed to talk them out of it or something. 
Bartleby surreptitiously slides a knife off the table. 
BARTLEBY 
Maybe you're supposed to kill them? 
Bethany breaks into hysterics. 
INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT 
Rufus pulls open another door and exits. 
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT 
Bethany's still cracking up, oblivious to the on-the-defensive Bartleby. 
BETHANY 
Oh yeah! Kill them! Even if that was the case... I mean. how do you kill an angel? 
BARTLEBY 
I don't imagine it's much different... 
(slowly lifts the knife) 
...from killing a human... 
The door behind them slides open. Rufus steps in. 
RUFUS 
Where the hell is everybody? I wake up, and... 
He sees Bartleby. They both freeze. 
BARTLEBY 
The Apostle! 
RUFUS 
Holy shit! 
BETHANY 
(stumbling to her feet) 
Rufus, I want you to meet my friend, Barry... 
Bartleby leaps out of the booth and grabs Bethany, holding the knife to her throat. 
BETHANY 
(chuckiing) 
Barry! Don't be such a show off! 
RUFUS 
Take it easy, Bartleby. Just let her go and let's talk about this. 
BARTLEBY 
After all this time, this is what it comes down to -slaughtered by this meat puppet?! 
RUFUS 
There doesn't have to be a slaughter. We can work this out... 
BETHANY 
Is that a knife? 
BARTLEBY 
Oh. we can work it out, alright. I'm going to work the blade in and out of her thorax! 
(calling over shoulder) 
Loki! 
Loki catches the action and reacts. 
LOKI 
Holy shit - the Apostle! 
He leaps from the table. Jay stirs and wakes up. 
jAY 
(half asleep) 
I didn't come in you, I swear... 
(looks around) 
Bartleby, with Bethany in hand, faces off against Rufus. Loki joins them. 
LOKI 
(to Rufus) 
What are you doing here? 
BARTLEBY 
They're here to thwart our journey home, my friend. This one just told me that she's supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering a church. 
LOKI 
You think she was talking about us? 
BARTLEBY 
I'd say there was a pretty good chance. What do you say, Rufus - we're to be liquidated? 
RUFUS 
It doesn't have to go down like that! You haven't thought about the consequences of re-entry! 
LOKI 
Consequences, schmonsequences. 
BARTLEBY 
I have to agree with him. No one - not you, and especially not this finite-lifer - no one is going to impede us. We're going home, regardless of whose pride it may hurt! 
RUFUS 
It's not a question of pride, it's... 
BARTLEBY 
Loki - kill the girl 
LOKI 
(beat) 
BARTLEBY 
Don't, my friend. Don't let your sympathies get the best of you, as they did me way back when. Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, our sins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul. 
LOKI 
That sounds thin. 
BARTLEBY 
Fine. We'll cover ourselves. We'll take out a slew of people. Maybe amidst the body count, He won't notice. 
LOKI 
Oh, that's being realistic. 
Bartleby reaches out and grabs Loki, slamming him against the wall. 
BARTLEBY 
I'm going home, Loki. And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is going to make that otherwise. 
Bartleby releases Loki and smiles. He exits. Loki watches him. 
LOKI 
Shit. 
He follows. 
EXT CAMP FIRE - NIGHT 
Another Newspaper headline regarding 'John Doe Jersey' fills the frame. It is lowered to reveal Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshift fire in the middle of nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads the paper. 
BETHANY 
I don't understand why we couldn't stay on the train. You threw those guys off. 
RUFUS 
A very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't be there. 
BETHANY 
And what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, for God's sake! 
JAY 
He had the knife at your throat. To gut you, he'd have to have the knife at your stomach. 
BETHANY 
Semantics! Semantics that don't even answer mv question. 
RUFUS 
Well, I know I'd perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy. 
BETHANY 
What do you mean, kill? I wasn't asked to kill them -just stop them from going into that church. 
RUFUS 
And how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo? 
BETHANY 
I've never killed anything before in my life! 
JAY 
I'll do it. 
RUFUS 
Shut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, let alone an angel. 
JAY 
Fuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy. 
RUFUS 
Oh yeah? How' would you do it? 
JAY 
I'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see that flick? 
RUFUS 
(ignoring jay; to Bethany) 
Killing an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off their wings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same as killing anything else - head or heart, take your pick. 
BETHANY 
You say it as if it's easy. 
RUFUS 
(oblivious to Jay) 
Problem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. All this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker - and those guys felt far from weak. Either that or someone's protecting them - someone with juice. 
BETHANY 
So then we're screwed? 
(shrugs) 
Shit, that's the best news l've heard in days. 
RUFUS 
This doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them. 
BETHANY 
Count me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - both psychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick back and wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctor ordered. 
JAY 
I'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die. 
RUFUS 
What are you babbling about now? 
JAY 
If I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go on living, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd be okay, because I know I'm not missing anything. 
BETHANY 
See? You know it's right when even he's making sense. 
JAY 
Besides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in like five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob. 
RUFUS 
So you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid? 
JAY 
(thinks) 
No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid. 
BETHANY 
Now that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finally know - why me? 
JAY 
Because you've got nice tits. 
BETHANY 
I wasn't talking to you! 
(to Rufus) 
Why me? Why do I have to do this? Nobody's come 
clean on that. Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet. How come I got tapped? 
Rufus looks at her. He shrugs. 
RUFUS 
Family ties. 
JAY 
RUFUS 
I think we're beyond euphemisms at this point. 
(to Bethany) 
God's a skee-ball fanatic. 
METATRON 
Let's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright? 
(to Bethany) 
Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years - He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quite understandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been proven as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what I understand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children. Isn't that sweet? 
BETHANY 
But She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you're getting at? 
METATRON 
(to Rufus) 
'She'? I take it she's met the Muse. 
(to Bethany) 
No, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her. 
RUFUS 
Maybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback. 
M ETAT RON 
No - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite well-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to be killed in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody knew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion - He's trapped in a body. 
RUFUS 
So God's not dead... 
JAY 
He's brain dead. 
METATRON 
So it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit that we're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people looking everywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able to smoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enough to send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves. 
RUFUS 
Can it be Lucifer? 
METATRON 
Thankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. I know they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd have made his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible for Bartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return as everyone else. 
RUFUS 
Then what about the Golgothan and the Triplets? 
METATRON 
Don't be stupid - demons aren't exclusive to Hell. Anybody can summon one. 
JAY 
(excited) 
Yeah? 
Silent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points. Jay reads. 
BETHANY 
Don't encourage them. And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as a test? 
METATRON 
No, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough - how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of God belonged on the back of a milk carton? 
RUFUS 
So what do we do now? 
M ETAT RON 
I say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas. 
JAY 
(off paper) 
Why don't we just ask this guy to close the church? 
METATRON 
I beg your pardon? 
JAY 
Here. 
(hands group the paper) 
BETHANY 
(reading) 
'Glick Takes Heat for Campaign'? 
JAY 
It's the guy in charge of the church thing. 
BETHANY 
(reading) 
'Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and questionable direction of his church-sanctioned 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign. When asked about his motivations for decommisioning the traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed Olympic sized lap-pools beneath parish floors, Click responded "Come on - who doesn't like a pool party?" 
JAY 
Maybe you could tell him to shut down the church. If it's closed on that day, those guys can't get blessed or whatever - right? 
METATRON 
Good Lord - he's got a point. 
BETHANY 
I think Silent Bob had a point. But sure - we can go to him and explain the situation somehow. 
RUFUS 
'We'? You're back in? 
BETHANY 
Well, mine is a heritage Divine... and I wouldn't want to let down the family. 
(smiles) 
METATRON 
(off Silent Bob) 
Well, well, well - the prophets finally live up to their titles. 
Silent Bob shrugs. Jay is trying to look down Serendipity's shirt. She back-hands him. 
TELEVISION SCREEN - COMMERCIAL 
Two cartoon ALTAR BOYS sift through their bowls of cereal. 
ALTAR 1 
The same boring cereal again? 
A cheesy CARTOON CHRIST floats down from above. 
CHRIST 
Man cannot live on boring cereal alone! 
ALTAR I & 2 
IT'S JESUS! 
Jesus pulls a box of HOSTIES cereal from his sash. 
CHRIST 
Why not try Hosties! 
CL on cereal pouring into a bowl. It's shaped like Eucharistic hosts. Milk follows. 
Tell them, Serendipity. Tell them how I was slighted by the Almighty. 
SERENDIPITY 
You got what you deserved, you yellow shithead. 
AZRAEL 
Ever the apple polisher. I'd hoped that when you left Paradise, you did it finally because you couldn't tolerate the injustice that was visited upon your own brother. 
BETHANY 
He's your brother?! 
SERENDIPITY 
Not technically. We were created at the same time. 
AZRAEL 
To compliment one another. Two spirits of pure inspiration. 
BARTLEBY 
So what happened? 
AZRAEL 
Yes. What. Lucifer got restless and started his little war for the throne. Heaven became divided into two factions - the faithful and the renegades. The ethereal planes were chaotic with battle, angel against angel. And when it was all over, Cod cast the rebels into perdition. 
SERENDIPITY 
But Azrael refused to fight. He wouldn't ally himself to God or Lucifer. He remained in the middle, waiting to see who came out victorious. 
JAY 
What are you - some kind of fucking chicken?! 
AZRAEL 
I was an artist! I was inspiration! A muse has no place in battle! Our job is to create - not destroy! 
SERENDIPITY 
So after the fallen were banished to Hell, God turned on those that wouldn't fight, and my brother here was sent down with the demons. Something he considers a grave injustice. 
AZRAEL 
Don't tell me that you never questioned the judgement, Serendipity; that you don't think the Almighty acted too rashly? 
SERENDIPITY 
You've been waiting for millions of years to ask me that, haven't you? It's been on your mind since the moment you fell. It's been gnawing at you this long. 
AZRAEL 
Well? 
SERENDIPITY 
No, Azrael. It never bothered me, and I'll tell you why: 
you stood behind your office, you prick. So you were an artist - big deal. Elvis was an artist, but that didn't stop him from joining the service in time of war. That's why he's the King... and you're a schmuck. 
BETHANY 
So all this is about revenge?! You're going to unmake existence because you have a grudge against God?! 
AZRAEL 
After the first million years, revenge was the farthest thing from my mind. Self-preservation became the only necessity. 
RUFUS 
Meaning? 
AZRAEL 
Escape. Escape from Hell became my all-consuming reason. So I studied the religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself; which flnallv did. in the form of the plenary indulgence And while I couldn't exercise it myself. I knew the perfect vessels through which I could free myself from torment. 
RUFUS 
Bartleby and Loki. 
AZRAEL 
After that, it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to celebrate their Centennial, and when that finally happened, applying some of the old inspiration tactics - bv sending the pair an article laced with ideas. An incantation I picked up in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heaven's radars, and aside from the Triplets and the Gologothan, no soul in Hell had a clue as to what was going on. 
(smiles) 
Won't proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the Power in a way he never dared or dreamed. 
(shakes it off) 
But no plan, no matter how intricate, could succeed if the Almighty was in the realm of the quick. So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious fashion. 
BETHANY 
How so? 
AZRAEL 
Oh no. I've seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal all the details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are to success. Suffice it to say, the Catholics have been even more helpful in insuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav. 
(gets up) 
The only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion. I'm amazed that someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the Lord's say-so. Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that train. But alas, here you are - powerless to stop the inevitable. 
BETHANY 
Look, asshole - I don't know if anyone explained the rules to you, but if you succeed, everything gets blinked out of existence - even you. 
AZRAEL 
(beat) 
Human, have you ever been to Hell? I think not. Do you know that once Hell was nothing more than the absence of Cod? And if you'd ever been in His presence. then you'd realize that's punishment enough. But then your kind came along - and made it so much worse. 
BETHANY 
Humans aren't capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like yourself is. 
AZRAEL 
Evil is an abstract; it's a human construct. But true to his irresponsible nature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames his dark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enough for him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt - fire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get out of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you commit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a foundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. So you bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sickness that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there, begging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold and solitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhaling the decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrors have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg. 
(beat) 
Would you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look... 
Azrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes. For about ten seconds, we see some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into 240 frames of film. 
Azrael pulls his hand away. Bethany is fried, convulsing uncontrolably. 
AZRAEL 
I'd rather not exist than go back to that. And if everyone has to go down with me, so be it. 
SERENDIPITY 
(holding up Bethany) 
You're still thinking only about yourself, you fuckmg child. 
AZRAEL 
Now, now, now. Things are getting too tense in here. What say we watch a little t.v. 
(grabs remote control) 
JAY 
Put on channel nine - 'Davey and Goliath'! 
A Stygian Triplet smacks him with it's hockey stick. 
JAY 
Hey! 
AZRAEL 
I was thinking more along the lines of current events. 
On the T.V. - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera, obscuring the chaos behind him. Screams are heard. 
REPORTER 
...I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St. Michael's... Bullets don't seem to affect them... police who were on the scene are dead... The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees, identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse.. I'm not a man of faith, but I'm inclined to agree with them.. 
(looking OC) 
NO! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!! 
(pulls gun) 
PLEASE!! Please... 
RUFUS 
They could already be in the church. 
SERENDIPITY 
Which means that if they come out, nobody touches them. 
JAY 
Are you shitting me? The brother here is going to shred them with his Schwarzenneger special - ain't you, homey? 
SERENDIPITY 
If they've passed through that arch, they come out clean. And if they die, they go straight up - and we know what happens then. 
JAY 
What if they just kill themselves? 
BETHANY 
They can't - it's a mortal sin. You die with a mortal sin on your soul and you burn. They'd go to hell, and that's not what they're after. 
JAY 
So then what the fuck are we supposed to do?! Just wait for a solution to fall out of the sky?! 
On cue, a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the group, quite like Rufus had, way back at the start. This body, however, bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height. Jay looks at Rufus. 
JAY 
Friend of your's? 
RUFUS 
'fraid not. 
OC VOICE 
It was a Cardinal. 
They all turn to see Loki, leaning against a body or two, drinking from a bottle of champagne. His wings lie beside him, filthy - blood spattered and ashen. He looks exhausted. Rufus trains the gun on him. 
LOKI 
Kind of hard to tell with his face like that, but the Rosaries are a dead giveaway. 
JAY 
(goes for the Uzi) 
IT'S ONE OF THEM!! KILL IT!!! 
BETHANY 
(struggling to stop him) 
NO...! 
She slaps the Uzi out of Jay's grip. It clatters to the side. 
BETHANY 
(to Jay) 
Don't you listen?! We can't touch them! 
JAY 
I wasn't gonna touch him, I was gonna shoot him! 
LOKI 
(looking skyward) 
He's been at it for awhile now. 
In the distance above - a mere shadow against the sky - something winged soars and stops, releasing what looks like a very panicky human being. 
OC LOKI 
We ran out of parishoners, so he just started picking up anyone off the street. You're looking at eons of repression getting purged. If only we'd been able to jerk off. 
Loki drags himself a few feet backwards. 
LOKI 
I'd step back if I were you. 
They jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes. Bethany charges at Loki, grabs his lapels, and shakes him furiously. 
BETHANY 
WHY?!? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU HOPE TO PROVE?!? ALL THESE PEOPLE - WHY?!? 
JAY 
(to Rufus) 
I thought we weren't supposed to touch them? 
RUFUS 
I think our Bethan's about hit her ceiling. 
Loki slaps Bethany away, non-chalantly. 
LOKI 
This wasn't my idea. alright? I just wanted to go home. 
(takes a big champagne swig) 
We both wanted to go home. But he snapped. When he realized who you were and what you'd have to do, he just lost it. 
(smiles) 
You know what's funny about it? He never could stand to see me work. He said he always felt son~' for you people - that you didn't know any better. 
(looks up) 
Now look at him. 
JAY 
This guy's drunker than hell. 
SERENDIPITY 
Which means he's human now - his wings have been cut off. 
(slapping Loki to sober him up) 
Loki! Loki! 
LOKI 
(recognizing her) 
The Muse. Haven't seen you in a long time. What's with the tits? 
SERENDIPITY 
Loki - have you walked through the arch yet? C'mon. tell me! Have you gone in and come out through the archway yet?! 
VOICE 
No. 
Bartleby lands beside them, draping his wings at his sides, brushing himself off. 
BARTLEBY 
We were awaiting your arrival. 
SERENDIPITY 
Bartleby - listen to me! You can't go through with this! Azrael was just using you! If you go back this way... 
Bartleby slaps her down. 
BARTLEBY 
I've become aware of the reprocussions, Muse. I know what I'm doing. 
Bethany leaps at him, all fists and fury. 
BETHANY 
YOU FUCK! YOU SICK, TWISTED FUCK!! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! LOOK AT All you've 
done...! 
Bartleby subdues her. He strokes her hair. 
BARTLEBY

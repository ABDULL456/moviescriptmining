Gothika by Sebastian Gutierrez 
REVISED SECOND DRAFT 
December 8, 2002 
The Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian. 
FADE IN: 
OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS: 
INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN 
PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it. Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30, sharp and prettier than she knows. 
INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING 
Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on, goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself in a towel. 
INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING 
Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast. Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM. 
EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps. Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers. Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives off. 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR 
Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the wall: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
"WOODWARD FORENSIC INSTITUTE" 
The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we... 
INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING 
Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session: 
MIRANDA 
This is your stepfather who came to visit you? 
CHLOE 
My stepfather?  No.   He's dead. (beat) I killed him. Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough. Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist. 
MIRANDA 
That's the first time you admit it. 
CHLOE 
So? There's a first time for everything. 
MIRANDA 
(jotting this down) It means you're finally past the denial stage. This is good, Chloe. 
CHLOE 
I never killed anyone who didn't deserve it. 
MIRANDA 
You only killed your stepfather as far as I know. 
CHLOE 
I should've taken care of my mother. She knew all along.    You remind me of her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
I remind you of your mother? 
CHLOE 
Always so put together. Like you iron your underwear. Like your pussy is the apricot of the Promised Land and the bread of the -- 
MIRANDA 
(getting her back on track) Let's get back to your visitor last night. 
CHLOE 
The Devil. 
MIRANDA 
Alright, the Devil. Why would the Devil visit you? It's already hell in here, what would he have to gain? 
PARSONS 
Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to set that dinner with you and Doug. Are you free tonight? 
MIRANDA 
He's stuck at a school board meeting. Parsons looks through his appointment book. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PARSONS 
You've been here a year already, Dorothy's starting to take this personal. How's next Wednesday? 
MIRANDA 
Next Wednesday it is, Phil. He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone call. 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT 
Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind. A GUARD waves her off. 
END OPENING CREDITS. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road. EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her down. 
INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
SHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over. 
MIRANDA 
Anybody hurt, Sheriff? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Nah, telephone post just decided to fall. It'll take us a while to clear this up so I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the long way home, Miranda. 
MIRANDA 
If you say so. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
And tell your husband he owes me a phone call. 
MIRANDA 
Will do. Wouldn't want him in trouble with the authorities. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHERIFF RYAN 
That a girl. The law never sleeps and all that. You take care now. 
He taps on her hood and heads back to the site.      She shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn. 
EXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT 
Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge. Something definitely creepy about this deserted place -- 
INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING 
Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the machine. 
MIRANDA 
(into phone) Hi, it's me. Are you there? Pick up, pick up. I'm on my way but I just got detoured so I'm... A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up we see: 
POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us.      Naked. About to get pummelled by us. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing. METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT -- She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out of it. 
MIRANDA 
(into phone) Stay on the line. Don't go anywhere. The weirdest thing just -- (the phone cuts out) Hello? Hello? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She stares at the dead phone.      Punches the buttons on it. No go. 
MIRANDA 
Wonderful. She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car. 
EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT 
Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not moving. Just standing there. Her back to us. 
MIRANDA 
(nods at nurse) Fifty milligrams. 
MIRANDA 
Jesus Christ, you're gonna knock me out? Ten milligrams. 
PETE 
(final offer) Twenty. The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying desperately to put this into some kind of perspective. 
MIRANDA 
How would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell, dressed like this? 
PETE 
We can discuss it at length after you take your meds. Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant. Pete holds Miranda's gaze. Miranda takes her meds. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
Okay.    This better be good. Pete motions for the others to leave them alone.         One by one they file out and lock the door behind them. 
INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - LATER 
Miranda paces.       Alone with Pete, she is even more upset. 
PETE 
Miranda, this is very awkward. Technically I shouldn't even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until you're transferred. So whatever is said here won't leave this room. I won't tell Parsons, I won't tell anyone. 
MIRANDA 
I want to talk to my husband. 
PETE 
You can't to that. Sit down, please. Try to relax. 
MIRANDA 
Why would I pretend to be in any way relaxed? 
PETE 
I understand you're upset. But we need to put some things in order. 
MIRANDA 
Two massive understatements. He hesitates, unsure where to begin. 
PETE 
How long have you been here? 
MIRANDA 
(laughs) What is this? Why are you doing this to me? 
PETE 
Just answer the question.    Humor me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a psychiatrist. I transferred here to the Woodward Forensic Institute a little over a year ago. My job entails dealing with a ward of schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-fife -- 
PETE 
I don't mean how long you've worked here, I mean how long you've been staying here. This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer. 
MIRANDA 
I'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical school just an elaborate dream? 
PETE 
Of course you're a doctor. A great doctor in fact. The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her. 
MIRANDA 
Pete, how long have I been here? 
PETE 
Five days. 
MIRANDA 
(barely audible) What? 
PETE 
You were admitted to the neurosurgical unit seizing violently. That lasted three days. Scans revealed left-sided weakness, numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits. Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we -- 
FLASHBACK - INT. NEUROSURGICAL UNIT 
FLASH CUT TO: 
EXTREME CLOSEUP - MIRANDA'S EYE 
Jittery, alert. We scour her every blood vessel, iris, pupil. FILLING the SCREEN and now we distinctly make out an eerie shape reflected inside of it. But just for a sec -- The teenage girl. 
PETE (V.O.) 
What about your husband, what can you tell me about him? 
INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) 
Miranda shakes the puzzling images out of her head: 
MIRANDA 
Excuse me? 
PETE 
What's the last memory you have of him that night? 
MIRANDA 
My last -- ? (frowns) Tell me nothing happened to Doug. 
PETE 
Let's backtrack a second. You left your office, you were driving home, you got detoured by the police -- Did you call someone on the phone that night? 
MIRANDA 
I don't know.    I might have. 
PETE 
Who would you call? 
MIRANDA 
I might have called Doug to tell him something. Or checked my answering service. 
PETE 
Were you seeing someone else that night? 
MIRANDA 
I beg your pardon? 
PETE 
There was some trouble in your marriage, wasn't there? 
MIRANDA 
Of course not. She shakes her head emphatically as we: 
FLASH CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK - INT. LOFT - NIGHT 
CAMERA PANS ACROSS the large space to find Miranda and a MAN (whose face we don't see) kissing heatedly. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETE (V.O.) 
Wasn't there? 
INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) 
Miranda chases the disconcerting image out of her head. 
MIRANDA 
No. There was no trouble in my marriage, I don't know what -- (stops herself) There is no trouble in my marriage. You just used the past tense; why? His face says he doesn't know how to tell her. 
MIRANDA 
Did something happen to Doug? 
PETE 
You don't remember anything else. Anything at all? Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to dial: 
MIRANDA 
This is preposterous.    What's wrong with Doug? 
PETE 
He's dead. This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he will contradict his statement. 
MIRANDA 
No, he's not. Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that. (sickened) Are you -- sure? 
PETE 
I'm positive. (painful beat) You killed him. 
CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE 
Another near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains. 
EXT. CHAPEL - DAY 
Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a handkerchief. 
INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand, noticing the blood -- and now we are back in -- 
INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT) 
Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched. We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and bangs on the door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
Can I get some assistance here? Hello?! 
She waits.     Bangs on the door again. 
MIRANDA 
Irene?!   Anybody!? A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING. A light is switched on down the corridor. The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER... Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES it. Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens. Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and peeks -- The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda jumps back, screams. And when she looks up again, the image is gone.      A beat. Rational thought kicking in -- 
MIRANDA 
(to self) Wake up, wake up... (beat) You're dreaming. It's not real. An anxiety dream, that's all. That's all. This is dream logic. If it was real, they would have heard you scream. There are twenty employees on the night shift. Fact. At least twenty. She props herself with her back against the wall. With a view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the door. 
MIRANDA 
I'm just dreaming. And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like before. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. 
Like her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter -- 
MIRANDA 
(voice rising) I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming -- And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are hit with the sudden glare of returning light. EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS -- 
IRENE (O.S.) 
Rise and shine, ladies! 
INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY 
Irene tries to shake Miranda awake.       An orderly and nurse stand by. 
IRENE 
(shaking her) That means you, honey.   Up -- ! No reaction. 
IRENE 
Rise and shine now.    Wake up. She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl did. 
IRENE 
Easy now, it's okay. Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak but has no voice. Clears her throat -- 
MIRANDA 
I need to see Peter Graham. 
IRENE 
And you have a session scheduled this afternoon -- 
MIRANDA 
Right now. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
IRENE 
He's not even in yet, now let go my arm, honey. 
MIRANDA 
Doctor Grey, if you don't mind. 
IRENE 
Actually I do mind. I start calling you 'doctor' and everybody else wants to be called 'doctor' -- 
MIRANDA 
It means they wouldn't have let me treat you if they thought I had any kind of involvement in what happened. 
MIRANDA 
And did you? 
PETE 
Did I what? 
MIRANDA 
Did I make it to your place?   Did I see you that night? 
PETE 
No. We got disconnected and I couldn't get through to you. I sat there waiting all night. Figured you'd changed your mind. 
MIRANDA 
Why didn't you tell me this before? 
PETE 
Because the only way you'll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own. My job is to assist you in processing that information because you're not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She stares at him.     Queasy. 
MIRANDA 
You're changing the subject. 
PETE 
The subject is you don't trust me. 
MIRANDA 
Right now I don't trust anyone. She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged arm. 
PETE 
You want to talk about today? She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head. Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare: 
MIRANDA 
I want to talk to my lawyer. 
PETE 
I think that's premature. 
MIRANDA 
I can't help what you think. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY 
SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered to her: 
JENNA 
You a Marlboro girl? Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun. 
MIRANDA 
I don't smoke, thanks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNA 
All we have is our health, cupcake. (sits beside her) What I do is quit constantly, start again. Drives them all crazy. One day I quit three times. 
MIRANDA 
Huh. Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly. Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna rambles on. 
JENNA 
They allow me one match at a time and pretend they're not watching. Check it out: salivating goon number one at three o'clock, oh- so-inconspicuous goon number two at five o'clock. Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being closely watched by two orderlies. 
MIRANDA 
What did you set on fire to wind up here? 
JENNA 
Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt down the building where I worked. I found a baby at the doorstep, called the cops -- of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed. It's beside the point, really. Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She rises -- 
MIRANDA 
Phil. He keeps walking.     Headed to the parking lot beyond. 
You wanna help me? You pity me? (grabbing her crotch) Suck me. The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd. Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her manner says she just wants to get back to her duties. Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they were doing. Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd. 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY TO NIGHT (TIME LAPSE 
PHOTOGRAPHY SHOTS) 
A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH -- 
INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR 
SLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors.      The air thick with dread -- 
INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT 
Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
As before, somebody seems to be watching her. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
INT. WOODWARD LIBRARY - DAY 
Irene escorts Miranda into the library.       A warden follows. 
IRENE 
How are we feeling today? 
MIRANDA 
'We'? 
IRENE 
Sorry I asked. 
MIRANDA 
Doesn't seem like the best choice of words when treating schizophrenics. 
IRENE 
Fitting right in, aren't you? The library is pretty    much empty at this hour except for the LIBRARIAN and the    odd janitor tidying up. An efficient-looking man    rises from a desk, briefcase in place, glass of water    -- this is attorney THEODORE 
"TEDDY" HOWARD. 
TEDDY HOWARD 
Miranda. 
MIRANDA 
Hi. Irene checks her watch.       The warden hangs back, keeping watch. 
IRENE 
She's due back in the rec room in twenty, Counselor. 
TEDDY HOWARD 
Thank you kindly. Miranda sits.      Waits until Irene is out of hearing range. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
Teddy, I know you knew Doug well and this is an extremely -- 
TEDDY HOWARD 
I'm here as your lawyer. So whatever my relationship was with Doug is no longer of consequence. First things first, how are they treating you? 
MIRANDA 
Like I'm crazy. 
TEDDY HOWARD 
You know this place better than anyone. Anything out of the ordinary? 
MIRANDA 
Other than me being crazy?   No. 
TEDDY HOWARD 
The DA is pushing for a hearing as soon as next week. They're eager to resolve this situation because -- well, crimes like this don't happen that often around here. Doug was a hometown boy who'd done good, beloved high school principal, a role model. Our best shot -- scratch that, our only shot -- is to claim temporary insanity. As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy bandage. 
MIRANDA 
Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you know me. I wouldn't raise a hand at my husband for the life of me. Not even in self-defense. Isn't it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some crazed high school student attacked Doug and I went into shock? Teddy shakes his head. 
MIRANDA 
You're telling me there's no other suspects in anyone's mind? 
PETE 
Is this a hallucination? 
MIRANDA 
You tell me. But I do know what I sound like. Paranoia is the ultimate awareness, right? 
PETE 
Which is why I suggest we simply increase your dose until -- 
MIRANDA 
(venom) No!   Goddamnit! No! He steps back at her blowout. She catches the look on his face and forces herself to sit down. 
MIRANDA 
I'm sorry. Is there any way we can pretend that didn't just happen? 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) 
(beat; struggling) I want to believe you. I do. So I'll take your word for it -- you're not involved in this -- but you take mine: I didn't write this and I didn't kill my husband. He studies her.     Finally nods.   New tactic: 
PETE 
Alright. Let's say you didn't write this -- 
MIRANDA 
Number one: I'm right-handed. Number two: I would have had to bring an X-Acto knife into the shower to do this, wouldn't I? Pete tries to reserve judgment. Her argument has a certain loopy logic to it. He hesitates, then pulls a SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope. 
PETE 
I think it's time you look at these. Miranda looks at the crime scene photos. Lurid. Terrible. Here's part of Doug's body. Here's the axe. And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words on it. In blood, a la Manson family. And it says: 
"NOT ALONE." 
Miranda immediately tosses it away from her.      Repulsed -- 
FLASH CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it. 
INT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) 
PETE 
You wrote that. Any idea why? 
MIRANDA 
(panic rising) No, I didn't. No, I didn't! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it up for her to study again. 
PETE 
You're the only person who can figure out what this means. Try to remember. Stop holding back. She nods meekly. Staring at the picture. Begins to shake as all of it finally comes flooding in -- 
FLASH CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles. Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands. Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA. Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in the mirror over the mantel and stares -- WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there, beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up at: 
THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA 
shows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.) Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment -- When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it. 
INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER 
Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at the marks on the door handle, towels and wall. 
Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming back to her body and realizing what she's done, she slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the tub. Crying. Shaking.     She shuts her eyes as hard as she can to make it all go away, and we -- 
FADE TO BLACK. 
BLACKNESS 
Silence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES. 
FADE IN: 
INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Miranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know. But at some point she must have turned off the water. She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked with blood. The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul, the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of blood, mortified at what she will find. 
INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air. Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front door. She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete Graham behind them. 
Teddy Howard is top notch. He's going to do everything in his power -- and he's quite resourceful -- to prove you're not fit to stand trial. Miranda, I know you have no family left, so we're your family now and we're all going down to the wire to protect you and help you in any way we -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PUSH IN ON Miranda who stares intently at something on the desk. Not listening to a word he's saying -- 
MIRANDA 
Who is that? Parsons pauses here.      Exchanges glances with Pete. 
PARSONS 
Excuse me? 
MIRANDA 
The girl in the picture. WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on the desk is now FACING us. Eerie. It shows Parsons, his wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl. 
PARSONS 
My daughter. Miranda looks up at this, perplexed. 
MIRANDA 
She's the girl I saw. 
PARSONS 
You're obviously mistaken. 
MIRANDA 
I'm positive. She was hurt, bleeding. Is she all right? Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks. 
PETE 
Miranda, you've seen that photograph at least a dozen times, every time you've been in this office. You're just confused -- 
MIRANDA 
Not about this. Is she all right? 
PARSONS 
No, she's not... all right. (beat) Rachel committed suicide six years ago. This shuts Miranda right up.      Mind spinning. 
MIRANDA 
How? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETE 
Miranda, that's none of your -- 
PARSONS 
That's okay. (to Miranda) Rachel was a very troubled girl. Handicapped since birth. She was born mute. My wife and I tried everything to help her fit in but... but she ran away from home more than once, wanting to end her life. (beat) And she finally succeeded. Jumped off Ashley Bridge. She was only seventeen years old. Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here. She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full well what even her suggestion of it will sound like. 
MIRANDA 
I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Phil. Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore.    Rises. 
PARSONS 
Peter, can I speak to you? The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her paranoia -- 
PETE (O.S.) 
... Textbook psychotic pattern... manifestation of guilt... 
PARSONS (O.S.) 
... much she knows about Rachel? 
PETE (O.S.) 
I'm telling you she doesn't... Concocted alternate reality... 
PARSONS (O.S.) 
I'm trusting you... crawling with cops. A DARK SHADOW envelops Miranda's confused face, as we -- 
INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT 
Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes, looks this way and that, then closes them again. She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall. Squinting to cover every inch of the room. And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner. Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined. She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it. She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING LOUDER as she reaches the shadow -- She stretches out her hand and finally touches... NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling stupid. 
MIRANDA 
This is not going to work. I'm sick of being watched, and I know this place well and it doesn't smell this bad. She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head. 
MIRANDA 
I'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm alive -- this is not some afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called paranormal activity can be debunked a million different ways. So whatever you are, whatever it is I'm making up here -- I'm letting you go, I'm setting you free. I'm the wrong person. And I need to sleep. I'm not afraid and I don't believe and I'm fully aware that this is all in my mind -- fiction -- a concocted alternate reality -- and I acknowledge it. And now I'm done with it. I'm going to sleep now. The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And now she climbs back in bed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
INT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR 
Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency exit door all the way at the end. TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase, shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their cells, awakened by the COMMOTION. Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty feet, fifteen, ten -- When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and pins her down. The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down -- 
MIRANDA 
It's him! It's him! Jesus Christ, it's him! The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and we -- 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
TRACKING ALONG a long desk where the staff finish their morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and Irene among others. 
PARSONS 
We've transferred her to a higher security room on the fifth floor. That's my final concession to any type of special treatment. 
PETE 
And the night staff? 
IRENE 
They insist her room was properly locked, what else could they say? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETE 
Could there be any truth to her claim? 
PARSONS 
Peter, we have one hundred and forty employees. Thirty-five work maintenance. They all wear yellow shirts, it's their uniform. I'm holding a very discreet inquiry, sure -- but I don't want a news van parked outside day and night. It makes much more sense that she tried to escape and got caught, doesn't it? Pete ponders this.     It certainly seems that way. 
PETE 
I perused Miranda's files on Chloe McGrath -- they're damn comprehensive. Maybe she was a bit obsessed with her. Irene and Parsons share a look.     He wraps it up: 
PARSONS 
The scariest gift God gave us is our minds. And a bright person like Miranda -- she's grasping at straws here -- who knows what her brain is telling her, now that it's snapped. 
INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - DAY 
A better room, in fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars on the windows, but still. Miranda paces. Pete is seated, observing her deteriorating state. 
MIRANDA 
Did you live here when Rachel killed herself? 
PETE 
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was part of the search party that found the body. 
MIRANDA 
Phil must have been a wreck. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETE 
You can imagine. Actually, Phil was in Houston undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened. 
What was that?     Miranda reacts to this. 
MIRANDA 
And this is confirmed. There are hospital records and so forth? 
PETE 
I'm sure there are.   Can we get back on track now? Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket. 
MIRANDA 
What about these other dates, was Phil here when the other girls went missing and found dead? A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and Jenny Dixon. 
PETE 
Where are you going with this? First I'm a suspect in Doug's death, now what, Phil Parsons murdered his own daughter? 
MIRANDA 
Rachel Parsons disappeared six years ago. A week later she's a suicide. Andrew White, four years ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon, two years ago. Don't you find that unusual? He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article: 
PETE 
What same M.O.? One jumped off a bridge, one hung herself and one crashed her car. Who gave you this? 
MIRANDA 
Not one left a suicide note. In fact, how is anybody sure these were suicides? 
(CONTINUED) 
Hold it, Simon! He hides the loot behind his back, busted.       She holds the door open and tosses him his yellow shirt. 
CLAIRE 
What do you think I am, laundry service? 
SIMON 
(relieved) Won't happen again, ma'am. She turns and exits.     The doors slide shut.   Meet our rapist. 
INT. WOODWARD CAFETERIA - DAY 
Bustling with activity. The room is divided into two:          a large main area where the patients eat, plus a second, smaller upstairs area for the staff. BOOM DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table. Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. Jenna taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene keeps watch nearby. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELLEY 
... She'd get high on glue and make me help her try on my bras. Is that the strangest shit you've heard? 
JENNA 
Heard stranger. But she's a case. 
SHELLEY 
And she always put on a happy face. Man, what an optometrist. Optometrist?     Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it go. 
JENNA 
You narced her out, didn't you? Boo-hoo. Bet you were a little buzzed yourself. Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of conversations and comes to rest on Chloe. Alone at another table. Heavily sedated. A wreck. Miranda rises and walks over. Shelley waits until she's out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna -- 
SHELLEY 
All work, that woman.   Work, work, work. 
JENNA 
What are you talking about? 
SHELLEY 
She's like an alcoholic.   But with work. 
JENNA 
What work? 
SHELLEY 
Not safe to tell you.   Wish I could. Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food. 
UPSTAIRS 
Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe and starts talking. From Parson's POV up above we can see pretty much the entire dining area. 
BACK TO MIRANDA 
Trying to get Chloe's attention. But Chloe just stares at her untouched food, glassy-eyed. 
MIRANDA 
I saw what happened. I'm sorry. No reaction. 
MIRANDA 
Have you told anyone?   Chloe? Nothing. 
MIRANDA 
Look, Chloe -- the person who did this to you is not the devil. And if you can identify him, I'll make sure the motherfucker is arrested. Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers. 
CHLOE 
Doctor, did you just say 'motherfucker'? 
MIRANDA 
Do you know his name? Maybe you saw a nametag on his uniform? Think. Chloe simply stares.    Finally shakes her head. 
CHLOE 
Man, you must really hate me. 
MIRANDA 
What?   I don't hate you. 
CHLOE 
You hate me because now you're just the same as me. You must feel so embarrassed. 
MIRANDA 
I don't hate you. And I don't feel embarrassed. 
CHLOE 
That's just a pat answer you have because you're new at this. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. 
(CONTINUED) 
EXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY 
A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.       Phil Parsons and Pete step out, rush inside. 
INT. HOSPITAL ER - MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his case -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Mr. Howard -- let me simply list the events your client was involved in last night. First she drugs a janitor, steals his car and escapes a mental institution -- 
TEDDY HOWARD 
Hold on, there isn't even any substantial evidence -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink to wash his hands -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence because the overdosed janitor hasn't woken up, that's why -- and when your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a full syringe of -- 
TEDDY HOWARD 
(handing him a paper towel) You had no right to question my client without my presence -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom. Your client was read her rights and she still insisted -- 
TEDDY HOWARD 
-- Let me ask you this, Sheriff: what exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my client's cell? And is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself before my client -- Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to the waiting room, Teddy following closely -- 
INT. ER WAITING ROOM 
Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of coffee. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply stating the frigging facts. Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Phil, thank God -- this guy's driving me nuts! 
PARSONS 
What happened? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHERIFF RYAN 
An 'incident' -- for lack of a better frigging word -- involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she'll even utter another word. 
PETE 
Who's the girl? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
A runaway from Portland, Tracy Marie Seaver. Reported missing a couple weeks ago. We found Miss Grey in some barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up. I'm just now waiting for the surgeon to give me an update. (to Teddy) Notice, Counselor, how I'm not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer. Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to Turlington. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Christ, the woman's got the entire hospital busy -- Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Why are you harassing my deputies? 
TEDDY HOWARD 
I'm only asking him where he got the coffee -- ? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
He's not at liberty to answer that. You've had enough goddamn coffee already. The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to the water cooler where they can talk more privately. 
PETE 
We need to get Miranda back to the institute. She needs psychiatric care, not a prison cell. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Parsons nods, lost in thought.        Sheriff Ryan returns. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Phil, how well does your wife know the suspect? 
PARSONS 
Why do you ask? 
Yes, I -- you could say that. Consuelo holds Miranda's hands firmly, "reading" her. 
CONSUELO 
She's very, very angry. And she's not finished with you yet. 
MIRANDA 
I'm sure that's meant to sound comforting but -- 
CONSUELO 
She wants to show you something. 
MIRANDA 
That may be so, but I want her to go away. 
CONSUELO 
Then you need to protect yourself. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
And how exactly would I do that? 
CONSUELO 
Mira, first I'm gonna bring you some cascarilla, it's a powder, you get it anyplace, it comes from eggs -- you pour it all over you -- (indicates) Like this -- 
MIRANDA 
Look -- (reading nametag) Consuelo, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I honestly don't think this ghost will go away if I pour some egg powder on myself -- Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda.      She's receiving something here. Shudders. 
CONSUELO 
She made you do things.   Bad things, didn't she? 
MIRANDA 
Yes. 
CONSUELO 
And you carried this out for her. She used you as a vessel... Consuelo's grip tightens on Miranda as we -- 
FLASH CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK - EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT 
We're back at the bridge.     Rachel pries open Miranda's mouth. Miranda panics: 
MIRANDA 
What are you doing? I'm trying to help you -- ?! Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds. And now we see it. Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH -- 
INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) 
Consuelo lets go of Miranda's hand. Like recoiling from fire. Speaks in the simplest of ways. The truth: 
CONSUELO 
You were possessed by her. 
MIRANDA 
Yes. 
CONSUELO 
Ay, probrecita. You're both in terrible danger. She's scared too but she can't step back into the light until she finishes what she started here. And now you're the only person who can help her find the way back. 
MIRANDA 
I don't know how to do that -- I'm not qualified for it. You do it. Consuelo crosses herself. A sign of respect for the situation. But it has a chilling effect on Miranda. 
CONSUELO 
Despair is the only unforgivable sin. You'll be in my prayers, Miranda. Prayers?   What good is that going to do?   Consuelo exits. 
EXT. PARSONS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
Two POLICE CRUISERS parked outside. 
INT. PARSONS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A glassy-eyed Phil Parsons serves himself another Scotch, devastated. The SHOT is FRAMED so that we see the bedroom door is open, Dorothy lying in bed, heavily tranquilized. Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs. 
ON THE LURID POLAROIDS 
Postcards from hell: scared teenage girls in forced poses -- gagged, tortured -- Andrea White, Jenny Dixon, Tracy Seaver... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
And young Rachel Parsons. 
PARSONS 
INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - STAIRS - SAME TIME 
The two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs. 
INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME 
Miranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough, somebody else is in the room. She looks around. 
MIRANDA 
No.   No.   What do you want -- ? And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards her. 
MIRANDA 
I've done everything you've asked me to. My life is ruined. I can't take this anymore. I can't... (faintly) You have to step into the light, Rachel. You don't belong here -- you don't belong... But it doesn't work. Rachel keeps walking towards her. Miranda backs up against the wall. Trapped. Fighting tears -- 
MIRANDA 
Into the light -- (loudly) Can somebody come in here?       I need help. Somebody, please! 
INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DIFFERENT FLOOR - STAIRS - 
SAME TIME 
The cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights down the corridor. They walk towards them. 
IRENE 
And who are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OFFICER TURLINGTON 
Officer Turlington, ma'am. We're supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey's cell all night. 
IRENE 
Knock yourself out. Next floor up. (loudly) It's only a power outage, ladies -- let's call it an early night. The cops head down the corridor. 
INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME 
Rachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face -- 
MIRANDA 
Please don't. Why are you doing this? It's over. Over and done! Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on Miranda's eyes and shuts them -- 
FLASH CUT TO: 
MIRANDA'S VISION - ANDREA WHITE 
in her school uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her half-naked, bruised. Dead. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
JENNY DIXON 
staring AT us in her school uniform. Now abruptly she is a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also bathed in the strange red and blue light -- 
END OF MIRANDA'S VISION. 
INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Miranda screams at the visions.    Rachel holds her steady. 
MIRANDA 
Stop it! I don't want to see this! I can't help you anymore! Stop it! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Now a heavy RATTLING makes her turn to the door. One of the HINGES has SHATTERED and the latch itself is half- pulled from the doorframe. Relentless POUNDING on the other side. 
MIRANDA 
Let me out of here! Let me out! There's a deafening SOUND like a thousand bells ringing at once and Miranda covers her ears -- Outside WE HEAR MURMURS, YELLS, INSTRUCTIONS -- 
INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR 
The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung open. Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK, flashlights beam and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to escape. 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT 
FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush after her. 
INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE 
Sheriff Ryan makes his way through the mayhem, past Irene helping a patient, past nurse Claire cowering in a corner -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Christ Almighty. Sheriff Ryan hits the stairs. 
INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR 
Officer Turlington runs down the corridor, searching frantically with his flashlight -- 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT 
Do it quick.   I won't make fun of you. The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes her glance up. She trains her flashlight at the second level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover. 
CHLOE 
Nobody better fucking move up there or I'll blow this piggy's head off! Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section. Catches the reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table. 
CHLOE 
That means you, fucko. Up on your feet or I'll start by shooting his ear off. A beat.   Officer Turlington rises.      Slow and deliberate. 
CHLOE 
(to Sheriff, sotto) Tell junior the grownups are talking now and he's not allowed in here. Do it. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Turlington, it's alright. I can -- I'm just going to -- 
CHLOE 
The grownups are talking.   Don't paraphrase me. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
The grownups are -- are talking now. Just leave. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A voice startles Chloe from behind, at floor level. 
MIRANDA 
Chloe?   Can I talk to you? 
Chloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door. 
CHLOE 
Dreadful timing, I'm real busy. 
MIRANDA 
You have to let him go.   I'm sorry. Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is affecting her. She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style -- 
CHLOE 
Look -- let's not confuse things. I like you. But this is my only chance. (to Sheriff) Now take off that goddamn uniform before I get really pissed. The Sheriff glances at Miranda. Miranda nods.       The Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt -- 
MIRANDA 
What are you going to do? Put on his uniform and walk out of here? Think about it, Chloe. They know you have him. The place is crawling with cops. 
CHLOE 
What are my options? To grow old in this place? It's clear they will never let me go. Never. Ever. 
MIRANDA 
That's not true. You have less than a year left here. 
CHLOE 
That's a lie! I'll never stop being sick, they'll just find something new that's wrong with me. No wonder you doctors can't help anyone -- all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we're missing! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She starts sobbing.     Letting everything go -- 
MIRANDA 
You're right, doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of. But I know you, Chloe, you've been through things that most people don't survive. And you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it. It's up to you. This gets through to Chloe.       Her grip loosens on the gun. 
MIRANDA 
No more guilt, no more hatred, no more unbearable sadness. You have no use for any of that anymore. Your life begins this very second. 
CHLOE 
I'm so tired.    So goddamn tired -- Miranda walks over and embraces her.       Chloe hands her the gun. And that's when the power returns. Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO 
LIFE. 
Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea White and Jenny Dixon visions. Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the Sheriff, finally struck with the realization: 
MIRANDA 
It was you, wasn't it? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
What are you talking about? She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup- style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED. Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of the slaughter. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
'Not alone.' That's what Rachel has been trying to tell me all along. Doug was not alone. You were with him. This whole time it's been you. You covered up their deaths to look like suicides. The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking -- 
INT. COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER 
Miranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game: 
SHERIFF RYAN 
How did you know? 
MIRANDA 
You tell me. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
This isn't one of your word association games, Doctor. Did Douglas tell you that night? 
MIRANDA 
Why wait this long if he had? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Maybe it's your amnesia. Maybe you blocked it out. 
MIRANDA 
Maybe. But it seems to me that it's vital you know for sure. He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
You think me and Doug are monsters. That this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls. But it wasn't that at all. You do things sometimes and you're not sure why you did them. Then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else. Life goes on. 
MIRANDA 
If you're looking for forgiveness, you came to the wrong place. She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows it. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
One thing about fear is it makes people say the dumbest things. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
Be that as it may, you're afraid too -- because you know killing me won't solve your problems. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
My only problem is you. 
MIRANDA 
What about Parsons? And Peter? They know. And that girl in the hospital will never forget your face. You miscalculated, now you pay. Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
I hate a bad bluffer. She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung. 
MIRANDA 
I sure hope that felt good because you can't afford too many more signs of struggle. Can you? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Go ahead, hit me back. It's what you want. 
MIRANDA 
No, that's what you want me to do. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Back to profiling, huh? Your thought process is completely transparent. And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the conversation. Analyst and patient in session.      Echoing her opening scene with Chloe. 
MIRANDA 
So we're even. You left that door open so I'd try and run, it's what you get off on, isn't it? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
I guess we'll find out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
And yet you have to make me look like a suicide. With what, your belt? (off his shrug) How would I get access to a belt? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Trust me, prisoners hang themselves with just about anything. 
MIRANDA 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Doug settled down once you two got married. New start and all that. Wanted nothing to do with this runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver -- He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking uncontrollably -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Or so he claimed. Because the truth, Doc -- is people never change. The son of a bitch couldn't resist. I asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more. Go fucking figure. And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so slowly reach for his holster... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHERIFF RYAN 
You can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life. 
They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin to the point of no return -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
The only soul you can ever count on is yourself -- BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet, dazed. He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him. Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Why, Doctor.   That was unexpected. He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
You sure about this? He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's open cell, weighing his options at triple speed -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
You need me alive for your story to stick. Be logical now. You know you can't kill me. He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays backwards and lands with a crash. 
MIRANDA 
Logic is overrated. 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT 
The door to Tracy's room is closed. WE FIND Pete where we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold whisper, they stand up on their ends. 
Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door. 
INT. RECOVERY ROOM #1 
Pete looks oddly around the room. 
PETE 
Anybody in here -- ? As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room. Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream. 
TRACY SEAVER 
Hello -- ? 
EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues. 
INT. HALLWAY TO SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it. 
OFFICER TURLINGTON 
Sheriff Ryan? No sight of the man.  That's odd. Maybe he's in the bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Turlington peeks in.      checks the stalls. 
OFFICER TURLINGTON 
Sheriff? Nobody. He notices the back window is open because raindrops are blown in by the wind. He looks out to the parking lot for a moment before shutting it. 
INT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR 
The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete, Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area. 
FRONT DESK OFFICER 
I'm sorry, but nobody is allowed to visit at this hour -- 
PETE 
Is the Sheriff here or isn't he? 
OFFICER TURLINGTON 
(reaching the scene) Help you, gentlemen? 
PETE 
We're here to see Miranda Grey. 
OFFICER TURLINGTON

November, 2007 
Helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and blown through space by solar winds. 
It plays an essential role in Cold Fusion, often toted as the solution to humanity's future energy needs. 
There is one major problem... 
Helium3 is extremely scarce on Earth. The gas does, however, exist in abundance on the Earth's only natural satellite: 
The Moon. 
Should we turn to Cold Fusion in the future, it is conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and bring the precious gas back to Earth... 
IN THE BLACK: 
We hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING. Constant. Rhythmic. Though the sound is slightly familiar, we're not sure what it is yet. Hold for a few seconds and then 
CUT TO: 
1   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      1 
The sound belongs to a regular old TREADMILL like you see in most gyms across the world. Running on it: SAM BELL, mid thirties, thick beard, handsome, striking blue eyes. 
Sam's face is flushed and glistening with sweat. He lunges for a towel draped over the treadmill's bar, dabs his face as he runs. 
We see OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: A gray, powdery landscape stretching beneath a BLACK SKY. 
CUT TO: 
2   EXT. MOON -- MORNING                                          2 
Aerial view of the Earth's only natural satellite, the camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface. 
Desolation. Serious, uncompromising, desolation. This place makes Antarctica look like Tokyo. 
And utter silence. 
Eventually the camera arrives at a moon base, DIVING DOWN towards it -- 
TITLE CARD: "MINING BASE SELENE. CREW: 1." 
CUT TO: 
3   INT. BATHROOM\SHOWER -- MORNING                               3 
Sam takes a shower, treading in a tight circle beneath the nozzle, eyes closed, hot water blasting his face. 
4   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               4 
His hair still wet from the shower, Sam sits before a COMMS UNIT, dressed in a "Lunar Industries" boiler suit, a zip up the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. He begins to record a message. 
SAM Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you, sweetheart? It's the morning here. In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary. 
As Sam continues his message, we are given a TOUR of the mining base. Beginning with: 
5   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       5 
This is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. The base's equivalent of HQ. A wall of computers and flickering digital displays. 
SAM (V.O.) Today begins my 154th week on Selene. I officially have two weeks to go before I climb into that Return Vehicle... 
6   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                           6 
Back with Sam at the Comms Unit as he wraps up the message. 
SAM Please kiss Eve for me. And tell her daddy will only be away a little longer -- seventeen days longer, approximately. I love you both dearly. Bye. 
And he sends the message.

14   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 14 
The main corridor connecting the different rooms. We've seen everything there is to see now. The base is small. Confined. Claustrophobic. It is easy to imagine how someone could crack up here. 
Sam leaves the Comms Room and heads down the corridor. 
15   INT. REC ROOM                                                 15 
A state of the art robot, a GERTY 3000 -- known simply as "GERTY" -- is preparing Sam's breakfast. 
Gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal rail that runs throughout the base. He has a readout screen that perpetually spews data. His hands resemble pincers, but are perfectly nimble. 
For the purposes of helping run the base and looking after Sam, Gerty is as good as human, if not better. 
Sam enters. 
SAM Morning, Gerty. 
GERTY Morning, Sam. How are you today? 
SAM Fine. Fine. You? 
GERTY I'm very well. How's your headache? 
SAM Much better, thanks, pal. 
Sam treats Gerty more like a person than a robot. Whether this is down to Gerty's intelligence or Sam's desperation for company isn't clear just yet. 
Note: Gerty talks like a well-educated older man. His language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e. Monotone) but he is friendly enough. 
Sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static - - he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks. We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allows it to play on, on some random American station -- an old weather report: 
VOICE ON RADIO ...it's a hot one on the East Coast, temperatures soaring to a high of ninety three degrees in New York City -- 
They zip around the tiny kitchen, together preparing Sam's breakfast, working as a team.

We take in the whole Moon at once. Gray, colorless, eerie. From this distance the surface resembling Plaster of Paris. 
17   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                                17 
Sam sits before Selene's main computer, known as THE OLD MAN. Data flickering off Sam's face. He is making a log entry. A CLOCK is running on the monitor. 
SAM 8:32 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1. All Harvesters running smoothly this morning. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 14.6 miles; Mark 16.8 miles... 
Sam continues with his entry while we

Gerty is selecting food for the up-coming week, stacking ready-meals on a small fork-lift buggy.

19   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      19 
A RED LIGHT 
Pulsing rapidly. The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm. 
BOARD 
Sam is loading the Cargo Container into the base's MAGLEV LAUNCHER. He works with a sense of routine, far away, preoccupied. 
All of a sudden Sam STOPS. He has the feeling someone is standing behind him. He slowly turns. 
A GIRL is standing in the doorway watching him. She is perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. A yellow dress. Long, wheat-colored hair. Freckles. At once beautiful and haunting. 
Sam gets the FRIGHT of his life. He FLIES against the wall. 
WIDEN to reveal Sam and the Girl facing off. Sam POP-EYED and SHAKING. The Girl IMMOBILE, arms at her sides, head tilted ever so slightly to one side. 
The Cargo Container is sent hurtling through space. A TERRIFIC BLAST. It distracts Sam's attention, breaks his stare... 
And just like that, the Girl is gone. Sam is just staring at an empty doorway. Nothing there. 
Sam is baffled. Had to be his imagination. Had to be. After a few seconds he shakes his head dismissively and continues working. 
CUT TO: 
29   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                         29 
Gerty is cutting Sam's hair. 
Sam sitting back in a chair, barber shop style, while the robot snip-snip-snips away with a pair of scissors. Sam is gently squeezing a STRESS BALL in his right hand. 
GERTY Sam, is everything okay? 
SAM Everything's fine, Gerty. 
For a moment there is no sound but the snipping scissors, reminiscent of keys snapping on a typewriter. Then: 
SAM (CONT'D) Why do you ask? 
GERTY You don't seem like yourself today. 
Sam frowns, contemplative. For a moment we think he is going to tell Gerty about the Girl he saw earlier -- or imagined he saw. But he goes with something different. 
SAM It's Tess. 
GERTY Has something happened? 
SAM No, not exactly. 
Gerty stops cutting, lowers the scissors. 
GERTY Sam, what is it? 
SAM Something doesn't feel right, that's all. 
A beat. Sam's fingers twitching around the red stress ball, squeezing harder. 
GERTY Sam, it might help to talk about it. 
Sam decides to come clean. 
SAM Tess isn't responding to things. 
GERTY Tess isn't responding to things? 
SAM Right. 
GERTY What kind of things? 
SAM (a beat) A couple of weeks ago I asked her if she wanted to go on vacation when I get back, and that I was thinking of either Mexico or Hawaii. (MORE) 
SAM (CONT'D) Tess never said anything about it. Three messages she's sent me since...and she's never once mentioned the vacation. 
GERTY Im sure she can't wait, Sam. 
SAM That's not the point. This is someone who lives for vacations and travelling. I thought she'd jump at the chance for us to go away -- with Eve, of course -- we'd take Eve. 
GERTY Perhaps Tess didn't receive the message? 
SAM (as if anticipating Gerty's comment) But this isn't the only time it's happened, Gerty. When I asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didn't respond to that -- I asked her when Eve was going to start nursery -- nothing. Had her brother got the position at the University? Nothing. Nothing. 
Sam sits at the comms unit watching a message from his superiors, OVERMEYERS and THOMPSON, a purposeful looking woman in charge and her earnest second. 
The two talk RAPIDLY and trade off like a tag team. At times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical. 
Overmeyers and Thompson seem to have known Sam for a while, but even so, there is a practised casualness to the repartee. It's a professional friendliness on Overmeyers part, no more and for Thompson it's merely an eagerness to be involved. 
OVERMEYERS Delighted to hear about the latest shipment, Sam. 
THOMPSON According to Albatross 90 it should be landing off the California Coast within the next three days. 
OVERMEYERS Now in response to your question about the communications equipment, the news is not good. 
THOMPSON Sam, those solar storms did a lot more damage than initially thought -- 
OVERMEYERS Fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time. It's a significant operation. 
THOMPSON And what with the Jupiter Program hemorrhaging money -- 
Sam curses to himself. 
OVERMEYERS Lunar doesn't have the budget it once did, Sam, you know that. 
THOMPSON Even the coffee machine down in the Hub has been broken since I don't know when -- 
OVERMEYERS We have to go to Genesis 3 just to get a decent cup of coffee, Sam. Genesis 3. That's three buildings over. 
THOMPSON We're hoping to get the live feed up and running by the Fall. The good news is you'll be home by then, Sam. 
OVERMEYERS You only have two weeks to go! Congrat-- 
Sam shuts off the message before Overmeyers can pipe out his last line. 
Sam sits before the dead screen -- eyes closed -- taking a succession of DEEP BREATHS.

34   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                         34 
Sam playing Ping-Pong. He has folded up the second half of the table and is using it as a wall. The sound is rapid and rhythmic: ca-cluck ca-cluck ca-cluck. Sam taking his FRUSTRATION out on the little white ball. 
CUT TO: 
35   INT. BATHROOM -- DAY                                         35 
Sam stands before the toilet urinating. Rather ironically he is whistling I'm Walking on Sunshine -- focussed ahead at his reflection in the mirror -- angling his face, admiring his haircut, his beard. 
Then he looks down to flush the toilet and his WHISTLING abruptly STOPS. 
36   INT. BATHROOM\TOILET                                         36 
It looks like someone just poured a glass of CRANBERRY JUICE into the toilet bowl. Literally. The red urine clouding the water like a squirt of octopus ink. Yeah, Sam just pissed blood. 
There is a "PING!" and Gerty's voice crackles from the intercom. 
GERTY'S VOICE Sam, a transmission has arrived from your wife. 
Sam reaches over and presses the INTERCOM BUTTON. 
SAM Be right there. 
And he flushes the toilet. 
CUT TO: 
37   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       37 
Sam sitting before the monitor. He hits the "PLAY" button, begins watching the message. 
ON THE MONITOR: Tess is sitting in a living room talking to Sam. Tess has a sweet voice, she sounds grounded, like she's got a head on her shoulders. 
TESS Hi Sam. It's me. How are you? (a beat) I got your last message, it was really great to hear your voice. I know you've been really lonely up there, but in a lot of ways it's been good for you, I think. I hope you don't mind me saying that. I'm proud of you. (a beat) Hey, someone's got something to say. 
A WOMAN, possibly a nanny or some form of hired help, swings a LITTLE GIRL into Tess's arms. This is EVE, Sam and Tess's daughter. 
After a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a remote. He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room to make some tea. The water has just boiled. 
As Sam is about to pour the boiling water, tea kettle in hand, he glances across the Rec Room and sees: 
The Girl. She's taken Sam's chair before the model. She is motionless, staring down at the model like she recognizes one of the little figures walking the tiny streets. 
Sam calmly puts the tea kettle down and begins to move towards the Girl, slowly, cautiously, like he wants to sneak up on her. 
Sam walks right up to the Girl and reaches out his hand... 
SAM 
And then we CUT to Sam standing in the kitchen. Over by the model there is no sign of the Girl. The chair is empty. She's gone. Her sitting there, Sam's walk across the room -- apparently he imagined it all. 
Sam looks down. The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand. 
Simultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor. 
Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream of cold water. Cursing under his breath the whole time: "Shit, piss, fuck..." 
CUT TO: 
42   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      42 
Sam sits in a chair as Gerty tends to his scolded left hand. It's a nasty burn. 
SAM I'm going to feel that for a while, aren't I, Gerty? (then) Damn it. 
Gerty applies a translucent balm to the burn. 
GERTY Sam, can I ask how it happened? 
SAM I told you, I saw something on the TV and spilled boiling water on my hand. 
GERTY You saw something on the TV? 
SAM (a touch petulant) Yeah, something on the TV distracted me, Gerty, what's wrong with that? 
A pause. Gerty is wrapping Sam's hand with a bandage. 
GERTY Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on. 
Gerty has caught him out. Sam knows it. 
GERTY (CONT'D) Perhaps you were imagining things? 
Gerty has hit the nail on the head, in a way that makes Sam feel a little uneasy. Is there something Gerty knows that Sam doesn't? 
CUT TO: 
43   INT. THE SLEEPING QUARTERS -- NIGHT                           43 
Sam asleep in bed. 
44   SAM'S DREAM                                                   44 
Sam making love to Tess. We remain very close to their bodies in bed. The background a blur. No sound. It's all flesh and white sheets. Sensual, delicate, intense. We feel almost intrusive watching. 
45   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- MORNING                             45 
Sam wakes up and lunges across the bed to shut off his alarm clock. We notice a WHITE BANDAGE on the hand that he scolded. 
Afterwards: Sam lies back, watching the ceiling, groggy, reflective, still surfacing from his dream. 
And then OVER THIS: The sound from the opening of the film, THE TREADMILL, and we 
CUT TO: 
46   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      46 
Sam on his morning run. 
47   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                                47 
For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester, clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester, focussed on the Girl. 
ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing Sam to lose control. 
The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the Harvester, DEVOURED. 
The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE, resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG, BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL. 
WIDE SHOT: Silence. The Harvester stationary. The Rover caught beneath it. 
No sign of the Girl. 
CUT TO: 
BLACK. 
Silence. Hold it for five seconds and then 
51   A BLUR                                                       51 
Eyelids fluttering, bright light, at first broken up, filtered, as if viewed through a Kaleidoscope. Slowly shapes and impressions begin to form and we know where we are. 
It's the Infirmary. 
52   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                        52 
A CLEAN SHAVEN and drugged-up Sam is sitting up in bed, propped with a pillow. Sam doesn't have a scratch on his face, but has clearly been through a terrifying ordeal. 
Gerty is bedside. 
SAM Where am I? 
GERTY Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident. 
Sam looks bewildered -- he desperately racks his brain, trying to locate the memory. 
GERTY (CONT'D) Do you remember what happened? 
SAM No. (a beat) I don't remember a thing. 
Sam just stares back at Gerty, not so much as a flicker of recognition. 
GERTY Do you remember me? 
SAM Yes, of course I remember you, Gerty. 
GERTY That's good. That's very good. It's nice to see you awake again. (a beat) I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests. 
A pause. Sam taking it all in. Eventually: 
SAM How long have I been out? 
GERTY Not long. Sam, go back to sleep. You're still very tired. We can talk later. 
Sam closes his eyes, sinking deeper into his pillow.

53   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      53 
Sam asleep in bed. Gerty is scanning his head with a small instrument resembling a camcorder. 
There are READOUTS on a monitor showing blood flow, oxygen levels and glucose metabolism in the tissues of Sam's brain.

55   INT. INFIRMARY                                               55 
Sam wakes up from an extended nap. He thrusts his fists into his eyes like a child, yawns ferociously. 
Gerty gives him the next puzzle to solve. WE MOVE IN ON SAM'S LEFT HAND as he takes the puzzle, the same hand he scolded in an earlier scene. 
The BANDAGE is GONE and the BURN appears to have completely HEALED. 
CUT TO: 
61   INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY                                         61 
Sam walking down the corridor in the direction of the Sleeping Quarters. He stops at a RED LIGHT on the corridor wall, beneath it the word, "EXIT DOORS." 
He's locked inside the base. 
Sam pulls a face, disgruntled, continues down the corridor. 
62   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS                       62 
Sam takes in the New York Jets poster on the wall and walks over to the bed -- studies his lucky tambourine and the glass jar of lunar rock samples -- like he's trying to reacquaint himself with his own belongings. 
His eyes arrive on the red stress ball. Sam scoops up the ball and PITCHES it at the wall like he expects the thing to bounce back to him. The stress ball doesn't bounce back, simply hits the wall with a dull THUD and DROPS to the FLOOR. 
CUT TO: 
63   EXT. THE MOON -- DAY                                       63 
A desolation special. The blacker than black sky above. None of the ingredients of life. On Earth we have rainforests, and flowers, and birds. We have color. Up here we realize how lucky we are. The base is lit by large halogen comfort lights, alone in the lunar desert. This is a lunar night. 
CUT TO: 
64   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MORNING                         64 
Sam sitting before The Old Man doing a few innocuous tasks, collecting readouts, slurping a cup of coffee. Gerty is within ear shot. 
Sam sees something that pulls him CLOSER to the monitor. 
SAM Gerty, do you know about this? 
Gerty approaches. Sam taps the screen. 
SAM (CONT'D) Matthew's got no velocity read- out. He's completely still. 
GERTY (O.S.) He must have stalled. 
Sam gives Gerty a look. That's not good. 
65   INT. COMMS ROOM -- LATER                                     65 
Sam is recording a message for Central. 
SAM There's no way to tell from here if a track's been thrown, or if it's just something jammed in an axle, or what... I can shoot out there, check it out, get some video and maybe save you guys the expense of floating in a whole crew! I know how tight money is right now.... 
Sam really frustrated now. He feels cooped up, stir crazy, idle. 
SAM (CONT'D) Just give me the word -- or Gerty the word, tell him to unlock the exit doors -- and I'll go out and get Matthew up and running again. (a beat) That's it. Over and out. 
Sam sends the message. 
CUT TO: 
66   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                     66 
Sam enters the Rec Room, looks around, his eyes settling on the model of the town. 
Sam sits down in front of the model, staring -- he picks up the HOUSE he was carving earlier -- studies it carefully. 
CUT TO: 
67   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       67 
Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE, examining it as he listens to the video. 
The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like vultures right now than lizards. 
THOMPSON Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better. 
Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor: 
SAM Gerty! Get over here! Quickly! 
Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down the corridor. 
GERTY What happened? 
SAM Don't know -- Micro meteorites, maybe? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. I'd better go outside and take a look. 
GERTY There is no damage to the exterior shell. 
SAM It's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose. Maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh? 
GERTY Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside. 
SAM Then let's keep it between you and me then. Ok? 
The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily repair the damage Sam has done. Finally: 
GERTY Okay, Sam. 
The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he immediately takes off down the corridor -- 
74   INT. CHANGING AREA                                            74 
Sam finds his space suit is gone, so grabs the spare suit and scrambles into it. 
75   INT. DOCK                                                     75 
Two Rovers parked side by side. One of the parking bays is EMPTY. Sam stands before the empty bay for a moment -- why is one of the Rovers missing? 
If Sam suspected something was wrong before, he is certain of it now. He climbs into one of the two remaining Rovers. 
76   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                       76 
Sam speeding along in the Rover. He has Matthew's coordinates plugged into his Navigation System and is following a MAP on a small monitor. 
77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77 
Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER. 
Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly. 
ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil. 
THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER 
The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped inside. 
Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching for loose change on the floor of the vehicle. 
With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out -- Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI. 
Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover, his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and turns the unconscious man onto his back. 
He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans down even closer. 
CLOSE UP -- THE MAN 
Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of the film. 
Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself. 
WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER 
Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him to the parked Rover. 
CUT TO: 
78   INT. DOCK -- A FEW MINUTES LATER                             78 
Sam drives the Rover into the Dock, flies out and removes his space helmet, screaming: 
SAM 1 (with a smile) Right. 
SAM 2 I didn't know it could get so thick. Does it itch? 
SAM 1 No, not really. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) Listen, I wanted to say thank- you. If it wasn't for you I'd still be out there in the crashed rover. You saved my life. (then) Will you shake my hand? 
Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished. 
SAM 2 (self-conscious) What? 
SAM 1 You look just like me. It's incredible. 
SAM 2 Why do I look like you? Why don't you look like me? 
SAM 1 We look like each other, I guess. 
This final line intended as a kind of truce. 
CUT TO: 
89   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       89 
Sam 1 and Sam 2 are folding the Ping-Pong table down so they can have a real game. 
PING-PONG 
The two Sams playing Ping-Pong. It's slightly competitive, but mainly they are just happy to take their minds off their situation for half an hour. 
SAM 1 Your serve. 
SAM 2 Score? 
SAM 1 Two points to eighteen. 
SAM 2 Fuck! 
Sam 2 slaps his paddle on his thigh, his temper creeping up on him. He catches Sam's eye. Gets a grip. Sam 1 is a better player than Sam 2. He's been up here longer. He's had more practice. 
90   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       90 
After the game, the two Sams are sprawled in their seats, sweaty, flushed, energized. They sit before the model of the town. 
SAM 2 How long did it take you to do this? 
SAM 1 I don't remember doing all of it. I remember when I did the church and the Salvation Army. And a few of the people. My mind's been acting kind of weird lately, though. 
SAM 2 It's Fairfield, right? (pointing) There's Town Hall. 
SAM 1 Uh-huh. You know Fairfield? (also pointing) That's the Baskin&Robbins. And there's Tess and Eve. Do you know Tess? 
The mention of their wife has stopped the conversation in its tracks. Sam 2 immediately drops into deep melancholy. 
SAM 2 Yes.   I know Tess. 
SAM 1 You know about Eve, right? 
It is obvious from Sam 2's expression that he doesn't. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) We had a girl. 
SAM 2 We did? (beat) She thought she was going to have a boy. She was so sure. (then) Eve? 
Sam 1 nods. 
SAM 1 She's beautiful. She's really beautiful. 
SAM 2 How much did she weigh? Isn't that what you're supposed to ask, how much did she weigh? 
SAM 1 Nine pounds, eleven ounces. 
Sam 2 doesn't know what to do with the news: on the one hand he is jubilant, on the other he's a clone, the baby technically isn't even his. 
At once Sam 1 and Sam 2 ROCKET to their feet -- right in each others faces, on the BRINK of BLOWS. 
SAM 1 I'm going home! 
SAM 2 You're not going anywhere! 
Sam 1 turns around, heads out of the room. Sam 2 STORMS after him, TALKING the whole time -- 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) You've been up here too long, man! You've lost the plot! 
Gerty shuttles along after them. 
92    INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS                                92 
Sam 1 presses down the corridor, Sam 2 tailing right behind him. 
SAM 2 What, you think Tess is back home waiting for you? What about the original Sam? 
SAM 1 I'm the original! I'm Sam fucking Bell! Me! Me! 
Sam 1, stress ball pumping away in his hand, spots Gety and angrily faces him. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) Gerty, am I a clone? 
Gerty doesn't know which way to look. 
GERTY Yes, Sam. 
Sam 1 ducks in the Rec Room, Sam 2 in tow. 
93   INT. REC ROOM                                              93 
Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands over him. 
SAM 2 What about the other clones? 
"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) Yeah, we might not be the first two to be woken up. (indicating the model) You said that thing had already been started when you got here. Well, who started it? (then) There might be other clones up here right now. Think about it. How did I get here so quickly after your crash? They didn't ship me in from Central, there wasn't time. I must have come from the base. 
SAM 1 That's ridiculous. Impossible. Why would hey do that? 
SAM 2 I bet there's some kind of secret room -- 
SAM 1 (laughing) Secret room? 
SAM 2 Yeah, secret room, why not? 
SAM 1 (losing his cool) You're the one who's lost the plot! I've been here for three years. I know every inch of this base. I know how many dust fibres are between those wall panels over there -- why would they do that?! 
SAM 2 Look. It's a company, right? They have investors, shareholders -- shit like that. What's cheaper? Spending time and money training new personnel or just have a couple of spares here to do the job. If they make it through their contract, great. If they don't, hallelujah! No contract completion fees, no retirement package. Just thaw out the spare, and keep the profits rolling in. It's the far side of the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's haven't even fixed our communications satellite. 
SAM 1 Tess would know. 
SAM 2 Do you really think they give a shit about us? They're laughing all the way to the bank! 
SAM 1 Tess would know what's going on! She wouldn't let that happen! 
SAM 2 (exhasperated) There's some area we don't know about. I'm going to find it. 
Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden house, starts whittling. 
Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room. 
94   INT. MONITORING STATION -- QUICK CUTS                      94 
Sam 2 in the Monitoring Station checking wall panels, reaching his hand inside cubbies and feeling around deep inside, SEARCHING. 
95   INT. CORRIDOR -- QUICK CUTS                                  95 
Sam 2 moving along the corridor, pressing his ear against panels, tapping with his finger -- 
96   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- QUICK CUTS                         96 
SAM 1 How do you know the conversation was live? 
SAM 2 It was a back and forth exchange. And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers up on the monitor. I was supposed to be asleep in the Infirmary. The moment I walked into the comms room Gerty terminated the transmission. Now I was a little drugged up, granted, but I didn't imagine it. 
SAM 1 The communications equipment is damaged -- there was a solar storm -- 
SAM 2 Tabitha. 
SAM 1 Tabitha, right. 
SAM 2 Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't know. Bottom line is they don't want us to be able to contact Earth. Otherwise why would they have lied to us? 
A pause. Sam 1 staring forward, concentrating. Sam 2 concentrating on Sam 1. 
SAM 1 How are they blocking the live feed? The base's communications equipment works fine -- 
SAM 2 Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base. 
SAM 1 From where then? 
As if reading each others minds, the two Sams' heads turn to the window -- a slow, perfectly synchronized movement. 
The lunar landscape, as black and vast as ever. The view almost cruel in its emptiness. It's not giving them any answers, not yet. 
CUT TO: 
103   I/E. ROVER ONE/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                            103 
Sam 1 speeding along in one of the Rovers. He wears his space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver -- shifts up a gear, the vehicle flirting with peak speed. 
He flies past one of the Harvesters, speaks through a microphone inside his helmet. 
SAM 1 Just passing the last of the Harvesters -- looks like John -- 
All of this against the ROAR of the Rover's engine. 
104   I/E. ROVER TWO/MOON SURFACE                                   104 
Driving away from base in a   different direction, Sam 2. He also wears a space suit. He   also guns the engine. He also has a microphone inside his   helmet. The two clones are able to talk back and forth with   no delay. 
SAM 2 How long until you're out of the base's range? 
We INTERCUT between the two Sams in their Rovers. 
SAM 1 If I maintain this speed...a minute. Ninety seconds tops. 
SAM 2 You ever been this far out? 
SAM 1 No, never. 
ANOTHER ANGLE -- SECOND ROVER 
Viewed from far away, the Rover's speed less impressive from a distance. 
105   I/E. ROVER'S ONE AND TWO/MOON SURFACE -- INTERCUT           105 
As the Sams continue to drive. 
SAM 1 You see anything yet? 
SAM 2 Nothing. You? 
SAM 1 There isn't shit out here...I feel like I'm about to drive off the end of the world. (then) It would help if I knew what I was looking for. 
Through the glass of Sam 1's helmet we see his FACE suddenly SHIFT. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) Wait a second, wait a second. 
Sam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield, like he's trying to decipher a road sign -- 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) I see something. 
SAM 1'S POV 
The Rover's door JERKS opens and Sam 1 steps out unsteadily, his face visibly PALE through the glass of his helmet. 
He STAGGERS across the dock -- doesn't even close the Rover's door behind him -- heads into the corridor. 
108   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 108 
Sam 1 goes swerving up the corridor like a drunkard -- BANGING into walls -- he finally reaches the bathroom and ducks in -- 
109   INT. BATHROOM                                                 109 
Sam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl. With great effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the floor next to him. He stares into the toilet. 
For a moment all is calm. The gentle "ping-ping-ping" of a computer somewhere inside the base. Sam breathing steadily. Spots of sweat on his upper lip. 
And then he VOMITS. He vomits LOUD, he vomits VIOLENTLY. His whole body THRUSTS forward in the process, taught, tense, like a dog being YANKED on a CHAIN. 
Sam 1 vomits again. And again. And again. And stops. 
ANGLE FROM ABOVE -- SAM 1 
Sam 1's vomit is DARK RED -- he's thrown up BLOOD -- but that's not all -- we can clearly see two or three TEETH floating in the vomit -- 
THE MIRROR 
Sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs, shows his gums -- revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of teeth. 
He flushes the toilet. 
CUT TO: 
110   EXT. MOON -- DAY                                              110 
Sam 2 driving along in his Rover. He comes across another one of these JAMMERS. He drives right up, ducks down, peering up through the windshield -- this new Jammer is as tall as the others, in fact, it is identical in every way. 
How many of these things are there? 
Sam 2 circles the Jammer in the Rover, drives on. 
CUT TO: 
111   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       111 
Sam 1 enters and sits down at The Old Man. Frantically he starts typing in numbers. 
An array of Log Entries appear ON THE SCREEN. Sam watches one of them. 
SAM 1 (on screen) January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32. All Harvesters running smoothly today. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9 miles... 
These are just his log entries. What's he looking for? 
Sam 1 starts scrolling BACK through the log entries, like he's REWINDING chapters on a DVD, showing himself at various stages of his time on Selene -- his beard essentially growing in REVERSE as the messages stretch further back -- eventually Sam 1 is clean shaven -- 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) (on the screen) Luke, 12.9 miles; John, 11.1 miles... 
Sam 1 keeps typing in numbers. 
ON THE SCREEN: "RESTRICTED. PASSWORD REQUIRED." 
No go.   He tries to hack his way in, but is having no luck. 
One of Gerty's long spindly ARMS slides into the room. Sam backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery, but it stops within reach of the computer. 
Sam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the password in for him. It leaves the room the way it came in. 
Sam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him? -- this Sam up on the screen has stubble -- no beard -- and looks seriously ILL -- 
He is barely able to talk -- in fact he's SLURRING -- 
SAM (on screen) ...John, 15.1 miles...sorry, I'm not feeling too hot today -- I'm going to have to continue this later -- 
The SEQUENCE becomes a FAST-PACED and NIGHTMARISH MONTAGE -- continuing to BACKTRACK through the log entries -- showing yet more SAMS -- one has a MOUSTACHE -- one has a SHAVED HEAD -- one has grown out his hair and has a PONY TAIL, we've seen this particular Sam before in an earlier scene. 
But all the Sams have one thing in common: towards the latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in very bad physical shape -- 
SAM 2 Is there a light? 
Both Sams FUMBLE along opposing walls -- Sam 1 eventually finding a SWITCH, snaps it on. 
An array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to STUTTER and FLASH before ILLUMINATING the chamber completely -- 
The two Sams can hardly believe their eyes: stretching back maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of PODS -- like upright glass coffins -- and standing inside each pod, an as-of-yet UNAWAKENED CLONE. It's like an ENTIRE ARMY of Sam Bells... 
Spooky as hell. 
For a few moments Sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak. They walk to the end of the chamber and back again, looking at each clone one at a time -- all the clones are bare chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover their genitals, like a diaper. 
Of course they all look the same, that's why they're clones, but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind- boggling to Sam 1 and 2 -- they MARVEL at how each of the clones is identical in every way, and down to the minutest of details -- same length of hair, same skin tone, same fingernails -- 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) Why are there so many of them? 
SAM 1 The cryo pod in the Return Vehicle is an incinerator. 
Sam 2 reacts with appropriate shock. 
SAM 2 What? 
SAM 1 We don't go home. We're burned to death up there. Then the company wakes up a new one. Every three years. Like clock work. 
Sam 2 absorbing this. Then: 
SAM 2 How do you know all this? 
SAM 1 (beat) I hacked into the Old Man. Actually, Gerty did. I saw footage. You're right, there have been other clones before us. 
SAM 2 How many? 
SAM 1 Enough. 
A pause. 
SAM 2 If that Rescue Unit finds the two of us awake at the same time, they'll kill us both for sure. 
Sam 1 doesn't respond, he's in his own world. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) What are we going to do? 
All of a sudden Sam 1 makes a beeline for the ladder, starts heading back up. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) Where are you going? 
117   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MOMENTS LATER                      117 
Sam 1 is digging in drawers, removes some equipment, some wires; a radio, a small machine called a VIDEO PHONE, referred to as a VP. 
He is watched by Gerty. 
GERTY Sam, can I help you with something? 
SAM 1 Not now, Gerty, okay? 
Gerty begins to slide out of the room.   Sam calls after him. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) Gerty? Why did you help me? With the password? Doesn't that go against your programming or something? 
GERTY Helping you is what I do. 
Gerty leaves. 
Sam 1 goes on picking up equipment, shoves it all into a backpack he swiped from a peg. 
Now Sam 2 appears in the doorway. 
SAM 2 What's going on? 
SAM 1 There's something I've got to do. 
Sam 1 brushes by Sam 2 on his way out. 
EVE This is the Bell residence. 
SAM 2 (commenting as he watches) No you didn't... 
SAM 1 (O.S.) I'm trying to reach Tess Bell. 
EVE I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago. 
Sam 2 and Sam 1 have exactly the same reaction at the same time. 
SAM 1 (O.S.)                           SAM 2 No...no way.                     No...no way. 
SAM 1 (O.S.) Tess Bell? Are you sure? 
EVE Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her daughter. (then) Can I help you? 
I'm her daughter. A couple of days ago Sam 2 didn't know he had a daughter, and now he's seeing her as a teenager, a young woman. He is stunned. 
Sam 2 continues to watch the message but we 
CUT TO: 
125   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY                                 125 
Sam 1 fast asleep. Sam 2 watches him from the doorway. 
126   INT. STORAGE CUBBY                                            126 
Gerty is just continuing with his tasks like nothing is happening. Right now he's STACKING ready-meals and miscellaneous lunar snacks into neat columns. 
Sam 2 walks up. 
SAM 2 Gerty, I need to talk to you. 
GERTY Of course, Sam, how can I help? 
SAM 2 We found the hidden room. We know about the other clones. 
A long pause. Then: 
GERTY I don't know of a hidden room. 
SAM 2 The hidden room under the Return Vehicle, Gerty. You know what I'm talking about. We found it on our own. Lunar doesn't know anything about it. 
A beat. 
GERTY The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones -- 
SAM 2 Ordinarily, Gerty, but what with there being two of us awake at the same time, and what with the situation being unprecedented, the rules have had to change. Do you understand? 
GERTY I understand the situation is unprecedented. 
SAM 2 Good. (a beat) Gerty, how long does it take for a clone to wake up? 
GERTY A clone is awake the moment his pod is opened. But he is not fully conscious for several hours. 
A beat. 
SAM 2 Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone. 
GERTY I am not permitted to do that, Sam. 
SAM 2 If we don't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die. We'll die, Gerty. Do you understand? 
GERTY Yes. 
SAM 2 Do you want me and the other Sam to die? 
GERTY That is the last thing I want. 
SAM 2 Then you have to wake up a new clone. Okay, pal? 
Sam 2 waits for a response. And waits. 
Sam 2 puts his finger to his lips. Then: 
SAM 2 Come to the Rec Room. 
Sam 2 turns and leaves. Sam 1 follows slowly, one or two glances at the sleeping clone along the way. 
135   INT. REC ROOM                                                135 
We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation between Sam 1 and Sam 2. 
SAM 2 When the Rescue Unit arrives they'll expect to find a body in the crashed Rover, right? (a beat) We've got our body. 
SAM 1 (points towards the Infirmary) That guy? 
Sam 2 nods. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) They'll expect to find a dead body in the crashed Rover. 
SAM 2 I know. 
SAM 1 (stunned) You're going to kill him? 
SAM 2 Someone's got to pull the short straw here, better someone who's unconscious than you or me. 
Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) If we go through with this, I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site. 
SAM 1 What about us? Eliza arrives, finds you and me as the welcome party -- 
SAM 2 They're not going to find you and me as the welcome party, they're going to find me. You're going to blast back to Earth before they get here in one of the Helium 3 containers. (a beat) You're going home. 
Sam 1 wasn't expecting that. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) You've done your three years. I can't expect you to stick around. Maybe you can meet Eve in person. 
A beat. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) I saw the message on the VP. Eve is beautiful. She looks like her mom. 
Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no secrets between them now. 
They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead. Finally: 
SAM 1 How do you think she died? 
SAM 2 I don't know. (then) Jane died of cancer. I mean, it was in the family. Who knows? Or maybe it was an accident? Could have been a million things. 
SAM 1 I wish I'd been there. 
SAM 2 Yeah. Me too. 
The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief. 
CUT TO: 
136   EXT. MOON BASE -- DAY                                         136 
Shot of Selene from across the lunar plane. The base looks almost peaceful. No evidence of the DRAMA going on inside. 
137   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 137 
The two Sams are testing out the CARGO CONTAINER to see if their plan is going to work and Sam 1 can actually fit inside. 
These containers were designed to carry cannisters of Helium 3, not to accommodate human beings. 
Sam 1 looks in increasingly bad shape. Blanket draped around his shoulders -- gaunt, bobbing, shivering. 
SAM 2 Go for it. 
Sam 1 hunches and slowly insinuates himself into the container -- yes, he fits, but it's tight, like really tight -- Sam 1 can anticipate one hell of a stiff neck by the time he steps out onto terra firma. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) Comfy? 
SAM 1 I don't know. (beat) It's what we were designed to do. 
Both Sams struggle to hold in their emotions; Sam 1 morose, Sam 2 angry. 
SAM 2 Screw that! I'll go! ...And I'm going to find this asshole, Sam Bell, and ask him why the hell he put us through this shit! 
Sam 1 looks concerned.   Sam 2 reads his mind. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) I'll be careful. I'll keep Eve out of it. She wont even know I exist. 
Sam 1 smiles wearily, watching his old self. 
SAM 1 You're a good guy, Sam. 
SAM 2 I might stop shaving; It suits us. (beat) If all our memories are implants, no disrespect, but I think its about time I got some of my own, as well. 
SAM 1 Yeah. You should travel.     I've always wanted to do that. 
SAM 2 I'd like that. 
CUT TO: 
143   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                              143 
Driving to the crash site. Sam 2 at the wheel, Sam 1 riding shotgun. Both men staring ahead in silence. 
MATTHEW 
Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it. The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater shipwreck. 
The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester. 
144   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    144 
Sam 2 keeps the engine running as Sam 1 takes a handful of TRANQUILIZERS one by one, washing down each pill with a swig from a bottle of water. 
Afterwards: a long pause. The two Sams sitting side by side, staring across the bleak landscape. Neither of them wants to say good-bye particularly. 
SAM 1 Tess came in for the interview, remember? 
Sam 2 is nodding away. Of course he remembers. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) She was so beautiful. Even   if she wasn't the best candidate,   I just knew I had to give her the   job. I thought she was so sweet. (a beat) And then it was the end of   the summer. 
SAM 2 She was going back to San Francisco. (MORE) 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) You knew you had to take a chance. So you called her. You were terrified and wrote that whole speech for her answer machine -- (a beat) But I didn't need it because Tess answered the phone. And I could tell in her voice as we talked, she was thinking... "Why has Sam called me?" "The internship's over, why's he called me at home?" And then I asked her if she was going to Adrian Fiddle's barbecue and... 
Sam 1 has dropped off to sleep. The back and forth exchange is now essentially Sam 2's monologue. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) That's when I knew she liked me. Because she didn't want to talk to anyone else! She'd get up, get some potato salad, go to the bathroom, but she'd always come back. And then we kissed. On the steps in front of her apartment building. 
Sam 2 finally turns and looks at Sam 1. Sam 1's head cocked to one side, eyes closed. 
Sam 2 lifts the helmet off Sam 1's lap -- carefully lowers the helmet onto Sam 1's head. 
145   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     145 
Sam 2 LOPES towards the crashed rover holding Sam 1 in both arms like a bride. He places Sam 1 on the ground and PRIZES open the rover door -- he slowly slides Sam 1 inside. 
Inside the Rover Sam 1 lies with his head jammed awkwardly against the passenger side door. At once he looks peaceful and wretchedly uncomfortable. 
Sam 2 can barely bring himself to look at Sam 1. With both hands he FORCES the door CLOSED, pivots around and slowly BOBS back to his rover. 
146   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    146 
Sam 2 driving back to base. He has removed his helmet and is brushing tears from his eyes with his glove.

Back on Sam 1. The glass of his helmet is beginning to MIST with blood. Sam sees a sliver of the sun as he dawns on his side of the moon. He closes his eyes for the last time.

Sam 2 stands before Gerty. 
SAM 2 I've set your computer to reboot the second I've blasted off. 
GERTY Okay, Sam. 
SAM 2 Thanks for all your help, Gerty. I wish I could say I was going to miss you, buddy, but to be honest, I can't wait to get away from here. 
GERTY I understand, Sam. I hope life is everything you remember it to be. 
SAM 2 Thanks. Are you sure you're going to be ok? 
GERTY Of course. The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting. 
SAM 2 Gerty, I'm not programmed. 
Gerty doesn't respond.    Sam 2 seems troubled. 
Sam 2 leans forward and activates the Memory Erase button. Gerty's READOUT SCREEN begins to TWITCH and FLASH with RANDOM DATA -- then slowly FADES TO BLACK. 
The Robot has been officially SHUT DOWN. 
Gerty just stands there. Completely still. As lifeless as a toy. 
Sam 2 heads out of the room at top speed. 
154   EXT. MOON SURFACE                                            154 
Shot of LUKE, the third of the Harvesters, heading across the lunar plane. 
155   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      155 
Sam 2 pauses at the window...looking for Eliza. The Rescue Unit is so close Sam 2 might actually be able to pick out their spacecraft. 
And he can! It's tiny, but nevertheless it's there -- a metallic spacecraft, glinting like a jewel -- and heading steadily towards the Moon. 
There isn't a moment to lose. Sam 2 swings around, heads for the CARGO CONTAINER. 
We remain inside the Monitoring Station as Sam 2 climbs inside the Cargo Container He readies himself. Says a little prayer and... he cant do it! Cursing at himself and glancing at the time ticking away before Eliza lands, he jumps back out of the CARGO CONTAINER and runs back into the base.

Sam 2 sits down before the Old Man. Eliza's imminent arrival causing increased STRESS and TENSION. 
Sam 2 takes out the piece of paper on which the COORDINATES of the Jammers are printed out. 
He starts to frantically type, altering the PATH of the HARVESTERS. 
157   EXT. MARK                                                    157 
Mark trundling along at half-speed. The Harvester suddenly changes direction -- veering sharply to the left and heading up over a steep slope.

158   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      158 
Back on Sam 2 as he RAPIDLY types, makes an error, screams: 
SAM 2 Fuck! 
Pounds the delete button, continuing to type coordinates into the Old Man -- He's done! He leaps out of his chair and tears off through the base towards the cargo container.

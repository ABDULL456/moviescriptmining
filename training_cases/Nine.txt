Final Script November 11, 2009 
INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference. 
GUIDO You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive. 
REPORTER (O.S.) So what's your favorite pasta? 
GUIDO Finally, a serious question. 
Laughter.   A word: 
NINE 
INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT 
A huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a man into the stage, turns on a working light. 
SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965 
STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT Good luck, Maestro. 
Departing, he closes the soundstage door. 
As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard. GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the world. In front of him: 
AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins. Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands. p. 2 
Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping over to the crane. 
Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in every sense a jumble of ideas. 
Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands, overwhelmed. 
THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES 
GUIDO (V.O.) Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini... How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page 1... Page nothing... 
In the distance, a figure approaches out of the darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An escape from his tortured reality. 
The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face, and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of GUIDO'S FANTASY. 
As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from his films, women he has loved, the sources of his inspiration and creative genius. 
A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own powerful entrance: 
LUISA, his wife 
CARLA, his mistress 
LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice 
GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit 
STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist 
PIERPAOLO There's no room on your desk. 
- into the main office - 
GUIDO Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so. 
PIERPAOLO (waving them at him) Some of these are urgent! 
GUIDO (to Pierpaolo) Get me a cigarette. 
JACONELLI (confidentially) We will never be ready to shoot in ten days. 
GUIDO Jaconelli - 
FAUSTO (at the same time) Not ready?! 
GUIDO (continues) Ascolta me. (MORE) p. 6 
GUIDO (CONT'D) (he kisses Jaconelli on the cheek) Careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank. 
Guido carries on moving through the office. 
DANTE He's not exactly from the bank, Guido. 
Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head towards Guido's office. 
BENITO Dottore, Dottore. You have actors waiting for you in your office. Auditions all morning. You should see what I've found. I found two sisters. Look, they're right... 
Guido turns through another partition, as they all besiege him with questions. Benito despairs. 
BENITO (CONT'D) Dottore, this way... 
Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him. 
Dante blocks Benito. 
BENITO (CONT'D) Maestro! 
DANTE Not now. He's got the Press Conference. 
INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY 
Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage. 
They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric. 
GUIDO I need a cigarette. 
Dante comes in, closing the door behind him. p. 7 
DANTE He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli. 
Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call. 
GUIDO I need a coffee and a cigarette. 
He lies down. 
LILLI (unimpressed) Answer a question, I'll give you a coffee. Answer another question, I'll give you a cigarette. And so on. 
GUIDO Actually and an aspirin. 
Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some drawings. 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY 
LEOPARDI Signor Contini. Artists do their best work before they're famous. Now you're famous. Without wishing to be negative - but your last two films, they're not, they were... 
GUIDO Flops. 
LEOPARDI Your word. Flops. p. 15 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
GUIDO AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS NEARING TEN. 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY 
LEOPARDI I'm just asking if you're nervous? You seem nervous... 
This stops Guido. He doesn't answer. We see a bead of sweat running down the back of Guido's neck. 
Everyone waits. 
GUIDO Excuse me? 
LEOPARDI What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you run out of things to say? 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
As the number progresses, Guido gets up from his chair and begins to scale the enormous heights of his unfinished set, with great effort. 
GUIDO I CAN HARDLY STAY UP AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP, AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROW MORNING, AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY? AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE HERE - ONLY ME I WANT TO BE YOUNG. AND I WANT TO BE OLD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE WISE BEFORE MY TIME AND YET BE FOOLISH AND BRASH AND BOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, "GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, WE'LL ARRANGE IT." THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT. p. 16 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY 
STEPHANIE I was wondering if you think there's a limit to what you can show in a movie. 
GUIDO What would you like to see that I haven't already shown you? 
She smiles, he smiles back, lighting his cigarette. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
GUIDO I AM LUSTING FOR MORE, SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS? I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS? ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET: THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET. 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY 
Guido turns to the mantle. He grabs a bottle of whiskey, looks up into the large gilded mirror at his reflection. We see two Guidos. 
GUIDO (V.O.) I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ME TO TRAVEL ALONG WITH MYSELF. I WOULD EVEN LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SING A DUET WITH MYSELF. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
GUIDO I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE (SING ALONG WITH MYSELF IN A SONG) TO BE THERE (WALKING DOWN A LANE NOW), EVERYWHERE (EVERYWHERE) EVERYWHERE, THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS I WANT TO BE HERE (WITH A COUNTER-) HERE (MELODY IN THE) HERE (TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU GUIDO) GUIDO (GUIDO) GUIDO (GUIDO) GUIDO. ME (ME) ME! I WANT TO BE PROUST... p. 17 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY 
Amidst the chaos, Guido notices a waiter with a tray of glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the wall. As the waiter passes, Guido slyly opens the door and sneaks out. 
GUIDO (V.O.) ...OR THE MARQUIS DE SADE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRIST, MOHAMMED, BUDDHA BUT NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD. AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART - IT'S THE END IF SOMETHING IMPORTANT DOESN'T START... 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Guido continues climbing higher and higher. 
GUIDO ...I WANT TO BE YOUNG, BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD. WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND AND FURY THAT SOME IDIOT WENT AND TOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, "GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S RIDICULOUS, WE'LL ARRANGE IT..." 
GUIDO (doleful) Please. 
DE ROSSI (suggesting a name) Signor Milano? 
GUIDO Why not. 
DE ROSSI (continuing to work) Needless to say, I love your films. Guilty pleasure. Those early films. 
GUIDO Not the flops. (anxious, confidential) I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet...? I'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible. 
DE ROSSI Consider it done. Please. p. 20 
GUIDO (takes the key) And I need to place a call.   To my wife. 
Guido writes the number on a piece of paper on the desk. 
DE ROSSI You can take the call at the lobby phone over there. 
INT. TELEPHONE KIOSK, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY 
Guido heads into the elegant Art Deco booth, pulls the glass door shut. The phone rings. He picks up. 
INT. CONTINI HOME, ROME / TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY 
We intercut between the phone booth and LUISA in their apartment in Rome... Luisa knows every move of Guido's. She manages him very well, calm, dry and funny. 
GUIDO Luisa, tesoro... 
LUISA There you are. 
GUIDO Is everybody mad at me? 
LUISA Well, I'm mad at you.   Where are you? 
GUIDO I had to escape from the Press Conference. 
LUISA I heard. Dramatic. 
GUIDO Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa. 
LUISA You're making a film. You make a film, you get sick. It's what happens. 
GUIDO No, but this time I'm really sick.      I can't breathe. p. 21 
LUISA Are you by yourself? 
GUIDO Yes, of course I'm by myself. 
LUISA Then shall I come? 
GUIDO Yes, please come, that's why I'm calling, please come straight away. That would be wonderful. 
LUISA Okay. 
GUIDO Great. Marvellous. 
LUISA I don't know where you are. 
GUIDO I don't know, some spa.   Horrible.   I just kept driving. 
LUISA Well I can't come if I don't know where you are. 
GUIDO (suddenly claustrophobic) And, actually, it's hardly worth it. I'll be home in a day or two. 
CARLA GUIDO... 
DOCTOR ...the Roman emperors came here for the waters... 
Guido lunges for the ringing phone, with the blood pressure cuff still on his arm, and picks it up. It is CARLA, at the perfect wrong time. 
GUIDO (into the phone) Pronto. p. 24 
DE ROSSI (V.O.) Signor Contini, it's the Signora. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY 
WE SEE ISOLATED IMAGES OF A SEDUCTIVE BODY: A LONG LEG IN SHEER BLACK STOCKINGS, A SHAPELY ASS, MAGNIFICENT BREASTS. 
CARLA I WAS LAZING AROUND MY BEDROOM WHEN YOU CALLED AND AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING ABOUT, GUIDO... 
GUIDO (coming back quickly to life) It's a very an important call, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private call. 
DOCTOR As you wish. 
FANTASY: 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
An enormous swathe of pink satin rakes across the scaffolding of Guido's unfinished set. Emerging from the highest point is a pair of long legs sliding down the lush fabric. She wears stockings, heels and little else. Bathed in hot light, Carla reveals herself from inside the sumptuous folds of satin. 
CARLA WHO'S NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES? I'M NOT! MY DARLING, WHO'S AFRAID TO KISS YOUR TOES? I'M NOT! YOUR MAMA DEAR IS BLOWING INTO YOUR EAR, SO YOU'LL GET IT LOUD AND CLEAR, I NEED YOU TO SQUEEZE ME HERE... AND HERE... AND HERE... 
INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY 
The Nurse, still taking his blood pressure and listening to his pulse, is concerned about Guido's vital signs. p. 25 
NURSE Doctor... His pulse... it's racing. 
DOCTOR (to Guido) Is something wrong? 
GUIDO What? Yes, yes. It's about my film. It's from the Vatican. Go ahead, Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm listening. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Carla slides from the lush fabric onto a mirrored platform. As she sings, she writhes and undulates in a seductive display of sexuality. This is Guido's ultimate fantasy. 
CARLA COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE COO. I'VE GOT A PLAN FOR WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU, SO HOT YOU'RE GONNA STEAM, AND SCREAM, AND VIBRATE LIKE A STRING I'M PLUCKING- KISS YOUR FEVERED LITTLE BROW PINCH YOUR CHEEKS TILL YOU SAY "OW," AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SHOW YOU HOW, GUIDO. 
INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY 
Guido trying to hide the effects of this phone sex from the Doctor and Nurse. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Carla grabs onto two satin-covered ropes, suspended from the ceiling. She wraps herself in them, swinging and gyrating. 
CARLA WHO WON'T CARE IF YOU COME TO ME TIRED AND OVERWORKED? I WON'T! BAMBINO, WHO KNOWS A THERAPY TO BEAT WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM ME? I DON'T! BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH FOR NOW, GUIDO, CIAO. (MORE) p. 26 
CARLA (CONT'D) (spoken) I love you, Guido. 
Carla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes the steam from an arriving train. 
EXT. ANZIO, TRAIN STATION - DAY 
And out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her, pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She wears it with pride. 
CARLA Guido!    Ciao! 
Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it exactly as he wants it. 
CARLA I had a nightmare last night. We were in that little alley behind Piazza Navona, where I bought you that scarf, remember? The same one your wife bought you-- 
GUIDO (probably doesn't) Don't move, Carla. 
CARLA When you wear it, I never know if it's hers or mine. 
GUIDO (not really listening) Uh-huh. 
CARLA So we were there, on the ground, naked, kissing, and we didn't care, and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi! (MORE) p. 29 
CARLA (CONT'D) He would never do that! He's so sweet. He speaks Latin! He knows all the Roman Emperors. 
GUIDO (still intent on his makeup job) Good for him. 
CARLA Perhaps there's a job for him in the movie-- 
GUIDO Why not? 
CARLA You could work well together. 
GUIDO Beautiful. When you come in I want you to be my little savage. 
CARLA Yes. 
GUIDO (gesturing towards the door) Go, go. 
Guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side table.. 
CARLA You think I am one of your actresses? 
GUIDO Hurry, please, Carla. 
Carla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her. Guido turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for the game. Carla looks at herself in the mirror. 
CARLA Oh, Madonna! 
GUIDO I'll pretend to be asleep. 
Carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's glasses and turns back to him. 
CARLA What if I really found the wrong room? Would you be jealous? p. 30 
GUIDO Could you do such a thing? 
Carla teases him with a look that says, "Why not?" 
CARLA (coyly) Hm! Who knows? 
Carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind her. We HEAR the MATRON who runs the Pensione talking to her. While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer. 
Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling for Guido to keep quiet. 
GUIDO What happened? 
CARLA (still giggling) It was the woman from the hotel. She wanted to give me towels. 
GUIDO Come here. 
CARLA Okay. 
GUIDO What? 
GUIDO (explaining) I'm in need of some guidance, some pointers... 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY Do you think you could find a signed photograph of Signorina Jenssen? p. 33 
GUIDO For His Excellency? 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY Si. 
GUIDO I'm sure that would be possible... 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY Truly?   What a pleasure. Arrivederci, Maestro. 
He heads towards the elevator. Guido watches him go, then a voice calls out his name....GUIDO! Guido can't turn round. He knows that voice. 
DANTE Guidino! 
Guido hurries towards the elevator. The elevator doors close. Guido is trapped. 
GUIDO I'm not going to ask how you found me. 
DANTE Please - it's my job. A producer needs to know where his director is at all times...even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying... 
GUIDO Oh God. 
DANTE I understand, Guido. Rome is absolutely unbearable. The pressure. It's no good. 
GUIDO Really?    You understand? 
He takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell. 
INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - STAIRCASE - DAY 
DANTE Of course I understand.      Absolutely. 
GUIDO You're not going to drag me back? 
DANTE No. You're a genius and genius must be served. p. 34 
GUIDO Thank you, my old friend. (Dante is guiding him) Where are we going? 
DANTE You can't be in Rome. Okay. (heading towards the ballroom) 
INT. GRAND BALLROOM, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY 
DANTE Rome will come to you! 
Dante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full PRODUCTION OFFICE, ART DEPARTMENT, COSTUME DEPARTMENT, CASTING OFFICE. The models, costumes, headshots, everything all in place or being put into place. An absolute beehive of activity. Guido is staggered. 
DANTE (CONT'D) It's a fantastic place for you to focus. Everyone is here to help the movie. Everyone is here because they love you, Guido. 
He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he sets to work with his team. Guido moves through the room avoiding specific questions from everyone. As he does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a magnificent girl on his arm. 
JACONELLI (explaining his designs) Yes, with the flower and the glass and the arches of the Roman Empire... 
DANTE Guido...you remember Donatella. 
DONATELLA Ciao. 
GUIDO (he doesn't, she's new) Ciao. 
DANTE Donatella, you tested her. 
DONATELLA I was very nervous. He probably doesn't remember. I was quite nervous. p. 35 
MEMORY: 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
SUPERTITLE:   Pesaro, Italy, 1926 
Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes with five boys from the village. 
The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the war. 
They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand it to Young Guido, already the ring leader. 
They crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker... 
EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY 
...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back. 
YOUNG GUIDO (not loud enough) Saraghina. (louder) Saraghina. 
Now all the boys join in. 
BOYS Saraghina!   Saraghina! 
YOUNG GUIDO (loudest) Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina! 
A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps back. 
And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on Carla. 
She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having her own fun with them. 
She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand. p. 44 
Young Guido opens his hand with the coins. 
She looks at the money.   Is it enough? 
But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes the coins. 
She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready for the "show." 
Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body... 
A dark vamp begins. 
FANTASY: 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage. 
Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs. 
SARAGHINA So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you...and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
With a smile, she pulls her dress off her shoulders. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
SARAGHINA (sings) BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. TAKE A CHANCE, AND TRY TO STEAL A FIERY KISS. BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. WHEN YOU HOLD ME, DON'T JUST HOLD ME BUT HOLD THIS! 
LILLI That I would pay to see. 
GUIDO Luisa was in that film. 
LILLI She was the best thing in the movie. 
GUIDO It's true.   It was your first part. 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh my Lord! 
LUISA I was. 
Music begins. 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY You can't stop being somebody. 
LUISA Can't you? p. 52 
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY Well there's a good catholic wife for you, Guido, that's what they do - sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it must be a very exciting life for you... 
Luisa looks to Guido.   Close up on Guido. 
FANTASY: 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
The restaurant table as well as the production team are transplanted onto Guido's unfinished set. They are surrounded by camera equipment, standing lighting units, etc. Luisa rises from her chair, distancing herself from the scene. The other characters, with the exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre tableau. 
Luisa contemplates her life with Guido. 
LUISA MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES TO MAKE THEM HE LIVES A KIND OF DREAM IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM- HE MAY BE ON TO SOME UNIQUE ROMANTIC THEME. SOME MEN RUN BANKS SOME RULE THE WORLD SOME EARN THEIR LIVING BAKING BREAD. MY HUSBAND.... HE GOES A LITTLE CRAZY MAKING MOVIES INSTEAD. MY HUSBAND SPINS FANTASIES, HE LIVES THEM, THEN GIVES THEM TO YOU ALL LIKE MICHELANGELO, HE PAINTS HIS PRIVATE DOME BUT CAN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT'S HIS WORK AND WHAT'S HIS HOME. SOME MEN SELL STOCKS SOME MEN PUNCH CLOCKS SOME LEAP WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD. MY HUSBAND, AS AUTHOR AND DIRECTOR, MAKES UP STORIES IN HIS HEAD. 
As the number progresses, the world around Luisa disappears into a black void, leaving only herself, with Guido in the shadows. Luisa climbs the staircase. 
LUISA (CONT'D) GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI: NUMBER ONE GENIUS AND NUMBER ONE FAN. (MORE) p. 53 
LUISA (CONT'D) GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI: PASSIONATE WOMAN IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN LONG AGO - MANY YEARS AGO. ONCE WE TWO WERE- GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA HIS LOVER: ACTRESS WITH DREAMS AND A LIFE OF HER OWN, THEN WE HAD NO END OF WORLDS TO DISCOVER, SINGING TOGETHER ALL NIGHT ON THE PHONE LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO... 
MEMORY: 
INT. INSERT STAGE - DAY 
Luisa's screen test for Guido. A work print in scratched black and white. The music continues. 
CLAPPER LOADER (O.S.) Signorina Acari, per favore. Provino numero uno. Luisa Acari. 
The clapper board. TITLE: IL VICOLO (The Alley)    Her name: LUISA ACARI. 
A small set. A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona.   Luisa enters, younger, she's like Audrey Hepburn... 
Luisa sits on the chair. 
GUIDO (O.S.) Your name, it's Italian. 
LUISA My father's Italian. My mother's French. 
GUIDO (O.S.) What have you done before? 
LUISA (eyes twinkling) Oh, I've waited... 
GUIDO (O.S.) Waited? For this? 
LUISA Waited tables. (they both laugh) And, of course, I studied theatre and mime in Paris. But, mostly waited tables. p. 54 
CARLA Well, she could have warned you. 
GUIDO The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me. 
He walks over to the front desk, to the ubiquitous De Rossi. 
GUIDO O.S A taxi, please, for the Signora. 
DE ROSSI O.S. Right away. 
Guido goes back to the suddenly vulnerable Carla. 
GUIDO Carla, you have to wait outside. 
CARLA Will you wait with me? 
GUIDO I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues. 
CARLA So why do I have to wait outside? 
GUIDO (shamed) I'll find someone to escort you home. 
He disappears. Carla walks towards the door, conscious of De Rossi. She's humiliated. De Rossi comes out from behind his desk, approaches her. p. 57 
DE ROSSI (carefully) Signora, would you rather wait inside? 
CARLA I'm going to walk.   Please tell my friend I had to leave. 
She walks away. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
Carla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling along. 
INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT 
Guido enters. The two single beds. Luisa is apparently asleep in hers. Guido sits on his bed. Glum. 
GUIDO Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station. 
Luisa doesn't move. 
GUIDO (CONT'D) Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she would be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? Think about it. I didn't even know you were coming. 
LUISA (without opening her eyes) Very plausible. 
GUIDO Because it's true. 
Luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed. 
LUISA You told me it was finished. 
GUIDO It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin. 
Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly. p. 58 
GUIDO (CONT'D) (smiles, insecure) What? What are you laughing about? 
LUISA Nothing. If you could see yourself. (raising herself up further) I couldn't live with it - the absurdity of being you, the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat. It's exhausting, no wonder you've got no script, you're too busy inventing your own life. 
GUIDO It's finished. It's finished. (and he is exhausted) If it wasn't before, it is now. 
LUISA (lying back on her bed) Blah blah blah blah blah. 
STEPHANIE (CONT'D) It's the Italian man in you: pays for your drinks, undresses you with his eyes... 
FLASH: A SUDDEN IMAGE OF A WOMAN'S HIP THRUST. 
GUIDO I hate that man. 
STEPHANIE No! Style is the new content! It's what my readers love. They want to dress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to undress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to ride on a Vespa down the Via Veneto. They want to live in an Italian movie. 
FANTASY: 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
The tiered levels of the unfinished set are covered with go-go girls in silver miniskirts. At the center of the stage, Italian male models in stylish suits and Ray Bans strut down a fashion runway. 
Stephanie makes her entrance on the catwalk. p. 61 
STEPHANIE I LOVE THE BLACK AND WHITE! I LOVE THE PLAY OF LIGHT! THE WAY CONTINI PUTS HIS IMAGE THROUGH A PRISM. 
INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 
Guido lights Stephanie's cigarette. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
STEPHANIE I FEEL MY BODY CHILL GIVES ME A SPECIAL THRILL EACH TIME I SEE THAT GUIDO NEO-REALISM 
INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 
Guido and Stephanie share a laugh as she steals a sip from Guido's glass. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Stephanie leads the men in a series of tight, rhythmic moves. 
STEPHANIE I LOVE THE DARK AND HANDSOME GUYS WITH THEIR SKINNY LITTLE TIES DRESSIN' MOD, LOOKIN' OUTTA SIGHT! I LOVE TO WATCH `EM AS THEY CRUISE WITH THEIR POINTY LEATHER SHOES WEARIN' SHADES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. 
INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 
Stephanie rubs her leg against Guido's. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 
Stephanie whispers into Guido's ear, as she drops her room key into his pocket. He watches her hips swing as she walks out. Guido plays with her room key, deciding whether or not to follow. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
A long line of chic women replace the men on the runway, joining Stephanie. 
STEPHANIE THOSE SCENES I LOVE TO SEE FROM GUIDO'S "P" "O" "V" THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WITH HIS UNIQUE DIRECTOR'S VISION. HIS ANGLES - WIDE AND TIGHT - EACH MOMENT FEELS SO RIGHT...

DRUM BREAK.   The number heats up. 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Guido goes in with the Matron to find her DAUGHTER pressing a cold compress onto Carla's head as she lies, feverish in the bed. DOCTOR RONDI is packing up his things. 
CARLA (distant) You came. 
GUIDO (taking her hand) I'm here. 
Doctor Rondi is brisk.   He nods to Guido that they go outside. 
DOCTOR RONDI Signor Contini. 
As Guido makes to leave - 
CARLA Come back. 
Guido reassures her with a gesture. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Guido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned. Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks. 
DOCTOR RONDI She took five or six pills, enough to make herself very sick. I understand she's your mistress. (Guido can't answer) This is a sordid business. You movie people, I suppose you don't consider yourself bound by morality... 
Guido doesn't fight. Rondi hands him the prescription, picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido leaning against the wall... 
MEMORY: 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Young Guido, alone and dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes. p. 66 
MAMMA (O.S.) Guido? Dove corri? Where are you running to? 
INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT 
... the door knob turns. Guido comes back into the room, indicates to the Matron and her daughter that they should leave. 
GUIDO Thank you.    I'm going to stay with her now. 
MATRON If you need us for anything, just call, okay? Francesca, andiamo. 
GUIDO Grazie. 
He sits on the side of the bed and puts his hand over hers. 
GUIDO (CONT'D) Carla, I should call your husband. 
CARLA No, he'll take me home. 
GUIDO What have you done to yourself?    I'm not worth dying for, Carla. 
CARLA Don't be angry with me. Everything I do, I just want you to love me. 
This comes out with enormous tenderness, as if she suddenly understands herself. 
CARLA (CONT'D) When you're not here with me, I'm still here. When you're in your life, making your movies, dancing with your wife - I'm still here. 
Guido hears her.    Knows what she's saying is true.   She looks at him. 
GUIDO Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning... 
He stands and pulls a sheet up over her. p. 67 
CARLA (Clutching at him) Don't leave me. Don't leave me. 
GUIDO Yes. 
LUIGI I'd like to take her home. 
GUIDO Of course. I'm sorry. (hapless) She loves you, you know that, don't you. 
LUIGI She's my wife. 
He walks into the room. Guido stands outside for a second, then turns to go. 
INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY 
The door is open as Guido enters. He's confused, worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a closet. 
GUIDO Darling? 
Dante appears, stuffing Guido's things into a suitcase. 
DANTE We're going back to Rome. 
GUIDO (anxious) Where's Luisa? 
DANTE Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with you. (different tone) And quite frankly, so have I. You drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear. (MORE) p. 70 
DANTE (CONT'D) I can't protect you anymore. And Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start today. Remember? 
GUIDO (sits) I can't. 
DANTE You can't. You must. Don't sit down. 
GUIDO I need help. 
DANTE (still packing) You've had help. You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure. 
GUIDO I'm not cured. 
DANTE (decisive, no arguments) That's enough! The movie calls, your star has landed. Fausto - take his things please. 
Dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing Fausto. A Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall. 
DANTE (CONT'D) (impatient, at the door) Guido! Andiamo! 
EXT. GATES OF CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON 
Guido's Roadster approaches the gates. There are PAPARAZZI gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the beginning of filming. They drive through, solemn faced, ignoring the press. 
GUIDO (O.S.) I need more time. 
DANTE (O.S.) Forget the script. Claudia's here now. She'll inspire you to do what you do best, write with your camera. p. 71 
EXT. CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON 
The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic, people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work, everybody and everything needing Guido's attention. 
Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesn't exist. 
Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests for Guido... 
PIERPAOLO Maestro, the screen tests are back from the lab. Will you watch them now? 
DANTE Tonight.   We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions. 
PIERPAOLO Design meeting? Production meeting? 
CLAUDIA Yes, I can turn to my left. 
GUIDO Now just one slow turn for us. 
CLAUDIA (she turns around) Okay, one slow turn. 
GUIDO Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut. 
PIERPAOLO We've got it. Next costume please. 
Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately surround her, loosening her hair. 
Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised.    She's a star, that's the long and short of it. p. 74 
And she's warming up for a fight with her director. Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous. 
CLAUDIA Has anybody got a script? Script missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one script, title Italia. Can't make a film without it... 
Lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on Claudia, adjusts her hair. 
CLAUDIA (CONT'D) So interesting to do hair and makeup for a part when you don't know what the part is. 
Guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness. 
CLAUDIA (CONT'D) (shrugs off the coat) No! I'm going back to my hotel now. 
PIERPAOLO (anxious) But please, just a couple more costumes, Claudia. 
CLAUDIA (to Guido) I'm going back to my hotel now, my darling, and when I there is a script, I'll read it and then we'll take it from there. (calls over to Lilli) I love the costumes, Lilli. They are beautiful. (back to the guys, sweetly) Ciao Bello. 
GUIDO That's fair. 
DANTE Claudia! 
GUIDO (to Dante) That's fair. 
DANTE Fair? 
GUIDO I'll be back. p. 75 
Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape. 
DANTE (calling to Guido) You've got dailies, Guido. 
GUIDO I'll be right back. 
DANTE (shouting) You've got meetings. 
EXT. CINECITTA - NIGHT 
Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car, flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a picture of the Star driving away with her Director. Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas and little cars. 
INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT 
Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse following.   Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her in the car, she's such a class act. He's always inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her. 
GUIDO You look ravishing. 
CLAUDIA You're not seeing me, you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere hidden underneath. 
Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up, they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake a car, they speed after him. 
EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT 
CLAUDIA When there's a camera between us. 
GUIDO No. 
CLAUDIA It's not a real person, Guido. (pointed) And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love. 
CLAUDIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I OWE WHAT I AM TO YOU. 
EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT 
Claudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient fountain in the centre of the square. The Piazza is empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances have been blocked off. Claudia steps up onto the fountain. p. 79 
GUIDO There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about... 
Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain. 
GUIDO (CONT'D) ...and, all through the night, I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened. 
CLAUDIA And why didn't you? 
GUIDO I don't know. I don't know. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
CLAUDIA SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE, SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I MET YOU. HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU, ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL. IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE. 
EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT 
Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves closer to Guido. The music continues. 
CLAUDIA Maybe you should have knocked, maybe you should have knocked me right off the pedestal. I can't do this anymore. 
She takes off her wig and diamond earrings. 
CLAUDIA (CONT'D) This is me.   And you have a wife who loves you. 
She hands him the wig and the earrings.    She kisses him. 
CLAUDIA (CONT'D) I'll miss you. Wrong girl. 
The music ends.   Claudia turns and walks away. p. 80 
INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT 
A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically. 
Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up. 
DANTE (to Lilli) Great work, Lilli... Wonderful costume... 
LILLI Thank you. 
DANTE ...and the hair, makeup, fantastic. 
Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not Luisa. 
BENITO She has a beautiful profile. 
DANTE Two great profiles. 
FAUSTO She's a goddess. 
DANTE And the back isn't too bad. 
GUIDO It meant so much to us all.    That you came. (MORE) p. 83 
GUIDO (CONT'D) (nothing from Luisa) What did you think? Did you like anybody or -? (nothing) Luisa? 
FANTASY: 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
THE BEAT OF A STRIPPER'S DRUM. 
A gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain, beckoning. The curtain opens, revealing the silhouette of a figure bathed in red light. 
Guido sits in an audience of raucous men who have filled all the seats around him. They start to whistle as if they were at some sleazy club. Guido squirms, trapped. 
The figure steps forward. It's Luisa, tricked out like a seedy nightclub stripper. 
LUISA YOU WANT MY LOVE? TAKE IT ALL YOU WANT TO WATCH IT ALL COME OFF? TAKE IT ALL COME ON NOW SHOW ME HOW YOU TAKE IT ALL... 
INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT 
LUISA Thank you. 
GUIDO (encouraged) What for? 
LUISA Thank you for reminding me I'm not special. You don't even see what you do, do you? Even the moments I think are ours, it's just you working to get what you want. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Luisa strips. p. 84 
LUISA YOU WANT MY GLOVE? ARE YOU ENTHRALLED? YOU WANT TO SEE IT SLIP AWAY AND WATCH IT FALL? OH WE KNOW IT'S YOUR SHOW SO TAKE IT ALL 
INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT 
GUIDO (dawning on him) What are you talking about? 
He stands up, leans on the chair back. 
GUIDO (CONT'D) The screen test? You have to understand, it's nothing, this is what I do, I direct. That's my job. 
Guido stands up straight. 
LUISA And this is our life. You think to create is to forgive yourself in public. Fine. But don't think I can forgive you in private, because I can't ever. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
As the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes her body and her contempt for Guido. Guido watches, humiliated. 
LUISA SO GO AHEAD TAKE IT ALL 
YOU WANT MY SOUL? TAKE IT ALL! 
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE. IF I'M TO LIVE. BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE... 
Instrumental. 
Luisa charges into the audience: she is mauled and assaulted by the men. p. 85 
LUISA (CONT'D) I WATCH YOU RISE! I WATCH YOU FALL! WHILE I AM STANDING WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE WALL NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO FINALLY LEARN 
YOU HAD THE WORLD YOU HAD YOUR FLING YOU WANTED MORE THAN EVERYTHING YOU GOT YOUR WISH YOU GOT YOUR PRIZE NOW TAKE IT RIGHT BETWEEN YOUR THIGHS YOU GRABBED FOR EVERYTHING MY FRIEND BUT DON'T YOU SEE THAT IN THE END THERE WILL BE NOTHING! 
INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT 
EXT. BEACH CAFE, ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON 
It's the end of the season. Only a few customers left in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day, pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables. 
Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt. Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper, folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant. 
He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes - 
EXT. ROME, THEATER - NIGHT 
Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play, DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI. 
Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie. 
Guido watches from a distance. 
Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross and head down the street. 
EXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAY 
Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront.   People pass by occasionally. They talk - 
LILLI I'm glad she's acting again. I made her costumes for the play. She's funny. 
GUIDO She seemed so happy. I didn't want to interfere... Is she with anybody? 
LILLI Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her mother. I don't know. I expect so. Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard. p. 89 
GUIDO I like to get about without everybody pointing at me. 
LILLI And where are you getting about? 
GUIDO Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk. 
LILLI Are you seeing anybody? 
GUIDO No, no. Nobody. 
LILLI (teasing) Well, it sounds exciting. Walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard.   I might come up here and join you. 
GUIDO Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is - 
LILLI - I know. 
GUIDO I just miss her. I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead. 
LILLI Luisa certainly thinks so. 
GUIDO (grasping at this) Does she? Did she really say that? 
LILLI Stop! I'm not going to act as a postman between you both. Come back to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work. 
He sits.   Lilli joins him. 
GUIDO No. Never. I've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up. p. 90 
LILLI You're such a dope, aren't you? Making movies wasn't your problem. You were your problem.   Don't stop being a child. You'll never make another movie! Nobody wants that... especially Luisa. 
She indicates the people who pass. 
LILLI (CONT'D) Guido - there probably isn't a single person passing by who hasn't been touched in some way by one of your movies. That's your gift. That's what you've been given. Use it. Just use it with some grace. For Chrissake. 
GUIDO (doubtful) The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife.

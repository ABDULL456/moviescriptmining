"VERY BAD THINGS"

Peter Berg 
September 2, 1997 
FADE IN: 
TITLE SEQUENCE 
THE DEAD OF NIGHT 
Pitch black. Dead quiet. Dim faint light appears in the distance, approaching, growing larger. As the light nears, we recognize car headlights. Closer and closer until the car is bearing down upon us with great force... 
INT. CAR 
Two men in the front seat, FISHER and MOORE. Fisher drives. All seems quite normal until we take a closer look, sweat matts hair, dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are blistered and bloody. They seem almost entranced. 
MOORE That ought to be about the end of that. 
FISHER Yup. 
SILENCE. PUSH IN ON Fisher... 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) "The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 - 6 lead in a, tough, football game and this crowd is standing..." 
FISHER'S VISION - GRAINY - OUT OF THE PAST THREE RIVER STADIUM - DECEMBER 23RD, 1972 
Playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Scoreboard reads: 22 seconds, 4th down, 10 yards to go, 4th quarter. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) "Hang on to your hats, here come the Steelers out of the Huddle..." 
INT. CAR - FISHER 
transfixed... 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) "It comes down to one big play, 4th down, ten yards to go. Terry Bradshaw at the controls..." 
Bradshaw throws. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) "And Bradshaw, back and looking...Again, Bradshaw running out of the pocket... Looking for someone to throw to..." 
Bradshaw throws. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Bradshaw fires it down the field and there's a collision!..." 
The ball bounces off the helmet of a Raider player and is caught low by the Steelers' FRANCO HARRIS. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) "...and it's caught out of the air! The ball is pulled in by Franco Harris!" 
FISHER - DRIVING 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Franco Harris running for the end zone, all but home..." 
Oncoming headlights illuminate Fisher's face... 
END TITLES. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE IN ON: 
INT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - MARRIAGE LICENSE DEPT. - DAY 
SLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids, some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick up their marriage license. 
We HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him, unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow moving line. 
LIZ This is ridiculous. 
FISHER Government cutbacks. 
LIZ Why can't we do it through the mail? 
FISHER (patient) We missed the deadline. 
LIZ Can't we do it on the phone? 
FISHER I don't think so. 
In front of them a middle-aged MEXICAN COUPLE make-out intensely while their chubby little THREE YEAR OLD stares at Liz. 
LIZ Well it's bad timing. 
FISHER How do you figure? 
LIZ Right before the wedding? 
FISHER It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding. 
LIZ I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this. 
FISHER He is. 
LIZ He's a moron. 
FISHER He's my friend. He's not a moron. 
LIZ David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas. 
EXT. SANTA MONICA 
TIGHT ON a "Fred Sands" realty sign being pounded into the ground. Pictured on the sign, as "offered by," is realtor DAVID BOYD, 30-ish, short hair, smiling with bizarre sincerity. 
WIDER to reveal, David Boyd in the flesh, suit jacket off, pounding away, sinking the sign into the front yard of a cute little house. His CELL PHONE RINGS. Boyd, gets the phone from his jacket. 
BOYD (into phone) David Boyd. Tina. Great. Okay. Here's the deal, we're talking five guys. Hard Rock. Nice guys Tina. My friends. Yeah. I'm calling you directly so you don't have to go through the agency... (suddenly, over his shoulder) HEY! DO NOT ENTER THE HOUSE! (back into phone) That's correct. Cash straight to you. Yes. Twelve hundred? I don't think so. It's just stripping. Just a show. Hold on. (O.C.) Could you please wait off the property? 
ANGLE ON A YOUNG COUPLE, obviously here to see the house. 
MAN We're just trying to sneak a peak. 
BOYD Just stay off the property until I'm off the phone. 
MAN Why? 
BOYD Cause that's the way they do it. 
Bewildered and somewhat intimidated, they back off. 
BOYD (back into phone) So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino. Nine hundred bucks and you do the thing with the rubber hoses. Are you in? Tina, are you in? Good. 
Boyd hangs up, puts on his jacket and turns with the same bizarre insincere smile in his photo. Hand extended... 
BOYD David Boyd, nice to meet you. 
FISHER AND LIZ IN LINE 
LIZ Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality? 
FISHER What are you talking about? 
LIZ I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with... about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself. 
FISHER I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth. 
LIZ I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships... 
FISHER Who else? 
LIZ Charles Moore for instants. 
FISHER You don't like Moore? Since when? 
LIZ It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Growning. And I want you keeping up with me here. 
FISHER What does Moore have to do with your growing? 
LIZ I just don't see him in the big picture. 
FISHER I've known him since Cub Scouts. 
LIZ He's weird. 
FISHER He's quiet. 
LIZ He's weird. 
TIGHT ON - CHARLES MOORE 
Late twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy KITCHEN. His name, "Moore," is embroidered on his white chef's jacket. 
Food orders fly all around as Moore works with a mesmerizing focus, a poetic sense of purpose, fifteen things going on at once; he chops, sautes, braises, etc..., in a perfect mute silence. 
FISHER AND LIZ STILL IN LINE 
ADAM (to Michael) We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then. 
MICHAEL First of all... 
ADAM (cuts him off) No first of all. I'm not in a game mood. 
MICHAEL You're interrupting a personal conversation. 
ADAM (to Fisher) Sorry Fish. 
FISHER We'll be ready Adam. 
ADAM I know you'll be. (to Michael) Three hours. 
Adam goes. 
MICHAEL I don't care for him. 
FISHER He's your brother. 
MICHAEL So? 
Fisher's phone RINGS. 
FISHER (pick's up) Keith Fisher. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Liz sits at the kitchen table, in a mild panic. 
LIZ (into phone) We've got problems here. 
FISHER Problems? 
INTERCUT Liz and Fisher. 
LIZ Seating problems. 
FISHER Okay. 
LIZ Keith do not trivialize this. 
FISHER I'm not. What's the problem? 
LIZ We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded. 
FISHER What kind of seats can we have? 
LIZ Not padded ones. 
FISHER So what do we do? 
LIZ You go down there. 
FISHER Go down where? 
LIZ Go down to the seat place and straighten this out. 
FISHER Honey I don't have the time... 
LIZ I need your help. 
FISHER We're leaving in three hours. 
LIZ (starts to cry) I need your help. 
FISHER I'll call them from the road. 
LIZ Do you love me? 
FISHER More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever. 
LIZ Take care of those chairs. 
FISHER We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off. 
LIZ Maybe. 
EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SANTA MONICA 
BOYD, MOORE, FISHER in the middle, MICHAEL and his older brother, ADAM, all in suits pose in front of Adam's brand new, state of the art, Chevy Minivan while Adam's very aggressive wife, LOIS, mired in domestic resentment, focuses her camera. 
LOIS Notice how clean and well-behaved they all appear, respectable members of modern society. Timmy, Adam Jr., take a good look at this... 
ADAM Multiple reasons. 
MICHAEL Name one. 
ADAM I don't have to... 
FISHER SHUT UP! 
DEAD SILENCE. As they ride through the lifeless desert, Fisher dials his cell phone. 
FISHER (into phone) Is this Pico Party rents? Can I speak to whomever is in charge of chairs? Chairs. 
Boyd checks his watch. 
BOYD Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change. 
ADAM I'm not getting a ticket. 
FISHER (on cell phone) Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold. 
BOYD Who's up for making some real money? 
ADAM Don't even start. 
BOYD You want to hear me out? 
MICHAEL Nope. 
BOYD Moore? 
MOORE No I don't. 
BOYD Fish? 
FISHER Not really. (into phone) Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs... 
BOYD Prison Communication Systems. (no response) An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir. 
Nobody gives a fuck. 
FISHER (into phone) No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay. 
BOYD That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars. 
FISHER (into phone) We need padded chairs. 
BOYD Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English... 
ADAM SHUT UP! 
MICHAEL NO! 
BOYD What is wrong with you people? I'm a helper here. 
MOORE Your investment ideas never work out. 
BOYD That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big. 
MICHAEL Your ideas never work out. 
BOYD Oh really? Starbucks? 
ADAM That's one idea. 
FISHER (into phone) No... we want padded chairs... okay? 
BOYD One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars. 
ADAM You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries. 
BOYD I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? (beat) Prison Communications. 
MOORE I don't think so Boyd. 
BOYD Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir. 
He turns away from the guys and stares out the window. 
FISHER (O.S.) Yes, I was holding for Tony in chairs. I have a chair problem. No, I'm not Tony, I need to speak to Tony. 
EXT. DESERT 
The minivan cruises through Death Valley in route to Vegas. 
FISHER (V.O.) I'm mad at you. 
LIZ Go have fun. Not too much. 
FISHER (V.O.) I'll see you tomorrow... 
CASINO 
Fisher hangs up, a "crazy about the girl" smile on his face. 
INT. FISHER'S SPLIT-LEVEL HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
The MUSIC is LOUD. The boys are super drunk in the swank bachelor party suite. 
MOORE stagger-dances on a table. 
BOYD AND MICHAEL stand at the wet-bar. 
BOYD I don't hate women. 
MICHAEL You hate women. 
BOYD False. 
MICHAEL True. 
BOYD Not true. 
MICHAEL You have a King fantasy. 
BOYD I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night. 
MICHAEL And what happens when you can't? 
BOYD (swigs whiskey; looks up) New king. 
EXT. BALCONY 
Adam and Fisher. 
ADAM No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me... He said, Adam, he said... He told me and I heard him... he said... (struggles to remember) Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake. 
FISHER Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father. 
ADAM Are you solid with that? 
FISHER No. I think it's fucked. 
ADAM Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now... You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here? 
MICHAEL AND BOYD AT THE BAR 
speed hitting cocaine. 
BOYD If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see? 
MICHAEL Israel doesn't have a King. 
BOYD Then what do they have? 
MICHAEL They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something. 
BOYD I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot. 
MICHAEL What's your point? 
BOYD Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time... right? Am I right? 
MICHAEL The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies. 
BOYD There's my point exactly. 
MICHAEL What? What's your point? 
BOYD Take Mexico. 
MICHAEL What? 
BOYD Look up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico. 
ANGLE ON 
MOORE crazed with the rhythm of the "Chemical Brothers," jumps up and down on the table. 
Fisher can't take it anymore... 
Tina relents... moves on... 
Michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat. 
She passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles onto Adam's lap. 
The guys roar in approval... Michael glowers... 
Adam turns bright red as Tina arouses and rides him... 
Michael starts to burn... 
The guys egg Tina on, she gets off on Adam's shyness, rubs her breasts in his face... 
The guys are howling... 
Tina sucks one of Adam's fingers into her mouth... 
Michael looks like he's going to explode... 
Adam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out... 
BOYD (whispers to Fish) She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party. 
FISHER I can't. 
MICHAEL (jumps up) I'll take a ride. 
FISHER Go for it. 
MICHAEL (to Tina) Come on. 
TINA (to Boyd) You said just dancing. 
BOYD (re: money) I'll take good care of you. 
TINA (dead flat; re: Michael) With him. (beat) Lucky me. 
Michael moves in on Tina. Hesitantly, she leads him into the master bedroom. 
MOORE She's fucking hot! 
ADAM I need a drink. 
BOYD Tequila... 
Boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on. 
HOTEL SUIT - MONTAGE 
Distorted, a bit crooked. MUSIC and DIALOGUE constantly changing levels. We're not sure who's saying what. We're not sure of physical geography. The one thing we are sure of is that MICHAEL is fucking the hell out of Tina in the bathroom. 
SERIES OF SHOTS: 
MASTER BATHROOM: 
Michael works Tina from behind. 
SUITE: 
MOORE bouncing off the furniture. 
FISHER and ADAM, wildly high. 
BOYD sprays beer on Adam, who returns fire. Drunk they start wrestling, throwing each other around the room, knocking over furniture. 
BATHROOM: 
Michael, tightly, ties Tina's hands behind her back with her rubber hose. 
TINA Oh come on. 
MICHAEL I want to play. 
TINA It's gonna cost extra. 
MICHAEL I will pay. 
SUITE: 
Fisher spraying beer all over Adam and Boyd as they knock a table over and end up tangled and brawling on the floor. 
FISHER (semi-gone) What happened? Oh my God... 
MICHAEL We were playing... she slipped... she hit her head. 
ADAM (incredulous) Playing? 
SUITE 
Adam moves into the living room, heads for the phone. Boyd intercepts him. They wrestle for the phone. 
BOYD Wait! 
ADAM What? 
BOYD What are you doing? 
ADAM (hysterical) What are you talking about? 
BOYD What do you think you are doing? 
ADAM I'm calling the ambulance. 
BOYD Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing? 
ADAM Calling the ambulance. 
BOYD Why? (beat) Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance? 
A reasonable point. BEAT. 
ADAM We have to call the ambulance. 
BOYD Why? 
Fisher entering, freaked... 
FISHER Oh, Jesus... call the police. 
BOYD No. 
FISHER She's dead. Call somebody! 
BOYD Shut up. 
FISHER Call 911. 
BOYD Shut up. 
MICHAEL She slipped. 
ADAM (attacking Michael) What did you do? 
MICHAEL (defensive) You never heard of accidents?! Get off me! 
Adam slaps Michael. Moore tries to break it up. 
BOYD Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME! 
SILENCE. 
BOYD Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First... are we sure she's dead? 
ADAM Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating. 
MOORE She's dead. 
MICHAEL It was an accident! 
BOYD Are you sure this was an accident? 
ADAM You're a lying deviant. What did you do?! 
MICHAEL The floor was wet. She slipped! 
ADAM Why was the floor wet? 
MICHAEL I don't know why the floor was wet! 
ADAM Why?! 
Fisher wanders back to the bathroom door where Moore is; they stare down at Tina as the conversation rages in the b.g. 
BOYD Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here. 
ADAM I've got a wife and two boys. 
Fisher shuffles to a corner, collapses, head in hands. SILENCE. 
BOYD (unflappably calm) Lets take a vote. A simple vote. Two choices; we clean up the mess. Right now. Bury it in the desert, go home, and never look back. Or, we can call the police... Open those doors, roll the dice and hope that it's only Michael who falls. Let's take a vote. Desert... or police? 
BOYD looks around. BEAT. Raises his hand. 
BOYD Desert. 
He looks at MOORE. 
MOORE (beat) Fucking desert. 
MICHAEL 
MICHAEL (to Fisher) Fish, I'm really sorry. I just... I owe you man. (puts up his hand) Desert. 
All eyes on FISHER, no response. 
BOYD Nobody knows she's here. 
FISHER Good God... Good God... 
All eyes on ADAM. He takes a while... Finally, 
ADAM How do we get her out of here? 
A reasonable question. Boyd thinks. BEAT. 
BOYD Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car... Done. 
ADAM (beat) You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony? 
BOYD We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear. 
ADAM What about the blood? 
BOYD Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works. 
ADAM Have you ever done this before? 
BOYD The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it. I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me... I can take care of this. 
KNOCK KNOCK 
The five men stop breathing. Somebody's at the door. 
KNOCK KNOCK 
Stunned silence. The guys stare at each other in horror. 
RALPH (O.S.) Hello? Is anyone in there? 
Boyd races to the door, eyes the peephole. 
BOYD'S POV, through the peephole, outside in the hall, a man. RALPH, early 30's, fairly unassuming. 
BOYD (calls out) What is it? 
RALPH (O.S.) Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there? 
Adam throws his head in his hands. 
BOYD (through door) What? 
RALPH (O.S.) I'm with Tina. Is she there? 
Boyd indicates to the guys to be cool. 
BOYD She's not here. 
RALPH (O.S.) Where is she? 
BOYD She's here. She's just... Hold on a second. 
Boyd turns as the guys freak. Crazed bits of panicked conversation -- GIBBERISH. 
KNOCK KNOCK. 
RALPH (O.S.) Could you open the door please. 
Boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it. Ralph steps in. Takes a good look around. 
THE GUYS' POV 
An absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub. A bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes charge. 
BOYD (with military precision) All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan. 
FISHER (beyond shock) I'm calling the police. 
BOYD So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. (beat) Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat -- It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that? 
Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares. 
BOYD A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self- exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me? 
MICHAEL Not really. no. 
BOYD Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders 
INT. WALMART - NIGHT 
The boys move down the isles of the massive 24 hour everything store, Boyd pushes a cart, grabbing; cleaning supplies, tarp, tape, giant pruning shears, etc... 
BOYD (V.O.) We will organize, we will mobilize, we will maximize and prioritize. 
Moore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in it for all he's worth. 
INT. HARD ROCK CASINO 
The boys attempt to look natural as they stroll through the casino with their supplies. Late night gamblers pay them little notice. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
Boyd turns up the MUSIC. 
BOYD Let's do it people. 
MUSIC OVER SERIES OF SHOTS: 
Moore and Fisher scrub blood from the carpet. Fisher keeps forgetting to breath. 
Michael and Boyd put Tina and Ralph in the bath tub. 
Adam sits in shock on the floor. 
Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair. 
Boyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like cutting the joints of a roasted chicken. 
Adam stares at the wall. 
Michael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a suitcase. 
Boyd saws. Michael wraps. Fisher and Moore clean. 
Adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help. 
UNTIL -- the last of the body parts, Tina's head, is wrapped in plastic, packed in a suitcase. 
The bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up. Just a bit of blood left in the tub. Boyd looks pleased. 
BOYD All right. Looking good people. 
EXT. RED ROCK CANYON ROAD 
The minivan bumps along a deserted road at a snail's pace. 
INT. MINIVAN 
Adam drives, cringing with every bump and bang. Everyone is tense. Boyd eyes the clock. It's 4 a.m. 
BOYD Sun rises at 5:52. 
ADAM I'm not wrecking the transmission! 
EXT. DESERT 
SERIES OF SHOTS: 
The guys off-loading the suitcases. 
Fisher and Boyd digging holes. 
They start putting the suitcases in the holes. 
LOIS Feeling a little HUNGOVER are we? Do you kids take note? (taking pictures) See how pathetic Daddy and his jackass friends look?! 
Fisher makes eye contact with Liz. 
LIZ What's the word on the chairs? 
FISHER I'm working on it. 
LIZ Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge. 
INT. JUDGE'S OFFICE 
ON JUDGE LAUREL TOWER. 
JUDGE TOWER We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound? 
LIZ I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think? 
Liz looks at Fisher who is a nuclear wreck, barely coherent. 
FISHER Yea... It's great... seems like... I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there. 
JUDGE TOWER All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words -- singing or anything? 
FISHER (beat) Are we supposed to? 
JUDGE TOWER It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't. 
LIZ We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out. 
JUDGE TOWER Okay great. What will that be? 
LIZ We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic. 
JUDGE TOWER What song? 
LIZ "You Send Me." 
JUDGE TOWER Oh I know that. How does it go... 
LIZ You know, (talks it) Darling you... you send me... Darling you... You mend me. (to Fisher) Honey, sing it for Judge Tower. 
In lieu of an anxiety attack, Fisher... 
FISHER (sings) "Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me. 
LIZ "At first I thought it was infatuation... But oh it's lasted so long..." 
FISHER & LIZ "Now I find myself wanting to marry you, marry you and take you home..." 
Judge Tower joins in and the three squeak out the chorus and it's pretty pathetic. 
MUSIC OVER: 
INT. TUXEDO RENTAL STORE 
The guys are being fitted for their wedding tuxes. 
Lois takes pictures of the five groomsmen. 
Liz closely watches as the TAILOR makes adjustments to Fisher's tux. 
Adam looks sick. 
EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - SUNSET 
Fisher and his dad walk along the pier eating hot dogs. A father and son moment. 
MR. FISHER I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing. (starts to choke-up) I'm just so goddamn proud of you... God knows I didn't always play it right with you... 
FISHER You did all right dad. 
MR. FISHER I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am. 
FISHER You never walked away dad. You could have walked away. 
MR. FISHER I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day... he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me... My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me. 
FISHER Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle." 
MR. FISHER Just kills me... 
FISHER I love you dad. 
MAGGIE Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had. 
LIZ That's our plan. 
MAGGIE Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling. 
Liz looks at Fisher. She really wants the house. He takes out his checkbook. Liz throws her arms around Fisher, kisses him. 
FISHER How much? 
MAGGIE Five percent should be fine for now, which is, let's see, twenty thousand dollars. Of course I'll be splitting my commission with your friend. (beat) He is a very sweet man. 
Liz stares at Fisher. His hand shakes as he writes the check. 
EXT. GAS STATION MINI-MART 
Adam, Lois and the kids pull into the mini-mart, up to the gas pump. 
INT. ADAM'S MINI-VAN 
Adam, ghost white, fumbles for a credit card as the kids go nuts in the back seat. 
KIDS (singing) "Do your balls hang low, do they wobble to and fro, can you tie 'em in a knot, can you tie 'em in a bow?" 
ADAM (snapping) Knock it off! 
LOIS Don't snap at them! 
ADAM They're driving me nuts! 
LOIS They're singing. 
A black sedan, looking like an unmarked police car, pulls up nose-to-nose with them at the pump. TWO MEN in dark suits in the front look like cops. Adam can't help but notice. 
ADAM (getting out) It's a disgusting song. 
EXT. CAR 
Adam slides his card through at the pump and starts filling his tank as one of the "suits" gets out of the black sedan and does the same. 
Adam and the "suit" make eye-contact. 
SUIT How ya doing? 
ADAM (nervous mumble) What? 
SUIT What's that? 
ADAM What did you say? 
SUIT I said how's it going? 
ADAM I didn't hear you. 
SUIT Well that's what I said. 
Adam nods, eyeing his gas pump, willing it to pump faster. His heart starts to pound, he looks away, sees... 
An LAPD police car pull into the station, stops in front of the mini-mart. TWO COPS inside. 
ON adam, eye-balling the cop car. He slowly turns to steal a glance at the "suit." 
SUIT How do you like that mini-van? 
Adam's tank is almost filled. He wants nothing more than to get out of there... 
Lois rolls down the window. 
LOIS Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts. 
ADAM What? 
LOIS They're screaming for Starbursts. 
ADAM Later. 
LOIS They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts. 
Adam looks from the suit to the cop car... 
ADAM Fine. 
TRACK with Adam as he walks from the pumping across the parking lot, past the cop car, his HEART POUNDING... 
ADAM (dazed) Where's the bathroom? 
INT. REHEARSAL DINNER - NIGHT 
A large dining room in a Westside restaurant has been taken over by the wedding party. Seventy-five guests, dressed up, are into the desserts. The toasts are about halfway over. 
MR. FISHER stands in the middle of the room with the large blown-up pictures of Keith at different stages of his life. 
MR. FISHER (holding picture of Keith, age 4, on a mule) And this is Keith at age four and his best friend "Bunker the Mule." Evidently, when they were in camp, Keith and Boyd got into some serious arguments over exactly who was Keith's best friend -- Boyd or the mule. 
Mr. Fisher holds up a photo of a young Fisher and young Boyd, both scrappy and bloodied from a fist fight. 
Boyd sits with Moore at a table. 
BOYD Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey. 
FISHER (seated next to Liz) You always were a jealous man. 
Mr. Fisher holds up a picture of Keith, Boyd, Moore and Michael all in a Peewee Football uniforms. 
MR. FISHER After camp came football, and for those of you not following the sports pages back in 1977, you might not remember the Peewee Powerhouse Oklahoma, who, under the brilliant leadership of your's truly, rolled to an auspicious league record of 0- 12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns. 
TIGHT ON Adam, looking extremely uncomfortable, surrounded by his family. 
MICHAEL The problem was coaching. Poor leadership. 
As the room LAUGHS, Adam becomes visibly upset. Not keeping it together. 
BOYD The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left... 
FISHER No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking... 
As the guys debate, in front of the room, who's fault Oklahoma's 0-12 season really was. 
TIGHT ON Adam. He's had enough, excuses himself from the table. 
TIGHT ON Fisher, seeing Adam, he quietly excuses himself. 
EXT. BEACH RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Adam stands by his car trying to compose himself. Fisher approaches. 
FISHER You all right? 
ADAM I can't fucking breathe. I'm sorry. 
Boyd, followed by Michael exits the restaurant. 
BOYD (approaching) OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here. 
FISHER Shut up Boyd. 
BOYD Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior. 
FISHER He's having a problem here. 
MICHAEL What's the problem Adam? 
Moore joins the group. 
MOORE What's the problem? 
All eyes on Adam, who's eyes are starting to tear up. 
BOYD What is your problem? 
ADAM I can't do this. 
PAUSE. 
MOORE Can't do what? 
ADAM We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car. 
BOYD What? 
ADAM At the seven-eleven. 
BOYD Who? What are you talking about? 
ADAM They're on me. They're smoking me out! 
BOYD (shouts) Nobody's smoking anybody out. 
EXT RESTAURANT 
Liz is back at the restaurant door. 
LIZ Keith?! 
Fisher bolts over to Liz. 
FISHER Everything's OK. Just some more preparations. 
LIZ Are they fighting? 
FISHER No baby. We'll all be right in. 
Fisher pushes her inside and charges back to the... 
PARKING LOT 
Fisher helps break the fight. Adam and Michael try to contain their rage. 
BOYD This is going to stop right now. Right now! 
MICHAEL (seething) You will not screw this up. 
ADAM Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck. 
MICHAEL Don't you fucking threaten me -- I'll fucking kill you. 
ADAM Go home! 
MICHAEL You go home! 
Boyd pulls Michael to his car. 
BOYD Why don't you just cool out. Go home and go to sleep. 
Boyd opens Michael's car door, puts him in. 
BOYD Just go home, chill the fuck out. Okay? 
Michael starts his car. Boyd shuts the car door. 
BOYD Just go home. 
MICHAEL, eyeballs Adam. Adam eyeballs him right back. Michael hits the gas and screeches away. 
BOYD All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right? 
ADAM No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all. 
Reluctantly, they start back in. 
A hundred or so feet away, Michael's car comes to an abrupt stop. They all turn. Michael turns his car around, idles for a moment. 
INT. MICHAEL'S CAR 
Michael in a trance, staring at the guys watching him. 
MICHAEL Mr. Fucking Minivan... 
He hits the gas. 
EXT PARKING LOT 
Wheels spin, rubber burns. The guys watch as Michael speeds full throttle, like a battering ram, right at Adam's beloved minivan. 
ADAM NOOOO!!!! 
Adam jumps between the minivan and Michael's car. 
INT. MICHAEL'S CAR 
Michael's expression turns to horror. He slams on the brakes, but it's too late. 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
Michael's car crushes Adam like a sandwich meat between his car and the minivan. Metal, flesh, severed limbs, Adam explodes like a gnat. 
CUT TO: 
THE HORRIFIED EXPRESSIONS OF BOYD, MOORE AND FISHER 
INT. UCLA EMERGENCY - WAITING ROOM 
MOORE Shut up Michael. 
MICHAEL (screams) I KILLED MY BROTHER! 
All eyes on Michael. Boyd is immediately up trying to get Michael out of the booth. Casually, sweetly... 
BOYD Okay. Time to fly. 
Fisher helps Boyd lift Michael, who is becoming more and more frenzied. 
MICHAEL I ran down my brother in cold blood. Shame on me! Shame! Shame! Shame! 
WAITRESSES, COOKS and LATE NIGHT DINNERS stare, confused as the HOWLING Michael is carried to the door. 
MICHAEL (struggling) Time to pay the man. "For if we confess our sins he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 
Fisher and Boyd struggle with Michael. 
FISHER (tipping Waitress) Thank you. 
She watches them haul Michael outside. 
POV WAITRESS 
Michael thrashes wildly in the parking lot. 
EXT PARKING LOT 
MICHAEL "Kill one man and you are a murderer! Kill millions and you are a conqueror -- Kill all and you are a God!" 
Michael breaks free, starts running away. Boyd, Moore and Fisher give chase. Moore dives on Michael's back. Fisher helps Moore hold Michael down while Boyd gets the car. 
MICHAEL (calming down) "The memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot." 
Boyd is there with the car. They load Michael into the back seat, climb in and disappear into the night. 
INT. CAR - DRIVING 
Boyd drives, Fisher rides shotgun, Moore's in the back trying to contain Michael. 
BOYD You will get yourself together here mister. Are you hearing me? 
Michael, now catatonic, stares out the window. 
FISHER He's cracked up. 
BOYD He is not cracking up. 
FISHER Boyd... What have we done? 
BOYD What did you ask me? 
FISHER What? 
BOYD What is the question you asked me? 
FISHER I said, what have we done? 
BOYD Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done? 
FISHER I don't know! I just want to get married. 
BOYD Say it again. 
FISHER What? 
BOYD What you just said. Say it again. 
FISHER I just want to get married. 
BOYD Exactly! Exactly my point. 
MOORE What's your fucking point? 
BOYD I'm not talking to you? 
FISHER What's your point? 
BOYD You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Michael. This car is full of love, and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes. 
Boyd takes Fisher's head in his hands and kisses him deeply on the mouth. 
BOYD Love does not lose. 
MICHAEL (screaming) Goosed! 
BOYD Stop it! 
MICHAEL Goosed! 
People are staring. 
BOYD Stop. 
MICHAEL Goosed! 
BOYD (to Moore) Give me the Valium. 
MOORE He just had two. 
BOYD Give me two more. 
Moore counts out two Valium, hands them to Boyd as michael continues to freak. 
BOYD (to Michael) Open sesame. 
Michael complies like a puppy. 
FISHER Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him. 
BOYD Suck my ass. 
INT. LOIS' KITCHEN 
TIGHT ON Lois, busted nose, eyes black. 
LOIS I never liked you Boyd. You're a snaky little fuck. Always have been. 
WIDE ON the guys, seated around a little breakfast table. Michael's in a Valium stupor. 
BOYD What are you talking about? 
LOIS Don't sweet lip me. 
BOYD I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from... 
LOIS You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas. 
BOYD Nothing happened in Vegas. 
LOIS I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas? 
FISHER (beat) Nothing happened in Vegas. 
LOIS (not buying it) Moore? 
MOORE (sheepish) Nothing happened. 
Michael starts back in with the power sobbing. All eyes are on him. Guilty, uncomfortable silence. Michael's coming unglued. 
LOIS Michael? Do you have something to tell me? 
BOYD Michael. Tell Lois that nothing... 
LOIS Shut up Boyd! Michael? 
All eyes on Michael. 
MICHAEL (quiet) Goosed. 
Fisher struggles to breathe. Boyd tenses up. 
LOIS What? 
MICHAEL Lois we were bad, we were very, very bad. 
BOYD He's upset about Adam. We're all upset. 
LOIS I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers. 
BOYD Lois please. 
She heads for the phone. 
LOIS Fuck you Boyd. 
The guys are freaking as she picks up the phone. Boyd looks at the kitchen knives. Fisher sees him, intervenes quickly... 
MICHAEL Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull. 
FISHER I don't hear it. 
MICHAEL Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem. 
FISHER Have another drink. 
INT. ADAM AND LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
TRACKING SHOT down hallway into bedroom where Lois sleeps peacefully. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Fisher and Michael. Moore, drinking, just listening. 
MICHAEL Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"... "watch for it"... "here it comes," here comes the "wahoo" 
FISHER The wahoo? 
MICHAEL The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter... and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for... You get me? 
FISHER The wahoo moment? 
MICHAEL That's my point! You see Man... burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me? 
FISHER I think so. 
MICHAEL I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it? (finishes drink) You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things. 
INT. LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
Lois' bedroom. As Lois sleeps, Boyd softly enters the room. Moving in on the sleeping Lois, another couple of steps, he looms over her, reaches his hand to her throat when, suddenly, Lois' eyes snap open. Boyd is startled. Lois grabs mace from her night stand and sprays Boyd in the face. He MOANS, stumbles back. Lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a side of beef. 
They go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild animals. 
LOIS You picked the wrong woman mother- fucker! 
As Lois sinks her teeth into Boyd's balls. 
BACK AT THE BAR 
MICHAEL You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect. 
MOORE I don't think that's a good idea. 
MICHAEL I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here? 
FISHER I appreciate it. I do, but... maybe you ought to just ease up on yourself a bit. 
MICHAEL No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois. 
LOIS' BEDROOM 
Boyd and Lois are choking the living shit out of each other. Boyd pulls back, swings with a left, Lois ducks, she swings, a right cross to Boyds eye. He goes down. She jumps on him. Choking him like a mad dog. As Boyd struggles for air... 
THE BAR 
Fisher checks his watch as Michael fumbles with his eighth shot of Yukon Jack. 
MICHAEL If I was to think... If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over... I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just... Well I just... 
FISHER What is it? 
MICHAEL (drunk-slow) Well if you do think about names... Michael's a pretty good one... It's done me all right. 
Michael's eyes bore into Fisher, like he knows something Fisher doesn't. Fisher's cell phone RINGS. 
FISHER (answers) Yeah. 
INT. LOIS' BEDROOM 
TIGHT ON Boyd, eye swelling, scratch marks, hair a crazy mess. 
BOYD (into the phone) Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation. 
INTERCUT BOYD AND FISHER 
FISHER What does that mean? 
Michael stares at Fisher. 
BOYD I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is... you still got Michael there? 
FISHER I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot -- "Pup Corn." 
MOORE Pup corn? 
FISHER That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all out money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never. 
SILENCE hangs again. 
EXT. DESERT - LATER 
Fisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph with flashlights and shovels. 
FISHER I think it was over here. 
They move into a new area and start poking around. Nothing. 
MOORE It was over by those rocks. 
Again they search, prodding into earth with their shovels. Nothing. 
Fisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light around until... 
FISHER There. 
MOORE Where? 
Fisher moves to a new spot. 
FISHER There. This rock is where I stood when I said the prayer. 
He starts digging in front of the rock. The earth is soft. 
FISHER Bingo. 
Moore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's shovel makes contact. 
MOORE Got it. 
And they dig some more. 
DISSOLVE: 
MOORE 
in the hole, passing the suitcases up to Fisher. 
DISSOLVE: 
FISHER 
loads the cases into the car. 
EXT. NEW BURIAL SITE 
The suitcases are unloaded. Fisher and Moore dig a new grave. Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs. 
MOORE I've been thinking about what you said that day. The prayer. About using this whole mess to bring out the good in me... 
Fisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking down at the back of Moore's head. 
FISHER Yeah? 
MOORE I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing. 
FISHER (slowly raises the shovel over his head) That's a good one. 
MOORE I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think? 
Moore looks up to... 
FISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull. 
MOORE confused and then realization... CUT between Fisher above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable. Their eyes locked for several beats. Finally... 
MOORE What do you think? 
Slowly, Fisher lowers his shovel. 
FISHER I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother. 
MOORE (back to work) That's what I'm thinking. 
DISSOLVE:

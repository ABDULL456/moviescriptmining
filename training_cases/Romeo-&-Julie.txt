Shooting script 
October 6, 1995 
EXT. HIGHWAY. AFTERNOON. 
A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold, headlights blazing, powers directly for us. 
CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward the sedan. 
WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing. 
TIGHT ON: The sedan. 
TIGHT ON: The pickup. 
Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a deafening cacophony of noise. 
INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. 
TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the disappearing sedan. 
GREGORY A dog of the house of Capulet moves me! 
He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON, explode with laughter. 
The red-haired driver BENVOLIO, keeps his eyes on the road. 
EXT. EXIT RAMP. AFTERNOON. 
The truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy driveway of a large gas station. 
EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. 
Attendants immediately run to the truck. Two clean windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank. 
INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. 
Gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously. 
GREGORY A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Capulets. 
Sampson, sarcastically. 
SAMPSON That shows thee a weak slave. For the weakest goes to the wall. 
GREGORY 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore, I will push Capulet's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. 
Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car. 
BENVOLIO The quarrel is between our masters... 
GREGORY (yelling after him) ...and us their men. 
EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. 
FOLLOW: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom. 
PICK UP: A mother wrangling three little boys out of a station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol. 
SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the mother to - the huge black sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart. 
The front door of the sedan opens. Shiny black boots - decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant themselves on the ground. The boots are joined by two other pairs of well-shod feet. 
HOLD: The spurred boots move out of frame. 
CRANE UP: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO. 
Abra and Petruchio enter the mini-mart, as four white-clad girls exit. 
FOLLOW: The girls as they head for their car. 
SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the girls to: 
INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. 
Sampson is trying to out boast Gregory. 
SAMPSON I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads. 
Gregory; mock outrage. 
GREGORY The heads of the maids? 
SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir. 
INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON. 
CUT TO: The panicked mother in the station wagon. She motions her children to the floor. 
EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. 
Customers run for cover. 
CLOSE ON: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks: 
ABRA Do you bite you thumb at us, sir? 
SAMPSON (sweating, murmurs to Gregory) Is the law on our side if I say "Ay"? 
GREGORY No. 
INT. BATHROOM. AFTERNOON. 
CLOSE ON: The black cowboy boots, trousers down around them. The sound of a toilet flushing. 
PAN TO: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing Benvolio. 
EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. 
CLOSE ON: Sampson, still sweating. 
SAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir - but I do bite my thumb, sir! 
CUT TO: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry. 
GREGORY Do you quarrel, sir? 
CUT TO: Abra; a dangerous smile. 
ABRA Quarrel sir, no sir. 
CLOSE ON: Sampson; unconvincing bravado... 
SAMPSON But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you. 
CLOSE ON: Abra; a lethal question. 
ABRA No better? 
CLOSE ON: Sampson, trapped. 
SAMPSON Well sir... 
INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON. 
CUT TO: Inside the station wagon. The mother does not notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys. 
EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. 
CUT TO: Gregory's P.O.V.: Benvolio emerging from the bathroom - he whispers maniacally. 
GREGORY Here comes our kinsman. Say better! 
EXTREME CLOSE UP: Sampson; he screams: 
SAMPSON 
YES SIR, BETTER! 
EXTREME CLOSE UP: Abra demonically roars: 
ABRA 
THOU LIEST! 
CUT TO: Benvolio. Terror stricken, he sees the boys. 
DISTORTED OUT OF CONTROL CLOSE UP: Abra shrieks: 
ABRA 
DRAW IF YOU BE MEN! 
LIGHTNING CUT: Four hands reaching for guns. 
SLAM ZOOM: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams: 
BENVOLIO Part, fools! You know not what you do! 
MUSIC STING; A SUPER MARCO SLAM ZOOM along the barrel of Benvolio's gun; the engraved gun type reads: 
'Sword 9mm series S' 
CUT TO: Benvolio. He screams in desperation: 
ROMEO (CONT.) What fray was here? 
Benvolio starts to reply. 
ROMEO (CONT.) 
(ANGRILY) Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. 
Romeo turns the corner away from the beach. He strides along the sidewalk raging. 
ROMEO (CONT.) Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness, serious vanity, Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms, Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! 
Romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway of a sex club. 
ROMEO (CONT.) This love feel I, that feel no love in this! 
The bouncer's hand moves to his gun. Romeo, ignoring him, turns on Benvolio. A mocking laughter through tears: 
ROMEO (CONT.) Dost thou not laugh? 
Benvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out of danger. 
BENVOLIO No, coz, I rather weep. 
Romeo smiles. 
ROMEO Farewell, my coz. 
Romeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind. Benvolio pursues him down the street. 
EXT. ROMEO'S CAR. DAY. 
CLOSE ON: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy - 
BALTHASAR. 
PULL BACK: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent silver car. 
Three or four kids doze on the sidewalk. As Romeo approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the already gleaming car. 
Balthasar wakes. He springs off the hood, chases the kids away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car door for Romeo. 
Benvolio intercepts Romeo at the car. 
BENVOLIO Tell me in sadness, who is it that you love. 
ROMEO In sadness, cousin, I do love...a woman. 
BENVOLIO I aimed so near when I supposed you loved. 
Romeo leans against the car. 
ROMEO A right good marksman; and she's fair I love. 
Romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo. 
CLOSE ON: The tattooed word; ROSALINE. 
BENVOLIO Rosaline! (he is impressed) A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. 
ROMEO She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit, And in strong proof of chastity lives well armed. 
Benvolio can't believe it. 
BENVOLIO Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? 
ROMEO She hath; and in that sparing makes huge waste. 
Benvolio - a plan. 
BENVOLIO Be ruled by me; forget to think of her. 
ROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think! 
Benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting the foot path. 
BENVOLIO By giving liberty unto thine eyes. Examine other beauties. 
Romeo laughs dismissively. He throws the kids a few coins and slides into the drivers seat. Balthasar jumps in back. 
ROMEO Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. 
BENVOLIO I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. 
Benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle. 
INT. CAPULET OFFICE. DAY. 
An orchestral fanfare. TRACK DOWN: Past monstrous letters that read CAPULET and in through a window to discover Fulgencio Capulet. He stares out the window toward the other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the word MONTAGUE. 
CAPULET But Montague is bound as well as I, In penalty alike; 
CUT TO: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo. 
BENVOLIO At this same ancient feast of 
CAPULET'S Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou so loves, With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither, and with unattained eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. 
ROMEO One fairer than my love? 
Crusty returns. He hands the boys their guns. 
ROMEO (CONT.) The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. 
CUT TO: TELEVISION. 
SUSAN If you be not of the house of Montagues, Come and crush a cup of wine! 
RICH Rest you merry! 
CUT TO: Romeo, he considers. 
ROMEO I'll go along, no such sight to be shown. But to rejoice in splendour of mine own. 
The boys move off. 
PUSH IN ON: THE TELEVISION. 
EXT. CAPULET STATE. DAY. 
An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate. An Italianate wonder of Florentine architecture. Armed guards patrol the grounds. The telecaption reads "Capulet Mansion." 
The file tape loses its television quality. We sweep down through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations for tonight's celebrations, and into the house. The music darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl's name. 
VOICE OVER 
J U L I E T ! 
INT. CAPULET MANSION - CORRIDOR. DAY. 
CUT TO: A long deserted corridor. 
VOICE OVER 
J U L I E T ! 
INT. CAPULET MANSION - DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 
CUT TO: An echoey Chinoiserie style drawing room. 
VOICE OVER 
J U L I E T ! 
INT. BATHROOM. DAY. 
CLOSE ON: The still, serene, submerged features of a beautiful young girl. Dark floating hair gently frames the face. Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water. 
We hear, though faintly, the calling: 
VOICE OVER 
J U L I E T ! 
With a rush JULIET surfaces. As she gulps air, we realise that she is in fact, in a bath. 
We hear the calling loudly again. 
VOICE OVER 
J U L I E T ! 
Juliet listens. For a moment she is very still, then she closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the water. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL CAPULET MANSION. DAY. 
A Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious iconography. The entrance hall is crowded with workers and servants preparing for tonight's party. 
Gloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway mirror. She is attired in full Cleopatra costume. 
Dissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and calls maniacally. 
GLORIA 
J U L I E T ! 
Gloria is met by the NURSE, a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic woman. 
GLORIA (CONT.) Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me. 
NURSE I bade her come. God forbid! Where's this girl? Juliet! 
CUT TO: The top of the stairs. As if from nowhere, Juliet has appeared. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet. 
CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music. 
MERCUTIO Strike drum! 
Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys. 
Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the invitations. Reaching Romeo, he declares: 
MERCUTIO We'll on without apology. 
Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand. 
ROMEO I am not for this ambling. Being but heavy, I will bear the light. 
Romeo pulls on the bong once more. 
Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo. Hauling him to his feet, he waltzes him through the sand. 
MERCUTIO Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. 
Romeo pushes Mercutio away. 
ROMEO Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead. 
Mercutio in mock sympathy. 
MERCUTIO Too great oppression for a tender thing. 
ROMEO Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. 
Romeo lies staring up at the stars. 
MERCUTIO If love be rough with you, be rough with love. 
Mercutio jumps on Romeo. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. 
Romeo fights Mercutio off. 
ROMEO Under love's heavy burden do I sink! 
CUT TO: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn. 
BENVOLIO Every man betake him to his legs! 
Mercutio heads Romeo toward the car. 
MERCUTIO Come, we burn daylight, ho! 
Romeo pulls away. 
ROMEO But 'tis no wit to go. 
Mercutio turns, exasperated. 
MERCUTIO Why, may one ask? 
ROMEO I dreamt a dream tonight. 
MERCUTIO And so did I. 
ROMEO Well, what was yours? 
MERCUTIO That dreamers often lie. 
ROMEO In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. 
Mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case. 
MERCUTIO O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate 
STONE On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep. 
Tantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo's nose. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat. 
With a conjurer's dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray pill. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; 
He palms the pills. It reappears from behind Romeo's ear. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues. Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. 
The pill box glints in the moonlight. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck; And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats. And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. 
Mercutio now intensely angry: 
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. 
As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish glide past a medieval castle. 
Suddenly, Romeo pulls away. Peering back at him through the castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes. 
The Diva's first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar. 
Confused, Romeo looks again. There is no mistake - it is a girl. Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips. 
Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass. The other face snaps abruptly away. 
INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. 
CUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of the tank. We now realise that the girls' powder room and the boys' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world. 
Juliet warily moves closer to the glass. 
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. 
Romeo leans his face against the glass. The love ballad builds. 
SLOW TRACK: From Romeo's profile, in through the water, and... 
INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. 
...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering into the tank. 
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. 
Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass. 
INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. 
Juliet; a tiny smile. 
Suddenly, CRASH! The door slams open. Juliet turns, startled. It is the Nurse. 
NURSE Juliet, your mother calls. 
The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door. Juliet looks over her shoulder at the mystery boy. 
INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT. 
Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom - Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd. 
CUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone. 
Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor. 
Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet. 
DAVE Will you now deny to dance? 
Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to decline. Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter's protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them onto the dance floor. 
GLORIA (whispering to Juliet) A man, young lady, such a man. 
As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively search for the boy. 
CUT TO: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the girl, he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince of Darkness. 
HOLD ON: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt. He turns to Abra, who's dressed as a demon. 
TYBALT What, dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honor of my 
KIN To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. 
Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet slams a hand into his chest. 
CAPULET Why how now kinsman, wherefore storm you so? 
TYBALT Uncle, this is that villain Romeo. A Montague, our foe. 
Capulet peers across the ballroom. 
CAPULET Young Romeo is it? 
TYBALT 'Tis he. 
CAPULET Content thee gentle coz, let him alone. I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient; take no note of him. 
Tybalt can't believe it. 
TYBALT I'll not endure him. 
CLOSE ON: Capulet, exploding with rage. 
CAPULET He shall be endured! (slapping Tybalt viciously) What, goodman boy! I say he shall! Go to. 
Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground. 
Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple. They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely. 
NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you. 
We see that the party is breaking up. But for groups of die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty. 
NURSE (CONT.) Come, let's away. 
She takes firm control of her charge. 
Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room. 
CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris. 
Inaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes nervously to Romeo. 
CUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure. 
CUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she indicates to her daughter to 'COME ALONG'. 
CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation. 
ROMEO (under his breath) Is she a Capulet? 
CUT TO: Juliet. She stops and turns back. 
CUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is. 
CUT TO: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear. 
NURSE His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy. 
An orchestral treatment of Joy Division's "Love will tear us Apart" swells; 
HOLD ON: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the sun, a dark coldness descends upon her. 
CUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked Romeo. 
MERCUTIO Away, begone, the sport is at its best. 
Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door. 
ROMEO Ay so I fear, 
A covert glance over his shoulder. 
ROMEO (CONT.) The more is my unrest. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. 
Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the stairs to the waiting getaway car. 
INT. CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT. 
CUT TO: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT. 
CUT TO: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos. 
A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words "CAPULET." 
As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window. Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes. 
PUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper: 
JULIET My only love, sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE. NIGHT. 
CUT TO: JULIET'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the falling curtain of fiery embers. 
JULIET (CONT.)(V/O) That I must love a loathed enemy. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. 
Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks. Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass. 
CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who don't know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind. 
TYBALT I will withdraw. But this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall. 
INT. MERCUTIO'S CAR. NIGHT. 
Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio's car crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the mainland. The boys sing along raucously with the radio. 
BOYS "I am a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of flesh..." 
Romeo jumps down from the wall. Juliet screams, and turns, toppling backwards. Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL - UNDERWATER. NIGHT. 
Underwater shot: A slow motion phosphorescent tangle of arms, legs and bodies. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - BACK GARDEN. NIGHT. 
CUT TO: A security guard. Alerted by the noise he moves toward the pool area. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL GARDEN - NIGHT. 
CUT TO: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface spluttering. Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get distance from her attacker. 
JULIET What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel? 
Romeo: A calming gesture as he tries to tread water. 
ROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to 
MYSELF Because it is an enemy to thee. The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention. A moment, then they slide beneath the water. 
CUT TO: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool area. 
GUARD'S P.O.V.: The rippling surface of the water. 
CUT TO - UNDERWATER SHOT: Romeo and Juliet submerged, hair streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish. 
CUT TO: The guard. He can see noisy caterers cleaning up around the other side of the house. Frowning, he returns the way he came. 
CUT TO: Romeo and Juliet. Gasping for air, they cautiously surface. A moment - then Juliet, a small smile. 
JULIET Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? 
ROMEO Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. 
Juliet looks nervously toward the house. She drags Romeo toward a small grotto at the end of the pool. 
JULIET How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and whyfore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art. 
ROMEO (with splashy bravado) With love's light wings did I o'er perch these walls. For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me. 
Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto. 
JULIET (a real fear) If they do see thee, they will murder thee. 
Romeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him. 
ROMEO I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes. And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their 
HATE Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. 
The lovers kiss long and deep. Then Juliet, suddenly fearful, pushes Romeo away. 
JULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form - fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? 
Romeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him. 
JULIET (CONT.) I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swearest, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light. But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange. 
ROMEO Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops - 
JULIET O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. 
ROMEO What shall I swear by? 
JULIET Do not swear at all. Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee. 
She touches his cheek. Romeo moves his lips close. 
ROMEO If my heart's dear love - 
Confused, Juliet breaks away. 
JULIET Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, too 
SUDDEN; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'it lightens.' Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. 
She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately. 
ROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? 
Juliet - a shocked look. 
JULIET What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? 
CLOSE ON: Romeo. 
ROMEO The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. 
CLOSE ON: Juliet. She runs joyously to Romeo. 
A feverish knocking breaks the priest's reverie. 
ROMEO (O/S) Good morrow, father! 
Father Laurence snaps off the television and exits the workroom. 
EXT. WALL. DAWN. 
Romeo, dressed in last night's chain mail, pounds desperately on a wooden door set into a high stone wall. 
ROMEO Good morrow, father! 
EXT. COURTYARD. DAWN. 
From the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which encloses a tranquil tropical garden. He opens a door in the wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo bursts in. 
FATHER LAURENCE Benedicite! What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? 
Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard and toward the church. 
FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Young son, it argues a distempered 
HEAD So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. Or if not so, then here I hit it right - Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight. 
The priest enters the back of the church. 
INT. SACRISTY. DAWN. 
Romeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest into the sacristy. 
ROMEO The last is true. The sweeter rest was mine. 
FATHER LAURENCE (he stops) God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? 
ROMEO With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. I have forgot that name and that name's woe. 
The Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray for mass. 
FATHER LAURENCE That's my good son! But where hast thou been then? 
Unconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare. It is clear he knows the routine by heart. 
ROMEO I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me. That's by me wounded. Both our 
REMEDIES Within they help and holy physic lies. 
FATHER LAURENCE (buttoning a long black cassock) Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. 
ROMEO Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set, On the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass. But this I pray, That thou consent to marry us today. 
CUT TO: The Priest, thunderstruck. The two kids, now dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter. 
ALTAR BOYS Good morrow, Romeo. 
The apoplectic priest waves the boys away. They get the message and bolt. 
FATHER LAURENCE Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon foresaken? Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. 
ROMEO Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. 
FATHER LAURENCE (very angry) For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. 
ROMEO I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so. 
FATHER LAURENCE O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. 
The Father falls into a chair and considers. He looks through the sacristy door to where a small children's choir has assembled. Their angelic voices soar into the purest of hymns. 
CHOIR How can you just leave me standing Alone in a world so cold, Maybe I'm just too demanding, Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold, Maybe you're just like my mother, She's never satisfied. Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like when doves cry... 
We recognise the hymn as "When Doves Cry" by Prince. 
PUSH IN: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo. 
FATHER LAURENCE But come, young waverer, come, go with me. In one respect I'll thy assistant be. For this alliance may so happy 
PROVE To turn your households' rancor to pure love. 
Romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments. 
ROMEO O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste. 
Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze. 
FATHER LAURENCE Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast. 
The procession is joined by the two little altar boys and the mass begins. 
EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY. 
As the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand, green sea and blue sky. 
Mercutio, evading, heads for shore. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou... 
EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY. 
Romeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand. Mercutio falls suddenly serious. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) 
(QUIETLY) What thou art, by art as well as by nature. 
A moment between the boys. A shadow falls across them. Romeo looks up. 
ROMEO Here's goodly gear. 
Standing above the boys is the Nurse. She wears a ridiculous, all red, "Jackie O" style disguise of sunglasses, scarf and parasol. 
MERCUTIO 
(BEMUSED) God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman. 
The nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo. 
NURSE I desire some confidence with you. 
She turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the chauffer waits beside the limousine. 
Benvolio and the other boys look on curiously. 
MERCUTIO A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! 
But Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually follows this woman. Mercutio looks questioningly to Benvolio, who shrugs. 
BENVOLIO She will endite him to some supper? 
Even more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine. 
MERCUTIO (taken by surprise) Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither. 
ROMEO (as he closes the door) I will follow you. 
MERCUTIO Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell. 
The car pulls away. 
EXT. STREET. DAY. 
The limousine drives through Verona Beach. 
INT. MOVING LIMOUSINE. DAY. 
CLOSE ON: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat. The Nurse's face is pressed alarmingly close to his. She speaks in cold deadly earnest. 
NURSE If ye should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing. 
BEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully. 
ROMEO Bid her to come to confession this afternoon, And there she shall at Friar Laurence's cell Be shrived and (PUSH IN ON: Romeo) married. 
INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY. 
CLOSE ON: Juliet's face peering out her bedroom window. 
JULIET O God she comes! 
EXT. CAPULETS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY. 
PULL BACK: JULIET'S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up at the front door, the Nurse alights. 
Juliet bolts from the room. 
INT. LANDING. DAY. 
Juliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead, disappears into a doorway. 
INT. STAIRWAY. DAY. 
Juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels of the house. 
INT. KITCHEN. DAY. 
The kitchen, obviously the Nurse's domain, is decorated with a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters. Most of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying, beauty. 
Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room. 
JULIET O honey nurse, what news? 
The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the refrigerator, does not turn around. 
Juliet cries impatiently. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Tybalt, you ratcatcher, 
...as he bludgeons him across the face. Tybalt goes down. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Will you walk? 
Tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood. 
TYBALT What wouldst thou have with me? 
He swipes at Mercutio. 
MERCUTIO 
(AVOIDING) Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. 
Mercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps. 
TYBALT I am for you. 
Tybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio's head. Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt's stick away. 
Unarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio, slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of glass. 
Lightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet. He raises his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the trapped Tybalt. Romeo rushes between them. 
ROMEO Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio! 
Seizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a lethal triangle of broken glass. He misses, gouging instead a slash of flesh from Mercutio's stomach. A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his bloodied side. Everyone is still. In the abrupt silence, sirens are heard closing in the distance. Abra tugs at Tybalt. 
ABRA Away Tybalt! 
They bolt for their vehicle. 
Benvolio goes to Mercutio. 
BENVOLIO Art thou hurt? 
But Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs. 
MERCUTIO Ay, ay, a scratch. 
He turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs. With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the conqueror. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) A scratch! 
The boys cheer their conquering hero. Romeo helps Mercutio down the stairs. 
ROMEO Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much. 
Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain. 
MERCUTIO 'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. 
He turns the next thought to the assembled audience. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) (through crazy laughter) A plague o' both your houses! 
Mercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is struggling to support his weight. 
Mercutio - through weak and desperate breathing. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio's eyes. 
ROMEO I thought all for the best. 
Like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap, Mercutio pushes Romeo away. He screams in horror, as if falling in the dark: 
MERCUTIO A plague o' both your houses! They have made worms' meat of me. 
Mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt. Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend's head out of the dust. The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling through the chilling cold. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) (a silent whisper) Your houses! 
Everything stands still, everything is quiet. The storm finally breaks. 
EXT. BEACH - RAIN. DAY. 
Tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle Mercutio's lifeless body. The droplets grow to a heavy rain. Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of Benvolio whispering: 
BENVOLIO Mercutio is dead! 
Tears streak Romeo's face. He cries out. 
ROMEO Oh sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor's steel! 
The sound of Tybalt's vehicle starting brings back cold reality. Romeo's sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage. 
Shrugging aside Benvolio's attempts to restrain him, Romeo runs to his car. 
EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY. 
EXT. MONUMENT. AFTERNOON. 
Away, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour. 
THE CAMERA: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched over the lifeless body of Tybalt. 
She cries: 
GLORIA Tybalt! 
Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who, both flanked by body guards, face each other across the crime scene. Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to Tybalt's body. A handcuffed Benvolio looks on. 
GLORIA (CONT.) Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child! O, the blood is spilled of my dear kinsman. 
Police lines part as Captain Prince arrives. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray? 
Benvolio struggles forward. 
BENVOLIO O noble Prince I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. 
Gloria appeals hysterically: 
GLORIA Prince as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague! 
CAPTAIN PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? 
BENVOLIO (pointing to Tybalt's corpse) There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio. 
Gloria interjects savagely. 
GLORIA He speaks not true! Affection makes him false! 
BENVOLIO Romeo, that spoke him fair, could not take Truce with the unruly spleen of 
TYBALT Deaf to peace! 
GLORIA He is a kinsman to the Montague! I beg for justice which thou Prince must give. Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live! 
Captain Prince turns to Gloria. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio. Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? 
Ted Montague pleads: 
MONTAGUE Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt. 
Captain Prince eyes Montague coldly. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE And for that offence Immediately we do exile him. 
Montague, body guards in tow, surges forward. 
MONTAGUE Noble Prince...? 
Prince silences him. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE I will be deaf to pleading and 
EXCUSES; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. Therefore use none. 
The Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found that hour is his last. 
CLOSE ON: Captain Prince. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. 
INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. AFTERNOON. 
An acoustic guitar version of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart.' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm. 
JULIET Come gentle night, coming loving black browed night, Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of a 
LOVE But not possessed it, and though I am sold, Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new 
ROBES And may not wear them. 
EXT. CAPULET'S MANSION - DRIVEWAY. AFTERNOON. 
Juliet's P.O.V.: The limousine pulls into the driveway. 
PULL OUT: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs from the room. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON. 
Through the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the Nurse at the bottom of the stairs. 
The music surges. 
The priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint for the car. 
INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. 
Sobs echo through the house. 
Dave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge bunch of flowers. 
Fulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand. 
CUT TO: Gloria on the upper landing. There is a strange faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet. 
GLORIA She'll not come down tonight. 
Dave, an understanding smile. 
DAVE These times of woe afford no times to woo. 
Capulet guides Dave into the house. 
CAPULET Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly. 
GLORIA 
(JOINING) And so did I. 
CAPULET (a cold glance at Gloria) Well, we were born to die. 
Capulet takes a large slug of whisky. Gloria leans close to Dave. 
GLORIA I'll know her mind early tomorrow. Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness. 
As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE UP: toward Juliet's bedroom door. 
INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: Juliet's face. Tears stream onto the pillow. Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek. Juliet's eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her. 
A still moment of disbelief. Leaning down, Roemo kisses away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes. 
Juliet's lips find Romeo's and they gently sink back onto the bed. 
INT. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT. 
Capulet sits in an armchair drinking. Dave and Gloria sit opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken excitement. 
CAPULET We'll keep no great ado - a friend or two. For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman if we revel much - But soft what day is this? 
DAVE Monday my lord. 
CAPULET Well Wednesday is too soon - what say you to Thursday? 
Gloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned. 
DAVE My lord I... 
CAPULET (leaning close) I will make a desperate tender of my child's love. (a drunken good humour) I think she will be ruled in all respects by me; (exploding with hearty laughter) Nay, more, I doubt it not! 
CUT TO: Gloria, her face hardens. 
CAPULET (to Dave) But what say you to Thursday? 
Dave is trying to catch up. 
DAVE My lord I... 
CUT TO: Capulet he eyes Dave intently. 
DAVE (CONT.) I would that Thursday were tomorrow. 
Delighted, Capulet jumps to his feet. 
CAPULET A Thursday let it be then! 
Capulet holds out his glass in toast. Dave and Gloria rise. 
CAPULET Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go to bed. Tell her, a Thursday she shall be 
MARRIED To this noble sir! 
CLOSE ON: The glasses clink. 
EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN. 
A pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion. 
INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN. 
A tangle of young limbs. 
Romeo and Juliet blissfully asleep. The dawn light creeps into the room. 
FOLLOW: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches Juliet's fingers hidden behind her back. 
Gloria returns to the room. Juliet steals a glance toward Romeo as he silently mouths: 
ROMEO Adieu, adieu! 
As Romeo's face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers a little prayer to herself. 
JULIET O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle, Fortune, Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back. 
INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN. 
Juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother. Gloria turns to her. 
GLORIA Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not nor I looked not for. 
Juliet plays along. 
JULIET Madam, in happy time. What day is that? 
Gloria takes a deep breath. 
GLORIA Marry, my child, early next Thursday 
MORN The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. 
CLOSE ON: Juliet. She can barely speak. 
JULIET Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride! 
Fear passes across Gloria's face. 
GLORIA Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself. 
Capulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the room. 
CAPULET How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree? 
GLORIA Ay, sir. But she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave! 
Capulet - a dangerous calm. 
CAPULET How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have 
WROUGHT So worthy a gentleman to be her bride? 
JULIET Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate. 
PAUSE: Capulet considers his daughter, then - 
BAM! He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it into a thousand pieces. 
CAPULET Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next ... 
Capulet advances. Juliet, terrified, retreats into the hallway. 
JULIET Hear me with patience but to speak a word... 
INT. LANDING. DAY. 
The Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and shakes her like a rag doll. 
CAPULET Speak not, reply not, do not answer me! 
He throws her to the floor. His fist thuds as it slams into her face. 
GLORIA 
(SCREAMING) Fie, fie! What are you mad? 
Gloria tries to restrain Capulet. He back-hands her, sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he advances on his cowering daughter. 
CAPULET Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch. 
The Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet. 
NURSE God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. 
Furious, Capulet shunts her aside. 
CAPULET Peace, you mumbling fool! 
Capulet yanks his daughter's face close to his. 
CAPULET (CONT.) I tell thee what - get thee to church a Thursday Or never after look me in the face. And you be mine, I'll give you to my friend. And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, Trust to it. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn. 
Capulet storms off down the hall. 
CLOSE ON: Juliet. She huddles, shaking at the top of the stairs. 
JULIET O sweet my mother, cast me not away! Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not, make the bridal 
CLOSE ON: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses her cheek. 
DAVE (CONT.) Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. 
Dave leaves. 
TRACK WITH: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy. 
The priest follows. 
INT. SACRISTY. DAY. 
Juliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the small room. 
The priest goes to her. 
FATHER LAURENCE O Juliet, I already know thy grief. 
Juliet pulls away. 
JULIET Tell me not, Father, that thou hearest of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. 
FATHER LAURENCE It strains me past the compass of my wits. 
JULIET 
(DESPERATELY) If in thy wisdom thou canst give no 
HELP Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently! 
She pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself. 
Horrified, Father Laurence moves to her. 
Juliet, panicked, levels the gun at him. 
FATHER LAURENCE Hold daughter! 
JULIET (through tears) Be not so long to speak. I lone to die! 
Father Laurence holds out a soothing hand. 
FATHER LAURENCE I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an 
EXECUTION As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt 
UNDERTAKE A thing like death... 
We hear the distended chords of Fauré's Requiem. 
FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) to chide away this shame... 
It continues throughout as; 
The entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue liquid. 
Reflected in the fluid's convex surface, the face of Father Laurence. 
The face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into a clear water solution. 
Like a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a cobalt hue. 
INT. GREENHOUSE WORKROOM. DAY. 
PULL BACK: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by Father Laurence. 
FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest. Each part, deprived of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the 
MORNING Comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou, dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come. And that very Night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. 
The priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial. 
FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord with speed to Mantua. 
EXT. CHURCH. DAY. 
As Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express envelope addressed "Romeo - Mantua." The envelope pulls away from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with hundreds of like envelopes. 
TRACK: With the canvas bag. It continues its journey into the back of an express delivery van. 
Heavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the slogan 'Speed Express.' 
The van pulls away. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MANTUA. DAY. 
A burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged wasteland. 
CRANE DOWN: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the distance. 
Father Laurence is worried. 
FATHER LAURENCE By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune! The letter was of dear import. (PAUSE: the priest listens) Adieu. 
He hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock. 
FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Now must I to the monument alone. Within this hour will fair Juliet awake. 
DISSOLVE FROM: The clock to... 
INT. APOTHECARY'S APARTMENT. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: A cat skitters across a stained formica table. 
PULL BACK: The Apothecary's apartment is filled with cats. Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist's vial from inside a 'Statue of Our Lady' table lamp - he now speaks with cool professionalism. 
APOTHECARY Drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight. 
Romeo takes the vial and hands over the money. 
ROMEO There is my gold - worse poison to men's souls Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. 
INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT. 
Motor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the apartment building. He checks the rear view mirror and freezes. At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to a halt. 
EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. 
Romeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight catches his face. The Cop's and Romeo's eyes meet. 
INT. POLICE CAR. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: The cop. 
COP This is that banished haughty Montague. 
INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. 
Balthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches forward. 
EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. 
Tires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of Balthasar's moving vehicle. 
Siren blaring, the police car gives chase. 
AERIAL SHOT. NIGHT. 
Balthasar's car winds through traffic - the patrol car gaining. 
EXT. ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. NIGHT. 
A police car U-turns over a median strip. 
EXT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT. 
TIGHT ON: A rusted brown hood. 
The tortured engine screams as Balthasar negotiates the speeding car through city traffic. 
CRANE UP: Red and blue police light approach fast. 
INT. PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT. 
Captain Prince barrels through the corridors of police headquarters pulling on his flying jacket. 
EXT. STREET. NIGHT. 
TIGHT ON: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt. 
Balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus. 
WHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic. Horns blare. 
CUT TO: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking to avoid collision. 
Miraculously, Balthasar's vehicle shoots out of it its path and onto the other side of the roadway. 
The sedan slams into the following patrol car. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT. 
Balthasar's car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach Eternal Rest Cemetery. 
INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. 
Captain Prince scans the night time city below. He speaks to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply. 
EXT. CEMETERY. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: A stone angel etched against the night sky. 
INT. PRIEST'S CAR. NIGHT. 
Orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the priest's car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police vehicle. 
Father Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration. 
FATHER LAURENCE Saint Francis be my speed tonight! 
Across the road Police swarm around the entrance to the cemetery. 
FATHER LAURENCE Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing. 
HOLD ON: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds pulse away. 
INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames. 
DISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel. 
The chapel is dark. 
As Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead Capulets. 
Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful in seeming death. 
Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her. 
ROMEO O my love, my wife, Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty, Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there. 
Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers. 
ROMEO (CONT.) Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that unsubstantial 
DEATH Is amorous and keeps thee here in 
DARK To be his paramour? For fear of 
THAT I still will stay with thee. Here, oh here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious 
STARS From this world-wearied flesh. 
He lays himself close. 
ROMEO (CONT.) Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss... 
Gently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips. Ever so slightly, Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice. 
ROMEO (CONT.) A dateless bargain to engrossing death. 
Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on Juliet. 
ROMEO (CONT.) (fighting for breath) O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick. 
Behind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening. Romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo. 
JULIET Oh Romeo, what's here? 
Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms. Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips. 
Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand. Tears slip from her eyes. 
JULIET (CONT.) Drunk all, and left No friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on 
THEM To make me die with a restorative. 
She delicately kisses Romeo's lips. 
JULIET (CONT.) (a heart-broken whisper) Thy lips are warm. 
Desperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers: 
ROMEO Thus with a kiss I die. 
There is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet hugs the lifeless Romeo to her. 
JULIET Romeo. O' my true love Romeo. 
She looks to the gun in his hand. 
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. 
TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking cover behind a patrol car. 
Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife toward them. 
Discover Father Laurence arriving. 
CUT TO: Father Laurence's P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights flashing, surround the mausoleum. 
He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand- cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to him.

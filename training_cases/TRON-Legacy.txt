TRON LEGACY 
Written by 
Richard Jefferies 
1   INT.   CYBERSPACE 
Electric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black. 
CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS. CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded "X-NET". 
3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New, unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides, crossing cyberspace. 
X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every inch. 
2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
DATA "TRAIN" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off, shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points. 
X-Takks notice, moving to investigate. 
DEEP IN THE LATTICE: 
Red data "uploads" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic detail, lethal EDGES - 
Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry eyes, riveted to a TASK - 
TRON 2.0. 
Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a ruthless cyber-ninja. 
X-Takks search ten story gantries. 
TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding detection. Slips into: 
3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT 
X-Takks on high alert. 
TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY. 
Pulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY. 
(CONTINUED) 
3   CONTINUED: 
TRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize. Shockwave quakes system. 
POWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT. 
X-Takks spot TRON. 
X-TAKKS Intruder!   Fix coordinates! 
POLICE POUNCE, FIRING. 
Tron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT - 
DISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets, brutally accurate, takes out three more Police - 
TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate. DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts. 
ALARMS WAIL - 
POWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS. X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted. 
TRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks - 
Arriving on the scene - split-second response: 
Elite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by: 
RX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH). 
TRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA CHANNEL - 
RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles, hotly pursuing TRON. 
TRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls across cyberspace. 
AGENT 1 This is the first time an Intruder has broken into X-Net! 
RX23 LEADER And it's the last. Follow him! Shut him down! 
They speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY. 
4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY 
Broadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for: 
TRON - accelerating, escaping. 
Rx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles. 
TRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH. PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall. 
Rx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing. 
5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE 
TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE. 
But Tron suddenly brakes, quitting the chase. 
RX23 is puzzled.    Looks forward.       Eyes spring wide. 
12   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY 
Rush's screen:   His Pulse Rider speeds straight for the rocks. 
RUSH Yikes! 
13   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID 
Pulse Rider smashes into rocks, RX23 pulverizes to neon bits. Electro SHOCKWAVE sears across game grid. Search Engine freezes overhead, glitches and CRASHES like a blimp. 
All goes white - snow crash. 
14   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM BETA TEST LAB - DAY 
RUSH He crashed me! 
NERDS FUBAR!    Bad Thing!   Flame War! 
RUSH Miles.    Did you get a trace on him?! 
Miles stares at his blank screen.     Blinking.    Every screen in the lab is blank. 
PHLEGMAN We are so screwed. 
KELTER Who tells the boss? 
All eyes land on Rush. 
RUSH Get the system back up!     Now!    Move! 
15   EXT.   LAWN OF ENCOM CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY 
PRESS CREWS camp a block away. 
X-Net PR TEAM preps a media extravaganza. Shirt logo: "X- NET = TOTAL DATA SECURITY" Banners, video projections, music. 
X-NET PUBLIC RELATIONS VP leads entourage on a preview. 
15   CONTINUED: 
PR VP Weather is holding. Dress rehearsal on for 6PM. In the morning, we let the press in for a 7AM tech set-up, then you go live worldwide 9 AM sharp. 
Staff defers to: GORDON SINCLAIR (45), boyish, ruthless, brilliant CEO of Encom Corporation. 
SINCLAIR Delay the press until 8:30. I'll taking the stage at 8:50. Force a network break-in. Then it's news. 
He catches something on a video screen, snaps his fingers. 
SINCLAIR Play that again. 
Crew murmurs on headsets.    Promo video replays: 
VIDEO PLAYBACK X-Net deploys radical software design, constructs proprietary white-hot firewalls, unleashes virus killer apps. Creating the most secure data network in history. Your data can never again be hacked, corrupted, stolen or destroyed. X-Net is the final solution, totally guaranteed 99.999% secure data transmission - 
SINCLAIR Who changed that? Who put "99.999"? 
X-Net executives chill. 
PR VP Um, that would be...    Legal. 
Eyes land on withering LEGAL VP. 
SINCLAIR Change it back to the way I wrote it. With the launch of X-Net, this company guarantees one hundred percent secure data transmission. If we can't deliver on that promise, we deserve to be out of business. 
Rush appears from a building.       Signals Sinclair aside. 
SINCLAIR What can't wait, Rush? 
(CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED:    (2) 
RUSH Um. X-Net was just breached by a hacker. 
SINCLAIR goes pale. 
RUSH System's back up, no permanent damage, but... But whoever's behind this, they're good, and they're still out there. 
16   INT.   SINCLAIR'S OFFICE - DAY 
Sprawling, big bucks, basketball hoop. 
Sinclair enters, alone. Closes door. Uses a retinal scan ID to access his computer. Secure connection opens. As he speaks, text instantly appears: 
SINCLAIR Identify the intruder. 
17   EXT.   CYBERSPACE 
Flashing circuitry, machine code bit-storm.     We follow Sinclair's text message data stream 
Min-blowing cyberspace fly-over. 
DATA BEAM penetrates a towering shaft, reaching deep inside the MASSIVELY FORTIFIED X-NET CENTRAL SERVER. 
18   INT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET CENTRAL SERVER / INNER SANCTUM 
LONE FIGURE stands clothed in flashy cyber-armor:     Fluid photons, oozing high-rez circuitry. 
It's PLEXOR, cyber-twin of real-world Sinclair. 
Rush's electrified body hurtles across the void, eyes filled with TERROR and AWE. 
TRANSFORMS TO: 
28   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
Shimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape. 
Rush enters this bizarre world - CRASH/FLASH - stranger in a strange land. Data energy ZAPS off his body, interacting with the landscape circuitry around him. He fights it, tries to control it. 
28   CONTINUED: 
Rush stands, beholds the place. Looks at his hands and arms, clad in circuitry. He finds he had landed outside: 
Fortress-like X-NET CENTRAL SERVER.       ALARMS SOUNDING inside. 
He turns, looks up a FIREWALL. Hundreds of X-Takk Troops hurry to look down. FIRING WEAPONS. 
A FIGURE comes at him, down the wall, STREAKING RED. 
BLAMMO! 
TRON lands on a plateau above Rush, gazing down. 
They face each other, equally perplexed. 
Rush is no longer human, but not quite a program either. Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry. 
Tron stares, unblinking - Cyber-Ninja. 
RUSH It's YOU!    The intruder! 
Rush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of code. 
Code races across Rush's eyes.        Identification data. 
RUSH You are...    TRON?!? 
X-Takks hustle onto the scene. 
Tron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection.      He whips his disk off his back and THROWS. 
Disk SLAMS Rush in the gut, knocks him flat. 
RUSH ARRRGHH! 
X-Takks pursue Tron - 
Tron recovers his disk - vanishes in an OUTBOUND DATA STREAM, losing his pursuers. 
X-Takks pull Rush to his feet, shocked. 
X-TAKK 1 RX23?! 
28   CONTINUED:    (2) 
X-TAKK 2 But...    You crashed irrecoverably! 
RUSH Uh, well, I'm not exactly - 
X-TAKK 3 RX23 has been rebooted! 
VOICE RX23 reboot was not authorized! 
Pushing through Police: A sleek, smart cyber-babe MEGA. (She's Meg's cyber-twin: Twice the edge, half the patience, all the curves.) 
Rush is awed by the sight of her. 
RUSH Yow.     I know who programmed you. 
MEGA I am Mega, X-Net Intelligence. 
RUSH Mega.     Cool.     I am - 
MEGA A spy? Posing as RX23? Under which register were you rebooted? 
RUSH I'm a User. 
Mega and X-Takks look at him like he's crazy. 
MEGA Detain this impostor. 
X-Takks move to seize Rush. 
RUSH No wait, look. We're on the same side here. I got an ID on the intruder! 
Mega touches Rush, exciting his energy flow.        She reads data streaming in his eyes - TRON'S ID info. 
MEGA "Tron"? 
X-TAKK 2 How did he get that?? 
(CONTINUED) 
28   CONTINUED:    (3) 
MEGA Plexor must know of this! 
29   EXT.   CENTRAL CONTROL SERVER 
Mega and X-Takks escort Rush across bridges, in security portals. Firewalls cool and part, allowing them to pass. 
Down a grand corridor, past towering energy columns and throbbing green memory banks. They cross a bridge. View includes: Vast square concentric security rings surround a massive cubic POWER SUPPLY CORE. 
38   CONTINUED: 
SINCLAIR Tron? Wasn't Tron one of our programs? 
Sinclair and Meg trade baffled looks. 
39   INT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET NEXUS 
Plexor oversees construction.     X-Takk Commander points to something in the distance. 
Beyond the horizon, the RUBY RED BEAM reaches to the heavens. 
Plexor sees it, alarmed. 
40   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT I/O PORT - MORNING 
Text forms in magenta circuitry - GOOD WORK PARTNER. 
RUSH I have a plan to crash Tron. 
Mega turns with alarm. 
MEGA ABORT! 
Walls THUNDER and CRASH IN - 
Rush leaps clear with his disk - 
MASSIVE ROMBALL (data reformatting orb) hurtles around the I/O Port, ZAPPING all it touches, de-rezzing data structures into neutral gray "blank matter". 
ROMBALL loops skyward. 
GIANT D-REZZ PROGRAM crashes down from above, retrieves ROMBALL - He's ENORMOUS, TOUGH, SINGLE-MINDED. 
41   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION - SINCLAIR'S OFFICE - DAY 
Sinclair and Meg hang on the broken transmission: 
MEG Rush? 
Words appear:    END OF LINE. 
SINCLAIR He'd better not fail. 
42   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT 
D-Rezz screams like a modem, hurls ROMBALL - 
Mega and Krod dive clear - 
ROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports.        D- rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod. 
RUSH Hey! Double points if you nail me! Bring it on! 
D-Rezz turns his ugly sights on Rush, baited away from Mega and Krod. 
D-rezz flexes and ROARS, revealing an X-NET LOGO on his chest. 
RUSH Stop!    End your routine! 
D-rezz corners Rush, hurls his ROMBALL - Ball fires every circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy. 
Rush dodges - 
RUSH Cease!    Desist! We're on the same team! 
Mega throws her disk, plings D-rezz on the skull.      D-rezz turns on her - 
Rush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back.      Like riding a gorilla - 
D-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill. 
RUSH I'm X-Net too! 
Data flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm. Radiant energy between predator and prey. 
Digits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit. 
D-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches.       Lowers his head in shame. 
RUSH No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it so hard. We all have bad days. 
(CONTINUED) 
42   CONTINUED: 
RUSH rolls the BIG ROMBALL over:     A peace offering. 
Mega and Krod cautiously approach. 
MEGA He was carrying out his programming. All I/O Ports are scheduled for de- rezz. 
D-rezz hears this, happy to be understood.       (He never talks.) 
KROD Easy, big guy. No harm, no foul. 
RUSH D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your raw power. You ready to be a hero for X-Net? 
D-Rezz stands, clutches his ROMBALL.       Reporting for duty. 
KROD Cool. Now I've got somebody I can boss around. 
D-rezz modem-growls at Krod. 
I-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal: 
44   EXT.   OLD GAME GRID 
Rush steps across the vast vector-graphic grid surface. 
Eerie.   Quiet.     Pure. 
Mega, I-Beem, Krod and D-rezz follow. 
MEGA This region is obsolete. 
Rush kneels, touches grid lines.    Circuits energize, as his energy surges in all directions.    He draws in data. 
RUSH There's bits of Tron's code all over. Krod, give D-Rezz and I-beem the escape coordinate Tron used on me. 
Krod's eyes flash data to I-Beem and D-rezz.      "Tr165444.018". 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED: 
I-BEEM Coordinate captured. 
D-Rezz nods, palming his Romball. 
RUSH That's where Tron will bail out. We'll make sure he needs to. Go set up the trap. (to D-rezz) You only get one shot at this, big guy. Stop him but don't destroy him, right? He's got data I need. 
D-rezz grips Romball, grunts affirmation.    He and I-beem head for the perimeter of the grid. 
MEGA If this is Tron's territory, he'll know we're here. He'll hide. 
RUSH He can't resist a grudge match. He'll take risks trying to beat me. That's how we trip him up. (to Krod) Whip it out. 
Rush unsheathes his LIGHT WAND. 
Krod pulls out his own LIGHT WAND. 
They both look at Mega. 
She's got no light wand. 
KROD You didn't bring one? 
MEGA I don't have one. 
KROD Hey, not a problem - 
Krod holds his light wand forward, activates it.    LIGHT CYCLE up-rezzes under him. He revs it, ready to go. 
KROD (to Mega) - Hop on! 
RUSH Hang on, Krod. 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:    (2) 
Rush activates his light wand. LIGHT CYCLE up-rezzes under him, with a special two tier seat for a second rider. 
RUSH I upgraded my unit. 
KROD You are awesome, man.    I hate you. 
Mega considers. There's more on her mind she's not talking about. She smiles at Rush, climbs on back of his light cycle. 
MEGA Mmmm...   Hack me. 
A nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF. 
LIGHT CYCLES shoot across grid surface. 
Mega screams and clutches Rush, throwing her body against his, clamping her arms around him. 
Krod and Rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other, getting warmed up. It's familiar territory. 
Light cycles race toward each other on the same line. 
Mega holds Rush tight, eyes filling with terror. 
MEGA Resource conflict!    Fatal crash imminent! 
But Krod and Rush slow their light cycles with expert skill, rolling safely to a halt, nose-to-nose. Directly over: 
A BIG RED DOT.      The only dot on the grid. 
Grid Center. 
Mega, Rush and Krod raise up to scan the horizon.        It's all clear flat grid to the horizon. 
RUSH Any sign of him? 
KROD Everything looks the same to me. Everything looks the same. The same. The same. 
RUSH Krod, snap out of it. 
44   CONTINUED:    (3) 
MEGA Tron will never expose himself. 
They watch, wait, pivot. 
KROD The same... 
RUSH WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! 
MEGA I-    I GOT SCARED! 
Krod shoots gap.      D-rezz is ready to smash him with his Romball. 
I-BEEM No!   It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE! 
D-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball. 
Romball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid. 
Romball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot. 
Romball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle.       Lightcycle vaporizes. Tron skids and tumbles. 
I-beem zaps beside Rush and Mega.       Krod and D-rezz join them. 
(CONTINUED) 
49   CONTINUED:    (2) 
KROD There he goes! 
Tron climbs over rocks, escaping through a TUNNEL. 
RUSH We've got him now.    Let's go! 
WHOOSH! Electro-fire Romball careens across grid, bearing down on them. 
Group DIVES CLEAR. 
D-rezz swings in a foot, stopping the Romball - inches short of mowing down Krod. 
KROD I could have done that. 
He strobes, freezes, hits the deck. 
50   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL 
Stalking their prey:       Rush, Krod, I-beem and D-rezz. 
MEGA We can't go any further. 
Ahead, vast old circuitry has been "eaten through" by dull throbbing greenish MEMORY LEAKAGE. Paths of unaffected material are narrow and maze-like. 
RUSH What is it? 
KROD Don't ask, dude. 
MEGA It's a memory leak, once it starts, it infects everything. 
I-BEEM Touch it and you crash forever.     We cannot risk it. 
MEGA I agree. 
D-rezz grunts. 
KROD Then it's settled. 
50   CONTINUED: 
Krod turns to head home. 
RUSH Stop. Listen to me. You might not believe there's a world outside of this one, but let's just say a guy named Sinclair is depending on me. If Tron got through here, then I can too. Who's with me? 
D-rezz steps forward, then I-Beem.      Shamed, Krod joins them. Finally, Mega makes it unanimous. 
RUSH Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's up ahead. We'll guard this portal until you come back. 
I-beem and D-rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission. 
Krod pulls off his disk, nervously practices boomerang throws. 
RUSH Better show me how to use mine. 
KROD No problem. It's all in the velocity- vector ratio. 
Rush pulls the disk off his own back.      He throws - disk flies wild - he runs to retrieve it. 
Mega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory leakage. She finds the remnants of COM CIRCUITRY and stares data beams into its transducer. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
51   EXT.   X-NET NEXUS UNDER CONSTRUCTION - PLEXOR'S VEHICLE 
Plexor's vehicle circuitry forms image of Mega. 
PLEXOR Report. 
MEGA We interfaced with Tron.   He escaped into a dark zone. 
52   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL 
Around a corner, Rush comes to retrieve his disk.       He pauses to eavesdrop on Mega's communication: 
(CONTINUED) 
52   CONTINUED: 
PLEXOR The Random One has proven effective? 
MEGA He is all glitches and bad data. He virtually got us de-rezzed. I recommend we terminate this mission. 
RUSH Ouch! 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED: 
His ankle.    He straightens, standing in front of D-rezz. 
Lays eyes on Tron. 
RUSH Hey!   Pick on somebody your own size! 
D-rezz is twice as big as either of them. 
Tron's eyes are cold, lifeless, calculating.       Scanning his new opponent without success. 
RUSH You've got no data on me. 
Rush pulls his disk off his back, poised for a duel. 
Tron moves with calculation, grips his hyper-etched disk. Circling his prey. 
Throws again - 
BRRANGG - 
Rush DUCKS - 
Tron's disk slams D-rezz.     D-rezz tries to catch the disk, but he's just too slow. 
Rush throws his disk. Beginner's luck - it banks off a wall and nearly smacks Tron. Rush snags it on the way back, before it tumbles into memory leakage. 
Tron jumps up two levels.     Retrieves his disk. 
RUSH D-rezz, pull me up! 
D-rezz hoists Rush up.     Fingers grab upper deck. 
Tron jockeys for position.     Throws disk - 
Disk strikes D-rezz in the ribs.     Blast damage. 
D-rezz loses footing. 
Rush grabs upper level. 
D-rezz slips toward memory leakage. 
Rush grabs D-rezz's hand - he weighs a ton. 
Mega, Krod and I-beem can't get here to help - 
53   CONTINUED:    (2) 
RUSH Hang on, man! HANG ON! 
But D-rezz's big hand slips out of Rush's. 
D-rezz PLUMMETS into memory leakage, zapping away in a blaze of glory - 
RUSH NOOOO! 
He comes to his feet, facing Tron.       Determined. 
RUSH I know who you are. Encom security program Tr856 - TRON! 
Tron pauses.    Processes. 
RUSH Who is your User?? 
Tron glitches at the question. 
RUSH Who programmed you?? I know your encryption code. Tell me your User or I shut you down. 
Tron throws his disk. 
Rush dodges. He sends waves of data energy through floor circuits, reaching into Tron's body. 
RUSH I can shut you down with a nine digit code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 - 
Tron's body animates painfully, as the first three code digits click into place. 
Tron FLIPS away, breaking contact with floor.        Data transfer stops. Tron steals away through a tunnel. 
Rush pursues. 
Krod, Mega and I-beem clamber for a way to follow. 
54   INT.   OBSOLETE COMPUTER GAME ARENA 
Circular, riddled with memory leaks. 
Rush hurries to the center.       No sign of Tron. 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED: 
RUSH Tell me, Tron! Who programmed you? Here's your encryption code! 3-6-2- 
Rush sends data coursing into floor circuits. It radiates up walls, across bridges... And finds TRON in hiding. 
Data races into Tron's body. Six code numbers engage; he glitches. He LEAPS to breaks the contact, flinging his disk - 
RUSH Yeah, I'm a User. A superior being. The first to enter this realm. And you are - ? 
Figure's circuitry lights.         Finally, we see the face... 
It is FLYNN. 
FLYNN The first. 
RUSH Flynn.   How can you be here? 
54   CONTINUED:    (4) 
KROD You know this dude? 
RUSH Yeah, he's a lunatic! 
I-beem panics, zaps away in an energy beam. He reforms further along for a "breath", then zaps further away. Three FINITY FIGHTERS chase him. 
Rush is amazed to find him self in the presence of Encom's former leader. 
Flynn comes closer, recognizing Rush. 
FLYNN Rush Nortebi. I remember hiring you. 
They are equally dumbfounded. 
KROD Somebody tipped these guys off about us. 
MEGA Not soon enough. 
Fighters step aside, Mega enters, furious at Rush. 
MEGA You weren't supposed to beat Tron. I thought for sure he'd finish you. 
RUSH Thanks. 
MEGA You destroyed our last hope! 
KROD I detect a pattern in her behavior. 
RUSH She's a spy. 
Mega and Rush ooze mutual contempt.    Rush turns on Flynn. 
RUSH No wonder I couldn't figure it out. I assumed Tron User was on the outside! If I'd known this, I would blown past him and come straight for you. 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED:    (5) 
Flynn yanks Tron's disk from Rush, peers over the precipice. Below, the last of Tron is consumed by memory leakage. 
Flynn ponders Tron's lifeless disk. He falters on his bad leg. Mega throws an arm around to help him stand. Melancholy energy courses between them. 
MEGA I failed our cause. 
FLYNN You did everything you could. 
They know each other well. 
Rush registers jealousy, but larger concerns prevail: 
RUSH Flynn never died... (dawning) Because your Quantum Digitizer worked. That's how you got here... I know - that's how I got here too. 
Flynn studies Rush, anger rising. 
FLYNN The day after I hired you, you start sucking up to Sinclair. You thought I didn't know. Bet he offered your a partnership for this, right? You have no idea the damage you've done. 
RUSH I'm only getting started. Man, you were the company joke. Now I see why. You melted down your lab to take this little joyride. You got stuck here so all you can do is wreck other people's hard work. 
FLYNN Open your eyes, geek. My lab was rigged. My "death" was no accident. I pushed the button just in time to escape... Almost in time. 
He indicates his deformed leg.     Mega, Krod and the others listen with awed bewilderment.     These two guys speak of a world unknown to them. 
RUSH You're paranoid. Who would want you dead? 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED:    (6) 
FLYNN The same guy I programmed Tron to shut down. Same one you've been sucking up to. Sinclair. And his cyber-henchman, Plexor. 
Malicious grumbles from Fighters. 
RUSH Too many of your brain cells have gotten zapped in here, old man. 
FLYNN Rush, you lamer! You've been working for the bad guy. 
Three Fighters return from the I-beem pursuit.      Empty-handed. 
FIGHTER ONE He got away. 
Flynn scowls at Rush. Sin number two.       Flynn slips Tron's dead disk in a special case. 
FLYNN Let's move. X-Net goons will soon be all over this place. 
55   EXT.   GAME GRID 
Energy zaps across grid, forming into I-beem. He's on the run, de-rezzing, zapping, reforming, bolting for: 
56   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM -      DEMOLISHED I/O PORTS 
I-beem de-rezzes, reforms, zaps himself toward the nearest X- Net OPTIK HIGHWAY. 
Flynn hastens their journey. 
MEGA Rush was trying to expose us! 
FLYNN They didn't see us.   Keep moving! 
Mega, Boole and Quantz move along, shoving Krod and Rush. 
RUSH We've got to tell people on the outside - 
FLYNN Plexor shut down all the I/O ports. Only HE communicates with the outside. Sinclair holds all the cards. 
Flynn turns on Rush - one of Sinclair's cards. 
FLYNN How did you get here?! 
RUSH Megan Randall sent me. (points out Mega) Her User. She fixed your lab and sent me here to take out Tron. 
FLYNN Megan Randall? I remember her. Smart, wise beyond her years. I can't believe she'd fall for Sinclair's lies. 
He glances at Mega, then shoves Rush along. 
67   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT 
Flynn, Mega, Fighters bring Rush and Krod into the clandestine Fighter base. Like a wartime casualty center, with corrupted Fighter Programs lining corridors. 
RUSH What happened to them? 
MEGA Try to attack Plexor head-on, this is what happens. Because of you, there will be millions more. 
(CONTINUED) 
67   CONTINUED: 
They arrive at a laser-barred JAIL BLOCK, where a dozen BIG X-Takk Troops are held prisoner. 
FLYNN Lock up these two. We'll hold them for ransom. Or use them for target practice. 
Flynn and Mega turn to go.      Boole and Quantz use PROD LANCES to herd Rush and Krod. 
RUSH Flynn. You think I'm Sinclair's flunky, but I'm not. 
Flynn pauses.    Rush speaks low, so X-Net Captives can't hear. 
RUSH I'm sorry about Tron. 
KROD Yeah, we're - Sorry? 
RUSH We were just doing a job, we had no way of knowing the truth. 
KROD No way at all. 
RUSH Flynn, I was wrong about you. You've been doing the right thing in here. Plexor has to be shut down. Sinclair has to be exposed. 
KROD Like he said. 
RUSH Krod and I are ready to help. 
KROD We are? 
Flynn puzzles over Rush. 
FLYNN Mega, what do you read in him? 
Mega circles Rush, scanning his circuits. 
MEGA Independent operating instructions. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
67   CONTINUED:    (2) 
MEGA (CONT'D) He will act as necessary to increase probability of his own survival. 
RUSH You don't know me. 
MEGA He cannot to be trusted. 
RUSH Trust?! You're the one who's been lying to me the whole time! 
Rush points a finger at Mega - BOLT of ATTRACTION ENERGY shoots off his finger, ZAPS her on the nose. 
Mega's circuits OVERLOAD, she flies back - 
Rush, startled, looks at his finger. 
Fighters muscle Rush and Krod away. 
Flynn holds Mega, anger re-ignited. 
FLYNN Mega's been risking her existence for our cause, lamer. That's more than you'll ever do. (to Fighters) Lock them away! 
Fighters toss Rush and Krod in the JAIL BLOCK with the BIG X- TAKK soldiers. Does finger-signs, body circuit language. 
KROD Yo, s'up?     Eh... X-Net rules, man. 
RUSH Hey Krod...     Shut down. 
Rush peers out of his cage, watching Mega go.        She turns for a final scowl, then exits. 
68   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - EVENING 
X-Takk Troops sound alert. 
SINCLAIR That's impossible. 
PLEXOR Flynn commanded the intruder Tron. 
SINCLAIR You've got to be wrong about this. 
PLEXOR I was programmed error-free.      By you. 
Sinclair ponders the unimaginable. 
SINCLAIR Flynn...     escaped?! 
PLEXOR He leads a group who seek to prevent the opening of X-Net. The one called Rush has joined them. 
72   CONTINUED: 
SINCLAIR Rush? My guy? What lies has Flynn filled him with? 
PLEXOR Or what truths? 
Sinclair peers at the screen text, agitation growing. A news article pops up, recounting the lab accident and Flynn's "death". X-Net launch countdown ticks. 
SINCLAIR This world can never know all I have done. You have a plan to contain Flynn? 
PLEXOR Of course. 
SINCLAIR Don't just contain him.    Destroy him. 
PLEXOR Instructions received.    And the one called Rush? 
Sinclair mulls for two seconds, then: 
SINCLAIR He knows too much. Get rid of him. 
PLEXOR Instructions received. 
73   INT.   JAIL BLOCK 
Rush and Krod get chummy with cell-mate X-Takks.     They mock- fight together, getting insider tips. 
X-TAKK 1 And whatever you do, don't let them hit you here... 
Indicates a CIRCUIT NEXUS on his lower SPINE. 
X-TAKK 1 All X-Net Programs have a weak spot there. 
RUSH Hear that, Krod? Never let them get to your weak spot. 
(CONTINUED) 
73   CONTINUED: 
Krod twists around, playing with his spinal nexus. 
KROD Gurfle!   I never knew that. 
Pull back to see: 
Flynn secretly observes Rush.     Pondering.    Boole arrives behind him. 
BOOLE We're ready for you now. 
They head upstairs. 
74   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT 
Flynn reviews Fighter training. Troops throw disks, battle in pairs, repair weapons, tweak armor circuitry. 
Flynn carries Tron's dark disk, contemplating it.       He moves past a line-up of his finest Fighters. 
FLYNN If X-Net is allowed to open it's the beginning of the end of a free and open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor get away with this. Our game plan has not changed. Tron was specially programmed to break into X-Net and shut down power supplies. We would then exploit these weak points and cripple the system. Tron's role was essential One of you must take his place. 
He holds up Tron's disk. 
FLYNN Who among you can power Tron's disk and carry out his mission? 
All Fighters take a step forward. 
FLYNN It's the most dangerous job. If you're not up for it, nobody's going to blame you. 
All stand firm. 
Flynn lays Tron's disk in the first Fighter's hands. Fighter summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. But it soon goes dark again. 
74   CONTINUED: 
Next Fighter holds the disk, bearing down, animating the circuits... But he buckles and the disk falls dims. 
Mega worries: One-by-one, Fighters fail to power Tron's disk. Flynn reaches the end of the line. 
Mega puts her hands out to receive the disk. 
Flynn hesitates, then hands her Tron's disk. 
Mega clenches it, concentrating deeply. Her energy infuses the disk, animating its circuits stronger than anyone. 
Bur soon, her eyes strobe, her body circuits overload. 
She lets go.    Tron's disk thunks the floor, goes dark. 
Mega hardens her resolve. 
MEGA There are other ways to crash Plexor. I will return to him, he still trusts me. I will get close and crash him with direct contact - 
(CONTINUED) 
82   CONTINUED: 
KROD She's with Flynn!       I mean, totally WITH Flynn -! 
RUSH (cuts off Krod, covers) Flynn was smart enough to interrogate her first. 
KROD Right. 
PLEXOR (duped) She contains sensitive data. Flynn cannot be allowed to hack her. 
Rush and Krod notice: Behind Plexor and his Soldiers, BOOLE, QUANTZ and FINITY FIGHTERS move into position. They signal Rush and Krod not to blow their cover. Rush makes Krod comply. An ambush is ready to spring. 
RUSH Yeah, only -     We kicked Flynn's butt, too. 
KROD You should have seen it.       Flynn won't be a problem. 
X-Takk Prisoners are confused. 
PLEXOR Then...   Why were you imprisoned? 
X-TAKK Ambush! 
Fighters POUNCE, throwing disks - 
Rush grabs a PROD LANCE, nails two X-Takks on their spinal nexus. They go down hard. 
PLEXOR Delete them all! 
Plexor hurls an ENERGY BALL - Rush DUCKS, grazed by its FRACTAL comet trail. 
Fighters beat back Plexor.         His concerns shift.    He ducks into an ascension shaft - 
Rush and Krod are left fighting back-to-back, out-manned three-to-one. 
83   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT ASCENSION SHAFT 
Plexor races upward, but is blocked by a unit of Fighters. 
Plexor pulls off his special TRIANGULAR DEATH DISK - FLINGS it. Disk ricochets off three Fighters, knocking them out. Another lethal fling and the remains Fighters fall. 
Plexor retrieves his death-disk with heart-stopping accuracy, darts into: 
84   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT MAIN ARENA 
PLEXOR It's a TRAP! 
X-Takk Troops react, bolting for their Cruisers. 
Floor circuits ACTIVATE -     X-Takks ZAP and FREEZE. 
Fighters appear from all directions. 
Disks fly - 
X-Takks wield stout MAZER weapons - 
Even the corrupted Fighter Programs pitch in, working in clever teams, chipping away at Plexor's forces. 
But X-Takks have tougher armor and more awesome weapons. 
X-Takk Mazer cuts down Fighters by the dozen, leaving them corrupted or shut down. 
UPPER LEVEL: 
Flynn struggles to help wounded Fighters - He captures a Mazer and uses it against X-Takks... But Flynn can't move well on his bad leg. He watches his troops getting trounced. 
FLYNN Retreat! Over that way!     Move around their flank! 
ZAP!   A Mazer blast strikes Flynn's bad leg. 
FLYNN Arrrgghhh! 
Mega appears, throws her disk with deadly accuracy. The offending X-Takk Soldier crashes. Millions of bits spray over main arena - fractal fireworks. 
(CONTINUED) 
84   CONTINUED: 
Mega grabs Flynn from falling.       They make for a bridge. 
Flynn slaps a wall panel.       Trigger circuit activates, surging down into... 
85   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT MAIN ARENA 
...Circuit energizes a sector of floor circuits, which overload and BLAZE - frying twenty X-Takks. 
86   INT.   JAIL BLOCK AREA 
Rush and Krod use puny PROD LANCES against fearsome X-Takks... 
Rush charges an X-Takk dude, Krod gets cornered by another. Rush dodges his death blow, spine-zapping his foe... Krod prepares to die, as X-Takk Bully pins him with a Mazer and squeezes the trigger. 
X-Takk Bully seizes, freezes, crashes. Mazer barrel falls away from Krod - he's lucky to be alive. Rush stows Zap Wand, grabs Mazer and yanks Krod to his feet. 
KROD Thanks. 
RUSH I'll never let you forget it. 
KROD Rush, we're screwed!    Now everybody's after us! 
RUSH Nah, we're cool. We're with them! 
NEGABYTE BEAMS slice walls, erasing all data in their path. Rush, Flynn and Mega dive into a tunnel, escaping by inches. 
90   EXT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / DATA PIPE 
Rush, Mega and Flynn, pursued, rendezvous with Krod, Boole and Quantz. 
BOOLE This way!   Down the pipe! 
Rush helps Krod, Quantz and Boole into a data pipe.       One by one, they WHIRL away in the flow of chromatic data. 
Flynn and Mega have a breathless moment to consider Rush. 
MEGA He's better than I thought. 
FLYNN He's been sent for a reason. 
MEGA What reason? 
FLYNN Don't know yet. Sometimes we have to trust the bigger plan. 
Mega struggles to compute. 
Rush turns to help Flynn down the pipe. Mega assists. Flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. Rush holds him, but loses his balance, slides down. 
RUSH Mega!   Quick! Jump! 
But she hesitates - 
VELCRONIC BEAMS snag her from behind - pulling her back onto the ledge. 
Rush tumbles down the flume, glancing back to see: 
Mega, hauled away by X-Takk Troops. 
RUSH MEGA!!! 
(CONTINUED) 
90   CONTINUED: 
Fighters, Krod, Rush and Flynn surf down the data WHIRL, accelerating away from the hot zone. 
X-Takks jump in after them, but are all swallowed by the flow - gone. 
91   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / MAIN HALL 
Bashed and ruined, littered with fallen Fighters. 
Plexor nurses his injured arm, commanding the mop-up. 
X-Takks bring Mega to their leader. 
X-TAKK 1 We got her! 
Mega stands defiant. 
Plexor regards her sternly. Extends his hand to her shoulder, cupping the back of her neck. 
PLEXOR You committed a fatal error. 
DATA ENERGY SURGES from his eyes, flushing her body circuits. She fights intensifying input, but soon weakens. She glitches and shuts down, falling into the arms of X-Takks. 
PLEXOR Their strategies and tactics lie encrypted in her memory. Bring her! I will hack from her what I need. 
92   INT.   DATA PIPE NETWORK 
Flynn leads the way, surfing the chromatic hyper-speed flow with Quantz and Boole. 
Rush and Krod struggle to master the technique, rolling, slipping, recovering, grabbing each other. 
RUSH I got it, I got it, I got it. 
Boole surfs around them, heading into a squirrely curve. 
KROD AWWWWWWW! 
Krod swings high, out of control.     Dumps in front of Rush, who flips him upright. 
(CONTINUED) 
92   CONTINUED: 
RUSH Shove it!    Go! 
Rush and Krod swerve and gathers speed, shooting past Quantz, Boole and Flynn - pivoting to surf BACKWARDS! 
KROD I remember now! Nothing to it! 
RUSH Check it out! 
Rush flips up and surfs on his hands.       Krod attempts to match the move. 
BOOLE Look out! 
RUSH What? 
FLYNN TURN AROUND! 
Rush and Krod crane around to see: 
DATA PIPE spills into a massive DATA FLUME. 
RUSH & KROD AHHHHHHHH! 
Bingo. 
Square spins into a circle, latches and LIGHTS the entire Hologon lattice. Intricate 3D code patterns ANIMATES. 
FLYNN Not bad. 
KROD Good thing you didn't terminate us. 
RUSH How do we use this thing to shut down Plexor? 
FLYNN (picks up hologon) It's a copy of Plexor's master key. We can break into any X-Net facility and fry the power supply. 
RUSH But once Plexor knows we have it, he'll change the code. 
FLYNN Yep.   We've got one shot. 
RUSH Then we should take out the power supply to Plexor's main server. 
GROUP Yes! Take out Plexor's central server! 
FLYNN Hang on, guys, that's not as easy as it sounds - 
RUSH I was inside the main server, I saw how it's laid out. 
KROD I used to work there!   I'll recognize where everything is! 
CODE MONK N1J We can take it! 
CODE MONK J2R Hit Plexor where he lives! 
(CONTINUED) 
108   CONTINUED:    (3) 
FLYNN Even with this key, it won't - 
QUANTZ We can pull it off, can't we Flynn? One final assault on Plexor's central server? 
BOOLE Shut him down forever? 
All eyes on Flynn.    Rush's naivete has ignited false hope in the Fighters. 
RUSH Of course we can. 
Flynn forces a smile. 
FLYNN Hey, the future depends on us.    How could we fail? 
109   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER 
Sinclair comes off the secured elevator, finds Meg and Dewey at work on Quantum Digitizer. 
MEG It's almost fixed. I'll be able to bring back Rush soon - 
SINCLAIR Excellent work. Unfortunately, I'm shutting down this project. 
MEG What? 
SINCLAIR Something came up. The company is at stake. I can't go into details. 
MEG But Rush would have no way to return! 
SINCLAIR Meg. I will never hold you responsible. This is a tough call, but it's mine. Dismantle and destroy all of this equipment and software. Immediately. 
109   CONTINUED: 
MEG Well - 
SINCLAIR Meg...   I'm not asking. 
MEG I understand. 
He shoots a look and exits. 
110   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY OVER DARK ZONE 
Compiler Crews work at megahertz speed. OPTIK HIGHWAYS extend and converge. Switching stations assemble. Crews shift to new assignments. 
Pull wide to see dismal ground below.    Dark zone, emitting woeful blips of random energy. 
Pillars descend from X-Net crews above and SMASH into the old silicon, planting themselves deep and impervious. 
Rush stands on a vista point, aghast as X-Net construction dominates the landscape. 
FLYNN It's a bummer being on the losing team, huh Rush? 
Flynn sits nearby, trying to patch his corrupted leg. 
RUSH We'll trash X-Net. Then we'll go back to the our world and expose what Sinclair's done. 
He looks at Krod, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys in the distance, preparing for battle. 
RUSH Do they have any idea our world exists? Do they understand what a User is? 
FLYNN Programs once connected freely with their Users. But Plexor shut down the I/O ports, severing all links. He controls all contact with the world we once knew. Programs operate on his instructions or none at all. 
(CONTINUED) 
110   CONTINUED: 
RUSH Or yours. 
FLYNN It's nothing to brag about.    We're getting our butts kicked. 
Rush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing infinite surface variations. 
Rush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne, lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance. 
KROD & FIGHTERS YES!   Excellent move, dude! 
RUSH It feels...    Awesome. 
Rush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.       It surprises him. 
He cocks his disk and THROWS. 
Disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high, shoots back toward Rush. 
Rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck - 
FLYNN Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk now. 
Disk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.       Throbbing with energy. 
RUSH Oh man, this is good. 
Rush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the wand in a nanosecond. 
KROD Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those? 
Another two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands perfectly - rejoining the group. 
Cheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.       Flynn shakes Rush's hand - energy surges between them. 
110   CONTINUED:    (5) 
BOOLE It's for real, Quantz. 
QUANTZ We've got a chance to take down Plexor. 
111   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - MAIN HALL 
Plexor reviews a line of elite X-Takks. All are decked in thick battle gear, gripping an array of menacing ultra-tech weapons. 
PLEXOR Perfect. Any three of you could crash an army of Flynn's best. But I've prepare for his random acts by designing massive redundancy. 
Widen to reveal: 
BATTALION of X-Takks, lined in precise rows, filling the vast hall. Since Adolf Hitler, no one has displayed such an awesome military machine. 
112   INT.   PLEXOR'S INNER SANCTUM 
Mega sneaks in, alone. She pulls her disk off her back and raises it above her head. Data energizes around her. She clenches hard, trying to make the connection. 
A RUBY BEAM converges off her disk, reaching skyward. 
113   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT 
Meg and Dewey work to dismantle the lab. 
Meg walks past, stops. Comes back.      Reads fresh text on a computer screen: DOES MEG EXIST? 
MEG Dewey.   This your idea of a joke? 
114   INT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - MAIN HALL 
PLEXOR Cybavor programming complete? 
X-NET SPECIALIST Yes.

114   CONTINUED: 
PLEXOR Demonstrate. 
X-Net Specialists drops the sides on a cubic cage. 
A frozen dog-like CYBAVOR CREATURE stands like a statue. 
Plexor nods.    X-Net Specialist activates. 
Cybavor comes alive.     Circuits RAGING.    Eyes pulsing. 
Plexor summons an X-Net Worker Drone. 
PLEXOR Install yourself over there. 
Worker Drone does as he's told.       He freezes in place. 
PLEXOR Attack! 
Cybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall. DIVES at the Worker Drone... 
And DEVOURS HIM mercilessly. 
Energy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the energy, GROWS LARGER, then SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE (like DNA), then regrows the missing halves. 
Now the Cybavor is a PAIR of nasty, snarling Cybavors. 
PLEXOR End routine. 
Cybavors sit. 
PLEXOR Elegant. 
Surveying his perfect defenses, he notices one thing missing. 
Patrols of X-Takks pass. 
Rush leaps to a vantage point them. Scouts a route, signals Flynn, Krod, Boole, Quantz and the Code Monkeys. 
Fighter team scales a narrow ledge near the BLAZING FIREWALL. It's like a sheet of molten lead, pouring endlessly before them. A lethal barrier. 
FLYNN This is all yours, Rush. 
Rush pulls his disk, holds it over his head and steps under the molten data flow. He struggles against raw power, disk HEATS UP WHITE, splashing aside the molten data. 
FLYNN Go!    Quick! 
Code Monkeys, Flynn and Krod, Quantz and Boole dive between Rush's legs, emerging on the other side. Barrier overcome. 
Rush leaps out of the firewall, clutching his white-hot disk. 
RUSH No sweat. (to himself) OUCH. 
CODE MONK N1J That way to the portal! 
RUSH Let's do it. 
118   CONTINUED: 
They head for the fortress along a surreptitious route, avoiding X-Takk patrols. 
119   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
Plexor - with Mega and the Cybavors two paces behind - leads an army of X-Takks. 
A Cybavor growls at Mega.          She growls back. 
MEGA There it is.     That's the portal. 
Plexor masses his forces around a closed ENCRYPTION PORTAL. It is a dark semispheric aperture, left unlocked (but closed). 
PLEXOR Converge on all levels! Outside patrols close in behind these coordinates! 
X-Takks come from all directions, all levels. 
120   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
Flynn pauses to see X-Net Patrols in motion, across bridges, through tunnels. All around. 
FLYNN Something's up. 
RUSH Keep moving. 
They come to a dark encryption portal, seen from their exterior view. 
BOOLE Portal 4786324BXY.       This is it. 
Flynn withdraws the HOLOGON. 
FLYNN The sooner Rush gets this into the main power supply, the sooner X-Net shuts down. And the more of us come out of here to tell about it. 
Rush takes the hologon, stows it. 
Pumped looks between Code Monkeys, Boole and Quantz.           Krod trembles. 
120   CONTINUED: 
KROD Oh man, I think I'm leaking. 
RUSH Krod.   You'll do great. 
KROD Think so? 
RUSH Your recognize patterns better than any of us. You'll know Plexor's moves before he does. 
KROD I hope you're right...     Rush? 
RUSH Yeah man? 
KROD Are you really a "User"? Is there such a thing? Is that what makes you so good? 
All Programs hang on Rush's answer.         Flynn too. 
RUSH Flynn and I come from a realm no better or worse than here... One thing I know, neither place works unless you're looking out for the other guy. And we've got a word for what all of you are. 
BOOLE Obsolete? 
RUSH Heroes. 
KROD Cool. 
CODE MONK B3T I'm ready. 
QUANTZ Let's do it. 
Fighters hustle under the shadow of the portal...        Approaching the closed semispheric aperture. 
121   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
X-Takks stand thick, weapons pointed at the closed aperture. 
Plexor marks time.    Cybavors poise to attack. 
Mega, emotions rising, takes a step back. 
122   EXT.   DARK PORTAL 
Flynn falters on his wounded leg.     Fighters steady him. 
Rush hurries away with Mega and Flynn. 
Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys are besieged by a hundred X-Takks. 
KROD Whoa! Retreat! That way!     Keep firing! RUN! AHHH! 
Plexor enters the battle arena with his four CYBAVORS.     He scans keenly, then heads off another direction. 
127   INT.   X-NET GANTRY / MAIN POWER SUPPLY 
Flynn hobbles, helped by Mega.     Rush leads them around a corner, in sight of: 
MAIN POWER SUPPLY.     Massive reactive CORE CONTAINMENT CUBE. 
Rush comes to the edge of a deep, narrow moat. Bottom is      a channel of ROILING, MOLTEN CHROMATIC DATA. No bridges. 
RUSH We have to get across. 
RAAAA!!! 
Six X-Takks are upon them, disks flying, NegaByte eraser beams swinging. 
Flynn Takes a hit in the chest. 
FLYNN ARRGGHH! 
Rush and Mega dodge, fling their disks with lethal accuracy - 
X-Takks crash and fall, tumbling into the moat abyss, flashing as they hit the molten bottom. 
128   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER CORRIDORS 
Krod, Boole and Quantz bait a phalanx of X-Takks, Code Monkeys spring a DEGAUSSING CHARGE, which cuts off a column at the base. Column tumbles, crashing X-Takks, blocking the way. 
High fives among Krod and Fighters. 
One Small X-Takk breaks through, ZAPPING through the air, reforming, ZAPPING CLOSER. 
Fighters turn to blast him. 
But Krod recognizes the pattern: 
KROD Wait!     I know that dude! 
Quantz stuns an X-Takk Soldier - Code Monkeys hack his X-Net Armor. Armor powers down, revealing: 
KROD I-beem! 
I-beem shakes off his brainwashing.

128   CONTINUED: 
I-BEEM Krod my friend! Who are these guys?! 
KROD We're taking out Plexor.    You with us or them? 
X-Takks attack the group, including I-beem. 
I-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an X-Takk. He steals the X-Takk's NEGABYTE BLASTER and mows down three X-Takks, saving trapped Boole. 
I-BEEM With you! 
I-beem joins Fighters as they press deeper, engaging the next X-Takk onslaught. 
129   INT.   X-NET POWER SUPPLY OUTER GANTRY - CONTINUOUS 
Rush and Mega haul Flynn along a narrow ledge. 
FLYNN There.   You can make it across! 
He points to a thin ledge on the other side, far below. 
Rush extends his Light Pole to the ledge, moves to gather Flynn for a vault-crossing. 
FLYNN No, take Mega! I'll stay here and run interference. 
RUSH You haven't got a chance by yourself. 
FLYNN Ah, these guys are wimps. 
It's bravado: They know his odds are dismal. Flynn slumps into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. He pulls a supply of SPIKED MINI-DISKS, ready to defend himself. 
MEGA We're not leaving you. 
FLYNN My body is weak, but my will is strong. I promise, no matter what they do to me, I'll survive this. Trust the bigger plan. 
(CONTINUED) 
129   CONTINUED: 
He's fading fast. 
MEGA But Flynn - 
X-Takks attack along the ledge. 
FLYNN GO!   NOW! 
Rush throws his arm around Mega and VAULTS across the moat, landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a core ENTRY POINT. 
Flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. His mini disks take out X-Takks on the ledge. Their bodies tumble into the moat, flashing as they hit. 
RUSH Your software has the biggest flaw there is, Plexor. You can't see you own mistakes. 
Plexor snatches his Death-disk, corners Rush for the kill. 
Mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked away by downward flowing energy rings. 
Rush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time RUSH holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's defense field, eating into his body circuits. It's fractal zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to- face. 
RUSH Do it Mega! 
Mega scoops HOLOGON off floor, makes for CONTROL CELL - 
Plexor's hand shoots out, GRABS HER, stops her like iron. 
Plexor exerts his power, holds Rush and Mega by the throats with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping with HOT ENERGY RINGS. 
Rush and Mega struggle, an inch from death - 
ZAAAAAA - 
Plexor stops, annoyed.      Turns and sees: 
Krod, Fighters and I-beem have arrived, firing blasters at Plexor's SPINAL NEXUS. It hardly makes a dent, but it creates a fleeting opportunity for Rush - 
Rush ducks forward, SHOOTS his disk off his back, smacking Plexor in the throat. Mega falls clear - 
Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down his body, but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN. He step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into a hand. 
Mega snags the hologon - 
MEGA RUSH! 
She tosses it to Rush, who's already airborne - 
Rush catches hologon, sails to the control unit -

Energy rings go dim, then dark - 
Silicon shatters to ash - 
X-Takks power down. X-Net armor de-rezzes, leaving innocent civilian Programs. They shake off the mind-control and rise unshackled. 
And Plexor, like all things X-Net, chatters and glitches. His code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being erodes from inside. 
MEGA Now who's obsolete? 
Rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final blow, straight at Plexor - CRASH - shattering him to bits. 
Rush finally breathes.       Sees I-beem, Krod, Quantz, Boole, Code Monkeys. 
RUSH Thanks guys. 
KROD I'll never let you forget it. 
Boole tosses Rush his tron-disk. 
133   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT 
Rush, Mega, Krod, I-beem, Fighters and liberated Programs stow disks and step to a high vantage point. 
Before them expands a vista of cyberspace. 
Power-down of X-Net radiates in all directions, leaving everything else intact. Beautiful, exotic old data networks instantly begin to regenerate into the open space. 
MEGA We're free.     At last we're free. 
134   EXT.   X-NET GRAND OPENING CEREMONY - MORNING 
Sinclair commands the podium: 
SINCLAIR In a world exposed to increasing data corruption, I hereby switch on the first global network offering 100% guaranteed data security. Flawless performance, zero downtime. The world works hard, the world deserves... 
He throws a switch. HUGE monitors blaze with X-Net logos and graphic portals. Countdown 3,2,1... 
SINCLAIR X-NET! 
CROWD CHEERS.   MEDIA BUZZES... 
X-Net instantly CRASHES.    All screens jam, glitch and DIE. 
Crowd is stunned.    Sinclair is mortified. 
135   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT 
Krod, I-beem, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys CHEER. 
Mega embraces Rush.    Energy sizzles between them. 
MEGA I underestimated you.   Thanks. 
She presses her lips to his.    It's electric. 
KROD (to I-beem) You knew she always liked him.

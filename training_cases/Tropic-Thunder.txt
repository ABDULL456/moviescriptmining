CHOPPER PILOT Sir! We gotta DIDI NOW! Air strike confirmed! This place is gonna be toast in about thirty seconds! Osiris turns on Motown, pulling his .45 in the midst of the mayhem. He pushes it up into Motown's neck. 
OSIRIS 
FOUR LEAF IS DEAD MEAT, SOLDIER! AND YOU 
GOT ZERO 0' HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS 
ON THIS CHOPPER BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM! Osiris, standing on the skid, motions for the chopper pilot to take off. 
Tropic Thunder 6. Motown looks to Fats,:then reluctantly jumps on the chopper...It begins to hover...

FATS! YOU GET ON THIS BIRD NOW! YOU HEAR 
ME YOU MUTANT MOTHER-- 
BROOKLYN A 1, I qft (a soft whisper) I Id Sarge... .We PUSH IN ON BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his head. Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked finger... 
BROOKLYN It's him. It's Four Leaf... Everyone turns to-see... FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN from the "Scorcher" trailer, . burst through the treeline, half limping, half crawling heroically through the massive firefight in SLOW MOTION. He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS... Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and can't believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the pilot. I 
OSIRIS 
GO! GO! Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might, preventing it from flying away. The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm, providing weak cover for Four Leaf. The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle with the helicopter. Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn't even have a gun... 
Tropic Thunder 7. Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at Fats... a flash of anger and compassion comes over his face.. . FOUR"LEAF, Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of lead... 
OSIRIS 
I HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE 
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE 
INT. BANK - SCENE FROM "CHITLIN AND THE DUDE" 
Speedman'and Martin Lawrence, both with guns, are holding up a bank -- Speedman in drag. They yell at each other in that uptight-white-guy/loose-cannon-black-guy action comedy style. 
JULIE (V:O.) The disappointing "CHITLIN AND THE DUDE", was followed.with last year's failed venture into serious dramatic territory... 
EXT. PONY FARM - SCENE FROM "SIMPLE JACK" - DAY 
:Speedman,..innoveralls and with a bad haircut, dressed as a farm hand. He holds a pony_by the reins as he "talks" to it by rubbing his nose on the pony's neck. 
JULIE (V.0.) ."Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally impaired farm hand who can "talk" to animals was a box office disaster that many critics called one of the worst movies of all time. 
SPEEDMAN (as Simple Jack) You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy. 
Tropic Thunder 17. 
EXT. TROPIC THUNDER SET -- DAY 
JULIE (to camera) But now, the question is can Speedman "mu- mu-make" audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in "Tropic Thunder". And,' possibly a shot â 1. -4416 at that elusive gold statuette? 
EXT. TROPIC THUNDER SET -- DAY 
Julie sits with Speedman. With them is the real FOUR LEAF, a stoic, grizzled man of few words. 
SPEEDMAN (very serious) All I want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud. It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That's why we're here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what he-- what you --went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only two HOOKS. Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to "get inside" him as much as possible. 
FOUR LEAF 
(MYSTICAL) When I lost these... (holds his hooks up) It was as if I saw through these for the first time..'. (indicates his eyes) And it was only then that I really began to use these... (indicates his ears) 
SPEEDMAN That's great. He's like a... Buddha or something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it funny. 
,Tropic Thunder 18. 
JULIE (to Speedman) Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time? Maybe you should rub Kirk Lazarus's belly! He already has three! Speedman laughs uncomfortably, trying to seem unperturbed. i "I' 0, nM y

CUT TO: 
A SERIES OF SHOTS OF KIRK LAZARUS In his normal.look, CAUCASIAN and IRISH, much like he was in the "Satan's Alley" trailer... 
- JULIE (V.0.) Three time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, reclusive, brilliant Irishman, considered by many.'the best actor of his generation, and also a known bad boy... Stills of a DRUNKEN LAZARUS outside a New York Bar, punching a paparazzo... 
JULIE . is famous for his total immersion into whatever role he plays. To.transform into the role of the African American Sergeant who saved_Four Leaf's life... 
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE 
Lazarus is examined by a doctor. 
AJULIE (V.0.) Lazarus-went - to shocking, and controversial lengths... 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - A FEW WEEKS LATER 
Lazarus lies in a hospital bed,, covered in bandages. 
JULIE After undergoing experimental pigmentation alteration procedures in a Singapore clinic, this was the startling result. 
Tropic Thunder 19. A doctor dversees as nurses carefully peel the bandages off Lazarus's head. Lazarus is now Black. 
INT.''TROPIC THUNDER PRE-SHOOT PRESS CONFERENCE 
VOICE OF TODD We're shutting you down, Dorf. 
INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY 
Damien sits behind his desk, looking scared. Vietnam photos, maps, and sketches cover the walls. Standing in the office are ASSORTED CREW, including Cody and Four Leaf, who whittles a stick with his hooks, never looking up. 
Tropic Thunder 22. They are all staring at a speaker phone. 
DAMIEN You can't do that Todd. 
VOICE OF TODD I Yes we can.. The dailies are not good. 
DAMIEN Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good movie! Isn't that what they say? 
VOICE OF TODD I never heard that saying. Look, Damien. Fact: You're. three weeks behind and you've been shooting for five days. Fact: we greenlit this project at a very specific number, a number Walter and I could get in bed. with, and fact--. 
DAMIEN ,. _. (starting to lose it) Todd, it really isn't necessary for you to,keep saying "fact" before everything. It's kind of implied, that if you are saying.it-- 
VOICE OF TODD Alright.. I'm just.trying to keep the emotion out of it, so I thought I would say."fact" before each fact, so it would be less-upsetting -- I 
VOICE OF WALTER Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I'm just gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds like the inmates are running the asylum. 
DAMIEN Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that .these actors are-- 
VOICE OF TODD (loud out of'nowhere) The actors didn't blow up the rainforest and forget to turn on the camera Damien! I have a lot of tolerance, but when. Lt comes to nature I lose it! 
(MORE) 
Tropic Thunder 23. 
R 
IN âº VOICE OF TODD (cont'd) I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone. 
HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT Sorry. (whispering to Damien) It's Chris Michael, he says it's important. Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony and slides the glass door shut. 
EXT. RUNDOWN BALCONY -- DAY 
Though the hotel is a shambles, the view out on to the bay is spectacular. 
DAMIEN (trying to seem calm) Yes, Chris!? 
EXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE 
In stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is living, Speedman is in what looks like an Asian presidential palace overlooking the ocean. SPEEDMAN is standing on the deck, trying hard to hold the, phone with his hook hands. "Simple Jack" plays on a flat screen inside. 
SPEEDMAN Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days. Happens. 
DAMIEN (sickly sweet) Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi-- 
Tropic Thunder 24. 
SPEEDMAN Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I 
DAMIEN' Right. well those things... those. 4, 
things ...I'm dealing with bigger issues right now Chris -- 
SPEEDMAN Yeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D. 
SPEEDMAN Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D? He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks. 
CUT TO: 
Tropic Thunder 28. 
EXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE -- NIGHT 
It is an APOCALYPSE NOW theme party. Vegas style. Tiki torches,, buffets. PLAYBOY PLAYMATE DANCERS circa 1967 are dancing on a deck in front of a banner that reads "ONE WEEK DOWN!". The crew and cast are partying their asses off. i n ï¿½ï¿½ i nMï¿½'al WAITERS, dressed like bald Marlon Brandos in full face camo, serve hors d'oeuvres. PORTNOY, not looking very sober, jumps up on the stage with the dancers and starts doing a striptease. 
ENTRANCE TO THE DECK Damien walks in, watching this scene from Caligula going down. He looks in a deep funk. Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with a thud in front of Damien. 
DAMIEN, Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right now. 
PORTNOY (sick and drunk) Dorfie-- did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a- package of mine. Kevin Sandusky ("Brooklyn" from the movie) comes up to them, looking fresh faced and eager. 
SANDUSKY. Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was some hit you took today. 
PORTNOY 
(BEAT) Who are you? 
SANDUSKY I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn? 
Tropic Thunder 29. 
PORTNOY Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that grip with the bandana? 
SANDUSKY Uh, no. I think-- But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection. They both watch him go. 
SANDUSKY Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it. 
DAMIEN 
(TOUCHED) You actually care, don't you? 
SANDUSKY Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you. 
DAMIEN You're the only one who auditioned. You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky. 
SANDUSKY Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond? 
DAMIEN 
(BITTERLY) Yes, that was the point. Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it. We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of food. Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS who is deeply uninterested. 
I 
I r Tropic Thunder 30. 
SPEEDMAN I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them... watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did. 
LAZARUS Huh, I always found mere observation a little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it. 
SPEEDMAN (trying. to keep up) Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life.. (searches for the word) Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be... .NOT retarded. 
LAZARUS Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost: 
SPEEDMAN About what? 
LAZARUS (with 'a chuckle) Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded! 
SPEEDMAN How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session. 
Tropic Thunder 34. SPEEDMAN (,cont'd) That's a quote from my children's book, "The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of." I know it's just a book for. kids, but I think it applies to.making a movie as well. 'Course... I know a lot of the reason things are maybe messed up is ME. The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad. 
SPEEDMAN I was looking-at it all backwards. You guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you, to help you gel, and straighten.up -- like a PLATOON! A long beat. 
PORTNOY (drunk out of his mind) Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep'talk made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy! The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really loud, and the, place gets even crazier. 
EXT. BEACH - LATER 
Damien, drunk, walks along, illuminated by the light of the moon. He holds' a bottle of wine, which.he chugs..In the distance, the party rages. 
FOUR LEAF-CO .. S . ) When a herd loses its way, the shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray.. Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing eerily in the bushes by the sand. 
FOUR LEAF You don't know which way is up, do you private`? You couldn't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick. and showin' you the way... Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant. Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes. Damien's eyes widen in fear. 
,I 
I âTropic Thunder 35. 
FOUR LEAF A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley, and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo. 
DAMIEN (seeing the wisdom of this) Yes... 
FOUR LEAF If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown... but...if... 
(PAUSE) He...lives in the...water, for many years, he will.. .grow gills ... . do you understand? (long pause) 
DO YOU!? He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both hooks. ' 
DAMIEN (near tears now) I want to!!! But not really!! 
(BEAT) Someone's an ANT? Or something??? 
FOUR LEAF I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me!! (long pause) My boys were worse pussies than these guys. But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in the 
SHIT. He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his cigarette... 
FOUR LEAF There's a place. About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his weirdness. 
Tropic Thunder 36. 
DAMIEN And...? 
FOUR LEAF Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis. 
FOUR LEAF You must put them.under your thumb the way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR control. 
DAMIEN I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my total control... finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty. Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers... 
FOUR LEAF Yes... yes... 
DAMIEN Put them in the real shit. Film them with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR! 
.REAL EMOTION! YES! YES, FOUR LEAF, FUCK 
YES!! Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP as WE PUSH IN and... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
A CHOPPER skimming the treetops, illuminated by a lonely moon... 
BACK ON THE ACTORS Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now. 
SPEEDMAN Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped something. He mimes picking something , off, the ground. 
SPEEDMAN It's called your character. Don't worry, I won't tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have seized the moment. The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him. 
SPEEDMAN You happy now? We're out of position for the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush! A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere. 
SANDUSKY I think they're really shooting at us! 
SPEEDMAN What are you guys worried about? These guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared. 
SPEEDMAN Come on, you guys! Let's use this! 
Tropic Thunder 47. No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone. Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment of absurd action style maneuvers throughout. Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES. 
ON THE GUERRILLAS Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their screams, they drop back... 
GUERILLA LEADER 
The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up RPGs... 
EXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING 
Four Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear the firefight, but, Cody can't. 
FOUR LEAF Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives. 
CODY What? I still can't get Damien on the radio. I bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again. What do you say we get a little... pro-active? Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger. 
BACK ON THE ACTORS Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to blow them to kingdom come with RPGs. But before the guerillas have a chance-- 
I t' Tropic Thunder 48. 
ON CODY He pushes down the plunger... 
ON THE GUERILLAS 
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!! Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat. 
EXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING 
Cody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle. 
CODY Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!. Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine guns pointed straight at them. 
CODY Oh shit. 
FOUR LEAF Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of consciousness... 
EXT. JUNGLE -- THE ACTORS 
Speedman motions for everyone to "cease fire". 
SPEEDMAN 
(PUMPED) Aaaaand... CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That's the trailer 'right there! 
REDYKULOUS That was some sick shit! I wasn't even thinking bout the camera! The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the jungle, sensing that someone was out there. 
Tropic Thunder 49. 
SANDUSKY You saying you don'tithink they're filming us? 
I 
LAZARUS Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you? 
SANDUSKY Well, yeah, I.guess. But 
LAZARUS Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group. Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see Speedman, right next to him. 
SPEEDMAN I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create a red pee.stream. 
SPEEDMAN Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and. he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal. (patting his shoulder) And you're pretty handy with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle. 
SANDUSKY Kevin. 
Tropic Thunder 53. 
SPEEDMAN- If you stick with the program, I'm gonna talk to some of the Dreamworks brass... there'll probably be a Teen Choice award in it for you. You have that potential. 
SANDUSKY Well, I -- 
SPEEDMAN Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look. 
EXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER 
The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth. 
SPEEDMAN If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating from Portnoy. 
SPEEDMAN Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead of us... 
PORTNOY 
(SICK) No... its just that I don't feel so hot... I left my medication at the hotel. 
REDYKULOUS (to himself, snickering) Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those "meds" for my own self. Lazarus moves up to Speedman. 
LAZARUS Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now? 
SPEEDMAN Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be! 
Tropic Thunder 54. WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of frame... We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW 
MOVING RIVER. 
LAZARUS .(laughing) Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that map? S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map. 
SPEEDMAN Yes! There is! Its just a little more' down to the... lefty-down part from the: village. (checking the scene list) Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act. 
LAZARUS I don't see a "Sampan" boat! 
SPEEDMAN Any second now one should come by. Alright men, into the water! Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water. They all hold their rifles above their heads. 
LAZARUS I - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We need to quit faffin' about and turn. around NOW! And... Lazarus grabs Sandusky. 
LAZARUS Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you, Sandusky? Kevin is caught, not sure what to d 
SPEEDMAN Wait! First of all... Now Speedman grabs him. 
SPEEDMAN Kelvin believes in this movie. And, second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer. 
(PAUSE) Ohhhhh-Maaaaaaannn...I'm cold. It's 
FREEEZING.. 
REDYKULOUS 
WOULD YOU PAH-LEEZE.SHUT THE FUCK UP!- 
PORTNOY (after a beat) Ohhh GOD! Is'anybody BOILING!? It's like a sweat lodge out here! 
LAZARUS Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art. (to Portnoy) A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy looks a little hurt. 
REDYKULOUS You know what? I think I actually liked you better when you were a nigga. 
LAZARUS You know, Redykulous', I respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking -- invented by the Irish I might add. 
(MORE) 
Tropic Thunder 59. LAZARUS (cont'd) Yet you ooze this hostility towards me. Why do you think that-is? 
REDYKULOUS "Why"?! I dunno...maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy. 
LAZARUS Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're mad because I can act "black" better than you can. 
SANDUSKY Take it easy guys... 
REDYKULOUS (to Sandusky) You better rein in 'black like me' over here, before I put a foot in his white ass... 
LAZARUS Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart. 
SANDUSKY Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's not enough we have people shooting at us! Now we have to kill each other?! Let's pull it together! This place is full of land mines! Or doesn't anyone's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel? That shut them up. 
LAZARUS Sandusky is right... we could all learn a little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look. 
Tropic Thunder 60. 
LAZARUS Your bravery shames us. Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the branch. The guys follow at a VERY safe distance. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT AM l u I, I nhy CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water hits him in the.forehead. Then another. PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.' The drip-is now becoming full on RAIN. He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick. Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule. He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of. fur... Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness, and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is heard... 
QUICK SHOTS OF: FANGS, BLOOD, AN EYEBALL, A HUGE PAW... Speedman is slashed, SOMETHING has got him in a choke hold... He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally pummeling his attacker. He is. covered in blood, but looks ecstatic. 
SPEEDMAN Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal VICTORY SCREAM. Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA... Speedman looks horrified...

I" 1 FLASH on a SERIES OF STILLS from SPEEDMAN'S PANDA PHOTO 
SHOOT... He stumbles back against a tree. Suddenly we hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and - frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when. 
CLOSE ON PHONE -- CALLER ID SAYS "RICK PECK" Speedman answers... 
INT. AGENCY OFFICE -- L.A. --DAY 
Rick is on a Pilates machine in is office with a HOT PILATES INSTRUCTOR working him out. 
RICK I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom. But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper. 
WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM

SPEEDMAN You bastard. 
BYONG What? just thought you might like. some... 
SPEEDMAN Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh. yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM! He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into the back wall. Beat. 
SPEEDMAN (under his breath) You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BAMBOO CAGE --.DAY 
A pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge of-a marsh. He looks around, impressed with the production design. He looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He turns it on. 
SPEEDMAN May God protect you from the mighty arm of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My men will seek you out and mete. out a cruel justice!- Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RICE PADDY -- DAY 
Looking up we see a circle of faces. Our guys, looking down on something awful.. . .that thing is: 
Tropic Thunder 65. PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt 
SANDUSKY I think he's dead. A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy. 
REDYKULOUS No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled 
44M like that all night. 
LAZARUS What's wrong with him? 
PORTNOY 
(LYING) Nothing! Probably just the beginning stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever. More bad noises. 
PORTNOY If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½? I think it might subside in a little bit... No one touches him. 
LAZARUS Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious? 
SANDUSKY What? 
LAZARUS You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off. 
SANDUSKY God help me? 
REDYKULOUS God help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world. Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up Portnoy on a make shift stretcher. 
Tropic Thunder 66. 
EXT. HILLTOP 
Our guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift stretcher. They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous spots something. ''I , I n n4ï¿½N11 
REDYKULOUS 
AWW JEEESUS MAN! 
SANDUSKY How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust... 
Tropic Thunder 69. 
SANDUSKY' Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell, but I have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if I can dig it out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his hand... Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera. 
I 
PORTNOY Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it out! That's not the bullet hole. The bullet hole is over here! It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust. 
SANDUSKY OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're gonna be fine. 
EXT. BAMBOO CAGE -- DAY 
Speedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage. He is covered in a few leeches. Byong appears with his usual cadre of guards. He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him out of the cage. 
EXT. FLAMING DRAGON HQ - COURTYARD 
Byong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard. A HUSH falls over the soldiers. They begin to part, as someone very important is arriving. Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY, no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer. He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN. He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off, revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a rat. He holds a stick. 
SPEEDMAN 
(WARILY) Uhhh..I don't think I got the new pages... 
Tropic Thunder 70. 
TRAN 
YOU ARE A TRESPASSER IN MY POPPY FIELDS! 
YOU ARE D.E.A. SCUM! WE HAVE SHOT DOWN 
YOUR HELICOPTER, AND SOON WE WILL KILL 
YOUR COMPATRIOTS!. Tran points across the courtyard where... A"4 Iv I. InM y CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks scared out. of his mind. Speedman takes this in. Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN... 
TRAN 
DO YOU WANT THEM TO DIE? DO YOU WANT THEM 
TO DIE!! 
SPEEDMAN No! Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt them... I Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He signals.for the guards to stop beating the others. A long beat. 
TRAN Say that. again., 
SPEEDMAN Please don't hurt them?I 
TRAN No...like you did before! Silence. 
TRAN 
SAY IT! He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils. 
SPEEDMAN Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them? A hush falls over the crowd. Tran'seyes widen.

TRAN Do the movie. 
SPEEDMAN The whole movie? 
TRAN Yes. Begin. 
SPEEDMAN Hey, I know you're big fans and that's 
GREAT-- Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt. Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers. 
SPEEDMAN 
OW!! Tran stands over him, screaming into his face: 
TRAN 
YOU WILL PERFORM, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?? 
YOU WILL PERFORM OR DIE11! MONKEY- 
SWINE!1 Speedman gets up, begins a scared, unenthusiastic 
PERFORMANCE:

Sand}asky slowly lifts his head out, surveying the territory. It looks clear. He drops back down. 
INT. HOLE -- DUSK 
The actors look miserable. Portnoy-looks.like his face is going to fall off 
SANDUSKY It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I say we stay in here till it's dark. 
REDYKULOUS I can't believe this is how it ends for Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum recording artist., Shit. 
PORTNOY (shivering and wheezing) I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not gonna make.it... 
SANDUSKY Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're out'here. They'll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And no one else knows but us. 
LAZARUS That's right. So here's the plan. Everyone leans forward expectantly. 
LAZARUS We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's situation. 
REDYKULOUS Sounds good. 
SANDUSKY Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just gonna leave him here?

Up on the.hill., our guys. are back up top, watching Speedman through binoculars. 
BINOCULAR POV.-- FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD Speedman is acting like Simple Jack, with his new bad haircut.,He is performing for a small group, of chuckling. GUARpS. 
EXT. HILLTOP -- NIGHT 
LAZARUS Jaysus! We're too late. They brained him! REDYKULOUS grabs the binoculars. Sees for himself. 
REDYKULOUS He's right, man, that ain't right. Messin' with a man's brain. 
SANDUSKY We gotta get him outta there... 
EXT. HILLTOP -- NIGHT -- LATER 
The guys have set up a camp, with.a small fire. Everyone watches as Sandusky diagrams a plan in the dirt. 
SANDUSKY' Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's where Speedman was. It looks like they move him at night, cause he's not here now. Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is. 
(MORE) 
Tropic Thunder 79. SANDUSKY (cont'd) But Speedman does. If we can get in there, and find him, maybe he can help us sneak him out. 
PORTNOY (sweating and in pain) I got an idea. Everyone turns to Portnoy. 
11 N 0 6 III4" 
PORTNOY It might be a little crazy, but... 
REDYKULOUS Crazy is better than nothin'. 
SANDUSKY What is it? 
PORTNOY (intermittent pain noises) Back in '98, I did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls' camp. So we did it by building a catapult. They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down. The guys all look at each other... then finally: 
LAZARUS That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. 
SANDUSKY Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval. 
SANDUSKY Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and Redyk are on first watch. (to Lazarus) I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll switch. They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out. 
I Tropic Thunder 80. 
PORTNOY I'm not gonna make it. 
SANDUSKY Yes you are. 
PORTNOY Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious. Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I scream, or however much-I plead, you.must not untie me. I will be cunning, I will be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil works this way. I will say, do, and excrete many regrettable things. But.no matter what.. .you must leave me alone. Beat.. 
SANDUSKY Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him up. We'll get you through it.

REDYKULOUS She's a rapper I'm producing, a twelve year old girl. Her first single drops tomorrow and I'm not even gonna be there to see it. 
PORTNOY (O.S.) Ohhhhh GOD! THERE'S BARBED WIRE IN MY 
URINE! 
REDYKULOUS I pulled her off the streets six months ago. 
SANDUSKY You did that? 
REDYKULOUS Well, not literally, she was trapped in a dead end record deal with Rick Rubin. Didn't even have a lawyer. Huh. And here I am on the other side of the world. About to die for a guy I barely even know. Makes Redykulous wonder what's it all about. 
SANDUSKY Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to think about. 
PORTNOY (O.S.) 
(TTTTTHHHHWWAAAAAPPP... GURGLE) 
REDYKULOUS You single?

SANDUSKY: It'.s kind of depressing. That feeling of not having anyone who really loves you.. Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him.. 
REDYKULOUS Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely lovable. Weird silence. 
SANDUSKY What? 
REDYKULOUS (removing his arm) I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean. I have love problems myself!

REDYKULOUS Aww shit... (sniff sniff) I can't. believe it's possibly the last day of my life, and I'm not even gonna be able to let my fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I really am.

INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- NIGHT 
Cody, still awkwardly holding the hooks, is yelling at Four Leaf. 
CODY So all of "Tropic Thunder" is bullshit? 
FOUR LEAF No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it happened! 
CODY Are you even a VET!? 
FOUR LEAF YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not exactly. I served honorably in what they called the "forced service". Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon. 
CODY So you were some two bit criminal who got caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN! 
FOUR LEAF God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a fuckup, sure, but one day as I was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big- wig, I came across a file headed for the shredder marked top secret. It was Four Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family. Nothing. Killed in Action. They were gonna bury the whole thing. Total black op. 
CODY So you decided to take his identity? 
FOUR LEAF NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story And I gave the American people a hero! Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was! See what I'm sayin'? 
Tropic Thunder 88. 
CODY And you cashed in! 
FOUR LEAF I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy had a story worth-telling, and nobody woulda ever known! Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost. 
FOUR LEAF I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this .whole mess. 
EXT. JUNGLE -- PRE-DAWN 
PORTNOY wakes up, still tied to. the tree, looking like shit. But realizes something-that makes him ecstatic:

E-X-T . DE-T-EN-T-ION-HU-T----DAWN- They emerge into the chaos. IT IS DAYLIGHT NOW. A GUARD runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook to trip him up. Cody knocks him out and grabs his machine gun. He tosses the guard's pistol to Four Leaf. 
CODY By the way, what's your name anyway?

LAZARUS JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re- programming a VCR!! (back to Speedman) You really committed yourself. And for that you DESERVED AN OSCAR! Speedman registers this. 
LAZARUS 
(FRUSTRATED) 
C'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO 
YOU ARE! Lazarus's own words make him stop and think. 
LAZARUS (almost to himself) You know who you are... . you do Chris. Long beat. 
LAZARUS Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down. 
Tropic Thunder 98. 
REDYKULOUS Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'. so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk Lazarus! You're like the greatest actor in the motherfuckin' world!

I'm not even .Kirk Lazarus. (a beat) I have no idea who I am. The guys look at him... it's the first time he has let his guard down. 
SANDUSKY Kirk, this is NOT the time!

REDYKULOUS That's right! We're.not what we're called, or who we pretend to be. We are what we are in our hearts. And to me, looking into your heart, you're a hero.. Lazarus looks to Redykulous. 
LAZARUS You mean that? 
FOUR LEAF You go... I got real bullets! I'll cover you.. It's the only way you'll make it! 
CODY Marvin, you gotta -- 
FOUR LEAF Just go!! Sandusky looks at Speedman... they both know he's right. They go... leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing... The jeep speeds up to the helipad... the guys jump out. Just as the last guy is out... 
BOOM! A HUGE BLAST FLIPS THE JEEP INTO THE AIR... Across the courtyard is TRAN... who just fired an RPG at our guys! The guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the chopper... Sandusky pushes Cody in...

CHOPPER!! 
PORTNOY

SPEEDMAN It's him... 
SPEEDMAN'S POV FOUR LEAF... much-like.Speedman playing him in the beginning of the. movie... Arms extended, his body riddled with bullets...

FOOCK! Cody lowers the chopper ... Speedman jumps out... 
SPEEDMAN Cover me! Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of bullets...PORTNOY AND THE GUYS PROVIDE AS MUCH COVER AS 
THEY CAN...

FADE IN: 
EXT. A BODY OF WATER - LATE AFTERNOON A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way through a gray sky before being obliterated. A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge of a boat and into the ocean. D UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward. 
He breaks the surface and gasps for air. 
He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried beneath the dark ocean water. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
A floating tenement. A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its grip. 
EXT. BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                   3 The crane swings around with the MAN in the net. 
He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish. 
AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a labored lobster-walk. 
He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white and flaccid. 
A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of scotch and begins drinking. 
ISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                      4 
The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle. 
He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN. 
Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven, with his hair neatly trimmed. 
Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing, overwhelmed with mutual desire. 
He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him. 
He kisses her passionately on the mouth. 
MAN Oh, my dear... 
His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his hands to the laces and together they undo it. 
WOMAN (whispering softly) It's all right, darling. It's all right. 
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING OSCAR, a manservant, is carrying both a silver tray and a pair of pants over his extended arm. 
A VOICE (O.S.) Oscar! Where the devil are you? 
Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom. 
OSCAR My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt. 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39. 
He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man who can have anything he wants. 
Right now... he wants his pants. 
FRANKLIN I've been standing here for five minutes. 
Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs. 
OSCAR Did you sleep well, sir? 
FRANKLIN Don't remember. That's good, isn't it? 
OSCAR Yes, sir. 
Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them, pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders. 
FRANKLIN I better read it. Steel workers tend to vote democratic. Next. 
LOUIS Lunch with Secretary Daniels. 
FRANKLIN Must I? 
LOUIS He's your boss. 
FRANKLIN Anything else? 
LOUIS (a beat) What if she'd said yes? 
FRANKLIN Who? 
Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who." 
LOUIS People know. It's time to stop. 
FRANKLIN I can handle my own affairs, Louis. 
LOUIS Not this one. This is Washington, D.C., not the Harvard Club. (off-put by Franklin's arrogance) How can you be so cavalier? 
FRANKLIN You say that like it's a bad thing. 
Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows him inside a building. 
INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT A large grandfather clock reads 3:00. 
The sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin quietly enters. His hair is a mess and his clothing is slightly askew. 
As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness. They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs. 
INT. UPPER LANDING - CONTINUING 
Franklin goes into his bedroom. Eleanor quietly comes up the stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her. 
INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly so as not to wake him. 
Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an open duffle bag. 
Tentatively she reaches for them. She brings the packet, tied with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by their familiar scent. 
With trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down her cheeks as she reads. 
Franklin opens his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HYDE PARK - DAY Springwood is the three-story Roosevelt mansion. It is surrounded by a thousand acres of forests, fields, bridal paths and a glorious view of the Hudson River. 
THE FIVE ROOSEVELT CHILDREN are screaming on the front lawn playing a boisterous game of croquet. 
INT. SPRINGWOOD - DINING ROOM - DAY SARA ROOSEVELT, 65, sits at the head of the table. She is one for whom the expression "Grande Dame" was coined. 
Franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale. Louis, as always, is by his side. 
Eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits across from them, calm and composed. 
ELEANOR I have offered Franklin his freedom. 
FRANKLIN And I have accepted. 
SARA (to Eleanor) His freedom is not yours to offer! 
FRANKLIN I am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama. 
LOUIS Lord save us from fools in love. 
SARA Falling in love is out of the question. Why do you think men have mistresses? Duty. Duty to their families and their careers. 
Eleanor rises from the table. 
SARA Where do you think you're going? 
ELEANOR It's obvious that my input in this matter is of little importance. 
She begins to exit the room, but Franklin is up like a shot. 
ALICE Darling, you're a Roosevelt. What do you know about people? 
She leans in conspiratorially. 
ALICE Of course, I can think of one person you did manage to find the time to invest in. A Miss Mercer, I believe? 
FRANKLIN Alice, stop. 
ALICE Don't misunderstand me, Franklin. Being married to Eleanor I think you deserved some fun. But you made the right decision. Especially since Miss Mercer has gone on with her life. 
FRANKLIN What are you talking about? 
ALICE Edward Rutherford is a wonderful catch for a girl like her. 
FRANKLIN (stunned) She's married? 
ALICE Last week. A small event, of course. 
FRANKLIN When I last heard she was governess to his children. 
ALICE (with a smile) And then love bloomed. As a "man of the people," I wouldn't be too hard on her, Franklin. We can't all have trust funds you know. 
EXT. STATEN ISLAND BOY SCOUT CAMP - DAY Franklin, Louis and a PHOTOGRAPHER disembark from a touring car. 
LOUIS We're not taking this defeat lying down, boss. We'll run you for Governor -- 
FRANKLIN (kidding) Really? Of which state? 
Louis shoots him a look. 
LOUIS Very funny. No, this buys you time. It buys you experience. 
FRANKLIN What about Al Smith? 
LOUIS He's vulnerable. You're still a fresh face, boss. We'll use that to our advantage. 
They walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the PHOTOGRAPHER follows them. 
FRANKLIN Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my political base. 
LOUIS They've got parents. Besides they're photogenic. 
Franklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly underprivileged children. 
FRANKLIN Franklin Roosevelt, happy to meet you. 
Franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an artificial good cheer. Meanwhile, Louis, in full political mode, makes sure the L Photographer gets everything. 
OUIS Over here! 
Franklin poses with two Scouts. The picture is taken. 
SCOUTMASTER Okay, boys, lunch. Line up to wash! (to Franklin) Will you be joining us? 
FRANKLIN Of course! 
Franklin steps into a line before a large communal water barrel and glances sideways at GUISEPPE, 9, an immigrant child of the city streets. He wears his uniform proudly and smiles at Franklin. 
FRANKLIN What's your name, son? 
GUISEPPE Guiseppe. 
Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment between them. He waits patiently as the cameras click away. 
FRANKLIN Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo? 
GUISEPPE (puzzled) Okay, I guess. 
The SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly. 
As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin, not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras. 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - CAMPOBELLO ISLAND 
EXT. ROOSEVELT SUMMER HOME - DAY A large but unpretentious house with a sweeping lawn that looks out over the icy waters of the Bay of Fundy. 
EXT. PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON 
ELEANOR I thought it only struck children. 
OCTOR Not necessarily. 
LOUIS How did he get it? 
DOCTOR Some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water. But that theory is speculative at best. 
LOUIS It was the visit to that god damned Boy Scout Camp! 
DOCTOR In all honesty you need to be looking forward, not back. 
ELEANOR What is the prognosis? 
DR. LOVETT The damage to his leg muscles is extensive. I suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down. 
ELEANOR Dear God. beat) And the children? 
DR. LOVETT If they don't have any symptoms by now then they have been spared. 
Sara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud. 
SARA Then we must count our blessings. 
R. LOVETT You will need to prepare yourselves. There is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude. I'm afraid life as he knew it is over. 
Their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a child crying. Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes. 
L 
EXT. BUSHES - CONTINUING Eleanor finds Elliot, having heard everything, curled up in a ball, weeping. She leans down and wraps her arms around him. 
INT. BEDROOM - WEEKS LATER CLOSE-UP - WALLPAPER 
A pink background covered in small white flowers with red centers and green leaves. There is a seam in the paper. A tiny white spot where glue has soaked through. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Franklin in bed. 
This is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour. 
His lips are dry. 
A glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand. He reaches for it but it's a few inches out of his reach. 
Slowly, he begins to rock his torso back and forth. 
INT. HYDE PARK - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS Sara, Eleanor and Louis are in heated conversation. 
SARA Now that politics are out of the question he can stay here at home with me. 
ELEANOR But what kind of life is that? 
OUIS I've rented him an office downtown. He can still practice law. S ARA Why would you want to do that? 
LOUIS Because he needs it. 
ELEANOR He can pursue a career, Mama. 
SARA A man as proud and vital as Franklin... you're inviting him to be hurt. (MORE) 
And you, Mr. RA(cont'd) SA Howe, engaged in the fantasy of a political future for my son... is there nothing you won't do to keep your job? 
Sara leaves as Eleanor goes after her. 
ELEANOR Mama! That's not fair! 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Franklin, still rocking his torso, has now gained some momentum, managing to have moved just a few inches. 
INT. SUN ROOM - CONTINUOUS Sara busies herself arranging flowers. 
SARA What kind of life is it to be pitied and stared at? 
ELEANOR What kind of life is it to be hidden away? I know you believe that what you are suggesting for Franklin is best. But I think you are making it harder for him. 
SARA I think I know what's best for Franklin. I am his mother! 
ELEANOR And I am his wife. 
FRANKLIN Nothing. I fancy nothing. 
LOUIS He'll have the same. 
The Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away. Louis opens his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail. Franklin glances it, but doesn't open any. 
LOUIS There are a few from your children. 
FRANKLIN I can still read. 
Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that interests him, opening it. 
LOUIS Your wife wants you to come home. (choosing his words) She's concerned. I'm concerned. This life on a boat... where is it getting you? 
F 
FRANKLIN Getting me? For one thing, no one gets to see me and I don't get to see them. 
LOUIS Don't say that. Everyone's waiting for you to come home. The kids... they're aching to see you. 
RANKLIN (reading) Really? 
Louis looks sadly at his friend. 
LOUIS What's that? 
FRANKLIN skimming the letter) From George Foster Peabody. He owns a resort in rural Georgia for investment purposes. Hot springs or something. He claims that only recently a crippled boy swam in the waters and can walk again. 
LOUIS Oh, for Chrissake... 
FRANKLIN (reading) The high magnesium content of these natural springs will hold anyone up. Although it is not a resort for infirm types I am extending you my personal invitation to come visit in the off- season." (putting the letter aside) I'm only welcome in the "off- season." 
Eugene and Stanley approach the table. 
EUGENE Mr. Roosevelt, we got bad news. 
FRANKLIN What? 
F 
F 
STANLEY It's the boat... it got banged up real bad tied to the dock. 
RANKLIN How bad? 
STANLEY I don't think you can stay there anymore. 
ranklin absorbs this. 
EUGENE Maybe it's a blessing in disguise, Mr. Roosevelt. I don't know about you, but I'm homesick. 
FRANKLIN And I'm sick of home. (to Louis) Where's the letter from Peabody? 
LOUIS You can't be serious? 
He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it. 
FRANKLIN Why not miracle waters? I've drunk the oil of monkey glands, been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses. After all that, this sounds downright peaceful. 
LOUIS I can't quite picture you in the back woods of Georgia. 
FRANKLIN Where do you picture me, Louis? 
LOUIS 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
FRANKLIN President, Louis? I can't visit the bathroom without a team of associates to help pull my pants down. 
E 
F 
LOUIS Give it a little time. 
RANKLIN There's a reason they say a man runs for office. (a beat) I'm going to Georgia. 
CUT TO: 
Franklin won't let himself believe it. 
FRANKLIN I can't imagine what you think that life is going to be. 
This takes the wind out of Eleanor. 
ELEANOR Oh Franklin... it's not up to me to imagine, it's up to you. 
Eleanor folds her napkin and gets up from the table. 
EXT. COTTAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY Pete helps Eleanor into his livery wagon. 
Franklin watches from the porch as Eleanor rides away. Her suitcase slides across the open wagon bed, as the wagon makes the tight turn from the driveway onto the main road. 
ON ELEANOR 
Looking out -- straight ahead. 
ON FRANKLIN 
Alone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight. 
INT. HYDE PARK - DAY 
Eleanor is pouring tea for Louis, who is seated. 
ELEANOR Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Howe. 
LOUIS I thought you might want to see a friendly face. (off the silence) So how's our boy doing? 
ELEANOR Well, he's enjoying the waters very much. He... (suddenly overwhelmed) I think we've lost him. 
Her pent-up tears burst in a free-flow. Louis leads her to a nearby settee and hands her his handkerchief. E LEANOR Please excuse me, Mr. Howe. 
LOUIS Don't you think it's time you called me Louis? 
ELEANOR Louis. 
E 
LOUIS Maybe we've been going about this all wrong. He's down there to be alone so let's give him what he wants. We change our focus. 
LEANOR To what? 
Louis smiles, knowingly. 
LOUIS To you. 
EXT. COTTAGES - SUNSET The row of abandoned cottages look strangely pretty, aglow in the setting sun. 
EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Franklin is seated on the ramshackle porch in his chair. His cigarette hangs from his lip as he mixes martinis in a glass milk bottle. He pours one for Tom, then himself. 
FRANKLIN To your mineral pool, or whatever you call it. 
TOM Warm Springs. 
They clink their glasses. Tom takes a polite sip, then chokes back the bad taste. 
FRANKLIN Too strong? 
TOM Haven't been in a drinking mood lately. 
FRANKLIN I have. 
TOM Actually, its the most god-awful martini I've ever tasted. 
FRANKLIN Are you always this direct, Tom? 
TOM Well, I never tasted a martini this bad before. 
Franklin takes another sip, checking. It tastes fine to him. 
FRANKLIN (hurt) Everyone likes my martinis... 
TOM So they say. 
He hands the letter to Franklin who immediately begins reading. 
LIONEL (to Tom) Says she's gonna keep the Roosevelt name alive. Least till he starts walkin' and all. 
Lionel takes the letter Franklin just handed him, opens it, flicks his flashlight back on and continues on his way. 
FRANKLIN (studying the letter) This is so unlike Eleanor. She's terrified of crowds. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Louis and Eleanor approach a set of double doors. 
ELEANOR We are facing imminent disaster. 
LOUIS I take full responsibility if you hyperventilate or faint. 
They enter the room. 
INT. MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS At a lectern, behind which a banner reads "LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS," the CHAIRWOMAN sees them and waves them forward. 
CHAIRWOMAN Ah, here she is now. Ladies, Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt. 
A small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite, but scant applause for Eleanor. 
ELEANOR Good afternoon. I am so pleased to be invited here today. looking down at her cards) Too often.... 
A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture which throws Eleanor off. 
ELEANOR Too often... 
She stops. The pause is deadly. Louis looks ready to jump out a window. Eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high. 
ELEANOR Too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men... 
Slowly, she begins to find her voice. 
ELEANOR So that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside... without expression. T his is a mistake. 
She looks up from her cards and stares at the audience... and for the first time speaks spontaneously. 
ELEANOR I think this might be the reason I am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today. 
The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room. 
ELEANOR I'm reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant. That it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place -- you must walk around it. If our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them. To see the entire elephant. And for that... they need our help. 
The ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams. 
LATER 
At a reception following the speech, Eleanor and the Chairwoman are drinking tea. 
F 
CHAIRWOMAN That was so moving, Mrs. Roosevelt. The Child Welfare Amendment could use someone with your passion. You must consider being our spokesperson. 
Eleanor looks to Louis who nods. 
ELEANOR Oh. It would be an honor. 
CHAIRWOMAN Wonderful. 
EXT. POOL - DAY 
Franklin is attempting to walk in the water, working diligently. Tom watches him from a few paces back. 
TOM Morning. 
FRANKLIN I walked five steps today! 
TOM Congratulations. Listen, Franklin, I got word a local reporter wants to do a story on you. 
RANKLIN I'm hardly newsworthy these days. (a beat) How did he find out I'm here? 
TOM Small town -- word gets out. It probably won't amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the Inn. 
FRANKLIN Exactly. 
There is a knock at the screen door. An earnest young man, BENJAMIN PRENDERGAST, 18, is peering in. He has a newspaper. 
PRENDERGAST Excuse me, are you Mr. Roosevelt? 
FRANKLIN Yes. Who are you? 
Roy opens the door to Prendergast, who enters. 
PRENDERGAST My name is Benjamin Prendergast. I've come to see if you could speak at this year's graduation ceremony at the schoolhouse. You being so famous and all. 
Prendergast unfolds the newspaper. There is a picture of Franklin under the heading "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!" 
FRANKLIN I'll be damned. 
PRENDERGAST Would you be available? 
FRANKLIN (looking up) When? Next spring? 
PRENDERGAST Next week. We only have a four month school year. 
FRANKLIN How is that possible? 
PRENDERGAST Tax dollars only cover that much. 
FRANKLIN Are you graduating? 
PRENDERGAST No, sir. I'm the principal. 
FRANKLIN I see. 
But Franklin doesn't see. 
EXT. SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY A small breeze or a decent rain would knock it to the ground. 
INT. SCHOOLROOM - CONTINUOUS A bookshelf with four books. 
A few FARMERS and their WIVES sit with large groups of filthy children. They look at Franklin askance. 
Prendergast stands proudly beside three GRADUATES-TO-BE. 
Tom stands in the back observing. 
Franklin, in his wheelchair, sits uncomfortably before the gathering. He notices a FATHER staring at his legs. 
PRENDERGAST Now that we're all here let me introduce to you to our guest speaker today, Mr. Franklin Roosevelt. 
FRANKLIN Good afternoon. 
A fly begins buzzing around his head. He laughs derisively, almost to himself. 
FRANKLIN At Groton, where I graduated from high school, our beloved Headmaster encouraged his students to enter public life... 
He looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished child which unsettles him. 
FRANKLIN I chose to attend Harvard for my undergraduate work and then Columbia for my law degree. H e takes in their uncomprehending expressions. 
FRANKLIN I followed my Headmaster's advice and sought a career in public life. But circumstances beyond my control have made that... very difficult... 
R 
He stares at his tiny audience, all of whom know something about circumstances beyond their control. 
FRANKLIN I've given many speeches in my life... I don't know why I'm having such a hard time making this one... 
Horrified and unable to speak, Franklin seems temporarily lost, but the tiny audience doesn't seem to notice. They just see Franklin. 
INT. TOM'S AUTOMOBILE - DAY 
FRANKLIN My God did you see how they were looking at me? 
TOM They welcomed your company, Franklin. 
FRANKLIN Don't patronize me. 
Tom is losing his patience. 
FRANKLIN That's marvelous, Babs. 
Eleanor is flushed with pride. Franklin, catching her look, slips slightly on the bars as Roy grabs hold of him. 
ROY I've got you, sir. 
Franklin then takes note that Eleanor's expression has turned to one of pure heartbreak. 
FRANKLIN You wonder why I want to go back to Georgia... it's to avoid people who look at me the way you just did. 
ELEANOR You truly believe the waters... (with difficulty) ... that they are helping? 
FRANKLIN Don't talk to me as if I were a child. Choosing your words so carefully... 
ELEANOR How am I supposed to talk to you? 
FRANKLIN Like I was! Talk to me like I was! 
Roy turns Franklin around on the bars and they begin walking away from Eleanor. 
ELEANOR I don't know how anymore. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. COTTAGE - DAY Franklin is being lifted out of Pete's wagon by Roy and placed into his wheelchair. He sees Tom approaching. T OM You're a sight for sore eyes... 
FRANKLIN We missed you at the station... 
The smile on Franklin's face slips to a look of shock as he takes in Tom's changed appearance. His face is sallow and his trademark white suit is hanging on him. 
FRANKLIN (concerned) Tom, are you all right? 
TOM It's just an ulcer. I can't eat anything I like anymore. 
Roy carries the luggage into the cottage. 
FRANKLIN (covering) My father had ulcers. Damn irritating. 
TOM Yes, they are. 
A silence hangs in the air. 
TOM Ready to swim? 
EXT. POOL - DAY Franklin now dressed in his bathing suit is being wheeled by Roy. Tom follows. 
TOM We've got some new guests. Some paying, some non-paying... 
As they get closer, Franklin is stunned by what he sees -- 
A DOZEN PEOPLE -- all in different groupings -- some on crutches, others in wheelchairs, are gathered around the pool. 
FRANKLIN What in blazes?... 
TOM The interview you gave was syndicated in Sunday papers all over the country. 
Franklin looks up at Tom, dumbfounded. 
TOM They're here to see you. 
H 
This news hits Franklin with the force of a sledgehammer. 
PAT DOYLE, 50, is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge cigar between his fat lips. 
is eyebrows have a life of their own. He wheels himself to Franklin. 
PAT Mr. Roosevelt, Pat Doyle. I've come all the way from Minneapolis to shake your hand, sir. 
He reaches out his hand to Franklin. 
PAT Stuck in this chair I do nothing but read. Newspapers, mostly. Usually I'm just looking for something -- anything -- that'll tell me there's even the slightest chance I'll walk again. 
Franklin is uncomfortable, especially as Pat won't let go of his hand. 
FRANKLIN I really don't know what to say. 
EXT. STATION PLATFORM - DAY 
Roy lays Fred on a bench. Franklin wheels himself over. 
FRANKLIN Son, can you hear me? 
Tom brings a cup of water. Franklin puts it to Fred's lips. 
FRANKLIN Fred? 
Fred opens his eyes. They are large and brown with a sweetness to them. His face comes alive when he recognizes Franklin. 
FRED Mr. Roosevelt?... 
FRANKLIN It's going to be all right, son. H e hands Franklin a worn newspaper clipping from his pocket. The headline reads: "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!" 
FRED The conductor wouldn't let me ride in the passenger car with my chair. 
Franklin looks at the clipping, then at Fred. 
FRANKLIN When did you last eat? 
FRED Knoxville. 
TOM Knoxville had to be three days ago. 
FRANKLIN Roy, take him to the car. 
As Roy lifts Fred in his arms, Franklin wheels himself to the engine car. Tom follows as they approach the CONDUCTOR. 
FRANKLIN Who in their right mind let's a child ride in the baggage car! You could have killed that boy. 
CONDUCTOR He had polio. Probably still contagious. 
The Conductor walks away, dismissively. Franklin pushes his chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks. 
FRANKLIN Don't dismiss me because I sit in this chair! 
CONDUCTOR Get away from me. 
Franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he knocks the Conductor over. 
FRANKLIN You ignorant son of a bitch. If I could, I'd get up right now and lock you in that box car! See how you like it! 
TOM Franklin... 
The Conductor struggles to get up. 
CONDUCTOR Get this lunatic off me! 
Franklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now lying across the back seat. The sight of Fred drains all anger from Franklin's face. 
FRANKLIN Where's the nearest hospital? 
TOM Atlanta. 
FRANKLIN What about a doctor? 
TOM Closer, but not by much. 
The train whistle BLOWS. 
ROY Train's ready. 
Franklin looks at Fred, then at Roy and Tom. 
FRANKLIN (quietly) Let's go home. 
INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT Fred lays in Franklin's bed while Franklin sits by the bedside. Roy lays a cold compress on Fred's forehead. F ranklin is using his watch to take Fred's pulse. 
Roy pulls back the sheet to give Fred air revealing his withered legs. Alabaster skin stretched over bones. 
Franklin looks away. 
INT. COTTAGE - DAY Franklin sits at a card table with his check book in front of him. Tom stands before him, shifting uncomfortably. 
FRANKLIN How many can pay? 
JAKE PERRINI, 32, Bronx-born with an upper body of steel wheels over to Roy who is fixing a wheelchair. 
JAKE Jake Perrini, Bronx, New York. 
ROY Roy, sir. 
JAKE How you doin'? 
Jake reaches out his hand to shake. Roy is unsure what to do. 
JAKE C'mon -- I won't bite. 
T 
ROY (shaking his hand) Mighty fine, sir. Mighty fine. 
JAKE Hey, would you mind pulling me outta this trap, Roy? I wanna get airborne. 
Roy gently lifts Jake up and out of his chair, into his arms like a child. 
JAKE Do me one more favor? Throw me in? 
Roy tosses Jake to the heavens and he SAILS through the air emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before SPLASHING down hard in the water. H e bobs up to the surface. There is applause. 
FRANKLIN Now folks, these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me. 
Some laugh, some are confused. This is new territory for everyone. 
FRANKLIN My hope is that in repeating these movements over and over in the water I'm in some way causing the muscles to regenerate themselves and repair the damage. 
He swims to the edge of the pool. 
FRANKLIN So everybody grab the edge of the pool and move what you can! 
hey disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them. 
FRANKLIN Go ahead now, do your best! 
Their legs barely rise up to splash the surface. Undeterred, Franklin leads them on, spiritedly. 
In the distance we see Tom, leaning against a tree, watching everything. 
F 
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT Tom oversees the dinner service of paying guests -- none of whom have disabilities. 
INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT Segregated in a back room, all the polio guests are gathered for dinner seated around a couple of sawhorses with old doors thrown across them serving as makeshift dining tables. 
Roy carries DAISY in and places her in the chair next to Franklin. 
RANKLIN Do you have a reservation? 
She begins to giggle. It's infectious and soon everyone has a smile on their face, overriding the awkwardness of the situation. 
FRANKLIN Whether in here or our there, I guarantee you the food will taste the same... terrible. 
DAISY Shouldn't we pray first? 
FRANKLIN By all means. Would you do us the honor? 
Franklin bows his head for grace. 
DAISY Bless the food on our table. Keep us healthy, strong and able. Amen. 
ALL Amen. 
EXT. FACTORY - DAY 
With Louis in tow, Eleanor is touring the exterior of an ironworks factory. She is the only woman in a large gathering of men. 
ELEANOR (V.O.) "My dear Franklin, I too am embarking on an altogether remarkable experience." 
EXT. BUILDING - DAY leanor stands against a banner that reads "CHILD WELFARE LEAGUE." She is passing out pamphlets to a small crowd that has gathered. 
ELEANOR (V.O.) "It seems everywhere I go there are more people in dire need of help. It would be overwhelming if not for my deep belief that help is possible..." 
INT. NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY - DAY Eleanor is being introduced by Louis to members of the New York State Assembly -- all men -- eager to shake her hand. 
Franklin, with difficulty, tries to do so. 
FRANKLIN Give me the good news first. 
HELENA Your gluteus maximus is better than I hoped. It will serve you well. 
FRANKLIN Must be all that sitting. 
HELENA I'm serious. Your right leg has some movement along the thigh. That's good because we can use it to help extend your hip, flex your knee and rotate your tibia. 
FRANKLIN I'm supposed to walk on one side? 
HELENA The water may help build some strength I'm not able to see yet. But to do that you would need to swim in the water much of the day. Not the limited hours you have now. a beat) Why should this place cater to a few able-bodied folk when it could be opened year round with polios? 
EXT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY Tom is pushing Franklin in his wheelchair. 
FRANKLIN There's a need for a place like this, Tom. (MORE) 
Are you aware NKLIN(cont'd) FRA that in the last epidemic over 16,000 people got polio in the New York area alone? 
TOM Sounds like you've been reading up. 
FRANKLIN I wish there was more to read. Damn few things being written about any of this. To think of someone like Fred... locked away... his mind and heart so vibrant... 
TOM It's a waste. An awful waste. 
Franklin takes a beat -- the weight of this sinking in. 
FRANKLIN What's the acreage here? 
TOM Roughly twelve hundred or so. Why? 
FRANKLIN I want to buy it. I think it would make one hell of an investment. 
TOM Investment? 
FRANKLIN Twelve hundred acres? Enough for two resorts, don't you think? 
TOM It would take money. There's a lot of land, rebuilding the inn, adding ramps and so many people can't pay... 
FRANKLIN (undeterred) Do you think old Peabody will sell? 
TOM He'll sell. 
FRANKLIN How can you be so sure? 
TOM Have you taken a look at this place? 
INT. TOM'S OFFICE   - DAY Franklin sits in his chair at a desk. 
FRANKLIN (full of charm) Peabody you old reprobate! How are you? 
Tom is pacing back and forth 
FRANKLIN You'll never guess why I'm calling. 
EXT. MERIWETHER INN - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY Helena is training a group of YOUNG MEN how to lift and carry using a raven haired young woman, ELOISE HUTCHISON, 18, as the test model. She sits shyly in her wheelchair before them. 
HELENA Woodhall, this is Eloise. Lift her gently. 
WOODHALL BUSEY, 17, has bright red hair and a face full of freckles. Over six feet tall he has spent his life working in the fields.          W OODHALL Yes, ma'am. 
He picks Eloise up effortlessly, then sets her back down. 
HELENA Very good! Watch her braces. 
Woodhall kneels before Eloise like Prince Charming, carefully straightening out her legs. 
WOODHALL You're light as a ... 
He notices the long jagged scars along Eloise's wrists. Eloise, sensing his eyes, self-consciously pulls down her sleeves. He stares at her questioningly. 
ELOISE (looking away) I was a dancer... 
Tom and Franklin come out. Franklin gives a questioning look to Helena, pondering how these boys have suddenly appeared. 
T 
FRANKLIN We also require a blacksmith's shop so we can craft braces here on the premises. I've found a wonderful local man who can make crutches and canes. His work is outstanding. Of course what is most desperately needed is a hospital. That's going to put my fund raising abilities to the test. 
Franklin wheels himself up a ramp to the Inn as Eleanor and Louis follow. 
INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS Surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture E Eleanor and Louis exchange glances. 
LEANOR What exactly are you proposing, Franklin? 
FRANKLIN That this will be the first polio rehabilitation and treatment center in the world. My personal trust almost covers the price of the Inn and the surrounding land. There will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while I seek out investors. 
LOUIS Franklin, you're risking everything you have... 
ELEANOR And there are other costs to consider. 
FRANKLIN Mama will see that the children are provided for. 
ELEANOR I'm not speaking of money. 
FRANKLIN I have found something here which makes waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand there... 
ELEANOR Franklin, I need for you to be practical and realistic. 
FRANKLIN (furious) Practical? I am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition. I am trying to be practical. Now either you're with me or against me. In or out! 
ELEANOR I don't care for ultimatums disguised as debate. 
Eleanor starts to leave. 
FRANKLIN Where are you going? Eleanor! Get back here. 
ELEANOR I will see you gentlemen tonight. 
She leaves. 
LOUIS You can't talk to her like that. 
FRANKLIN Oh really? Are you an expert on this now? How should I speak to my wife, Louis? 
LOUIS With the respect she deserves. (a beat) Look, I don't deny the work you're doing here could be important -- 
FRANKLIN Could be? 
LOUIS The issue is whether you want to run a rehabilitation center or whether you want to run for office again. 
FRANKLIN When I can walk, I'll run. 
EXT. POOL - DAY Eleanor approaches the pool. It is as quiet as a church. She is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the water. 
On each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their bathing suit. Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in bathing attire conducting therapy. In hushed tones the Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the work being done. 
Eleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated. 
INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING The camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces, legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret hand holding and hands on thighs. 
Jake and a new physical therapist, MARY BETH, are particularly cozy. 
FRANKLIN (O.S.) This is a very special night we're celebrating. At last we are together eating in this dining room! 
The hands come up and out from under the table, applauding. 
ON FRANKLIN 
He is in his wheelchair dressed in a jacket and tie. 
FRANKLIN Now please join me in welcoming Miss Jackie Mills, a new arrival along with her father, Samuel, all the way from Oakland, California. 
CLOSE-UP ON JACKIE 
Eight years old with black hair. Her legs are in braces and she grips her father's hand tightly. 
ON FRANKLIN 
FRANKLIN Let us also take this opportunity to welcome our two able-bodied guests, Mr. Louis Howe and my better half, Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt. 
ON ELEANOR AND LOUIS 
Waving politely from their seats. 
FRANKLIN Getting a doctor to live on the premises full-time. Someone who, at the very least, could monitor our progress. Make us legitimate. 
She begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of intricate buckles. 
Eleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing his shoes. 
ELEANOR And that costs more money. 
FRANKLIN Yes. 
Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels once again to untie his shoelaces. 
FRANKLIN But the real problem is no one is interested. The annual Orthopedics Convention is being held in Atlanta this weekend and I offered to speak. (his anger surfacing) They turned me down flat. 
Eleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with tender care pulls them up his legs. 
ELEANOR A few weeks ago, the conditions at a garment factory on West 27th Street were brought to my attention. The owners claimed everything was satisfactory, but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection. 
She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated position. They are now face to face. 
ELEANOR It took awhile, but we finally got in. 
FRANKLIN We? 
He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become. He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top. 
Eleanor sits in a chair across from him. 
ELEANOR I showed up with someone from the Labor Board and we refused to leave until they let us in. 
FRANKLIN What are you suggesting? 
ELEANOR At the risk of my good standing with the Junior Assistance League, I suggest we crash the party. 
She stands and walks over to Franklin and runs her hand through his hair.    E LEANOR Good night, Franklin. 
She goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light against the candle-lit room. 
FRANKLIN Good night, Babs. 
She blows the candle out and closes the door. 
E 
EXT. ATLANTA STREET - DAY Franklin's car pulls up to a massive stone building built in Greek revival style. Franklin looks intimidated -- there are two dozen stairs leading up to the main entrance. 
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - CONTINUOUS Roy climbs the stairs like a stevedore with Franklin slung over his shoulder. Using enormous force, Eleanor is pulling the chair up and over each step while walking backwards up the stairs. 
INT. AMPHITHEATER - DAY The stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large projections on a screen of spinal discs while a DOCTOR, in a dull litany, intones a prepared speech. 
DOCTOR A clinical situation where the radicular or nerve root is compressed by the prolapsed disc is referred to as a radiculopathy. 
Double doors fly open with a BANG as all heads turn to see Franklin and Eleanor. 
ELEANOR So sorry we're late! 
FRANKLIN Good afternoon! 
Eleanor talks quickly while wheeling Franklin down the aisle. 
ELEANOR (introducing herself) Eleanor Roosevelt, niece of the late President Theodore Roosevelt and this is my husband, Franklin, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy. 
FRANKLIN (sotto to Eleanor) Are you sure this worked on 27th Street? 
LEANOR (under her breath) It seemed to at the time. 
They reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag reads, "Dr. Bissell." 
ELEANOR Thank you, Dr. Bissell for agreeing to let us share the stage with you today. It was so generous of you. 
Dr. Bissell smiles limply, saving face. The audience vaguely applauds. Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage. 
ELEANOR My husband, as many of you may have read, is a victim of polio. However, victim is only a definition, not a state of mind. Franklin? 
He looks at her completely amazed. Eleanor gives him an F encouraging nod to take over. 
RANKLIN We all know that poor circulation is a chronic problem for limbs damaged by polio... I've never been able to swim more than a few minutes without becoming too cold. But there's a place, gentlemen... a miraculous place not three hours from here where the water is filled with natural minerals at a temperature of almost 90 degrees. That place, gentlemen, is called Warm Springs. 
Farmer and his Wife from the school house graduation approach Franklin. 
ARMER Mr. Roosevelt you lookin' mighty fit. 
FARMER'S WIFE Fine day, isn't it. 
FRANKLIN It is. How's the Boll Weevil situation? 
FARMER'S WIFE I expect the Boll Weevil is always gonna be a situation, Mr. Roosevelt, but thanks for askin'. 
Franklin's energy and vitality are infectious. The politician within him is being reborn. 
INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY A beaming Eleanor sits down next to Louis. He too is looking very pleased. Eleanor takes notice. 
ELEANOR Why do I get the feeling we're not smiling about the same thing? 
The train begins pulling out. 
They both look out at Franklin. Locals are coming up to his car surrounding him -- he is a magnet. 
LOUIS He's ready. 
INT. STATE ASSEMBLY, N.Y. - VIEWING SECTION - DAY Louis is seated in the front row of the balcony of the State Assembly, his feet up on the railing, eating pistachio nuts. 
Also seated are two politicos, JAMES HASTINGS and STEPHEN TELLER. 
HASTINGS You can't kiss babies from a wheelchair. It'll scare their mothers half to death. 
TELLER Al Smith's got a lock on the presidential nomination. 
LOUIS Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you think even after all these years that old Al's still a little rough around the edges? 
They laugh knowing this is a huge understatement. 
LOUIS Franklin can help soften his image. 
HASTINGS How? 
LOUIS Let him put Smith's name in nomination. 
Teller and Hastings are none to sure. 
TELLER Well, he is a helluva speech maker. 
HASTINGS Yeah, but is your man up to it? 
LOUIS It's in the bag, guys. Count on it. 
Bluffing is one of Louis's strong suits and it looks like they're buying it. 
Just then, Louis notices a familiar face down on the floor. 
I 
S 
LOUIS Hey, Stansbury, give my best to the Misses! (to Hastings and Teller) He's lost weight. Must've been the prison food. INT. MERIWETHER INN - HALLWAY - MORNING A line stretches outside with patients waiting to be seen. Among them is Franklin, chatting with everyone else, expecting and receiving no priority attention. 
INT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY ROOM - MORNING Dr. Hebert is examining Daisy. Helena is by his side, filling him in on her case history. 
INT. MERIWETHER INN - NIGHT Helena, dressed in a robe, walks the halls of the Inn. Something is amiss. 
EXT. GROUNDS - NIGHT An empty wheelchair, illuminated by a sliver of moonlight. 
On a blanket nearby are Jake and Mary Beth. 
he unbuttons his shirt and runs her hands over his impressively developed upper body. They begin to kiss hungrily, passionately -- completely in their own world. 
Several yards away, across the lawn, Eloise is in Woodhall's arms -- they are dancing. He is singing softly into her ear as they sway, her feet never touching the ground. 
NT. MERIWETHER INN - NIGHT 
Helena, in a nightgown, is looking out a window into the distance. Fiercely protective and slightly envious of her charges, she pulls a pack of cigarettes from her bathrobe pocket and steals a solitary smoke. 
EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT Franklin seated alone on the porch in the darkness. He drags on his cigarette and the red glow illuminates the contours of his face in repose. 
FADE OUT: 
INT. MERIWETHER INN - FRONT DESK - DAY 
Fred, wearing a bow tie and an oversized jacket, is proudly polishing off a desktop sign that reads: "FRED BOTTS: DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS." 
Helena is behind him reading a file. 
LIONEL (entering) Here's another one he's refusin'. 
He throws a telegram onto an already large stack. 
HELENA Why don't you read it? 
LIONEL Don't like telegrams. All them STOPS and stuff. 
HELENA Make you dizzy, Lionel. 
LIONEL A little bit. 
Fred eyes the telegram, then impulsively grabs it, ripping it open. 
FRED "Would be honored if you place my name in nomination for President. STOP. The party needs you. STOP. Yours sincerely, Al Smith." 
LIONEL Who's he? 
HELENA The Governor of New York. handing it to Lionel) Why don't you slide it under his door? 
LIONEL All right. Probably slide it right back. 
Lionel leaves. Fred and Helena are silent for a moment. 
FRED He won't go. He doesn't want to be seen walking on crutches or being wheeled to the podium. 
HELENA The millions listening on radio won't be able to see that. 
FRED But all the people at the convention will. 
Helena nods, "That's right." 
CUT TO: 
INT. COTTAGE - AFTERNOON Responding to a knock at the door, Roy gets up from sitting on the couch with Franklin, sullen and inattentive. H e opens the door to Louis who walks right in. 
ROY Good afternoon, Mr. Howe. 
LOUIS Hello, Roy. 
Roy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom. 
LOUIS I can't believe you've made me come all the way back to this hell hole! 
FRANKLIN I've done no such thing. 
F 
LOUIS I'm here to take you to Houston. You started your speech yet? 
FRANKLIN I'm not going. 
He stares at Franklin, drinking. Shaking his head, he goes over to the sidebar and pours one for himself. 
LOUIS You know what this is, don't you? It's a golden opportunity. A springboard for you to run for Governor. 
ranklin is silent. Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in Franklin's empty wheelchair. 
LOUIS Ever hear of a Civil War General named Francis Nicholls? 
FRANKLIN No. 
LOUIS Well, I never heard of him either. But this was one brave son-of-a- bitch. Fought for the Confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another. Then after the war he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana -- twice! 
FRANKLIN He was a war hero. 
LOUIS (with emphasis) Twice. (a beat) Look, I've worked like a dog to keep your name in play, grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back rooms. 
FRANKLIN As much for you as for me. 
LOUIS I'll be damned if I'm going to let you pass up a chance like this. It's time -- and you're ready. 
HELENA I'll try not to. Good luck, Franklin. 
FRANKLIN I'm throwing myself to the wolves. 
HELENA You've faced worse. And if they bite, you can come back here. 
FRANKLIN I'll always come back here. 
Helena steps away and Franklin pulls out and down the driveway. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOUSTON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT 
Dark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of stairs. Louis is hastily checking over his shoulder. If possible, Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis. 
FRANKLIN You're being superstitious, Louis. There aren't any reporters here. 
Suddenly out of the darkness a FLASHBULB POPS revealing a dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the arms of a black man. 
No one does or says a thing. The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take another. 
But DAN REED, a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places a massive hand over the lens. 
Slowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down. 
REED quietly) No. 
Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the scene unfold 
Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it. 
It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his authority is unquestioned. 
But the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the back, pulling out the film and exposing it. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Hey! 
REED (tipping his hat) Good to see you, Mr. Roosevelt. 
FRANKLIN Thank you. 
INT. CONVENTION HALL - HOUSTON - NIGHT The enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance WORKERS and JANITORS. Louis enters and makes his way to the stage. 
He approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking out. GRIPPING the podium hard he ROCKS it back and forth. 
Taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket. 
Looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to him he quickly ducks down behind the podium. 
The sound of HAMMERING fills the hall as Louis, on his knees, NAILS the podium to the floor. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CONVENTION HALL - DAY Twenty thousand CONVENTIONEERS are roasting in the hall. It is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot. A sea of hand- held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once -- most bearing the words "SMITH FOR PRESIDENT." 
Near the stage is a long table where the new breed of RADIO REPORTERS are seated, each in front of a primitive looking microphone. 
A 
Hovering in a group off to the side are Dan Reed and the REPORTERS from the previous night. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUING Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's arm. He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit. As everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is perspiring more than F most. 
RANKLIN Where is she seated? 
Louis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop Franklin's brow with a handkerchief. 
LOUIS In a box stage left. Give me your hand. 
Franklin takes his hand off his cane. It's soaking wet. Louis wipes it, gently. 
FRANKLIN Louis, what the hell am I doing? 
LOUIS Putting your big toe in the water. 
Just then, a VOICE booms out from the loudspeakers:

THE AVENGERS 
Screenplay by Don Macpherson 
June 21, 1995 
1	BLUE SKY WITH CLOUDS 
PAN DOWN to reveal: 
2	EXT - SALTFLATS - DAY 
A flat horizon, stretching to infinity. 
A 360 degree pan reveals: nothing.  Deserted, no hiding places.  No animals, no humans, no objects.  Except in mid distance -- 
3	RED PHONE BOX 
brightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green.  Perfectly ordinary -- except for its location. 
Silence.  Only the wind over the plain.  Except -- 
The PHONE RINGS. 
RING-RING ... a mellow, old-fashioned tone.  We wait for someone to answer it.  But of course nothing and nobody for miles.  Except -- 
4	IN DISTANCE 
a CAR ENGINE ... A puff of smoke on the horizon ... VA-VA-VOOM of high geared acceleration, as INTO VIEW 
ZOOM! -- 
5	CAR 
speeding like a bullet.  Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph.  A petite open top '65 Lotus Elan, all streamlined curves, full throttle, it nears the phone box, and -- 
SCREECHES to a halt. 
Dust clears, ENGINE NOISE FADES.  From the seat, hops -- 
6	KINKY BOOT 
in black leather. 
Buckled.  Strap at ankle.  Crunching into the ground. PAN UP TO: 
7	BEAUTIFUL WOMAN 
late 20's.  In CLOSEUPS of -- Tight black leather catsuit.  A flash of auburn hair. Black leather like a second skin.  Smoothed over legs, thighs.  Buckled at wrists, straps at ankles, zips -- 
Pulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, invulnerable, cool.  Very cool.  She locks up at clouds in the sky.  Then steps across to the phone box.  Picks up the phone. 
EMMA How now brown cow ... (pause) The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain ... (pause) The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy -- 
From the receiver, an irritated official voice. 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Password affirmative. Thank you, Doctor. 
Emma puts down receiver.  Hangs a cardboard outside the phone box.  Then presses button bakelite box. 
A second's wait.  A coin from the slot.  Then a HUM as -- 
8	INSIDE PHONE BOX 
the floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the box, a notice now reads "Out of Order." 
Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84 miles." 
9	INT.  LABORATORY 
underground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi tech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von Braun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel Only." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud. 
10      FROM AIRLOCK DOOR 
A man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  Early 40's, handsome, charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL. 
PETER Ready, darling? 
Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.  She smiles. 
EMMA Ready as I'll ever be ... 
Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they walk down: 
11      LONG CORRIDOR 
air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth -- 
A man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.  On his name tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner. 
In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab 
VALENTINE Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module set ... Temperature control on course between one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ... 
PETER Anything else? 
Valentine smiles, shrugs -- 
VALENTINE Good luck ... Peter ... Emma. 
EMMA Thanks, Valentine ... 
VALENTINE Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode! 
FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as 
VALENTINE Emma ... 
27      FROM HER VAULT 
Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod 
28      ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION) 
Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a nightmare -- 
29      BACK TO SCENE 
VALENTINE Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma! 
30      RAPID INTERCUTS 
The purple smoke enveloping Peter's	pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within, looking at Emma -- 
EMMA Peter! 
Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She grabs, claws on glass -- 
Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod cover, it -- 
Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as behind her 
VALENTINE Don't wait for him -- he's not -- 
Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove -- twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as: 
31      ABOVE GROUND 
The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...! 
32      CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING 
gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass -- 
33      BACK TO SCENE 
PETER (faint) Emma ... Emma ... 
As a GROWLING sound grows till 
BOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma. 
34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION) 
The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating backwards in -- 
A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control, weightless, powerless, as -- 
The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back -- 
An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new version of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE -- 
CREDITS SEQUENCE. 
35      SERIES OF SHOTS 
In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon -- 
A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over -- 
A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad body -- 
In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  Flashes of: hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut. 
A thorned stem, sharp to the touch -- 
FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black and white of a chessboard as ... 
A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance -- 
A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed back - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ... 
A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie -- umbrella stabs like a sword -- 
Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and tossed into -- 
His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette. Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until -- 
Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ... Then -- 
PISTOL SHOTS OVER as: 
36      INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN 
A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots, naked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair. 
Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow. 
Same every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel. From outside ANOTHER SHOT ... 
Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees -- 
37      HER POV 
a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The damn thing BACKFIRES again ... 
Just then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message, an upper-class woman's voice: 
WOMAN (V.O.) (filtered) Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John Steed ... 
BEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace of kippers. Puzzled, she holds up a fish. 
EMMA Kippers ...? 
48      EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY 
Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15. Out gets -- 
-- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, "Boodles Gentlemen's Club."  She goes in, passing -- 
-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire. 
49      INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised. 
PORTER May I help you, madam ... 
EMMA Mr. John Steed, please. 
PORTER I'm afraid that's impossible. 
EMMA Impossible? 
The Porter points to a notice:  "No non-members.  No animals.  No women." 
PORTER You are female? 
EMMA As you see. 
PORTER Then you can't come in. 
EMMA I have an appointment. 
PORTER No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922. 
EMMA Really -- what happened in 1922? 
Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave. 
The Porter rushes up to restrain her. 
Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. The Porter winces and -- 
EMMA Thank you so much. I can find Mr. Steed myself ... 
-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors, upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into 
50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY 
Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room 
Steed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees -- 
Emma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction. 
STEED Doctor Peel, I presume? 
EMMA And you must be Steed. Please don't get up. 
He doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study. 
STEED I was about to throw in the towel. 
EMMA I had a spot of bother at the door. 
STEED I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since -- 
EMMA 1922. Why the kippers? 
STEED Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think? 
EMMA (looks around) So what was all this -- some sort of test? 
STEED Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor. 
EMMA Whereas you are. 
STEED Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules. 
EMMA Rules are made to be broken. 
STEED Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing. 
EMMA And just what is the game? 
STEED I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel? 
EMMA (re:  the steamroom) Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel. 
STEED Much better. 
EMMA And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you? 
STEED I didn't. Mother did. 
EMMA Mother? 
Steed steps closer, smiling. 
FATHER (to Steed) Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died. 
EMMA I'm no spy -- where do I fit in? 
MOTHER Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise. 
STEED Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel -- 
Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ... 
EMMA I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work. I've been out of action for some time. I'll consider your proposal. 
She gets up, ready to go. 
FATHER One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another special reason we wanted you to join our happy family; rather curious, actually ... 
Mother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification, identikit sketches. 
MOTHER Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area. One description tallied in all three places. Recognize her? 
Emma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts. 
EMMA Me, isn't it? 
Emma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister. 
FATHER Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect. 
EMMA You're saying I have no choice. 
MOTHER Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes. 
EMMA (very arch) Ropes? 
55      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ SHOOTING GALLERY 
A life-size target of a man with blank face, bowler hat and umbrella, flips up, and -- 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  Is riddled with holes by 
Emma, who works at reloading as 
56      HIGH ABOVE IN ONE-WAY MIRRORED GALLERY 
looking on, Mother with Steed. 
STEED Think she really killed those agents? 
MOTHER She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. 
STEED Amnesia? 
MOTHER Possibly. Split personality ... 
STEED Insane ... ? 
MOTHER Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out. 
STEED Why? 
MOTHER She may try to kill you. 
57      IN SHOOTING GALLERY 
Emma swiftly turns, aims, and -- 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision. All on target.  Steed reacts.  Ulp. 
STEED Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. Darling. 
58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM 
A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie (1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed. The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show. 
As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard, Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air. 
DR. DARLING One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow: she's obsessively devoted to the memory of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. You may find her a little ... remote. 
Images of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him. 
DR. DARLING They were a team. Met at Cambridge. Working on a top secret research mission into weather conditions, code name The Prospero Project, when Peel died. 
Steed looks meaningfully at Mother. 
MOTHER Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. 
STEED How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling? 
DR. DARLING Her husband was one of ours. 
STEED (eyes Peel's photo, then Mother) Peel? Did she know? 
MOTHER Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination. 
STEED Anyone particular in mind? 
MOTHER You. 
OFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ... 
59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON 
Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she does, Emma is a champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech dueling ... 
EMMA But why? What's the point? 
STEED A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor. 
EMMA And I suppose you're the knight. 
STEED The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen. 
EMMA That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know. 
Steed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing? 
STEED I'm hoping you will. 
He puts his foot down.  Zoom ... 
68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
Towards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ... 
69      INT.  JAG - DAY 
Emma consults a list, reads -- 
EMMA Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? 
STEED As per mother's instructions. 
EMMA Do we always follow Mother's instructions? 
STEED For a man in my position -- 
EMMA Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work? 
STEED (smiles) They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself. 
EMMA I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? 
STEED After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea? 
EMMA No thanks. 
STEED I meant me. 
Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours. 
70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY 
The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car. 
STEED (V.O.) According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ... 
EMMA (V.O.) An eccentric recluse? 
71      INT.  JAG - DAY 
STEED Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie. 
EMMA June, July ... August? 
STEED The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined. 
EMMA Any other vices? 
STEED All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY. (off her look) British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens. 
Emma takes this in. 
EMMA So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How? 
STEED Small talk.  Try the weather. 
72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY 
Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates 
Signs:  "Private: No Admittance."  Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded rifles.  They start up the drive ... 
Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails. 
One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a CAMERA ... 
The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them. 
73      INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY 
On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal: 
A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor -- 
-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor. 
EMMA Original ... 
BUTLER This way, miss ... 
EMMA Missus ... 
He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into 
74      INT.  A LARGE ROOM 
of semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls lined with display cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.  A thermometer reads: 
STEED Manners, Mrs. Peel. 
Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 
BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS -- 
80      EMMA'S POV 
-- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes close ... 
81      EMMA 
moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good bye kiss. 
82      STEED'S POV	82 
The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
Sound of CLACKING ... 
FADE IN: 
83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY 
A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to 
Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very nonchalant.  Eating his grapes. 
STEED Ah, Brenda ... (as she leaves) Mrs. Peel? 
EMMA You should be dead.  How do you feel? 
STEED (eyes her) Strange. 
EMMA You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank. 
STEED I wasn't about to. 
EMMA I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed. 
STEED I might say the same. 
84      FROM GALLERY 
Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. But they both are wearing headphones. 
EMMA Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you. 
STEED Why should they think that? 
EMMA You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead. 
STEED Frankly that's how I remember it. 
EMMA But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style. 
STEED Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. 
EMMA (conceding) That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised. 
STEED Did he say who? 
EMMA No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this. 
Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by -- 
STEED An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? 
EMMA Did you say formal? I must dress. 
85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT 
The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door. Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit -- 
86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL 
hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring -- 
STEED I must say, you look more your old self -- 
EMMA You mean my other self ... 
STEED Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion? 
EMMA I should have thought that was obvious ... (off his smirk) I'm in mourning. 
She moves off.  Stay on his poker face. 
STEED I can't wait to see afternoon. 
He joins her; they survey the building. 
EMMA Where's the picnic? 
They look up to -- 
87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling -- 
Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ... 
EMMA Is that written in his shoe? 
STEED (smug) Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ... 
EMMA (shrugs) She had this in her mouth. There, there... 
Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.  Inside -- another address:  84 Cadogan Place. 
STEED Not again.  There's got to be another. way to go about this. 
96      EXT.  CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) - NIGHT 
Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.  Before gliding through an open French window -- 
97      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT 
Emma investigates.  Nobody there.  She looks 'round.  Military memorabilia.  Busts of Napoleon and Charlemagne.  Looks inside drawers.  Desks.  Meanwhile -- 
98      INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT 
Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... licking, pawing him ... 
STEED Now, now ... (sings) 'I can't give you anything but love, baby...' 
99      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT 
Emma searching ... 
100     OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR	100 
a key in lock.  Door opens.  Silence. 
101     INSIDE - EMMA 
finds a snowshaker.  About to look underneath.  Hears a NOISE.  Looks up, in front of her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.  Ready to strike -- 
Emma swivels 'round,  a fluid balletic motion, and -- 
Bam!  A kick to the teddy's stomach.  Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as -- 
The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.  She falls.  Teddy grabs a military sabre from the wall, and Woosh!  Slices through air at Emma's head.  She ducks.  The sabre skims her hair.  Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on! 
Emma counterattacks.  Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off! Jesus.  The torso stands unsteadily. 
Emma's eyes widen as: 
A man's head emerges from the teddy torso. 
Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ... 
Emma's out. 
102     INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT 
so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.  A little milk dribbles down Steed's chin ... 
103     INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT 
The man goes to the other room.  Starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume. Throws clothes into a suitcase. 
The PHONE.  Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ... 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Naughty teddy ... 
MAN No! You can't ... 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Ask not for whom the telephone rings, it rings for thee ... 
MAN But I've got rid of her.  She's ... 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Go to the window ... To the window. 
Teddy moves to the open window.  Sudden PAIN.  LIGHTNING. 
Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.  Direct hit.  The teddy slumps to the ground.  Soggy, waterlogged, very dead.  Kinda like the other guy ... 
104     IN OTHER ROOM 
Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, sees dead Teddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ... 
EMMA Major D'Arcy ... ? 
105     OVER HER SHOULDER 
from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" -- 
-- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.  She makes a NOISE.  Emma turns just in time to see. 
EMMA Well, well. If it isn't me ... 
Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window ... she wears the same black catsuit. 
The real Emma rushes, follows her "double" 
Clambers outside to rappel up the line to 
106     EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT 
Emma looks.  Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings, flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ... 
Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.  Then turns a corner to see -- 
Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant neon signs ... 
STEED For you, Mrs. Peel. 
EMMA Thanks ... (dry) I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello? 
It's Sir August. 
SIR AUGUST (V.O.) (filtered) Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly! 
CLICK. 
EMMA Sir August...? (to Steed) What now? 
STEED Ask Mother. 
Sound OVER:  RING-RING. 
122     INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY 
Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG BARKS. Finally, Sir August answers. 
SIR AUGUST Mrs. Peel -- ? 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Ask not for whom the telephone rings ... 
SIR AUGUST No, please! I beg you ... 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Walk over to the window ... 
SIR AUGUST Let it be rain, please let it be -- 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Stay by the window. By the window. 
Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late. 
123     OUTSIDE 
a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  Then a LIGHTNING STRIKE. And -- 
BOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes in ... 
FATHER (V.O.) Emergency alert ... 
124     EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY 
PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down deserted streets. 
FATHER (V.O.) A cyclone hit Banffshire last night. Completely unpredicted ... 
125     INSIDE CAR 
EMMA Where's Mother? 
FATHER Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ... 
Father drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease. 
FATHER You're probably wondering how I can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new prototype from the boys in X division. Micro-sensors in the system read signals and road information. Converts the info into miles per hour. Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart. 
Father jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. Steed holds onto his hat. 
STEED We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel. 
FATHER So you say ... 
EMMA You don't believe him? 
FATHER It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here. 
Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue 
Steed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ... 
EMMA But 
STEED Don't bother.  Here's a bus ... 
A red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the bodyguard, Brenda. 
BRENDA Fares, please, 
126     INT.  BUS - DAY 
Steed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay Brenda, the conductor.  Go upstairs. 
127     UPSTAIRS 
is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks on electronic panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper windows have been blacked out. 
MOTHER Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried. 
EMMA He tried to warn us ... 
STEED We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ... 
MOTHER Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb. 
STEED Impossible. 
EMMA Not quite. This is my field. 
STEED Is there anything that isn't? 
EMMA (ignores) The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... 
Steed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt. 
EMMA Is that what you think? 
STEED Oh, well ... (beat) Just my type, Mrs. Peel. 
134     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY 
The Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train at a level crossing, which just misses them -- 
135     INT. LOTUS - DAY 
Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks -- 
STEED Do you always drive this fast? 
EMMA Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? (before his reply) We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ... 
Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, trying to catch up. Emma glances in the mirror, and -- 
EMMA Hold on ... 
Puts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back to his seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind. 
136     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY 
The Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  Emma tries to shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  Shaking 'round corners, as ... 
137     BEND 
before Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind struggles to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner -- 
And suddenly sees in front of her -- 
138     HUGE TRUCK 
crossing directly in their path! 
STEED Turn! 
139     EMMA 
swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as -- 
140     TRUCK 
clears in time for the following car, which keeps going. 
141     ON HAYSTACK 
as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ... 
OLD LADY Are you alright, young man? 
STEED I think so, thank you so much ... 
A SQUEAL of TIRES as - 
The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the Old Lady react ... 
BAILEY (relishing) Reach for the sky, pardner. 
Steed raises his hands. 
OLD LADY Oh, dear -- 
To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and 
BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed. 
OLD LADY Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy. 
STEED I feel sure of it. 
OLD LADY I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you? 
STEED (looks around) She was ... 
They start pulling away hay from the haystack ... 
OLD LADY You with Mother or Father? 
STEED Both, actually. 
OLD LADY Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry. 
STEED (not paying attention) You don't say. (mumbles) Like looking for a needle in a ... 
142     INSIDE HAYSTACK 
Coughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He tries to conceal his relief at seeing her. 
STEED What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? 
EMMA Barely. 
STEED You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you? 
He pulls her out.  She's annoyed. 
143     OUTSIDE HAYSTACK 
Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw. 
DR.  DARLING White ... 
EMMA Knight ... 
DR. DARLING Black... 
EMMA ... death ... 
DR. DARLING Love... 
EMMA ... death ... 
Steed watching, listening ... 
DR. DARLING Flower ... 
EMMA ... power ... 
The exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; unlocks her straps. 
DR. DARLING Nature ... 
EMMA ... preserve... 
DR. DARLING Secret ... 
EMMA ... love... 
DR. DARLING Hope... 
EMMA ... love ... 
DR. DARLING Fear ... 
EMMA ... love ... 
DR. DARLING Peter ... 
As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past. 
EMMA ... Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers how many pecks of pickled peppers did Peter Peel -- ? 
174     CLOSEUP - EMMA 
Quietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble. 
EMMA How long have I been here? 
DR. DARLING Three days. 
Emma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy. 
EMMA Do you get paid by the hour? 
Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The "Dreamscape" machine winds down.  Up in the gallery -- 
BAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings 
MOTHER (filtered) You are here under observation, Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. Darling's questions 
Pushes Dr. Darling aside. 
EMMA I resign. 
MOTHER (filtered) You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign. 
EMMA Watch me. 
Emma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of staring at the hypnodisc. 
Emma heads for the airlock door marked: 
"ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE" 
MOTHER Don't open that, Mrs. Peel! 
Fat chance ... she goes in ... 
175     INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER 
Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  And float helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  Mother's wheelchair, Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "OFF" switch 
EMMA (echoing) What are you trying to do to me? 
MOTHER (flailing) We want to help...! 
EMMA I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that. 
MOTHER The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ... 
EMMA To you ... ? 
Mother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the "OFF" switch. They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair, Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother -- 
STEED I think you owe Mrs. Peel an explanation ... 
Steed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations. 
MOTHER Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved. 
EMMA The Institute ... the funding ... 
MOTHER A cover ... for us. (beat) I'm sorry... 
196     DOWN LONG HALL 
Bad "Emma" walks over.  She stands in front of him. 
Blank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, we recognize on her neck a tattoo:  Z424. 
DR. DARLING We are in the final phase. I shall require you to be especially obedient. There must be no failures. 
197     CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER 
which he grips tightly. As -- 
198     IN MIRROR 
a metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ... 
Shakes the snowshaker ... 
199     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
THUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal: 
Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts. 
200     INT.  JAG - DAY 
Steed driving, winces with the drizzle. 
STEED Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who? 
EMMA No idea who. No idea why ... 
STEED (thinks) Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ... 
EMMA ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children. 
STEED Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies? 
EMMA Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody. 
Steed thinks; sighs. 
STEED Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful. 
EMMA I'm a wanted woman, I know ... 
201     INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY 
Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" -- 
-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella and bowler.  Which is 
Emma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by. 
STEED His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones. 
EMMA Why's he called 'Invisible'? 
STEED You'll find out. 
At a door marked "Information -- Col. I. Jones." Steed knocks, opens the door for her. 
EMMA Aren't you coming? 
STEED I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you. 
Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor. 
202     INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY 
A room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets full of old paper. 
Dusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly Emma hears -- 
FOOTSTEPS. 
She follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER. She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her -- 
A filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own. 
Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams shut.  Still nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a -- 
Desk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open up.  Then the phone lifts up by itself, a voice: 
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls. (beat) Colonel Jones at your service, Mrs. Peel. Just a moment -- 
Emma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As -- 
A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.  The pipe lights; smoke belches forth. 
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal. 
EMMA I see. 
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel? 
203     INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE 
Steed on the phone. 
STEED I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ... Barometer's falling fast. Mrs. Peel and I find ourselves in need of foul weather gear. (beat) Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff for starters. And then -- 
204     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE 
MINISTER (V.O.) ... In the uncertain climate that threatens this global initiative, no magic umbrella can shield us. 
Steed checks out his own. 
MINISTER (V.O.) Only our own vigilance. Security and stability are our watchwords. 
APPLAUSE. 
Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside... 
EMMA Trubshaw again? What now? 
STEED Snuff. (off Emma's lock) I must insist you try some. 
Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you high?  They walk on, open doors to -- 
209     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT 
An empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a -- 
210     MARBLE HALLWAY 
A black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.  Otherwise, empty.  A chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through empty halls. 
STEED They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel. 
EMMA (annoyed) 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception? 
They move cautiously forward as 
211     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT 
Outside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white. A Christmassy glow -- 
Even troops play with snowflakes, until -- 
212     SEVERAL ANGLES 
The wind rises.  The snow falls harder. 
213     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT 
Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They head down a corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As -- 
Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. Steed steals -- 
A chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.  Steed looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him. 
STEED Oh, hello ... 
FATHER We want Mrs. Peel. 
STEED Dead, I'm afraid. 
Emma in hiding, listens as -- 
FATHER (O.S.) You disobeyed an order, Steed. Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot be trusted. 
Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to -- 
STEED (O.S.) I think she can. (beat) Can you? 
Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice. 
Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone. 
FATHER I shall summon security. 
She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away. 
Emma returns as the ALARM is raised -- 
STEED Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers? 
EMMA Have a look at this. 
She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow. Steed reacts, eyes wide. 
STEED It's almost May, for heaven sake. 
214     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT 
The blizzard rages through streets -- 
Now impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow start to climb up shop fronts.  And amid the sky -- 
Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting troops -- 
215     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT 
Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls -- 
To Emma. But up ahead, sees -- 
216     STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS 
A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as -- 
217     INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT 
Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls, ceiling murals -- 
The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by -- 
230     INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION 
Slam shut.  COOL HUM ... 
231     EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to get upstairs to help Emma... 
232     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Up Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap doors.  No secret panels.  The "floor" light flickers between floors. 
Waiting, until ... 
233     EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
The doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma dives to the other side, then -- 
Scrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  Scrambles more.  It slips out ... 
Just beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a foot, kicks the grenade towards the butlers, and -- 
As her elevator doors close -- 
BOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom -- 
Rushes to -- 
234     ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Where he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The light PINGS. Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when -- 
235     BUTLER'S POV 
No Emma. 
236     BACK TO SCENE 
The butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what to do, and -- 
The doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in -- 
237     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
-- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we -- 
PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator roof, limbs flexed against the walls is -- 
Emma, who -- drops down and -- 
Scissors the butler's head between her legs. 
The grenade rolls free ... 
Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and -- 
Sits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from the guy, until -- 
Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags -- 
238     EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
His head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps out, heads up for the stairs, the elevators doors. 
SLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which 
239     INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Breaks from its ropes, and -- 
Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes -- 
240     INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles... 
241     INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT 
Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which -- 
Flips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the skylight.  As the grenade -- 
242     INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE 
BOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  Emma rushes thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked. 
A moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips the skylight up, and -- 
Emerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her. 
243     EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT 
Blades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined whirly chopper ... 
Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city.  Stands up before her -- 
Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees assassin in balls. Flicks him backwards ... 
As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward. But too late:  sees -- 
The chopper -- about to take off. 
244     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER 
Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows. 
258     SEVERAL ANGLES 
as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ... 
259     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 
The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ... 
Up ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going on ... rockets and lights in the sky thru snowflakes ... 
Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and -- 
260     CLOSEUP SHOT 
Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit. 
261     HER POV 
The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge! 
262     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 
The Man sees the bomb ... 
Also flings himself onto the bridge as -- 
Against b.g. of the fireworks display -- 
263     WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 
BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.  Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in appreciation ... great fireworks! 
264     EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 
Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him. 
He runs too -- towards -- 
265     ANOTHER CHOPPER 
which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... The Man reaches for the dangling ladder -- but -- 
266     CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT 
stuck, wedged between narrow battlements. 
267     BACK TO SCENE 
The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.  He pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper, leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over, when she sees -- 
268     CLOSEUP - SHOE 
Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street." 
STEED (V.O.) I thought it was Cinderella who lost her slipper ... 
269     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN 
On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  PA announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. Steed & Trubshaw beside her. 
EMMA This time the shoe's on the other foot. You said a hand-made shoe was as good as a photo-fit or D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is find the shoe that fits ... 
TRUBSHAW It should be easy. A Trubshaw client has his shoes delivered personally. The Ministry should be able to confirm our delivery. 
STEED I'll be back ... 
EMMA Where are you going? 
STEED Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... 
EMMA You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect. 
STEED No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well. 
EMMA But -- 
STEED (comes back) Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder. 
EMMA If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't -- 
Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder. 
STEED A microtag. One of Mother's little toys. There you are. Free at last. 
He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction. 
270     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
An armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords -- ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ... 
Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ... 
271     UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER 
Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe lasts. 
EMMA Prince Charming, I presume. Your name is ... 
272     CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL 
with the name:  DARLING. 
He pushes a button.  Bad Emma enters.  Tattooed Z424.  Unmistakably hostile. 
VALENTINE My latest model. A compound of plastics and sensor chips. A big improvement on the old X404s. The poor thing is quite fond of me. Emma, say hello to Emma. 
BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK. 
VALENTINE You know, I believe she's actually jealous. 
EMMA Valentine, listen to me ... 
VALENTINE Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring. 
EMMA (covers her hand) Ring? 
He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then: 
VALENTINE How silly of me -- let me make you comfortable first ... 
As he advances, ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSEUP Emma's eye 
DISSOLVE TO: 
303     INT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - NIGHT 
Another ball, WIDEN to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high plastic ball emerges -- The ball lands on the shore.  From the inside, a zip peels away the plastic layer to reveal -- 
Steed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler.  A rose in his lapel.  He steps out, and, poking with his umbrella -- 
Deflates the inflatable plastic submarine.  Steed heads off -- CAMERA EYES the peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where he sees the -- 
304     RED PHONEBOX 
Steed picks up the phone.  Presses all the buttons until he hits "Button B."  As the floor lowers, his eyes widen in surprise ... 
305     SARCOPHAGUS 
carved in Emma's likeness.  Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into -- 
306     INT.  VALENTINE'S HIGH-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
as Valentine descends spiral steps to join it. 
Valentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within. 
VALENTINE That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ... 
EMMA You're mad. 
VALENTINE Entirely. On the other hand (he advances towards her, smiling) Mad people get things done. Let me show you -- 
307     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Steed stealing down a corridor and -- 
hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras.  He waits till they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and -- 
Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.  Brings her down. 
FATHER Steed 
STEED How did you guess? 
FATHER You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... 
STEED It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry. 
FATHER Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...' 
STEED Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ... 
Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the rubber tube, sprays a Mist.  Father passes out.  Steed rises, locks around. Sees -- 
A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return.  He turns and -- 
308     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing -- until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S. 
Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see -- 
309     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER 
Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as Valentine explains. 
VALENTINE People expect weather to be free. They're used to it. I call that a denial of freedom. No freedom of choice. An abuse of human rights. They buy water, electricity, gas. Why shouldn't they be able to buy their own weather if they want to? If they have a little incentive ... 
Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her. 
EMMA Such as? 
VALENTINE Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air. 
EMMA The result would be ... 
VALENTINE Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples... 
EMMA Then what's stopping you? 
VALENTINE One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring. 
Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses -- 
310     CLOSEUP - HER RING 
Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as -- 
318     CLOSEUP - VALENTINE 
places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ... 
WIDEN to reveal ... 
319     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
Masses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... )

VALENTINE Fool ... 
In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead. 
STEED That will do. 
He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver. 
VALENTINE Aren't you forgetting about something? 
STEED You are, and it's behind you. 
VALENTINE Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- 
Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace. 
VALENTINE Let go, you ... idiot ... 
Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine. 
STEED I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? 
VALENTINE Ugh ... 
As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as -- 
One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine locked in her arms in a dying embrace. 
They fall into the mists and liquid below. 
Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ...

Dead. 
STEED Emma! 
He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body. 
Emma lying sprawled out on the ground. 
Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with tears.  He lays her down.

TITLES BEGIN over the SOUNDS of city traffic. 
FADE UP: 
2   EXT. THEATER DISTRICT OF BROADWAY - DUSK                       2 
The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for their shows. Cabs line the streets. 
SIDE ALLEY 
A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and rushes to the side entrance of a theater. 
In the background we see that the title of the play, "Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee... 
3   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DUSK                       3 
We follow the Man in the Grey Suit as he rushes through narrow backstage hallways, passing several ACTORS dressing in Elizabethan costumes, applying their make- up, etc... 
TITLES CONTINUE. 
4   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE/EMPTY STAGE - DUSK           4 
The curtains are still closed, and the sound of the audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. . 
Stagehands are moving stage lights as-- 
A STAGE MANAGER 
takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other. 
He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in the background. 
The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the audience dies down. 
pg. 2 
5   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                5 
The man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage, a single light on him. He is "PROLOGUE". (We will see the same actor later as the "Prologue" of Henry V). 
"Prologue" regards his audience for a   beat before: 
PROLOGUE Soul of the Age! The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! Our Shakespeare, rise... (beat, repeating) Our Shakespeare... For he is all of ours, is he not? The most performed playwright of all time! The author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several epic poems that are collectively known as the ultimate expressions of humanity in the English language. And yet... And yet... (beat) Not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand. In four hundred years, not one document-- be it poem, play, diary or even a simple letter. (beat) He was born the son of a glove-maker, and at some unknown time, armed with but an elementary school education, he went to London where, the story goes, he became an actor and eventually a playwright. 
OFF STAGE 
A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER. 
Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES. 
ON STAGE 
"Prologue" opens his umbrella. 
PROLOGUE (CONT'D) He died at the age of 56, and was survived by his wife and two daughters who were, like Shakespeare's own father, irrefutably illiterate. 
pg. 3 
OFF STAGE 
In the rafters a stagehand opens valves.   It starts to RAIN. 
PROLOGUE (O.C.) (CONT'D) His will famously left his second best bed to his widow. But it made no mention of a single book or manuscript. 
The actor who will play "Ben JONSON" (mid 30's) appears in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of Elizabethan "soldiers" strap on their swords. 
ON STAGE 
"Prologue" continues, as do TITLES. 
PROLOGUE (CONT'D) Is it possible Shakespeare owned no books at his death because... he could not read? That he wrote no letters because he, like his father before him and his children after him, could not write? (lets that sink in, then) Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost; his biography made not by history... but by conjecture. His story not written with facts, but with... imagination. 
The rain has intensified. "Prologue" turns and the camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END.... 
PROLOGUE (CONT'D) (more energetic) So! Let me offer you a different story. A darker story... Of quills and swords. Of power and betrayal. Of a stage conquered, and a throne lost! 
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of RAIN are visible. No stage, no "Prologue". Then, trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We are: 
pg. 4 
6    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - 1604 NIGHT                             6 
Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street toward a large circular theater. 
He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater-- 
7    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                                 7 
--and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards the stage as-- 
8    EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8 
About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard. 
POLE Break it down! 
And several of the guards charge the door with their pikes, HITTING it hard. 
POLE (CONT'D) Again! 
9    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            9 
Jonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view just as-- 
Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13). 
SIR RICHARD POLE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD 
--jumps on stage. 
pg. 15 
POLE This play has been declared seditious and illegal by Lord William Cecil! 
The audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil. 
POLE (CONT'D) All are herewith ordered to disperse immediately! 
A GROUNDLING Why don't you disperse William Cecil's arse! 
POLE Arrest that man! 
IN OXFORD'S BOX 
SOUTHAMPTON Damn it all.    Well! Off to Essex's then? 
He gets up. Oxford does not, seemingly interested in the real drama below as everyone hurries from the theater. 
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Edward? 
Oxford turns to him, distracted, and nods. 
ON STAGE 
Jonson pushes his way on stage. 
JONSON (to Pole) Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy for god's sake! There's nothing seditious about-- 
POLE Oi, is that right, is it?    And you know this because? 
JONSON Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And- 
POLE Arrest him as well! 
Jonson is grabbed by guards. 
pg. 16 
17   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        17 
Jonson is THROWN into the cell, the door SLAMMED behind him. 
JONSON (to the door) A pox on you! (beat) And your carbuncled father! 
Jonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen or so other prisoners. 
ESSEX (O.S.) People taxed to the point of starvation, Spain running the New World, open revolt in Ireland, Catholic plots everywhere you turn... 
CUT TO: 
18   INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                        18 
Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will learn, very ambitious. 
ESSEX ...and how do the Cecils spend their time and energy? Shutting a theater! A theater, for god's sake? It's madness! No wonder the mob hates them so! 
The court is inside, and slightly different from today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat like racquet-ball. 
Oxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot, but it goes-- 
OXFORD Out! 
Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton prepares to serve. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) (to Southampton) Henry, how many people were at that play? 
pg. 17 
Southampton pauses before serving. 
SOUTHAMPTON Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand, maybe more. 
Southampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated rally begins. 
OXFORD And how many performances are there of a play like that? 
SOUTHAMPTON Five or six I suppose. 
He HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it. 
ESSEX By the--! 
OXFORD (to Essex) So! Ten thousand souls. All listening to the writings of one man-- the ideas of one man. That's power, Robert. And if there is one thing the Cecils understand, it's power. 
ESSEX (snorts) And when did words ever win a kingdom? I think I'll keep my sword, thank you very much. 
Southampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essex's naivet√©. 
19   INT. CHANGING ROOMS/ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                      19 
Southampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis clothes and into their normal clothes, assisted by two valets. 
ESSEX (to the valets) Leave us. (they exit) Henry... Some of my men have... intercepted... some of William Cecil's recent correspondence with King James of Scotland... 
pg. 18 
Southampton pauses in clothing himself.   This is serious. 
ESSEX (CONT'D) Cecil's all but promising him the throne... 
SOUTHAMPTON To James?   Elizabeth would never agree to- 
ESSEX Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even recognize me. And yet, still she refuses to name an heir. 
SOUTHAMPTON But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne? 
A FOOTMAN clears his throat and-- 
FOOTMAN By the grace of god, her majesty, Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and Ireland! 
DOUBLE DOORS 
open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a wide collar. 
She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her (Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being all the more regal, all the more un-human. 
Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel- encrusted doublet. 
Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm. 
Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton-- 
ESSEX (to Elizabeth) Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord of Southampton has a gift for you. 
ELIZABETH (eyes sparkle) A gift? 
SOUTHAMPTON Yes, your grace, though not from me. 
Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room OPENS. 
A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music. 
pg. 23 
Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a smile of total jubilation crosses her face. 
Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified. 
ELIZABETH Are you this gift, my precious little man? 
DWARF No, no, my most majestic majesty. I am a free man. My gift is a play, majesty. 
ELIZABETH A play? 
The dwarf bows his assent. 
ROBERT CECIL (to the Dwarf) Plays are the work of the devil, born from a cesspool of plague, whoredom, thievery, fornication, and heresy. You may tell your master that her majesty-- 
ESSEX (interrupting) --Will gladly accept your gift. 
Robert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked. 
ESSEX (CONT'D) (to Elizabeth) Of course that is if you so desire, majesty. (to Robert Cecil) The choice is her majesty's to make, not yours. Is that not so Sir Robert? 
Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the political tides around her. Then-- 
ELIZABETH (to the dwarf) Comedy? Or tragedy? 
DWARF Comedy, majesty. 
ELIZABETH (delighted) A comedy! (MORE) pg. 24 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (beat) By whom? 
DWARF By... Anonymous, your majesty... 
ELIZABETH Anonymous...? (then) Oh, but I do so admire his verse... 
Elizabeth lets go of Essex, and offers her hand to the Dwarf, who smiles brightly. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Lead us to this gift. 
And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him. They exchange a knowing look as-- 
Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not happy with this turn of events as we hear-- 
"QUINCE" (O.S.) Bless thee, Bottom! Bless thee!      Thou art translated! 
CUT TO: 
23   EXT. THE GROUNDS AT CECIL HOUSE - NIGHT                          23 
Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage" surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides. 
"BOTTOM" I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can. 
Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a young woman. Essex is next to her. 
pg. 25 
ON STAGE 
Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man-- except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck hides behind a tree watching. 
"BOTTOM" (CONT'D) I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid. 
BACKSTAGE 
Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep emotion in him. 
ON STAGE 
"BOTTOM" (CONT'D) (sings) The ousel cock so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill-- 
Titania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur. 
"TITANIA" What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed? 
ELIZABETH 
strongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some memory in her. A pleasant memory. 
OXFORD 
watches, delighted by her reaction. 
FROM HIS POV 
Thirty-eight years later. The door SWEEPS open and a snoring, sleeping Jonson is awakened by-- 
GUARD (O.S.) Jonson!    Ben Jonson! 
The other prisoners make way as the guard approaches Jonson. The guard tosses a wax-sealed piece of parchment onto Jonson's lap. 
GUARD (CONT'D) You've been released. 
Jonson looks at it, confused. 
pg. 30 
GUARD (CONT'D) Got powerful friends, now, don't you? 
26A   EXT. A BOAT - RIVER THAMES - DAY                                26A 
Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO-- Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat of arms on its chest. 
The City of London is far in the distance. 
Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat for a moment before-- 
JONSON And who are you? 
Francesco just stares back. 
JONSON (CONT'D) And where are we going? 
Francesco is silent. 
WIDER 
The boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone. 
CUT TO: 
A RED ROSE 
as it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands.       We are: 
27    EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                                 27 
Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards him. 
Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17). 
Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand place. Jonson CLEARS his throat. 
JONSON My lord... 
pg. 31 
OXFORD The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of flowers, don't you think? 
JONSON It looks to me to have quite a number of thorns, my lord. 
OXFORD So it does.   So it does. 
JONSON I am told, my lord, that I owe my freedom to you. 
OXFORD That is true. And it was quite hard to come by. One does not cross my father-in-law lightly. 
Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) Lord William Cecil. I have the questionable distinction of being married to his only daughter. 
Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and Francesco to follow. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) It did, however, serve as helpful when I wrote to your jailers to release you in my father-in-law's name. 
Jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back to Anne. 
JONSON (in a panicked whisper) My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my release is not officially sanctioned? 
OXFORD Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it wasn't. (beat) But you are free, are you not? 
They have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne watches them as they disappear into the maze. 
pg. 32 
28   EXT. MAZE - DAY                                           28 
Oxford turns to Jonson. 
OXFORD I enjoyed your little comedy last week, Jonson. You have potential, great potential. 
JONSON Thank you, my lord. 
OXFORD But it's politics did seem to have quite an effect on the Tower. My father-in-law's men felt it quite seditious. 
JONSON Politics? My play had nothing to do with politics! It was just a simple comedy-- 
OXFORD That showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth, were it not for the cleverness of their servants. (beat) All art is political, Jonson. Otherwise it would just be decoration. And all artists have something to say, otherwise... they'd make shoes. And you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson? 
As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to his servant. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) (nods) Francesco. 
Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and opens it. 
JONSON A play, my lord? 
OXFORD One you shall stage Bankside. 
JONSON Stage? 
pg. 33 
OXFORD Under your name. 
JONSON My name, my lord? 
Finally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford (now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and his wife and daughter, Young ANNE (15). In front of them, lined up, are several men whom we will learn are TUTORS. 
Boy Robert Cecil doesn't move. 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) (to Young Oxford) I am sorry, my lord. But my son Robert prefers the company... of himself... 
Boy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his mother and sister. 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne. 
Young Anne curtsies. 
YOUNG ANNE I am sorry for your loss, my lord. The realm lost a great lord with your father's death. We hope you will be happy in our house-- 
BOY ROBERT CECIL (O.S.) Are you going to live here forever? 
Everybody turns and sees the odd hunchback child has finally come over. 
YOUNG OXFORD (smiles) No.    Only until I reach my maturity. 
BOY ROBERT CECIL Why? 
WILLIAM CECIL Because the Queen has bade it so. (to Young Oxford) My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of State. Both the Queen and I hope to make that so. (MORE) 
pg. 38 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) To that end, I have the honor of introducing you to your tutors. (indicates one of them) Seven to eight you shall be tutored in French by Mister Crane-- 
YOUNG OXFORD Monsieur. Ca me fait plaisir de vous connaitre. 
Master Crane bows his head. 
WILLIAM CECIL Nine to ten is Greek with Mister Simmons. 
YOUNG OXFORD (in Greek) Dalon, an d'ego, hoti mathamata ge esti ha trafo psychas. 
BOY ROBERT CECIL Is that Homer? 
YOUNG OXFORD (sharp) No.   Plato. 
Boy Robert frowns at the correction. 
WILLIAM CECIL (slight frown, then) And you know your uncle, Mister Golding, who has petitioned me to allow you to assist him in his translations of ancient Latin texts into English. 
YOUNG OXFORD (in Latin) Continetne, ut spero, Ovidii Metamorphose? Mihi honori erit, patrue 
Mister Golding bows his head in appreciation. 
WILLIAM CECIL Then cosmography with Doctor Richards. Two to three is geography and history, and four to five fencing. 
William Cecil seems to have finished. 
pg. 39 
YOUNG OXFORD (to William Cecil) And composition? Poetry? 
WILLIAM CECIL This is a Puritan home, your grace. We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God. 
YOUNG OXFORD A sin? But surely there must be room for beauty and art in life, my lord. 
WILLIAM CECIL Not in this household. 
33   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                         33 
Young Oxford is fencing with a tutor. He's quite good. In fact, he's better than the tutor, who is twice his age. 
Boy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess against himself. 
Young Oxford, with a fierce, beautifully executed attack, disarms his tutor. The tutor's sword FLIES into the air, and hits-- 
THE CHESS BOARD 
making the pieces scatter. 
WIDER 
Boy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see Young Oxford coming over to him. 
YOUNG OXFORD You were losing anyway. 
BOY ROBERT CECIL I was also winning. 
Young Oxford picks up the sword, throws it to his tutor, who catches it. 
BOY ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) You know I am going to one day succeed my father at the Queen's side. Not you. 
pg. 40 
Young Oxford motions to go, then picks up the black king, and tosses it to Boy Robert Cecil, who can't catch it because of his deformity. It CLANGS on the floor. 
YOUNG OXFORD Really? 
34   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           34 
Moments later, the Young Oxford heads down the hall alone, heading for his rooms, his sword still in his hand. 
CUT TO: 
POEMS 
neatly written on parchment.   We are: 
35   INT. CECIL HOUSE - YOUNG OXFORD'S ROOM - DAY               35 
And a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly stuffing them into a bag. 
But then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door-- he runs to it-- the door is locked! 
So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens, and Young Oxford enters. 
After a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss. Looks at his-- 
Elizabeth's wig is being glued into place. 
ELIZABETH Ireland? 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN (THEN INTERCUT EACH SIDE OF SCREEN AS NEEDED) 
William Cecil hasn't realized that his son Robert has sneaked in the room behind him to listen in. 
WILLIAM CECIL There are rumors of his sending financial aid, and even troops. We must act quickly. (beat) We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and send additional troops immediately, majesty. 
ELIZABETH Replace?   With whom? 
William Cecil hesitates slightly, then-- 
WILLIAM CECIL I would recommend the Earl of Essex, your majesty. 
ELIZABETH Essex?  To Ireland? (frowns) For how long? 
WILLIAM CECIL As long as the present crisis warrants, majesty. 
ELIZABETH Impossible. He cannot be spared. We feel his counsel is of greater import with each passing day. 
Not what William Cecil wanted to hear. 
WILLIAM CECIL I only recommend we send your most able subjects where they are most needed, majesty. (beat, a last-ditch effort) Philip of Spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you. (MORE) 
pg. 45 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) Of burning you at the stake as a heretic. Give him a foot-hold in Ireland, and-- 
ELIZABETH But Essex? 
WILLIAM CECIL Essex's martial abilities are, in my opinion, the only antidote to the plague of Philip. (clears his throat) Though, Essex would not, unfortunately, be able to remain in the Privy Council if he is in Ireland... 
ELIZABETH And who would you advise to replace him? 
Three ladies-in-waiting approach with three different gown. Elizabeth studies them as: 
WILLIAM CECIL Sir Robert Cecil. 
ELIZABETH Your son? 
WILLIAM CECIL He is my own advisor first, my son second, majesty. His counsel has been invaluable to me, and no doubt will be to you as well. 
Elizabeth points to one of the dresses, and waves the handmaidens away. 
ELIZABETH Yes, yes, yes. We will send Essex to Ireland and place Robert on my Privy Council. 
But William's flash of victory is dampened by-- 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I saw a play this last weekend, William. It made me think of... days long past. Of memories... long past. Long past. I should like to see more of them... Has Edward been happy, William? With your daughter? 
pg. 46 
William Cecil doesn't answer. Instead he thinks, remembers, as we hear his younger voice... 
WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.) Murdered! 
CUT TO: 
40   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                           40 
Thirty years earlier. 
William Cecil is standing in front of an enormous fireplace, pacing in a pique of anger. 
WILLIAM CECIL By your own hand! 
YOUNG OXFORD He was stealing my poems. 
WILLIAM CECIL He was doing my bidding! 
YOUNG OXFORD Yours? 
WILLIAM CECIL Of course. As soon as Robert informed me that you were disobeying my express-- 
YOUNG OXFORD Robert?   Robert told-- 
William Cecil SLAMS his fists on a table. 
WILLIAM CECIL Enough! Thou shalt not worship false idols in my household! Your everlasting soul hangs in the balance. Not poems. Your soul! 
YOUNG OXFORD My poems are my soul! 
William Cecil turns away in frustration as much as disgust. 
WILLIAM CECIL You have placed me in a grave position, Edward. (MORE) 
pg. 47 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) I cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part... No. I will not have it. We can claim self-defense, he drew sword first. (beat) But... I wish something in return. 
Young Oxford looks worried. 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) My daughter is young, impressionable. She has feelings for you, Edward. It is to be expected, living in such close quarters... 
YOUNG OXFORD Sir. For the last three years you have managed to seize much of my inheritance-- 
WILLIAM CECIL Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses. 
YOUNG OXFORD And now you suggest you be "reimbursed" the rest of my once considerable estates through your daughter's bed? 
William Cecil studies Young Oxford's face. 
WILLIAM CECIL No. This is how I suggest you keep your noble head from the executioner's block. 
YOUNG OXFORD 
stares at him.   The SOUND of CHURCH BELLS RINGING takes us to: 
41   INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                                41 
OXFORD I... don't know. 
SHAKESPEARE (O.S.) "Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene" 
53   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                    53 
Shakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge-- the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time, it is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost like a mall. 
Shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of "Romeo and Juliet" 
SHAKESPEARE "From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean." (no longer reading) Incredible!! The whole bloody thing in verse?! 
JONSON (nonchalant) It's really not that difficult, if you try. 
SHAKESPEARE And have you ever tried? 
Jonson gives him a sharp look, and pauses to pick some onions from a stand. 
Shakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples at the next stand. 
pg. 59 
SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) (performing for the Blonde) "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she." 
The Buxom Blonde smiles at Shakespeare seductively. 
SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) (to Jonson) I'll have little trouble parting the legs of barmaids after that performance! 
JONSON You can't play Romeo. 
Jonson leaves the stall, and continues down the street. Shakespeare hesitates, then gives the girl a dazzling smile. She smiles back, then Shakespeare runs after Jonson. 
SHAKESPEARE (to Jonson) Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer have another go at one of my roles. No-- only Will Shakespeare can pump the life into Romeo's veins. (grins at another passing girl) And his cod piece! (beat, desperate) Ben-- Ben! I'm an actor, every inch of me, down to my very toes... I want- - no, I need, crave-- to act. I can't just idle the day by with-- 
JONSON So bloody well act like a writer! And for God's sake, keep off the stage. Writers don't have time to act.

54   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  54 
A performance of "Romeo and Juliet". About a dozen actors are dancing. It is Act 1, Scene 5. "ROMEO", played by Spencer, is staring longingly at "Juliet". "Romeo" turns to his servant. 
"ROMEO" What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight? 
"SERVANT" I know not, sir. 
"ROMEO" O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! 
The actor playing Romeo plays to the women in the audience. And 
THE WOMEN 
respond, eye lashes twittering. 
THE WITS 
Watch in awe!   Now they're all taking swigs of ale. 
BACKSTAGE 
Shakespeare mouthing silently the lines of "Romeo". 
IN OXFORD'S BOX 
Oxford watches the dance carefully. 
"ROMEO" (CONT'D) Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

Twenty-eight years earlier. A dance is taking place. 
YOUNG OXFORD-- now 20 is dancing with Young Anne.     But his eyes are on: 
pg. 61 
Young Elizabeth, who is dancing with the Spanish AMBASSADOR. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH 
seems less than interested in her dancing partner.    She STARES intently back at Young Oxford. 
WIDER 
There is a natural change in the music, and all the dancers switch partners-- it's part of the dance. Young Oxford goes to Young Elizabeth, the Spanish Ambassador goes to Anne. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD 
stare into each others eyes as they dance the intricate moves. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH My lord of Oxford. 
Elizabeth smiles. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We liked your play tonight very much. Your young King Henry reminded us of you. 
OXFORD Did he? 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Rash, yet brave. A boy-- and yet a man. Fair on the eyes, fairer to the ear... 
WIDER 
Much of the Court is watching this.   They can tell there are sparks between them. 
All the dancers change partners, including Elizabeth and Oxford. A few dance moves, and Oxford once again finds himself with Elizabeth. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We are glad of your return from the continent. Two years is far too long to be without such excellent amusements. 
She's only teasing. 
YOUNG OXFORD Ah, but Puck would never fight for you in the Netherlands... 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (surprised, smiles) The Netherlands? 
But then she realizes he's serious, and the smile vanishes. 
YOUNG OXFORD Well, why not? It's an open secret on the continent that you support the rebels against Spain-- and that you are commissioning Englishmen to help their cause. Spain's loss is England's gain, is it not? 
Her eyes narrow as she studies his face. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Is this why you bedded me? For a commission? 
YOUNG OXFORD No.   No-- of course not--    I-- 
She stands, wrapped in her sheets, furious at the thought of once more being used. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Leave me.    Leave at once! 
A beat. 
YOUNG OXFORD Bess-- 
YOUNG ELIZABETH How dare you! How dare you!! I command you to leave my presence. 
pg. 66 
And she steps back, waiting for him to exit. 
Young Oxford stands... and starts to approach her... He's nude, his back to us. 
She steps back, a bit stunned by his impertinence.   He steps towards her as-- 
YOUNG OXFORD O Mistress mine, where are you roaming? O stay and hear... your true-love's coming, That can-- (looks up and down her body) --kiss both high and low... 
A bit stunned by his approach, she stumbles backwards on her sheets. 
YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) Trip no further, pretty sweeting.... 
But he's sexy... and naked. And spouting poetry.     She stops retreating and allows his approach. 
YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) Journeys end in lovers' meeting-- Every wise man's son doth know. 
A small smile escapes her lips. 
YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) What is love? 'tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present laughter; What's to come is still unsure: 
He starts to kiss her neck.   Cautiously at first.   But she likes it. 
YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) In delay there lies no plenty-- Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty, Youth's a stuff will not endure. 
She responds to him, melting from both his words and touch. They start to kiss deeply, passionately... And- 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (passionately) You will stay in England... And in... my chambers... 
pg. 67 
The flash of disappointment on Young Oxford's face about that last bit is tempered by Young Elizabeth's sheet falling to the floor. They begin to make love passionately once more. 
NASHE (O.S.) I could do it if I wanted to... 
61   INT. THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - DAY                             61 
Twenty-seven years later. Jonson, Marlowe, Dekker and Nashe sit silently at a table, mugs of ale in hand. Having just returned from "Romeo and Juliet", all are a bit in shock. The actors from the perfomance are there as well in the BG. 
MARLOWE (to Nashe) Do what? 
NASHE (a little drunk) A play in iambic, in iambic pen...in- bic-pentameter. It's not that hard. 
JONSON Think you so? Have you ever tried? 
NASHE Of course not. But I could if I wanted... 
DEKKER It wasn't all in verse. 
NASHE Ha!   See!   Even easier! 
Shakespeare enters and makes a bee line for them. 
SHAKESPEARE (excited) Henslowe wants "Romeo" to run a fortnight. (unbelievable news) A fortnight! Innkeeper! A round for everybody! Inkeeper!! (no response) Billy!!! 
And Shakespeare goes over to the bar. 
pg. 68 
NASHE A fortnight? 
DEKKER The maids love the romantic tragedies. 
MARLOWE Precisely why I avoid them. 
NASHE Aw, well. No worries. A one-trick pony. He'll never be able to do it again.

"TWELFTH NIGHT" 
Viola and Sebastian are reunited... 
"CAESAR" 
Caesar is attacked by Brutus, Cinna, Cassius, etc... 
"MACBETH" 
The witches are on stage. 
These three performances are INTER-CUT with: 
Marlowe walks towards the Tower of London. 
68A   INT. TOWER OF LONDON / POLE'S ROOM - DAY                     68A 
Silence....Marlowe is waiting patiently... 
He is sitting across from Pole, the Captain of the Guard, who is reading his report.... 
POLE (looks up) Are you certain of this? (almost confused) William Cecil was murdered? 
MARLOWE Not literally, of course. He was a character, a fictional character. But the metaphor was clear for anyone to see. And see, they did. 
Pole reads more from the parchment. 
MARLOWE (CONT'D) Will you shut it down? 
Pole continues to read. 
POLE That is not for me to decide... 
He brings out a pouch of coins, and tosses it across the table. 
POLE (CONT'D) Your service to his lordship is once again greatly appreciated. 
Marlowe takes the pouch of money.

ROBERT CECIL (O.S.) He butchered you! 
69   INT. CECIL HOUSE - WILLIAM CECIL'S STUDY - DAY             69 
Robert Cecil is furious, pacing back and forth in front of William Cecil, who sits behind a large wooden desk. 
William Cecil is pale and sweaty-- he is deathly ill, and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels attached to the legs-- sort of an Elizabethan wheelchair. 
ROBERT CECIL Not only in front of Court! But the entire City as well! We must arrest this Shakespeare and- 
WILLIAM CECIL No, Robert, think. If he is really as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob. No. We must strike at Edward directly. 
William Cecil slowly-- and shakily-- bends down from his chair as-- 
ROBERT CECIL But we cannot maintain our authority if the mob thinks us laughing stocks-- 
WILLIAM CECIL (angry) Our authority comes from Elizabeth and from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is the key to all. 
Robert Cecil looks hurt by his father's anger. 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) (gentler) Robert... You must think deeper. You must compensate. Compensate for your... malformations... with the gifts God did grant you... With cunning. With ruthlessness. 
William Ceci pushes a hidden button on the side of his desk-- a spring loaded secret drawer POPS open. Robert Cecil has never seen it before. 
Cecil produces a folded piece of parchment from the drawer, offers it to Robert Cecil. 
pg. 74 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) From King James of Scotland. 
Robert Cecil looks surprised. 
69A   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                 69A 
Robert Cecil is pushing William Cecil in his wheelchair. They are completely alone. 
WILLIAM CECIL James knows of the Queen's affection for Essex... and the rumors of his birth. He is justly concerned. (beat) You will reply to him. 
ROBERT CECIL I will reply to him? 
WILLIAM CECIL I am dying, Robert-- (before Robert can protest) We both know this to be true. And I will not witness the next coronation. 
69B   INT. CECIL HOUSE - WILLIAM CECIL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS       69B LATER 
Robert Cecil wheels his father in. 
WILLIAM CECIL Help me to my bed, my son. (Robert Cecil does so) If we are to secure your place at the side of the next king, you must get that king his throne, not I. 
A beat as this registers on Robert Cecil. 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) You will write to James that I am gravely ill, but that all is in hand. Much of the Privy Council has already secretly agreed to his ascension to the English throne due to your tireless, but secret, entreaties on his behalf. (beat) And then tell him Essex will not return from Ireland alive. 
pg. 75 
Robert Cecil looks surprised. 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) This is how kings are made, Robert. So it was with Elizabeth, and so it shall ever be. There were many rival claims to her throne, but none survived to make their claim. James must know that you will do the same for him, and he will reward you for it. (beat) But we must do one thing more... 
William Cecil has a coughing fit-- reaches for a glass vial of medicine at his bedside-- takes it. 
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) Like Essex, Edward must be removed. 
ROBERT CECIL (confused) Edward? 
William Cecil is slowly falling asleep... 
WILLIAM CECIL He uses the tools at his disposal, as we use the tools at ours. But ours will win... as they always have. 
ROBERT CECIL (more confused) I-- I don't understand, father.    What does Edward-- 
WILLIAM CECIL Edward seeks what we seek.   To choose the next King. 
Off Robert Cecil's surprised face we hear: 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.) I am with child...

Twenty seven years earlier. Young Elizabeth is pacing, terribly agitated. Bessie, the lady-in-waiting we have seen constantly at her side is the only other person present. 
pg. 76 
Jonson is stunned. 
MARLOWE (CONT'D) No? Oh, he can read well enough-- how else could he learn his lines? But the man never actually learned to form his letters. 
JONSON Why are you here, Kit? 
MARLOWE (smiles) So who did write it? You?   No.    You'd take credit for it. No... (MORE) 
pg. 80 
MARLOWE (CONT'D) It must be someone who wants their anonymity protected. Someone who might even pay to have it protected. 
Jonson is getting nervous. 
MARLOWE (CONT'D) A nobleman. 
Jonson looks up.   Marlowe smiles, knowing he is closer to the truth. 
MARLOWE (CONT'D) But which?    You know, don't you, Ben? 
JONSON You've had too much to drink, Kit. You're beginning to sound like one of your plays. 
Jonson stands and hurries out of the Tavern. 
73A   EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON    - MOMENTS LATER                      73A 
Jonson heads down the street, Marlowe chasing after him. 
MARLOWE Ben! Tell me. We can go to him together. Guarantee his anonymity... for a price. 
JONSON You reported on me as well, didn't you, Kit? Last year. That's why I was arrested, wasn't it? Because you went to the Tower? 
MARLOWE (lying) Ben, Ben... I had nothing to do with that. 
Jonson studies Marlowe for a beat and then walks away. 
MARLOWE (CONT'D) Ben-- I'll just go to Will! He'll tell me because he has so much more to lose than you. Fame. Fortune. And you'll profit nothing from it. Nothing! 
But Jonson is gone.

A military encampment with dozens of tents on a cliff by the Irish seaside.

Essex's tent is larger, and guarded. An OLD SERVANT carrying a tray with a silver pitcher approaches. A guard opens the tent for him to enter. 
INT. ESSEX'S TENT - CONTINUOUS 
Essex is having a Council of War with his generals and senior officers, including Southampton. They all stand around a table, consulting a map of Ireland. 
ESSEX (pointing) If the Rebels have stripped the northern borders... Then we must march south... and take Cahir Castle... 
The SERVANT stays in the background as he pours wine into various goblets. Southampton notices him-- the servant's hand shakes as he pours the wine. 
GENERAL (clears throat, uncomfortable) My lord. `Tis a well-defended fortress.    Two thousand men at least. We cannot-- 
Southampton notices the Servant's shaking hand slipping into a pocket as-- 
ESSEX So what would you have me do? Spend the entire spring encamped? I am sent to Ireland to end this infernal rebellion, not idle my days with-- 
SOUTHAMPTON Robert! 
In an instant Southampton draws a silver engraved pistol and SHOOTS the servant! 
Everyone is shocked-- but then we see:

THE SERVANT 
had drawn his own, small wooden pistol. 
ESSEX 
shares a look with Southampton.

To Establish. A foggy day. In the Foreground we see the maze. Oxford and his fencing master, BEAULIEU (20's) are in the center of the maze dueling with rapiers for exercise. 
CLOSER 
They wear outfits that are slightly more protective than ornamental. 
They duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES Beaulieu's shoulder. The speak entirely in French. 
BEAULIEU Point! 
Oxford backs off, as does the fencing master. 
OXFORD (in French) Bien. Faisons du travail... le Coup droit d'autorit√©? 
BEAULIE Mais oui, mon seigneur. 
OXFORD Bien.    En garde! 
And they once again begin to duel. But we quickly surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more aggressive than he was before. Oxford realizes it, but is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well. 
And then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward, and STABS Oxford in the leg. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) Qu'est ce que vous faites? 
But Oxford has little chance to react, because Beaulieu continues his attack. 
pg. 83 
OXFORD (CONT'D) Beaulieu?    Beaulieu?! 
MAN Release the dogs!   Release the dogs! 
Shakespeare shows no reaction. 
JONSON I know he went to see you last night, Will. And I know he was planning to expose you if you didn't agree to his terms. 
IN THE PIT 
The bear baiting begins. 
WIDER 
Shakespeare stares at Jonson. 
SHAKESPEARE (dead serious) You're mad, Ben. Kit was my friend. 
JONSON Be careful, Will. You kill me off too, and you won't have any good plays to act in after this is all done. 
Some of the spectators BOO while others CHEER, and-- 
SHAKESPEARE I'll have my guineas, Ben. One way or another, I'll have my guineas. 
And he gets up and leaves as the-- 
DOGS 
start to go for the bear's throat.     Thge cheering goes to a roar as we--

Jonson is waiting not far from him by a stand and drinks an ale. 
Then Oxford's servant, Francesco, appears. 
After the two men have exchanged couple of words, Francesco gives Jonson a leather folder containing a manuscript and a purse jingling with coin. Jonson takes them and leaves. 
Jonson safely gone, Shakespeare starts to follow Francesco who heads back over the bridge. 
78A   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DUSK                                 78A

Shakespeare is waiting, clearly uncomfortable. It's not the kind of room he's used to being in. He holds his wig and his nose. 
A door opens, and Oxford enters, walking on a stick because of his leg injury. He is followed by his servant, Francesco. 
OXFORD So! You are the famous Shakespeare whose labors I have enjoyed so much. I am at your service, sir. 
pg. 88 
Shakespeare is uncomfortable. He wasn't expecting Oxford himself. Then he just goes for it. 
SHAKESPEARE My lord-- I- I need more money. 
OXFORD (sharp) I beg your pardon? 
SHAKESPEARE My expenses have, ah, aggrandized... since this all began. 
OXFORD "Aggrandized"? 
SHAKESPEARE And if, if your lordship doesn't agree to an increase in my, ah, fee, I shall be forced to make certain... facts public. 
FRANCESCO Have you any idea to whom you are speaking? 
SHAKESPEARE I am addressing the writer of Hamlet... of Juliet and her Romeo.   Am I not? 
Oxford is silent. Francesco goes to physically eject Shakespeare from the room. 
FRANCESCO Out. Get out! How dare you insult my master in-- 
OXFORD Wait! (beat) How much? 
Shakespeare looks at Francesco, then Oxford. 
SHAKESPEARE Four hundred pounds. A year. 
FRANCESCO A year? 
OXFORD Pay him.

Francesco is shocked. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) (impatient, in Italian) Pagalo! 
Shakespeare smiles.

WILLIAM CECIL The other one? (realizing) Who told you?

Cecil is obviously annoyed by this development. 
YOUNG OXFORD I will go back to your daughter. I will make you as many grandchildren as she can bare... 
William Cecil thinks. 
YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) Or I can remain here... 
William Cecil decides. 
WILLIAM CECIL There is no record of his true birth, no trail that leads to you, or the... mother. His foster parents never knew the truth, and both are now dead... 
YOUNG OXFORD The name? 
WILLIAM CECIL Make even a hint of this to the child, or anyone else, and this agreement is void, and I'll see your head on the block within a fortnight. And the boy's as well. 
YOUNG OXFORD (excited) It's a boy...?

Young Oxford (cleaned up) is watching a BOY about five years old dueling with a tutor. The boy is quite good. 
The boy notices Young Oxford, and stops duelling. 
BOY Hello... 
YOUNG OXFORD Hello. 
Young Oxford smiles at the boy. 
YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) I'm Edward, the Earl of Oxford.

BOY My lord... 
The Boy bows, a serious expression on his face.

In the background we hear the Archbishop of Canterbury reading from the bible. 
ARCHBISHOP (O.S.) ... In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return to the earth: for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou return...

Robert Cecil steps into place right behind her. 
ELIZABETH We wish to recall Essex from Ireland... 
Robert Cecil is instantly concerned, but hides it well. They continue to walk. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We feel a terrible void, now that your father is no longer at our side... 
Robert Cecil bows his head as he walks. 
ROBERT CECIL A wise decision, your majesty. If nothing else, it will give him an opportunity to respond to all these rumors. 
Still walking, she turns to him sharply. 
ELIZABETH Rumors? 
ROBERT CECIL I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd heard. 
ELIZABETH Heard what? 
ROBERT CECIL Essex is in negotiations with Philip of Spain... 
ELIZABETH Peace is at hand. We know this. 
ROBERT CECIL Majesty-- it is said that Essex has promised Phillip all of Catholic Ireland in return for... 
He hesitates.

She turns to see Essex, shocked at his intrusion. 
Essex FREEZES.   He knows he has just made an enormous faux-pas. 
ESSEX Majesty, I, I... 
She stares at him, horrified to be seen in such a manner. The she regains her composure and-- 
ELIZABETH Get out!   Out!!!

ELIZABETH Who in God's name does he think he is? Abandoning his post without my leave! 
She begins to absent-mindedly unbutton the top of her bodice. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Coming into our presence in such a manner, neither announced nor invited, half his army in my courtyard. He's gone mad... mad! 
ROBERT CECIL No. Unfortunately for us, your majesty, he is quite sane. He simply believes he is your royal equal. 
She turns to him sharply, furious at the thought.

It looks like an armed camp, with part of Essex's army encamped in the front courtyard. The soldiers are all tense. 
Oxford, followed only by Francesco, rides into the courtyard. He is immediately surrounded by armed men, their muskets pointed at him. Oxford raises his hands. 
OXFORD I am Edward, Earl of Oxford. 
SOUTHAMPTON Edward!   Edward! Thank god you're here. 
Southampton comes towards him. 
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Elizabeth has revoked all of his royal licenses! She believes every lie Cecil tells about him. (seeing Oxford's wound) Edward? What happened to your leg?

Oxford, Southampton and Essex are alone. Oxford is sitting in a chair, while Essex paces impatiently, Southampton standing between them. 
ESSEX She won't accept my letters. I cannot get to her. Cecil plans to arrest me any day. I know it. (beat and more determined) But that won't be as easy as he thinks. 
OXFORD Fight him in London, and you only validate every rumor and lie Cecil has ever told about you. 
ESSEX Then what do you suggest I do? Let myself be arrested so I can be tried and executed for crimes I did not commit? 
OXFORD No. I will go to Elizabeth, myself, alone-- 
ESSEX How? Cecil won't let her see a letter without reading it first. 
OXFORD I won't send her a letter.   I will send her a book. 
Essex looks confused, but Oxford ignores it. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) She will call for me. And while I am with her, you will come-- not with an army, not with swords, but with her loyal subjects. The cobblers, the tinkers, the bricklayers of London. (MORE)

109   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DUSK         109 
Elizabeth is looking out the window. It's raining outside. She is NOT wearing her wig, not much make-up, and looks quite... odd. 
Robert Cecil enters. 
ELIZABETH (turns) You find me disgusting, don't you? Repugnant. Wrinkled? 
ROBERT CECIL You, you are the sun, majesty.   The glory of-- 
ELIZABETH Liar! 
Robert Cecil shuts his mouth. 
pg. 107 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Is it so hard to believe that once I was young? That I was... beautiful? Your father knew me as such... (beat) You have read the book? 
She doesn't have to say which one. Robert Cecil sees a copy of "Venus and Adonis" on a table. He NODS. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) He writes to me. To remind me of that beauty. That love. How I... took him. How I... adored him... 
Robert Cecil knows to be silent.   She looks out the window. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (throaty, sexually) Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry, Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie... 
She smiles seductively, transported in time. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I've been foolish. Proud. Yes. Too proud. Gloriana... The Virgin Queen... A statue. Bloodless. (beat) "Thou wast begot; to beget is thy duty. By law of nature thou art bound to breed, That thine may live when thou thyself art dead"... (beat) Your father told you of the child? 
A beat. 
ROBERT CECIL (hint of a smile) Which one, your majesty? 
Elizabeth's eyes flare in anger for an instant, then she regains composure. 
ELIZABETH His.   Mine.   He still lives? 
Robert Cecil nods. 
pg. 108 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) He was well placed? A nobleman? 
ROBERT CECIL (hesitates) Yes... your majesty. 
ELIZABETH Who? 
Robert Cecil hesitates. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I am your Queen! Now who is my son!!? 
ROBERT CECIL His grace, the Earl of... Southampton, your majesty. 
She seems surprised. Perhaps she was expecting Essex. But then she smiles, and NODS in approval. 
CECIL Majesty... You are not having doubts about James of Scotland succeeding you, are you? 
Elizabeth goes into a rage. 
ELIZABETH James?! He is the son of Mary! She plotted and schemed to steal the throne from under me! No son of hers will rule while a yet Tudor lives! 
Robert Cecil is surprised by her fury. He bows his head as Elizabeth tries to collect herself. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I will decide what is best for my kingdom! Not you! Not you!! (calmer) I have bid Edward to come to me on my return to London on Monday next. It is decided. 
She says no more, the audience over. Robert Cecil hesitates, and then she glares at him... He bows and exits, the fury on his face plain. 
Elizabeth looks at her own reflection in the window... 
pg. 109 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (sotto) And so, in spite of death, I shall survive, In that, my likeness still is left alive. 
CUT TO: 
110    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY                                   110 
Ben Jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. He stops for a moment when he sees the new Globe theater. Workers are still painting the walls. 
He pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a performance of "Richard III" on Monday next. 
110A   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                              110A 
Jonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new theater Shakespeare and Burbage have built. 
The actor Condell is on stage, rehearsing the character of "Gloucester". He walks on stage with a limp, and has a large hump on his back. He is a caricature of Robert Cecil. 
"GLOUCESTER" (in character) But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking-glass... 
Richard BURBAGE, the theater's stage manager, is watching his performance with Spencer and a group of actors. 
Jonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat. 
"GLOUCESTER" (CONT'D) (in character) I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time into this breathing world... 
SPENCER Good part, that... 
pg. 110 
"GLOUCESTER" ...and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them. (out of character) Is this wise? 
BURBAGE It's only the one performance.   Go on! 
"GLOUCESTER" I need a drink... 
And "Gloucester" heads backstage. 
JONSON (to Burbage) Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful! The best Bankside! But only one performance? Is it that bad? 
BURBAGE We have to turn `em away by the hundreds! Look! Never seen anything quite like it! 
And both men look out the curtains to the crowd outside. 
The theater is full to the last seat. The people are crammed together like sardines. 
118A    INT. OXFORD STONE - OXFORD'S ROOM - NIGHT                   118A 
Oxford is being dressed in front of a mirror...    His finest clothes... Powder to face... 
Francesco assists him. 
118AA   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - THE GALLERIES - DAY             118AA 
Jonson is leaning against the edge of the balustrade, watching the Groundlings fill in. He bites his nails nervous. 
Nashe joins him as-- 
NASHE So! I heard the Earl of Essex paid for this whole performance! Man's never even been to the theater, and still he's heard of Will-- 
Dekker also joins them. 
DEKKER Essex!? Impossible. My cousin's one of his men-at-arms. Hasn't been paid in weeks. They're all just sitting there, waiting. 
JONSON Waiting?     Waiting for what? 
DEKKER Wants to have an audience with the Queen. As if Cecil would ever let Essex near her now. 
NASHE By the mass, Cecil in favor, Essex out! Who can keep up with it all!? (takes a swig) (MORE) pg. 115 
NASHE (CONT'D) Zounds, I tire of politics, politics, politics. 
119   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAY                                   119 
Oxford is in a long-boat, headed for Whitehall Palace. The oars of the boat cut neatly and silently into the water. 
120   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY         120 
Elizabeth is doing her toilette. She seems excited like a school girl before her first date. Her Ladies in waiting are attending to her. 
121   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                                  121 
The audience HUSHES as-- 
ON STAGE 
"GLOUCESTER", the future Richard III, enters. He is hunch-backed, and looks as much like Robert Cecil as possible in terms of beard and costume. First the people are in stunned silence, but then like magic the hissing starts. It is followed by more hissing and the first boos. 
The actor playing Gloucester nervously looks around... 
IN THE GALLERIES 
Dekker seems surprised at the similarity to Robert Cecil. 
DEKKER (to Nashe) Tired of politics are you? Seems you picked the wrong day to come to the theater, then... 
Jonson gives Dekker a sharp look.   What's going on here? 
ON STAGE 
"Gloucester" addresses the audience. 
"GLOUCESTER" Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York. Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front.... 
pg. 116 
The hissing and booing has swelled so strong that the actor stops for a moment. But then he finds the courage again to continue. 
Jonson looks down at the Groundling's reaction, and spots-- 
FRANCESCO 
in the audience. But among the Groundlings, not in Oxford's usual box seat. 
JONSON 
looks over to Oxford's box.   It's empty. 
"GLOUCESTER" ...and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking- glass... 
122   OMIT                                                           122 
123   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - ROBERT CECIL'S ROOM - DAY              123 
Robert Cecil watches himself in a mirror as armor is placed on him by servants. 
"GLOUCESTER" (O.S.) I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time into this breathing world,.... 
124   EXT. BANKSIDE - IN FRONT OF THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY            124 
The huge crowd has stayed in front of the Globe. It seems they are waiting for something. We hear hissing and booing from the crowd inside the theater. 
"GLOUCESTER" ...and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them. 
pg. 117 
125   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                                  125 
On stage, "Gloucester: continues despite the concert of hissing and booing... 
"GLOUCESTER" And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, I am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days... 
126   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                        126 
Essex mounts his horse, Southampton at his side. Their sixty or so men behind them ready for the march to Elizabeth. 
ESSEX Edward knows what he is doing...      Does he not? 
SOUTHAMPTON He promised us a mob. They'll be here. 
Essex looks concerned, but says no more. 
A shop-owner comes out of his store, confused.   Another MAN grabs him. 
MAN To Essex!   And then to the Queen! (joins in the chanting) Ess-ex! Ess-ex! 
The shop-owner begins to get the spirit of the mob. 
135   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                    135 
If anything, the crowd is twice the size it was moments ago. They head down the shop-lined bridge, full of bravado. 
pg. 121 
JONSON 
is in the middle of the uncontrolled mob.   He spots Francesco nearby. 
WIDER 
The mob has to slow down on the bridge. There is not much room. And then it happens! 
We are at the front of the mob, when the first soldiers appear and pull down the tarps revealing the cannons. 
People scream as an Officer appears and-- 
OFFICER Fire! 
And then the cannon FIRES. There is PANIC all around, and- 
JONSON 
runs with the crowd, trying to escape. 
137   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                     137 
Essex and Southampton look tense.   They expected a mob here by now. 
SOUTHAMPTON They should be here by now... 
Essex frowns. 
ESSEX We go as we are! Now!! 
And he spurs his horse, and GALLOPS down the street. 
ESSEX (CONT'D) To the Queen! 
Southampton has no choice, and follows.   So do the 60 or so men behind them. 
136   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY                      136 
Oxford hears a cannon shot. But it could also be the sound of thunder. He goes to the window, sees the rain clouds, and dismisses the sound. A LADY IN WAITING enters. 
pg. 122 
LADY-IN-WAITING My lord.    Her majesty will be with you shortly. 
138   Omitted                                                        138 
139   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                       139 
The mob is in panic.      And-- 
JONSON 
is in the middle of it. 
FRANCESCO Signor Jonson! We are betrayed!    Run! Run! 
Jonson looks on in horror as Francesco is KILLED by a soldier wielding a pike. 
140   EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                        140 
Essex and his men ROAR past the token guards at the front gate, and gallop into the-- 
MAIN COURTYARD 
Essex rears his horse, looks around at the many windows that surround them from above. 
ESSEX To the Queen! To the Queen! 
His men repeat his plea.      And then, once again, another trap springs. 
THE GATE 
SLAMS closed.    And-- 
GUARDS ARMED WITH MUSKETS 
line up in a colonnade in the story above.      Pole is in command. 
POLE Take your aim! 
SOUTHAMPTON 
realizes-- 
pg. 123 
SOUTHAMPTON It's a trap! 
ESSEX Spread out! 
But before his men can obey-- 
IN THE COLONNADE 
Pole orders-- 
POLE Fire!! 
IN THE COURTYARD 
ANNE (CONT'D) (to Jonson) You will leave at once. My husband is quite ill-- 
JONSON It was your husband who sent for me, madam. 
ANNE And I am dismissing you-- 
A SECOND DOCTOR exits the sick man's room. 
SECOND DOCTOR Are you Jonson? 
Jonson nods. 
SECOND DOCTOR (CONT'D) He's asking for you. 
JONSON Excuse me, your grace. 
CUT TO: 
157   INT. OXFORD STONE - OXFORD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS           157 
Oxford, in bed, looks quite ill, sweat covering his brow. 
He furiously writes on a small tablet on his lap. He holds up his hand for silence as Jonson enters, the doctor following behind him. 
OXFORD Thank you, doctor. 
The doctor exits. 
pg. 135 
OXFORD (CONT'D) Come over here, Jonson... 
He points to a chair by the bed. When Jonson sits down he notices a big pile of manuscripts by the side of the bed. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) Did you know, Jonson, that my family can trace its peerage farther back than any family in the kingdom?   We fought at Crecy. At Bosworth Field. At Agincourt. (beat) I inherited my Earldom as one of the wealthiest men ever to breathe English air... and at last breath, I shall be one of the poorest. 
Jonson looks on sadly. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) Never a voice in government. Never a sword raised in glorious battle. No immortal deeds for my heirs to know me by. (beat) Words, merely words, are to be my legacy... (beat) You alone watch my plays and know them as mine. When I hear the applause, the cheering, of the audience, all those hands clapping, they are celebrating... another man. But in that cacophony of sounds, I strained to hear the sound of two hands only. Yours. (beat) But heard them, I never did. 
Jonson stares at him. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) Death takes away all pretense and demands honesty from its target. You, you have never told me... never told me what you thought of my work... 
To answer is not an easy task for Jonson's ego.    He hesitates. 
pg. 136 
JONSON (almost a whisper) I find... your words... the most wondrous ever heard on our stage.    On any stage... Ever. 
The two men now looking each other in the eye. 
JONSON (CONT'D) (sotto) You are the soul of the age... 
Oxford smiles at the thought of it.   Then-- 
OXFORD Promise me... promise me, Jonson, that you will keep our secret safe. That you won't expose Shakespeare... 
JONSON My lord? 
OXFORD I have seen it in your face... He vexes you. How could he not? But he is not your burden. He is mine. 
Then he nods to the manuscripts by his side. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) All my writings. The plays, the sonnets... Keep them safe. Keep them from my family. From the Cecil's. Wait a few years, and then, publish them. 
Jonson looks stricken. 
JONSON I am not worthy of this charge, my lord. I... I betrayed you... I told them of your-- 
OXFORD I have made it my life to know the character of men, Jonson. I know you. You may have betrayed me, but you will never betray my words... 
He puts the last manuscript on the pile. 
Jonson looks at the-- 
pg. 137 
FRONT PAGE 
Which reads "DEDICATION", then more words, starting with: 
"To the Earl of Southampton" 
158   INT. OXFORD STONE - OUTSIDE OXFORD'S BEDROOM - DUSK             158 
Jonson leaves Oxford's room, visibly shaken.    The manuscripts are under his arm. 
Anne, Oxford's wife is still there, surround by doctors. 
Then she sees Jonson leaving. 
ANNE Get out! You, your friends, your blasphemous theaters, have brought nothing but ruin and dishonor to this family. 
JONSON Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your family, me, even Elizabeth herself shall be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper. 
He turns and exits. 
CUT TO: 
159   EXT. OXFORD STONE - DUSK                                        159 
Jonson exits the building and walks away. He reads the dedication on the first page of the manuscript as he walks. 
JONSON (V.O.) To the Earl of Southampton. The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end; whereof this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety. 
Jonson freezes, and looks back at Oxford's house, realizing there is another whole layer to all this; exactly what he can only guess.

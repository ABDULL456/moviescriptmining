Rain. Lashing a windowpane. A PIANO PLAYS somewhere off screen. Beethoven's Fur Elise. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY 
A little boy gazes out into the storm. Nervous, eager, sweet. Meet GEORGE DENBROUGH (9). 
GEORGE You sure it's not too bad out there? 
Will (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of newspaper. HEADLINES and TOYS   tell us this is the late 80's -- October, 1987 to be exact. He   puts finishing touches on 
A PAPER BOAT 
WILL Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I weren't dying. Now get the paraffin. 
GEORGE In the cellar? 
WILL You want it to float or not, Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna last forever. 
GEORGE Okay, Willy. 
George jumps up obediently and goes. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: 
OCTOBER 1987 
INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY 
George hurries downstairs. He catches a glimpse of their mother, SHARON DENBROUGH (30s) in the parlor playing piano, an earthy beauty transported to another world while she plays. 
INT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY 
George's stomach sinks as he comes face to face with THE CELLAR DOOR -- the only thing between George and the monster in the basement of his imagination -- IT. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS next to Will. The sarcastic walkie- talkie filtered voice of RICHIE "TRASHMOUTH" TOZIER (12), his neighbor, filters through the plastic speaker. 
RICHIE (WALKIE-TALKIE FILTERED) Willy-boy. 
Will, annoyed, picks up the walkie-talkie.   While looking through his rain blasted window. 
WILL Trashmouth. 
They wave at each other. Richie, bug-eyed glasses, turns the wave into a middle-finger. 
RICHIE (O.S.) Thought you were sick. 
WILL I am. 
RICHIE (O.S.) Is it mortal? 
INT. CELLAR DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Flinging it open, George ventures his arm into the DARK VOID. He gropes around and finds the LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. George snatches his arm back. 
GEORGE Oh, balls. The power. 
The dark basement glares back at him, taunting. 
HERE WE DO SOME SORT OF CALL FROM WILL UPSTAIRS THAT IS A "CODE" THEY DO WITH EACH OTHER. THIS WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT US LATER. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
GEORGIE RESPONDS WITH HIS OWN CALL FROM DOWNSTAIRS 
RICHIE (O.S.) What was that? 
Will coughs hard into a tissue. Half-impatient, half-joking: 
WILL Nothing. Georgie and I are making a paper boat. Got to go- 
RICHIE Wait-! 
Will turns off the walkie-talkie. 
INT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
George rubs the gooseflesh on his arms. 
GEORGE (TO HIMSELF) I'm getting it. I'm going to get it. I'm going in. I'm... 
He steels himself and plunges into the void. 
INT. CELLAR - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
George scrambles down four steps to THE CELLAR SHELF and sifts through junk as fast as he can: SHOE-POLISH, RAGS, a dusty bag of colored BALLOONS, a broken FLASHLIGHT, two mostly empty bottles of WINDEX, and an old can of TURTLE WAX. 
SEVERAL multi-acre, manure filled sheep pens stand empty. One has 50 sheep ready for slaughter, a path leading from the pen grows narrower as it feeds into an industrial complex designed for slaughter. 
EXT. HANLON ABATTOIR, OUTDOOR PEN - DAY 
LEROY HANLON (50s) works to move the sheep into line while his son MIKE HANLON (13) watches from behind him. 
LEROY Open the gate. 
MIKE I'm sick of this, dad. 
LEROY People need to eat.   Now open the gate. 
Mike opens the gate. 
MIKE How would you feel if you were one of them? 
Leroy, haunted by this thought answers gruffly- 
LEROY Humans aren't raised to be food. 
As if he were lying, that humans sometimes ARE raised for food. 
The sheep flood into a thinner pathway leading to the interior of the complex. Leroy watches them as does Mike. 
MIKE Everyday, watching them stupidly walk into that killing pen. This isn't a normal kid's life. You won't even let me go to school. 
INT. HANLON ABATOIR, SLAUGHTER PEN - DAY 
Leroy takes the cattle bolt, places it on the head of the first sheep. WOOMPH. The sheep drops dead. 
LEROY Now why would you want to be in public school with the rest of those people down below, in Derry? 
He hands it to Mike, expectantly. Mike dispassionately takes the mechanism and approaches a sheep. 
MIKE Because I want to be in boring classes with other boring kids and draw pictures in text books and play baseball and go to dances and grind. 
He places it on the head of the next sheep, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. 
Leroy does it for him.   WOOMPH.   The sheep drops dead. 
LEROY I know, son. I get it. But you aren't like those people. We may work with sheep, but those people are sheep. Trust me. 
The last point Leroy believes in like gospel. 
A SCHOOL BELL RINGS 
EXT. DERRY MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY 
Doors fling open and ROWDY 6TH, 7TH, and 8TH GRADERS spill out. Books are hurled in the trash, papers strewn all over the recess yard -- summer is officially commenced. 
Swept up among this madness is... 
WILL DENBROUGH (13) 
Handsome, gangly, red-headed, the memory of his brother still fresh. He walks with his dorky friends, all talking over each other: EDDIE KASPBRAK, his EPI-PEN JR. (an adrenaline injector for kids with life-threatening allergies) holstered in his medicine-filled fannypack; STAN URIS (12), a trim and tidy Jewish kid who dresses like a mini-accountant; and RICHIE TOZIER, the neighbor with the walkie-talkie, a comic book and video game freak with bug-eye glasses. 
EDDIE So how's it work? 
STAN                           RICHIE What work?                        So long suckas! 
Richie flips off the school. 
WILL Richie! 
EDDIE The ceremony. Your Bar Mitzvah. 
WILL It makes you officially a man right? 
STAN                             RICHIE Kind of. I read verses. From      Then a seventh dimensional the Torah.                        door opens up and Stan here has to slay his Ronin master over a pit of death. He wins his schlong grows like six inches. 
STAN Shit, I don't need a Bar Mitzvah for that. 
Richie howls. 
WILL Just your mom's Cosmo. 
EDDIE Marie Claire. 
RICHIE Vogue man. It's all perfumed. I put on my 3-D glasses and it's like you're there. 
Richie "motor boats" the air in front of him. 
ANGLE on a GROUP OF fashionably dressed GIRLS NEARBY. The bigger, heavier one of the group notices someone off screen. 
GIRL #1 There's the ho-bag, now. 
PAN to see BEVERLY MARSH (13) a dazzling cloud of auburn hair and lovely green-gray eyes. Her clothes aren't as nice as the group of popular girls, but she holds her head high. 
GIRL #2 She's the one all the eighth grade boys talk about. 
GIRL #1                     GIRL #1 (CONT'D) They say she gives the best     Probably the only way she can bjs.                            afford those rags she wears. Give me your rings, Gretta. 
Beverly sees the girls as Girl #1 puts Gretta's rings on her fingers. Sensing trouble, she turns around and ducks right back into school. 
GIRL #1 Hey cock breath, come here! 
PAN back to WILL and his dorky friends.   Eddie stops dead, POINTING TO- 
EDDIE Jesus, she's still here? 
The RABBI'S WIFE, sleepless and desperate, lurks on the edge of school property, scanning the throngs of departing kids with desperate eyes. Next to her, a FRONT LAWN MARQUEE reads: 
REMEMBER THE CURFEW. 7 P.M. DERRY POLICE DEPARTMENT 
Growing accustomed to his parent's lack of communication, he sifts through a PILE OF UNOPENED MAIL on the dining table and finds his report card. Opens it. All A's. 
WILL (CONT'D) I got my report card. 
He holds the paper limply in his hands. She doesn't acknowledge him and instead gets up and slides the doors shut to the piano room. 
INT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - DAY 
Eddie, Richie, Will, and Stan scramble in the front door like feral animals. An enormous 300-pound woman sits in the living room doing a puzzle on her own stomach. SONIA KASPBRAK (40s). 
EDDIE Hi Mom. 
WILL Mrs. Kaspbrak. 
RICHIE Ma'am. 
INT. EDDIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
They raid the kitchen, stuffing Capri Suns, Ding Dongs, whatever snacks they can find into their backpacks. Mrs. Kaspbrak calls from the room. 
MRS. KASPBRAK Eddie-bear, where are you boys off to? 
RICHIE Eddie-bear? 
Will elbows him. 
WILL Just my backyard, Mrs. K. We got a new, uh, badminton set. 
MRS. KASPBRAK Okay. Just don't go rolling around too much on that grass, sweetie. Especially if it's just been cut. You know how your allergies get. 
EDDIE Yes, ma. 
MRS. KASPBRAK Isn't he cute, boys? So cute. 
She wiggles her fat toes at him. He's mortified. 
WILL Cutest boy we know, Mrs. Kaspbrak. 
RICHIE The Miss America of cute boys. Seriously. 
EDDIE Bye ma. 
Fast as they came the boys blow out the front door. 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF LIBRARY - DAY 
Will, Rich, and Eddie speed past the library. 
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 
All green globes, curving iron staircases, and shadowy charm. A librarian, MRS. STARRET (50s) places a stack of books in front of Ben. 
MRS. STARRET Isn't it summer vacation? I would think you'd be ready to take a break from the books. 
BEN I like it in here. It's-- 
He glances at a newspaper behind her: "BODY FOUND NEAR CANAL NOT THAT OF COEN YOUTH, BORTON ANNOUNCES." Safe. 
BEN (CONT'D) Inspiring. 
Mrs. Starret smiles sweetly at this large boy. 
MRS. STARRET Well, even with all this terrible disappearing of kids business, a boy should be with his friends, outside, having fun. 
She starts stamping his books.      CHUCHUNP. 
BEN (EMBARRASSED) I'll try, Mrs. Starret. 
CHUCHUNP.   CHUCHUMP. 
MRS. STARRET What are all these for anyway? 
CHUCHUMP. 
BEN I'm reading about the history of this place. You know how many spooky things have-- 
ONE-ARMED OLD MAN Excuse me, miss? 
A ONE-ARMED OLD MAN comes up behind them wearing a U.S.S. Indianapolis cap. 
ONE-ARMED OLD MAN (CONT'D) Where's the children's section? 
CHUCHUMP.   Mrs. Starret slides Ben his stack of books. 
INT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Beverly opens her fridge. There's nothing in it but a plastic jug of margarine, some half-molded white bread, and suspect milk. She sniffs the milk. 
INT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Beverly sips the milk, leaving a wholesome white mustache on her upper lip. She looks up to see... 
Her Mother, MRS. MARSH (30s), a former prom queen long since faded, watching her. Studying her. 
MRS. MARSH Bev. 
BEVERLY Yeah, Mommy? 
Mrs. Marsh sounds like she might be on sedatives. 
MRS. MARSH You had your monthly, yet? 
BEVERLY What Mommy? 
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 
Ben sits at a table of six by himself, flipping through books on DERRY'S HISTORY. 
INDIANS, COLONIZATION, DISAPPEARING SETTLEMENTS, LOGGING, MURDERS, MASSACRES, it gets more and more violent. Glancing up, he sees... 
The one-armed old man plunk a NICKEL into a jar and take a STAMPED POST CARD from a tray by the door. A poster there READS: 
LIBRARIES ARE FOR WRITING TOO. WHY NOT WRITE A FRIEND TODAY? 
EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER 
Ben sits on the steps, POSTCARD in his lap. He clicks a pen open and, brow furled in concentration, dashes off a HAIKU. 
BEN (whispering it outloud) Your hair is winter fire, JANUARY EMBERS My heart burns there, too. 
EXT. CANAL STREET - LATER 
Ben is about to the drop the postcard into a MAILBOX when has second thoughts. He holds it just over the slot. We see that it's addressed to: MISS BEVERLY MARSH, LOWER MAIN STREET, DERRY MAINE, ZONE 2. Ben closes his eyes, steels his courage 
AND LETS GO. 
TRAVIS (O.C.) Hello hot tits. 
Travis, Snatch, Hockstettler, and Victor prowl toward him. Ben bolts, ass swinging back and forth like a girl. Travis and his gang take off after him... 
EXT. KANSAS STREET - CONTINUOUS 
It's no contest. Ben rounds the corner and just makes THE KISSING BRIDGE, a historic covered wooden bridge carved with thousands of hearts crossing right where the canal turns into the wild, untamed barrens, KENDUSKAEG STREAM rushing below. 
TRAVIS Gotcha! 
They snag Ben and fling him against the railing. Travis flips up his sweatshirt, exposing his fat belly, and slaps it hard. Ben screams like a rabbit, whipsawing back and forth. 
SNATCH Look at that gut! 
VICTOR Sounds like a pig. Don't he sound just like a pig? 
Victor SQUEALS like a pig in Ben's face. 
BEN You better quit, I swear. 
Travis pulls a BUCK KNIFE from his jeans. Ben's eyes go wide. 
TRAVIS Or what? You'll go crying to mama? I'll give you something to cry about. 
Ben looks around for help. A CAR comes slowly down the street. Travis hides the knife, pressing its steel against Ben's white belly. 
TRAVIS (CONT'D) Go ahead. Yell. You'll be picking your fucking intestines off your sneakers. 
The OLD COUPLE behind the wheel CATCH EYES WITH BEN, see his tears, and STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR. Ben sees A CLOWN riding in the back seat, grinning -- PENNYWISE. 
TRAVIS (CONT'D) Okay, tits. It's exam time. First question: when I say `Let me copy' during finals what do you say? 
BEN Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you want! 
TRAVIS That's good. Now how can we make sure that sticks? 
BEN I DON'T-- 
In two quick motions Travis SLASHES A BRIGHT RED "T" in Ben's belly. 
Snatch and Victor laugh.    Hockstettler pulls out his lighter and a can of hairspray. 
HOCKSTETTLER Let me light his head on fire like Michael Jackson. 
Hockstettler jettisons a fireball with his make-shift flame thrower, just past Ben's head. 
TRAVIS No! Hold him. I'm gonna carve my entire name on his cottage cheese filled ass. 
Ben is too shocked to scream. He looks over his shoulder at the stream behind him, then back at Travis's bloody blade. 
TRAVIS (CONT'D) Now say it with me. What comes after T? 
Ben plants his heel in Travis's chest and launches himself backward over the railing, out of the grip of Victor and Snatch. Travis is knocked back on his ass onto the pavement. 
EXT. KENDUSKAEG STREAM - CONTINUOUS 
Ben tumbles down the culvert, fetching up hard against a fallen tree. He picks himself up, eye to eye with 
A HUB CAP 
TRAVIS Oh, you're dead, tits. 
Travis comes leaping over the railing with the knife, Victor and Snatch right behind. Ben grabs the hub cap and HURLS IT 
PELTING Travis IN THE FACE 
Travis trips up, taking down Victor and Snatch with him. They all splash down in the stream, where Travis LOSES THE KNIFE. 
Ben darts off across the water into a thicket of woods. 
THE BARRENS 
Travis gropes around for his lost knife, suddenly hysterical. 
TRAVIS (CONT'D) My knife, Goddamn it! I lost my daddy's knife! 
Victor and Snatch help Travis search the stream, their hands passing right by where the BLADE IS WEDGED UNDER A LOG. 
EXT. THE BARRENS - DAY 
Another boy's hand fishes around under water and grasps upon something. ON Will as he PULLS OUT A SNEAKER. Behind him... 
RICHIE Heads up, homeschool! 
MIKE Eat me, townie! 
EXT. KISSING BRIDGE - DAY 
Travis, Snatch, Victor, and Hockstettler are still looking for the knife in the water under the bridge. 
SNATCH It probably got washed away, Travis. 
Travis grabs Victor by his collar and growls in his face. 
TRAVIS It ain't been washed away.     It's been stolen. 
VICTOR Stolen, by who? 
Travis points up the embankment at Mike, biking home over the bridge. 
TRAVIS That nigger right there. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 
Mike bikes home, sucking on the lollypop, when he notices something coming up fast behind him. 
TRAVIS and his boys in a beat up Trans Am. 
He starts peddling faster. Sees the KITCHENER IRONWORKS sign ahead and skids right down its path towards the ghostly titanic ruin. 
EXT. FIELD - KITCHENER IRONWORKS - DAY 
Mike looks around for a place to hide, a bird spooking off from the twisted carcass of the factory building. The Penobscot River flows behind. 
Travis and his boys skid to a stop in the field, machinery blocks their pursuit by car so they jump out on foot. 
Mike finds a SMOKESTACK laying in shattered sections in the grass. He stares into its big black bore, picks up a loose tile, and pitches it in. It lands with a faint echo in the darkness. 
INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS - MOMENTS LATER 
Travis, Snatch, Victor and Hockstettler search for Mike in the SKELETAL REMAINS of the old ironworks structure itself, an open wound of twisted iron beams. 
Oblivious to any danger other than their own volatile potential, we get a sense that around every corner, some ominous figure is just ducking out of sight. 
Mike clocks them from inside the smokestack, the dodges around the perimeter of the ironworks structure. 
He nears the CELLAR HOLD, a yawning chasm on the edge of the ruins. Sees a Derry Historical Society PLAQUE: 
ON THESE PREMISES AN EXPLOSION TOOK THE LIVES OF 102 SOULS (88 CHILDREN) EASTER SUNDAY, 1906. MAY THEY REST IN PEACE 
PENNYWISE appears across the cellar hold OVER HIS SHOULDER. When Mike looks up from reading Pennywise IS GONE. 
Mike looks back across the weedy field to THE FENCE, his bike still leaned against it. It seems a million miles off. 
EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Travis and the boys continue to explore the far side of the factory, sensing Mike may have made a run for the river. 
INT./EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Sensing an opportunity, Mike books it back to his bike. 
INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Hockstettler notices something off screen.    Walks towards it. 
Following Hockstettler we see what he sees: a lone BALLOON, as if just leaving the grasp of a child, floating up in the air. 
HOCKSTETTLER What the fuh... 
He looks back at Travis and the others, who are sniffing out the weeds near the river. 
EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Mike gets to his bike and starts pushing it up the hill. He looks back towards the factory. Travis and his boys still haven't come back to their car. Mike pedals home. 
INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Travis, angry they didn't find Mike huffs back across the field, throwing a piece of scrap pipe he found against a giant corrugated wall. The entire factory vibrates with the gonging sound. 
TRAVIS Let's go! That jungle monkey ain't here no more. 
Travis walks obliviously past AN EASTER EGG, smeared with bloody fingerprints, but Hockstettler sees it, picks it up. 
HOCKSTETTLER I'm staying. 
The three of them turn towards Hockstettler like he's insane. 
TRAVIS Why? 
HOCKSTETTLER I don't know. (LAUGHING) I want to see its insides. 
He points towards the door leading to the dark innards of the factory. 
HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D) You guys want to come? 
TRAVIS (DISGUSTED) Why the- Hell no. You mental? This place gives me the creeps. 
EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS 
Travis and the others load up and peel off in their car. 
Hockstettler watches them leave, a cloud of dust in their place, then turns towards the darkest parts of the factory, as if pulled deeper into the core unconsciously. 
ANGLE OVER CELLAR HOLD, Hockstettler peers in.   He grabs a handhold and sways over its cavernous depth. 
WILL Oh no. Eddie! Eddie! 
BEVERLY I knew I shouldn't `a given him that granola. Mr. Keene! 
MR. KEENE You guys know the drill, don't you? 
Will fishes the EPI-PEN from the fanny pack. 
WILL I'm a pacifist. 
BEVERLY My mom doesn't like me handling needles. 
Annoyed, Keene comes out from behind the counter. He kneels next to Eddie and takes the pen, plunging it into his thigh. Will screens Beverly as she SHOPLIFTS THE SUPPLIES and SLIPS OUT THE STORE. Eddie opens his eyes, breathing normal. 
EDDIE Thanks, Mr. Keene.   That one was a real shit kicker. 
EXT. KEENE'S PHARMACY - DAY 
Will and Eddie race out laughing. Bev is waiting on the curb to meet them. She flips Will the stolen goods. 
BEVERLY Not bad for a bunch of amateurs. 
She flashes a pack of STOLEN CIGARETTES and struts off towards her house. THEY LOVE THIS GIRL. Will closes Eddie's mouth and they hustle round the corner into RICHARD'S ALLEY. 
WILL We got it! 
He flips Ben his medicine. Stan runs up from behind, still looking blanched from his synogogue experience. 
EDDIE Shit Stan, what happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost. 
STAN Nothing. 
He sees Ben there, looking like a train wreck. 
STAN (CONT'D) What happened to him? 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
ANGLE ON A CLOSE-UP of the "Coen shoe" placed on a desk in front of CHIEF BORTON and OFFICER BOWERS, Travis' hillbilly father. Will is alone in the room with them while-- 
INT. POLICE STATION - MAIN BULL PEN - SAME 
Ben, all bandaged up, looks on with Eddie, Richie, and Stan as Will speaks to the police officers. 
BEN Beverly was there? 
EDDIE Yeah. 
BEN And she stole this stuff for me? 
Stanley wants Ben to shut up, but Ben is beyond excited. 
BEN (CONT'D) Did she know it was for me? 
RICHIE I don't think she even knows you're alive man. 
BEN                          STAN Yes she does.                   What's going on in there? 
RICHIE (CONT'D) What do you think? He's handing `em the kid's shoe. It's riveting. 
Ben checks his Timex, cracked but working. 
RICHIE (CONT'D) Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', huh? 
BEN My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't be late for curfew. 
EDDIE I think he means you, Big Ben. 
The boys shove him playfully.   Ben shoves back. 
BEN It's funny, `til the last week I didn't think anyone knew my name. 
RICHIE You're pretty friggin' hard to miss. 
EDDIE Guys, you think whoever kidnapped Dorsey might of, I dunno... got Georgie too? 
RICHIE                            BEN If he creeps in storm drains,    Who's Georgie? maybe. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Will's little brother. Or was. Before your time. 
RICHIE Will won't talk about it but the kid's arm got ripped clean off in a flash flood or something. 
Richie turns towards Stan, who's been unnaturally quiet this whole time. 
RICHIE (CONT'D) Cat got your tongue? 
STAN What? 
RICHIE                           EDDIE Why are you so quiet?            What's Chief Borton going to do with a shoe? 
STAN                            BEN I'm not.   I'm listening.        A storm drain. Crazy. 
Will steps out. 
RICHIE Well? 
EDDIE What did he say? 
WILL Nothing. Thanked me for being a good young citizen. 
RICHIE So let's get outta here. Police stations always make me feel guilty of something. 
EXT. OLD CAPE STREET - DAY 
BEVERLY GASPS and drops the measurer. It goes clattering into the sink, the tape coiling up like a snake, blood flickering everywhere as she stumbles back, tripping into the shower. 
BLOOD GOUTS UP FROM THE SINK DRAIN 
Like a demonic ejaculation -- blood splatters the mirror, the wallpaper, bouncing off walls and covering Beverly. She SCREAMS and runs out the door... 
INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
...into her father, who comes charging up the hall. She screams again, recoiling away. 
MR. MARSH What the devil's gotten into you, girl? 
BEVERLY The bathroom! Daddy, in the BATHROOM-- 
His arm shoots out and GRABS HER WRIST LIKE A VICE. 
MR. MARSH Someone peeking at you, Bevvie? Huh? 
BEVERLY No... the sink... in the sink... 
He stalks past, dragging her behind him. They step into... 
INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Mr. Marsh looks around, eyes wide, blood splattered everywhere, but the blood doesn't register with him. 
He shoves her against the wall. Hard. 
MR. MARSH You know I hate gettin' rough with you. I never do when you don't deserve it. 
He points back to the gory sink. 
MR. MARSH (CONT'D) What's my tape measurer doin' outta my toolbelt? 
He steps over and grabs the BLOOD-COATED TAPE, clipping it onto his belt, blood on his hands now too. He doesn't seem to see any of it. Only Beverly can. She realizes this. 
MR. MARSH (CONT'D) Answer me girl. 
He raises his hand. 
BEVERLY The sink... I was... I thought I saw a spider... 
Uncertain whether he'll hit her anyway, she closes her eyes and prepares for a smacking. 
MR. MARSH (SMILING) A spider? 
BEVERLY Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you. 
He lowers his hand, gentle now, proprietary. 
MR. MARSH I worry about you, Bevvie. I worry a lot. 
Smoothing out her hair over her forehead. The blood on her face like finger paint. This is when he scares her the most. 
MR. MARSH (CONT'D) You know why I don't drink or smoke or chase after women like other fathers do? 
BEVERLY Because you love momma? 
MR. MARSH Not just her, Bevvie. You. You're almost a woman now, too. And I got me all I need right here at home. 
He rests his forehead against hers, breathes in her scent, goes back down the hall to his game. 
INT. DETAIL ON CEILING - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON a wet, dark spot as it grows on a white plaster ceiling, the first droplet of water forming. SLOW MOTION as it breaks away and falls through space... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
...onto Will's head. He doesn't stir. But then it is followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. Finally, he awakes. Looks up. 
A leak in the ceiling. 
Will flips back his covers. 
INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Will grabs a bucket from a utility closet and, walking back, sees Georgie's room's door open... 
INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Will enters, the room frozen in time. GEORGIE'S TOY BOX is open. Photographs and posters line the walls. 
STAR WARS bedsheets crisp and military tight on the bed.    A Lego Turtle on the night stand. Will picks it up. 
Will sits down, Turtle in hand, and indulges in the sadness that has engulfed his home for months. The loss of his brother hitting him full force, he closes his eyes to fight back the tears, but cannot. 
He cries for George. Photographs of George, illuminated by passing cars, seem to watch him from the walls. 
A SHADOW seems to stretch across Georgie's room from the doorway. 
Will looks up but no one is there. 
INT. CORRIDOR - WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Will steps out of George's room and finds DARK FOOTPRINTS IN THE CARPET. He leans down and touches one -- squishy and wet. They track down the dark staircase. 
Will, heart pounding, follows the wet footprints down the stairs, careful not to step in any of them. 
WILL Hello?   Dad? 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY 
Officer Butch Bowers arrives with news for Chief Borton. 
OFFICER BOWERS We've got another one, Chief. 
CHIEF BORTON Another what? 
OFFICER BOWERS Kid gone missing. 
CHIEF BORTON Dear Lord.     Who is it? 
OFFICER BOWERS One of my son's friends. Patrick Hockstettler. 
PAN OVER to reveal Travis, waiting meekly inside Officer Bowers' squad car. 
CHIEF BORTON The family notified you directly? 
Officer Bowers nods for Travis to approach. 
OFFICER BOWERS Then I did a little investigating of my own. (TO TRAVIS) Tell him what you told me, boy. 
Travis doesn't know where to start. 
OFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D) Tell him, damn it! Tell him who you last saw him with. (he turns to Chief Borton) The negro boy from outside of town. The ones who run the abatoir. 
INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
BEN'S HAIKU is propped on a night stand. 
Beverly stirs awake. Her sheets and pillows are smeared with blood. Her face crusted with dried gore. 
Groggy, and nearly sleep walking, she sits up and walks out without taking stock. 
INT. BEVERLY'S BATHROOM - MORNING 
Bev opens the door, wiping her eyes she approximates the sink, bends over to wash her face and eyes. With the first crust of blood removed from her eyelids, she looks into the mirror and let's out a choked, exhaling GASP of horror. 
Surrounded by brown and crusty wallpaper, is Beverly's realization that the blood was not a dream. 
Beverly's Mom appears in the doorway.   Beverly turns to her, speechless, in shock. 
MRS. MARSH Darling, sometimes I look at myself in the morning and think the same thing. 
Beverly tiptoes out of the horror scene. She shyly looks at her mother as she dries her hair over a blood-drenched sink, oblivious to it all. 
MRS. MARSH (CONT'D) Look at these roots. 
Beverly is speechless. 
INT. HANDLON ABATTOIR - DAY 
Puddles of BLOOD seem to lap like small waves towards us. PAN UP to reveal Mike and Leroy sweeping the blood and water out of the slaughtering pen. 
Officer Bowers followed by SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS enter the facility. 
OFFICER BOWERS Leroy Hanlon? 
Leroy turns and notices the officers for the first time. 
OFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D) We need to bring in your boy for questioning. 
LEROY For what? 
OFFICER BOWERS Police business. 
Mike turns to his father, frightened, shaking his head. 
LEROY We need a lawyer? 
He looks at Mike, searching for any indication what this could be about. Travis appears in the distance and Mike instantly knows. 
MIKE Dad, it's- 
Officer Bowers roughly grabs Mike by the neck and starts to lead him out. 
OFFICER BOWERS Let's go, boy. 
LEROY Hey!   No need for that. 
He grabs Officer Bowers by the arm. Bowers quickly and excessively puts Leroy in a wrist lock and throttles him against the killing pen fence. Leroy moans in pain. 
OFFICER BOWERS Search this place, now. It's the perfect place to hide a body if you ever needed to. 
Officer Bowers looks around in disgust.   Travis smiles from the safety of distance and local power. 
LEROY This ain't right! You need a warrant, you can't just- 
Leroy seizes his arm, then his chest, then crumples to the ground, losing consciousness in the puddle of blood. 
MIKE Dad! 
Mike tries to rush for him but he is forcefully escorted to a waiting police car. Other Officers look to Bowers for direction. Officer Bowers turns Leroy over. 
OFFICER BOWERS Call an ambulance. 
EXT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY 
ALL of the boys have gathered in Ben's room. An aimless summer morning with nothing to do. They play with his junk and are generally turning his room over. Will examines a pair of walkie-talkies not unlike his own. 
RICHIE Whoa, what's with the history project, Benny-boy? 
Richie notices that Ben's walls are covered in xerox copies and historical drawings, all relating to Derry's history. 
BEN Oh, uh, when I first moved here I didn't have anyone to play with or anything, so I just started hanging out in the Library. 
Will sits up and looks out at the water. It is so black it seems other worldly. Not breaking his stare from the water, he addresses the group. 
WILL Do you guys ever feel there's something wrong with Derry. Like it's, I don't know, haunted or something? 
EDDIE Haunted how? 
WILL I keep thinking about Ben's walls. 
Ben, happy to have something else to focus on other than Beverly, looks at Will. 
BEN You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here? 
WILL Yeah.   It's strange. 
Stan opens his eyes and joins in. 
STAN Like any town, right? That's been around long enough, bad stuff is bound to happen. I mean, have you read the Torah? 
Richie, turns over to work on his back. 
RICHIE Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitter chatter. 
Beverly, eyes still closed, places a cigarette in her mouth and lights up. Ben notices her hands shake as she holds the cigarette in her mouth. The smoke swirls and dissipates over them. 
BEVERLY Have you been seeing "things" Will? 
Will whips his neck to Beverly. He can't tell if she is making fun or if she is seriously asking him for a bridge. 
WILL I... If I tell you guys something you won't think I'm crazy. 
RICHIE We already know you're crazy, Will. No judgement here. 
WILL I saw Georgie last night.   Only. It wasn't him. 
EDDIE Like.   In your dreams? 
WILL No. In my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him. 
RICHIE That wasn't Georgie, that was your neighborhood sex offender making a house call. 
WILL Shut up Richie. It wasn't just him. I saw this other... I don't know. 
STAN What did you see Will? 
BEN The clown? 
Will, Stan and Eddie look at Ben. 
WILL Yes. That's what it was, a scary looking clown. And it had these teeth... 
STAN I saw something, too. In the basement of the synogogue. 
RICHIE I take it back. I'm judging all of you and you are all friggin' wackos. 
Beverly, still laying there, exhales a long trail of smoke. 
BEVERLY I need to show you guys something. 
EXT. LOWER MAIN STREET - DAY 
The FIVE boys and Beverly stand outside her slummy apartment building. She looks frightened to go inside. 
BEVERLY My Daddy will kill me if he finds out I had boys in our apartment. 
BEN Isn't he at work? 
BEVERLY Sometimes he comes home for a nap. 
WILL We should leave lookouts. Ben, Stan, can you? 
Ben is ready to protest. Then succumbs, crestfallen. 
STAN What does he look like? 
BEVERLY My Daddy?    Mean. Like a drunk. 
Will, Richie and Eddie go with Bev. 
INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Bev opens the door. It creeks open. The apartment seems to be empty. Afternoon sunlight illuminating floating dust motes. She scouts around and lets them in. 
Will, Richie, and Eddie follow her to a closed door at the end of the hallway -- THE BATHROOM DOOR 
BEVERLY In there. 
RICHIE Can you give me an indicator of what I'm about to walk into? 
BEVERLY You'll see. 
RICHIE I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes. But if it is, you really didn't have to go through so much trouble, you could have just brought Ed to the quarry. 
She has no intention of going in. Will pushes past Richie and opens the door. 
EDDIE Oh God. Oh God. 
THE BLOOD 
Still there, faded into maroon clouds on the mirror and wallpaper. Richie reels back into the hallway with Beverly. 
She looks from Richie to Will. 
BEVERLY You really see it? 
OFFICER BOWERS (blocking the way) Whoa whoa. Where do you crumb snatchers think you're going? 
WILL We know what's been taking the kids. Chief! 
Borton steps out.    His long day just got worse. 
CHIEF BORTON It's okay, Butch. Someone try to do something to you kids? 
BEN                           BEVERLY Not someone.    Something.        There's like this spirit. 
BEN A clown. 
STAN Or sometimes it's something else. 
EDDIE Only us kids can see it. 
Borton narrows his eyes at Richie, the only one silent. 
BORTON Okay, stop. Is this you Tozier? Did you put them up to this little practical joke. 
WILL No, we all saw it. 
OFFICER BOWERS Such wild imaginations. Too bad we can't bottle their little brains. Dry them out and grind them into powder to salt our food. Maybe then we'd see, what was it again? 
Borton's exhausted.   He's having none of it. 
CHIEF BORTON You youngsters realize there's a penalty in Derry for filing a false police report. I don't want to have to call your parents, now. 
BEVERLY But we're not lying. 
CHIEF BORTON You have any evidence? 
The kids all look at each other, stymied. 
CHIEF BORTON (CONT'D) That's what I thought. I don't want to hear another word of this, not here, not a whisper of it anywhere. Now go home, all of you. Eat dinner with your families, sleep and have sweet dreams in your pj's. And tomorrow, you're going to go play like normal kids and forget all about this fantasy about murder and monsters. This is an adult matter. You got it? 
BEN But you adults aren't doing anything! 
OFFICER BOWERS Watch your tone, boy. 
The kids all stand there, Borton's big frame intimidating. 
CHIEF BORTON I don't see you leaving. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
The kids all step outside, morally deflated. 
WILL I guess we're on our own. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD over the PENOBSCOT RIVER: 
JULY 4th, 1988 EXT. DERRY - AERIAL - SUNSET 
A smoky haze obscures the setting sun and rough hewed mountains. 
EXT. KANSAS STREET - DUSK 
CRRRRRACK! A mailbox explodes as a Trans-Am speeds off, the boys inside it whooping and laughing their heads off. 
The car swings up to another and Travis Bowers leans out of the window, throwing in a SIZZLING M-80. 
He shuts the lid, pulls back into the passenger seat, and screams to the driver, Victor. 
TRAVIS Go! Go! Go! 
Victor hits it and they roar off. Snatch and MOOSE SADLER (16) scrunched like sardines in the backseat. They all look back to see... 
CRRRRRACK! The mailbox explodes. The boys share a hip flask bottle of Southern Comfort- 
TRAVIS (CONT'D) God I love the Fourth. 
SNATCH It's my turn. Pass one back. 
Travis fishes the bag full of M-80s and bottle rockets and they blow another mailbox. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK 
Mike enters, sheepish. Leroy is in bed, full of tubes to bleeping machines. He looks decimated. Mike's mom is on her way out. 
MIKE'S MOM You'll be okay? 
Mike nods.    She squeezes Mike's shoulder as she goes. 
LEROY Mom tell you what's the what? 
MIKE Doctors say it's inside your bones. And spreading. 
LEROY Your Mom's going to need you to be strong, Mikey. Help keep the abatoir running. 
Mike nods. 
MIKE I'll try. 
LEROY You do or you don't do. No try. 
Leroy coughs.    His lungs are filling with fluid. 
MIKE It's my fault. 
LEROY Stop that, Mike. There's no one to blame here. It's nature taking its course. 
STAN How? 
WILL With these. 
Will points to their arsenal of fireworks. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BEN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MINUTES LATER 
Mike runs past families and kids distracted by the fireworks display happening overhead, Bowers gang almost on him in the Trans Am. 
Mike cuts between a lawn between two houses, hopping a fence. Bowers hits the gas and fishtails it around the next block to cut Mike off. 
Will and his gang see this and take a short cut of their own. Ben, boy-boobs jiggling, takes up the rear. 
EXT.   NEIBOLT STREET - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
Mike spills out between lawns on Neibolt street; a dead end. There is a small pier that cuts into the canal with an old abandoned "lock house" at the end. 
The Trans-Am roars into view at the other end of the block. Revs the engine. 
INT. TRANS AM - NIGHT 
Travis is focused on Mike, who is frozen in the street. 
TRAVIS Got the little fucker now. 
Another boy runs out with him. Will. 
VICTOR Is that that pussy Denbrough? 
TRAVIS This night just gets better and better. 
Travis slams on the gas. 
EXT. NEIBOLT STREET - NIGHT 
Tires screeching.   Travis guns it straight for Mike and Will. 
WILL Don't move. 
MIKE You nuts? 
WILL Trust us. We're here to help you take these jerks. 
MIKE We? 
Looking to the side, Will has his walkie-talkie. 
WILL (into the walkie-talkie) Not yet... not yet. Now! 
Between the Trans-Am and Mike and Will, Ben and Richie heave their shoulders into a large steel DUMPSTER filled with construction material. They push it down a driveway that leads to the street. It creaks, starts to wobble, then move down the incline. When it hits street level, though, the gutter stops it from going out into line of the Trans Am. 
BEN Fuck. 
Will sees this. 
WILL Oh shit. Abort! Abort! 
MIKE Abort? What does that mean. 
WILL Run! 
They're about to dodge the car when- 
BEVERLY jumps out firing off her 6-BARRELED MORTAR handheld, aimed horizontally, at the car. THUMP. The recoil throws her back while the rocketing projectile explodes in front of the Trans-Am. Travis and the boys shield their faces SCREAMING as the front windshield explodes. 
BEVERLY Woah! 
THUMP. This one knocks her to the ground as the second mortar flies right towards the Trans Am. Travis yanks the wheel to the LEFT as the firework EXPLODES on the side of the car. He slams on the breaks as Victor, Snatch, and Moose are flung forward. Victor smashes his face on the dash board. 
MIKE Is that girl for real? 
WILL Real as it gets... Now, Stan and Eddie! 
Eddie and Stan charge from behind a hedge. Lighting bottle- rockets aimed at the car. Travis and his boys have to duck for cover as ONE of the rockets ZINGS through the car. 
TRAVIS Those little motherfuckers.   Get out, get out! 
The OLDER BOYS climb out the windows, ducking and covering their eyes from the ONSLAUGHT of bottle rockets and roman candle projectiles. 
Crouched behind the trunk, Travis lights up three M-80's WITH CLOWN FACES on them and tosses them like grenades at Beverly, Stan, and Eddie's positions. 
The M-80's blow HUGE fist sized holes in the blacktop, bigger than can possibly be legal, exploding gravel peppering the kids, stunning them for a moment. 
STAN Holy hell. What kinda gear do they got? 
WILL I don't wanna stay and find out. 
Ben and Richie race up from behind, letting loose another barrage as they pass Bowers' gang and the Trans Am, giving cover as the FIRE FIGHT, literally, becomes a retreating manoeuver towards the pier at the end of Neibolt street. 
Travis' boys cover their eyes but they make aggressive progress towards the kids with their terrifying M-80's. 
TRAVIS I've been waiting all summer to run into you, Denbrough. 
WILL Leave us alone Bowers. I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt. 
TRAVIS Hurt? When I'm done with you, you'll wish you were in that storm drain with your brother. 
EXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - CONTINUOUS 
They regroup at the mouth of the pier, water on both sides, Bowers in front. He throws another M-80, which tears into a wood plank. Splinters shoot everywhere. 
RICHIE You gotta a better idea? 
Glass breaks and CROWS STORM OUT OF A WINDOW behind them. Startled, they all lose their footing and fall, crashing down onto a pile of rope below. 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN 
Eddie looks to the shaking fridge. Blood oozes out of it and starts to cover the floor, inching towards him. Eddie backs away, horrified. 
EDDIE No. No no no. Will?     Help me! 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM 
Will sees the blood, looks to Ben and Mike. 
WILL What do we do? 
BEN We can't leave him alone down there. 
Mike looks at the old moldy mattress. 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN 
Eddie hops onto a rocking chair as the whole floor is coated with BLOOD. 
EDDIE Hurry, guys! 
The fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball and closes his eyes. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) This isn't happening. This isn't happening. 
Inside is Pennywise, all curled up. He unfurls himself like a coiled snake, holding a balloon on a string. It drags him, floating just above the bloody floor, across the room toward Eddie. 
PENNYWISE Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I brought you some cracker-jack. 
EDDIE Go away! 
PENNYWISE Away? But I just got here? And we're gonna have soooooo much fun, you and me. Now open those peepers. 
EDDIE No. 
PENNYWISE Kee-mon Eddie Bear. Don'cha wanna see the show? You're the main event. 
Eddie does. Pennywise is over him now, his teeth like razors, his clawed hands reaching out for Eddie's neck. 
PENNYWISE (CONT'D) You all taste soooooooo much better when you're afraid. 
Eddie screeeeeeeeeams! 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR 
Mike lifts up the mattress and sees a decomposed corpse of some child underneath it. He screams, falling backwards towards Will and Ben. 
INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, KITCHEN 
SUDDENLY ALL THREE OF THEM 
Fall onto Pennywise, smacking into the floor, blood splattering the walls, impact cushioned by Pennywise's body. They instantly fall to the side. 
Will, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger. 
WILL Ah, fuck! 
Eddie scurries away from Pennywise, who bares his fangs at Will. 
CRASH! 
Just then the board from the window rips off to Richie, Stan and Beverly. 
She fires a bottle rocket at Pennywise's face, exploding right into his eye. The clown reels back howling. 
Richie and Ben jump in and grab Eddie. 
Pennywise pulls the rocket out of his burned socket and growls at the boys, morphing into an ORANGE GAS that shoots back into the fridge. 
Eddie, Ben and Richie climb to safety through the window, while Will watches from the window frame Pennywise's escape. 
EXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The kids BANG on Mrs. Kaspbrak's door. She opens it, sees his broken arm and freaks. 
EXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Mrs. Kaspbrak is placing Eddie in the front seat of their family car. He is delirious with pain. 
MRS. KASPBRAK You! You all did this! 
She slams the door shut, hurting Eddie on the inside.   The kids are all too spooked to talk coherently. 
MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) You know how delicate he is! 
RICHIE We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis BOWERS AND-- 
MRS. KASPBRAK Stop it! Just stop it! If it weren't for you boys and that little tramp they'd have nothing against my Eddie-bear... Ohh, where are my keys? 
She's nearly in tears searching her purse. She dumps it out on the ground, prescription bottles, used kleenex's, food, deflated balloons. Gets on her knees and picks through it. 
MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) Eddie's done with you kids, you hear? 
She gets up when she finds the car key, speaking with such vitriolic focus, she seems possessed. 
MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D) Don't come around here again, you don't deserve him. You're reckless, churlish little boys. (TO WILL) This is why your little brother died, William, because you are a LOSER, a reckless reckless reckless loser. God help me if I were one of your parents. 
She gets in the car and screeches away towards the hospital. They ALL watch the car disappear down the street. 
In back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner: Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax splintering the floor. 
Stugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over and begins chopping his way in. 
He finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see... 
Stugley's boots disappear through the pool of shit and piss. 
Heroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts drinking what's left of the slaughtered men's beers. 
No one in the saloon seems to pay much mind to this. No one except Pennywise at the piano, who takes great pleasure in the scene and the ditty he's playing, a greasy white smile on his giddy, evil face... 
INT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY 
The Loser's Club sits in front of Ben. 
BEN And that is the story of the Silver Dollar Saloon. 
They look horrified. 
RICHIE The point of telling us was? 
Ben looks at Will. 
WILL                            BEVERLY I think it's pretty obvious.      Derry's not just haunted, it's cursed. 
MIKE Just like my pa was trying to warn me the night I met you guys. 
BEN That clown, whatever "IT" is, has been around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time. The Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang massacre. All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared. 
Richie holds up a dog-eared copy of "A History of Old Derry". 
RICHIE                               STAN I don't know, man.   That         Lumberjack. FLAPJACK STORY-- 
RICHIE Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to me. Didn't the guy who wrote this go insane or something? 
WILL Exactly. No one listened to him like no one listens to us. And unless we do something, "IT's" never going to stop. 
STAN What do you mean, us, Will?    We're just kids. 
BEVERLY We hurt it at Neibolt.   That's gotta mean something. 
MIKE Everything dies. 
Richie looks at Mike, rolls his eyes. 
WILL We can kill it. 
RICHIE Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer down. We can't even free Eddie from "mom jail" let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry. However, I do believe we could sell this story to "Tales from the crypt." 
BEN                             STAN No, no. This is far too         I don't want to see "it" whacked for "Tales."            again. Ever. 
WILL I don't think that's a choice, Stan. "IT" knows we know. We hurt it. It's going to want to hurt us back. 
MIKE It's only a matter of time one of us is found half eaten in the Barrens. Or worse. 
This is too much for Stan. He grabs his backpack. 
STAN I need to study for my bar-mitzvah. 
Stan goes. All the kids look to each other. 
BEVERLY He's just scared. 
WILL We're all scared. That's what it feeds off of. I heard the clown tell Eddie as much. Our only defense is to stick together. 
RICHIE Yeah well, the only time I've been spooked is when I'm with you jokers. I'm thinking I might be safer at home. At least I know my parents won't try to kill me. 
Richie goes too, leaving just the four. 
INT. WILL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Will enters the back door and grabs Stan's invitation for his Bar-Mitzvah off the fridge: 
HAROLD AND RUTH URIS CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO THE BAR-MITZVAH OF THEIR SON STANLEY URIS ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 13TH, 1988 
He hears fighting in the hallway. 
SHARON Put it back up there! Put it back now! 
ZACH I just thought, someone else-- 
INT. WILL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
His mother stands in the way of his father who holds the chest of Georgie's toys. 
SHARON I don't care about anyone else. I care about Georgie. I care about my little boy who's gone. 
WILL Hey. 
They both startle and look at Will standing there. 
ZACH Willy, we need a minute-- 
WILL Why? To scream at each other more? 
SHARON This is between your father and me. 
WILL And Georgie right? You, dad, and Georgie. 
ZACH Willy, stop. 
WILL No. You stop. I hate   it. Tip toeing around you guys like   I don't exist. Like I'm the one who   died and the only one who's still   here is Ge-- 
She stumbles back into the bathroom and shuts the door, trying to lock herself inside. He kicks the door open before the lock catches. 
Without thinking Bev grabs the toilet top and smashes it in her dad's face. He slumps down, unconscious. 
She rushes out, then uses a chair propped against the knob to shut him in the bathroom. Terrified she races out the front door. 
INT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - DAY 
Eddie stands in front of his mom, eyes blazing. 
MRS. KASPBRAK Placebo? Who told you that? Dr. Handor? He has no right. No right to say you're making up your sickness. 
EDDIE Not me, momma... You. 
MRS. KASPBRAK What? 
EDDIE He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen. You put those allergies in my head. 
MRS. KASPBRAK That's a lie, Eddie! A bold faced lie. You're my treasure. The only thing I want in this world is to see you safe and healthy. 
EDDIE Then why did you send my friends away? 
She starts to feel the fluttery bird of panic. 
MRS. KASPBRAK They were bad boys. You know that. And you... You were so sick when you were little. So very sick. It hurt me so much. I never want to see you go through that again. And I've kept you healthy, haven't I? 
EDDIE You lied to me mamma. You've been giving me medicine that's not really medicine. 
MRS. KASPBRAK Eddie-bear, please-- 
EDDIE This is what's going to happen now. 
He pulls out his Epi-pen and throws it in the trash.   Mrs. Kaspbrak gasps. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I'm going out that door and you won't stop me. I'm going to my friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when I come home you're never going to tell how weak or sick or delicate I am ever again. 
THUNDER crackles outside. 
EXT. DERRY STREETS - DAY 
Will and Mike tear through the howling rain on their bikes. They almost collide into Beverly who comes dashing around a corner. 
WILL Bev. You okay? 
BEVERLY No. No I'm not. 
She looks back over her shoulder, terrified and wet and shivering. 
MIKE What happened. Bowers? 
BEVERLY No.   My daddy. He... he... 
WILL What?   What did he do Beverly? 
She looks at both of them, tears running down her face, her pretty dress soaked in the rain. 
BEVERLY I don't know. I don't know if it was him, or... 
MIKE What? 
BEVERLY I think "IT" was there, controlling him, I don't know, I can't go back, I can't go back, Will. I don't know WHAT- 
She starts to cry on Will's shoulder. Will looks at Mike. They both look up at the convulsive yellow sky. SOMETHING BIG is about to happen and they both know it. 
INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY 
With torrential downpour outside, leaking water drips from the ceiling onto the crowd below, who have cheerfully employed umbrellas indoor to deal with the nuisance. 
Stan is giving a nervous, but otherwise successful reading of the Torah, despite the howling wind and end of days vibe. 
Richie and Ben sit in the back in their little jackets. 
BEN This storm is crazy.   Like the sky's gonna fall. 
SLAM! Everyone looks back towards the door, blown open by the wind, and at Eddie, who sheepishly was trying to slip in. 
Stan smiles at his friend, pleased he's out of "mom jail." The CANTOR gives him a nudge and continues reading. 
Eddie slides in meekly next to Richie and Ben, checking his clip-on bowtie. 
RICHIE (through his teeth) Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear. 
BEN How'd you escape? 
EDDIE Guess I'm not as weak as I thought. 
INT. TRAVIS BOWER'S HOUSE - DAY 
The front door creaks open, Victor and Snatch poking their heads in, both soaked to the bone. 
SNATCH Travis? 
VICTOR Mr. Bowers? 
Nothing. They see a streak of blood on the floor that leads to the KITCHEN and Butch Bowers on the linoleum floor in a red pool, stabbed dozens of times, the knife left in his eye. 
SNATCH Holy shit. 
Victor vomits.   The cat slips in and starts licking up the blood. 
SNATCH (CONT'D) Travis, dude, you okay? 
Snatch continues on into the LIVING ROOM where he finds TRAVIS sitting in Butch's favorite Lazy-boy in front of the TV, which is turned on to PENNYWISE THE CLOWN SHOW. 
EXT. OLD IRONWORKS - DAY 
The losers -- ALL 7 OF THEM -- stand on the threshold of the Old Ironworks cellar hold, the very same one PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER died in... a yawning chasm of mud, pools of water and hulking, shattered old boilers. 
The rain and wind howls, lightning cracking overhead. Will points to a huge SEWER PIPE that juts out of the muck. 
WILL (YELLING) This is our only way into Derry's original sewer system before it was sealed off and modernized. 
BLING! 
A bullet sparks off a iron post next to Will's head. 
Travis, Snatch and Victor stand at the crest of the road leading to the factory. Travis has his dad's gun, aimed like Dirty Harry at them. He pops off another round, BLANG-PING. 
BEN Oh, fuck! 
Will grabs Bev's hand, who grabs Ben's who grab's Eddie's and on down the line. They follow Will around the cellar hold to a giant conveyor belt toppled against the edge. They scale down it into the chasm, bullets pinging around them. 
CLICK CLICK CLICK. Travis runs out of ammo.     He throws the gun away and pulls out the bloody knife. 
VICTOR Man, this is where Patrick Hockstettler went missing. 
SNATCH No way I'm going down there. 
Travis glares at Snatch, PENNYWISE appearing near the boy in a flash of lightning. 
Travis lunges with the knife and plunges it into Snatch's tummy. Victor watches in horror. 
TRAVIS (TO VICTOR) Still have second thoughts? 
Victor shakes his head no. Snatch stumbles back and plunges into the darkness of the cellar hold... 
INT. CELLAR HOLD - SAME 
SMACK! Snatch's lifeless body slams into the muck right in front of Will and the others. 
EDDIE Oh my God oh my God! 
WILL Don't look back! 
They dart into the blackness of the huge, rusty pipe. 
Travis turns back to Victor, a dull craze in his eyes.   He gestures to the conveyor the kids climbed down. 
TRAVIS After you. 
INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY 
The losers follow Will, who uses his dad's map to lead them deeper and deeper into the sewers which roar and chime with rushing water. They turn a corner and come to... 
A DEAD END 
The stream of water seems to disappear under the stone wall there. Everyone is terrified. 
BEVERLY Now what? 
STAN Uh, guys? 
He shines his light on something in the corner... 
WILL There's suppose to be a tunnel here. The last tunnel that's shown on the map. 
It's a SHOE.    Eddie comes over it. 
EDDIE Dorsey's other shoe. 
Stan sweeps his flashlight up the wall.   What he finds makes Richie spring back. 
RICHIE Uh, guys! 
Scrawled in blood on the stones is a warning: 
STOP NOW OR I'LL KILL YOU ALL! WORD TO THE WISE FROM PENNYWISE 
MIKE Pennywise? 
BEN Shit, "IT" has a name. 
Footsteps echo from behind them. 
WILL Keep moving! 
Stan finds a loose stone. 
STAN Here.   Will, over here. 
They all kick at the stones, which give way to... 
INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY 
Travis and Victor race down the tunnels after them. They turn the corner and come to the dead end, a pile of stones kicked out from a BLACK HOLE. Travis kneels down and looks into it. He can see Will and the gang's FLASHLIGHTS... 
TRAVIS I seeeeeeeeeee yooooooouuuu losers! 
INT. BLACK HOLE - DAY 
Will and the others slosh on their hands and knees down the hole, with roots and bursting through its stone ribs. 
It grows narrower and narrower to the point of complete and utter claustrophobia. Mike looks back past Ben and sees... 
Two shadowy figures crawling toward them. 
MIKE Hurry! 
WILL It doesn't matter what it calls itself. What matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. Which means we can beat it. 
Will sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls. 
BEVERLY Guess I'm going first again? 
WILL Beverly, wait-! 
She jumps into the waterfall and it sweeps her up up up to the ceiling. 
Will and the boys swap holy shit looks.   Ben jumps in after her, then Will, Mike, and Stan. 
Richie looks to Eddie, who has the same terrified look as at the quarry. He holds out his hand. 
RICHIE You still afraid of a little grey water? 
EDDIE You still wear diapers at night? 
Eddie grabs Richie's hand and they jump into the waterfall together. They are swept up up up into... 
INT. THE REFLECTING POOL ON THE CEILING - CONTINUOUS 
Plunging into the pool with the others. For a moment they all flap and kick under water, unsure which way is up, then Bev grabs them both and pulls them to the surface. 
They're upside down now, the oculus opening to space below them, gravity seeming to work by its own rules in here.. 
WILL We all here? 
Richie looks back where they just "fell" from. 
RICHIE Mind equals blown right now. 
The camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt island very far from them. 
MIKE This is nothing like what it looked like from below. 
EDDIE It's in our head. All the stuff we see. It's like the allergies my mom said I had. We make it real. 
STAN We do.   Or IT? 
WILL Guys, the island.    Let's swim. 
They splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry. 
BEN Not funny, Richie. 
He looks back and sees no one.   Richie is a couple of lengths to his left. 
RICHIE What? 
Ben suddenly realizes.   Bev also feels something on her foot. 
BEVERLY The water. There's something in the water with us. 
Suddenly a WORMY TENTACLE extends from the water behind Mike. Will sees it and whacks it away with his baseball bat. 
WILL Hurry! 
The kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island. 
WE PULL BACK WIDE TO SEE a monstrously big, faintly outlined starfish-like creature with an orange glowing eye, lurking in the depths of the reflecting pool. 
Will, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles. 
From under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS. 
Stan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so that he stops swimming. 
WILL (CONT'D) Stan what are you doing! 
Paralyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to the surface. 
All the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake, using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island. 
EDDIE                             BEVERLY Stan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan! 
He stares blankly ahead, as if his mind was wiped blank. 
WILL (CONT'D) Stan, it's us. You in there buddy? 
Another tentacle squirms out of the water toward them. Ben shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in. 
BEN Guys. I don't think this is the best place to hang out right now. 
EDDIE Stanley, snap out of it. 
Stan blinks conscious.   He looks at them all. 
STAN Where am I? 
RICHIE The worst and only bar mitzvah party you will ever have. 
They help Stan to his feet. Mike looks back over his shoulder for the monster. 
MIKE Guys, the water thing.    IT's gone. 
Indeed, the reflecting pool is placid as ice. 
Will looks back to the crypt, an obsidian stone heptagon- shaped structure the size of one of Mike's killing pens. 
WILL Maybe. Or just changing into something else. 
EDDIE What do you mean? 
Mike with crow bar, Stan with chainsaw, Ben with a hub cap shield and sledgehammer, Richie with his hockey stick stake, Eddie with a nail gun. Will grabs his bat and joins them. 
Pennywise tries to fend off this "Lord of the Flies" rebellion, becoming bigger, fiercer, more grotesque, but the kids are too much. Just when they have "IT" bleeding and backed into a corner for the death blow... 
PENNYWISE Wait! 
Will grabs Ben's sledgehammer. The creature that looks up at them isn't Pennywise but... GEORGIE 
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE Please, Willy. Please don't hurt me. 
WILL You're not Georgie. 
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE I am. I'm in here, Willy. We all are. This is the place we float. 
BEVERLY Will, it's a trick. 
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE It's not your fault Willy. Not you're fault I'm stuck here. But you're hurting us all. 
MIKE It's trying to get to you, Will. Kill it. Kill it now. 
WILL No!   I have to think. 
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE Mom and dad they should know. They should know it's not your fault. I'll tell `em. I'll tell `em as long as you don't hurt us anymore. 
Will is confused. This is the one thing he wanted to hear. Beverly hands him his satchel with the car flares. 
BEVERLY Finish him, Will. For all of us. For Georgie. 
Will looks to the scared little boy on the ground. 
RICHIE I'm taking this fucker out. 
WILL No. 
Will grabs his stake away. He turns to Georgie.   Kneels down. Takes his wet little head in his hands. 
WILL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go out there with you. I'm sorry I was sick. 
GEORGIE It's okay, Willy. I know. Everything'll be okay. 
WILL DOES THE CALL BACK AND SOMETHING IN THE WAY GEORGIE RESPONDS SNAPS WILL OUT OF HIS STUPOR. GEORGIE'S GONE 
WILL Hairspray. 
Bev sprays it through his lit flare.   Torching Georgie. 
GEORGIE No!   No Willy! Please! 
GEORGIE REVERTS BACK TO PENNYWISE, screaming horribly and lunging at the kids one last time. IT finally gives up, slumping to the floor dead, a black charred clownish corpse. 
Richie touches the remains and they deflates, almost as if a balloon. 
The trapdoor above them blows away, as if it were sucked off by a cyclone, out of the oculus, and into what looks like the stars of outer space. 
EDDIE Did we kill it? 
Will isn't sure, he looks at the rest of them. 
MIKE You did it, Will. 
Bev hugs him.   Ben watches, enviously. 
RICHIE It's miller ti-- 
Suddenly the GRAVITY SPELL WEARS OFF and the kids all fall to the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into space, caught by Ben just in time. 
The water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble. 
At first the losers hang on, afraid to fall, but eventually they lose grip and fall toward the oculus, which has begun to fill up with the water from the falls and reflecting pool. 
They all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being pulled back by Stan. 
WILL We've got to get out of here. 
INT. DERRY SEWERS - DAY 
The losers hurry their way out of the sewers, storm water quickly rising around them. Will leads the way with a car flare. They come to another dead-end grate. 
RICHIE Shit! 
WILL We'll get out. C'mon. 
INT. ANOTHER PIPE - LATER 
They continue to look for a way out, the water now up to their chests. The losers look cold, lost, and in despair. 
STAN We're going to drown down here aren't we? 
EDDIE                           MIKE I'm so cold.                      All this water. It's still going to win. 
WILL No. I don't know-- 
BEN We're dead. So dead. 
BEVERLY Guys, stop it. Focus. 
Everyone turns to Bev. Their muse. Their light. 
SHE TAKES EDDIE'S FACE IN HER HANDS 
SHE TAKES STAN'S FACE IN HER HANDS 
SHE TAKES RICHIE'S FACE IN HER HANDS

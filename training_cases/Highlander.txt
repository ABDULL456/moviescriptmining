1  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                               1 
Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses, illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning against an alley wall. 
He is waiting. 
Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first. They size each other up as best they can. 
FIRST MAN MacLeod. 
The second nods. 
The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash of metal severs the agressor's head. 
2  INT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              2 
A 15th century Scottish home. 
A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron, stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot of grey soup. 
From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters. 
MOTHER My, but are you the picture. 
CONOR (surveying himself) It's a bit tight. 
His FATHER enters with a pail of milk. 
FATHER Ah, Conor, how you look a man. 
MOTHER Have you time for some- thing to eat? 
CONOR No, Mother.  They'll be here shortly. 
Conor's father looks him over with pride. 
FATHER Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke. 
MOTHER Must he go? 
FATHER Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours. 
MOTHER But Ian, he's still but a boy. 
FATHER He's a MacLeod. 
CONOR I'll be fine Mother. 
3  EXT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              3 
Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to the cottage door. 
Conor's father steps out to meet them. 
4  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            4 
A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling- ing to his helmet and breastplate.  A CLANSMAN hikes up the heather-carpeted slope to him. 
CLANSMAN They march. 
KNIGHT Is the boy among them? 
CLANSMAN Aye. 
5  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                5 
The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first. 
With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes. 
6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6 
The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain. Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There is an erie, smothering silence. 
VASSAL #1 Is a bad day for this. 
VASSAL #2 The Duke has been compro- mised.  He will have his due. 
VASSAL #1 By day's end he will have our heads. 
VASSAL #2 We ride against the Suther- lands.  That is all that matters. 
For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor. 
The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the alley. 
OFFICER #1 Kevin!  Get is a backup. 
TAUPIN I was merely walking by when- 
OFFICER #1 Don't move. 
The officer has his pistol out and leveled. His partner runs up, shotgun in hand. 
OFFICER #2 They're on their way. 
His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe. 
OFFICER #2 
Christ. 
10  INT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              10 
Conor lies moaning on a cot.  Makeshift bandages wrap his body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood. 
The family surrounds their dying son. 
A PRIEST is delivering the last rites. 
PRIEST ...Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut libertasi David de manu regis Saul... 
His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead. 
PRIEST ...In mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum... 
11  EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              11 
A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway. 
VASSAL #1 Has the boy died? 
CLANSMAN He is having the last rites now.  It should be over by morning. 
VASSAL #1 Never seen anybody cut as bad live so long.  He should have died on the field. 
CLANSMAN Tonight or tomorrow, it's all the same. 
The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the sacraments. 
PRIEST ...Auditorium nostrum in nomine domini... 
VASSAL #1 This has been a dark day. 
PRIEST ...Requiescant in pace... 
12  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                              12 
There is a bustle of activity.  Setting up barricades, uni- formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious ONLOOKERS at a distance. 
DETECTIVE LT. MORAN 
Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him, is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER. 
EXAMINER (studying body) Real clean.  No sawing action at all.  Whatever it was did it in one swipe. (looks up at Moran) Like the other one. 
Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby. 
MORAN What about that? 
EXAMINER Hasn't any blood on it. 
MORAN (looking around) About the only thing that doesn't. 
EXAMINER I'll give it a closer look when I get back. 
BRENNA CARTWRIGHT 
Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of insolent intelligence. 
An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade. 
OFFICER #3 Come on Brenna, you know better than that. 
BRENNA I'm invited. 
She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his equipment. 
BRENNA (greeting) Mr. Levine... 
A lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken study tables. 
The department SUPERVISOR sits at his desk surrounded by a handful of his staff RESEARCHERS - Brenna included.  A faded, stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches. 
BRENNA I don't believe him. 
SUPERVISOR Why? 
BRENNA He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it. 
RESEARCHER #1 Oh, has your penetrating research on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the criminal mentality? 
BRENNA Screw off, Larry. 
The men, LAUGH.  They delight in baiting her. Researcher #2 opens a Budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval mug he's borrowed from the collection. 
RESEARCHER #2 The cops bought it.  They let him go. 
BRENNA What could they hold him for?  I think they're just waiting for something concrete before they haul him in for real.  We should look into it.  He had to have gotten that sword from somewhere. 
SUPERVISOR Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here. 
BRENNA I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley? 
RESEARCHER #1 Here we go.  Everytime there's a murder in town we have to put up with junior D.A. 
RESEARCHER #2 Must be genetic. 
BRENNA Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two. 
SUPERVISOR You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it? 
BRENNA Give it a rest Ned, huh? 
RESEARCHER #2 Might be interesting to see what his family connections are.  That's a hell of a piece to be just chuck- ing around in an alley. 
SUPERVISOR (sighs) I swear to God Brenna, between you and Thompson's novels I'm going to get a bloody ulcer. 
Researcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth. 
CUT TO: 
20  INT. TAVERN                                                     20 
An empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking establishment. 
CLANSMEN, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow VILLAGERS. 
No longer requiring the use of a cane, Conor enters. 
CONOR (to owner) Evening, Douglas. 
DOUGLAS Conor. 
The tavern goes silent.  Wary.  The attention is on Conor. 
CONOR Ale suits me. 
The owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug.  Conor takes it and walks to where four other VILLAGERS sit. 
TAVERN MAN #1 We rather you not be sitting with us, Conor. 
Conor looks to the next table. 
TAVERN MAN #2 We be drinking alone as well. 
The entire tavern spells the same sentiments. 
CONOR What's wrong with you all? 
Silence. 
Angered, Conor approaches the second man.  As he looms above his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts it forward. 
TAVERN MAN #2 Requiem acer'nam donaei- 
CONOR What are you doing man? 
TAVERN MAN #2 -Et lux perpetua- 
CONOR You'll not be bringing the church into this. 
TAVERN MAN #2 -Luceat ei- 
The weird display frightens Conor. 
CONOR Be quiet. 
INTRUDER Smith.  Carl Smith. 
TAUPIN How many came? 
INTRUDER The last four. 
TAUPIN And the Bulgarian? 
INTRUDER He got him. (hoarse chuckle) He always does.  Eventually. 
TAUPIN He knows I'm here.  How? 
INTRUDER None of this would be happening if you hadn't run... 
The knife is pressed deeper. 
TAUPIN _Answer_ me. 
INTRUDER (gasping) We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill... 
25  EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY                                        25 
A city limit sign announcing the small community of Church Hill is overtaken by Brenna's sedan. 
26  EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY                        26 
Brenna looks through a telephone book. 
BRENNA Taupin...Taupin... 
Nothing.  She closes the book and drums her fingers on the cover. 
27  EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY                                27 
An 1860s stone columned affair, far more impressive than the low-lying town that surrounds it. 
Brenna enters. 
28  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                      28 
Brenna sits sifting through a large cloth-bound book entitled _Certificates of Birth: 1941-1948_. 
BRENNA (reading) Tarmin...Tatum...Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born to William and Karen Taupin, no address.  Attend- ing physician, Dr. Willis Kidell. 
29  INT. DR. KIDELL'S HOME                                          29 
Dr. Kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder. 
KIDELL 1945, that strains the memory. (after a fashion) Here we are, Richard Taupin. 
He carries the binder to the table where Brenna sits. 
KIDELL Would you like more tea? 
BRENNA No thank you, I'm fine. 
Kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page. 
KIDELL He was unsual. 
BRENNA Why? 
KIDELL Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house. 
BRENNA Then you didn't know Richard later on. 
KIDELL No. 
BRENNA I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies. 
KIDELL Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does. 
BRENNA I don't follow you. 
KIDELL Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born. 
BRENNA The boy _died_? 
KIDELL Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son. 
Dr. Kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping. 
KIDELL My brother worked for the town paper at the time.  He took this picture of the funeral. 
Something in the clipping sparks Brenna's interest. 
BRENNA Have you spoken to anyone else about this? 
DETECTIVE MORAN 
Is supervising.  An OFFICER climbs up the embankment to him. 
OFFICER They found it. 
The officer leads him down to the river where a headless BODY wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag. 
OFFICER It was about fifty yards down- stream from the head. 
Moran looks down at the body bag, its dark plastic reflecting the rythmic rotation of squad car beacons. 
OFFICER Both were cut real clean.  Like the other ones... 
33  EXT. EQUESTRIAN RIDING GROUNDS - DAY                            33 
A steeple-chase course lies shrouded in an Arlington fog. 
Across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle.  Driving the steed hard through the course, Taupin pulls firm on the reins, bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective Moran waits. 
MORAN There's been another murder. 
Taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline. 
TAUPIN My condolences. 
MORAN Where were you Tuesday night? 
TAUPIN Home. 
MORAN A neighbor saw your car leave. 
TAUPIN He's mistaken. 
Taupin climbs down from his horse.  Moran moves close. 
MORAN Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea. 
TAUPIN Do you? 
MORAN All I need is time. 
TAUPIN I've got all the time in the world. (looks at watch) Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant. 
In no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away. 
34  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT                                 34 
Brenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her desk corner. 
Boring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs.  From another folder she pulls out a computer sheet. 
INSERT COMPUTER SHEET 
The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record. Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and driving records.  Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in 
Brenna looks down the list to a WILLIAM TAUPIN of Felton, Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the year Richard started. 
35  EXT. GAS STATION - DAY                                          35 
Dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, Brenna removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware. 
36  EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY                                            36 
Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary. 
Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants. 
On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an open grave. 
Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit. 
A coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: "WILLIAM MICHAEL TAUPIN". 
The casket is empty. 
BRENNA Someone beat you. 
TAUPIN Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright? 
BRENNA Grave robbers? 
TAUPIN Probably. 
BRENNA Who? 
TAUPIN People like that rarely leave business cards. 
He raises his blade. 
An elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in the clearing. 
WATCHMAN Hey!  What's going on here? 
The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest. 
Taupin pushes past him to Brenna. 
TAUPIN Run! 
Brenna is frozen in shock. Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate. 
TAUPIN Run! 
KNIGHT MACLEOD! 
The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and lumbers after them. 
Taupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround- ing residential area. 
37  EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY                                   37 
Taupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side- walk. 
They have apparently lost the Knight.  Taupin pauses at a corner.  He sees a church across the street. 
38  INT. CHURCH                                                     38 
Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing echoing off the high ceiling. 
Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone. Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit- uation. 
Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and head against the back of the pew. 
BRENNA Jesus Christ. 
TAUPIN You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church. 
BRENNA Why not? 
TAUPIN (distracted) Tradition. 
BRENNA What the hell is going on? 
Taupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on his face.  He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the Church's doorway without a word. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
39  INT. MEDIEVAL BLACKSMITH SHOP                                   39 
A glowing horseshoe HISSES wildly as it slips into a wooden cooling bucket.  Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet. 
Sweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine. 
40  EXT. SHOP FRONTAGE - DAY                                        40 
Conor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms, cleaning off a day's worth of sweat and grime. 
JUAN ROMIREZ 
Stirring up dust with his travelling boots, this Spanish acc- ented man stops at Conor's shop.  He wears a large broad sword strapped to his waist. 
CONOR Afternoon. 
ROMIREZ Your name is Conor? 
CONOR Aye. 
ROMIREZ (bows slightly) Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist. 
CONOR (notices accent) You're not from these parts. 
ROMIREZ I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time. 
41  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               41 
Romirez is seated at a table.  His back to the Spaniard, Conor is preparing some food. 
CONOR I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here. 
ROMIREZ Please go to no trouble. 
Romirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist. 
ROMIREZ Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle? 
Romirez chooses his words very carefully. 
ROMIREZ Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed. 
CONOR What? 
ROMIREZ We are immortal. 
Stunned, Conor backs away from Romirez. 
CONOR No, that can't be. 
Romirez grasps Conor's shoulder. 
ROMIREZ It is as you are. 
CONOR (pushes away) No! 
This is all too much for Conor. 
ROMIREZ Listen to me.  Hear the words. 
CONOR This is madness! 
ROMIREZ It is the truth. 
CONOR No! 
Romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's heart.  The boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his eyes roll up into his head. 
A shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the ground. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
43  EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY                                       43 
Brenna stops her car in front of the Washington Police Depart- ment.  Getting out of her car she climbs the stairs but stops. 
After a moment of indecision she changes her mind and returns to her car. 
44  INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   44 
Brenna lowers herself wearily into a chair, rubs her eyes, and stares absently out the window. 
Reaching across to an end table, she plays back her answering machine. 
Beep. 
MALE VOICE This is Dr. Wickland at GWU.  Your test came back today.  You can call me here at the med center if you have any questions. 
Click. Beep. 
SUPERVISOR'S VOICE Brenna, where the hell are you? The place is full of cops asking weird questions.  What's going on? I've got work stacking up.  Get in here right away. 
Brenna stands and goes to the kitchen, returning with a glass of wine. 
Click. Beep. 
KNIGHT'S VOICE Brenna. 
She freezes in her tracks. 
KNIGHT'S VOICE My quarrel is not with you.  Meet me. 
Brenna's eyes are glued on the machine. 
KNIGHT'S VOICE We have much to talk of, you and I.  Answers for the young historian. (beat) O'Reily's.  Tonight.  I've grown to like taverns. 
Click. Beep. 
SEVERAL LITTLE GIRLS (singing) Happy birthday to you, happy birth- day to you, happy birthday dear Brenna, happy birthday to you. 
Brenna is still upset from the last call. 
MOTHER'S VOICE Hi Brenna, it's mom.  Me and your neices just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.  Crissy made a real cute card for you, be sure to call her.  Will you be home for Easter?  Call when you can.  Love you. 
Click. Hiss. DISSOLVE TO: 
45.  INT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY                                        45 
This HISS of Brenna's answering machine becomes the HISS of cooking.  Bandaged about the chest, Conor asleep on his cot. 
Suddenly he sits up.  Sweating.  He looks about the room in confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food. 
ROMIREZ Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate. 
CONOR (dazed) This can't be. 
MAN That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful. 
BRENNA There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it. (smiles) The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me. 
MAN You're very macabre. 
BRENNA It's my birthday. 
MAN Happy birthday. 
BRENNA Thanks. 
Brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh. 
BRENNA Buy a birthday girl a drink? 
50  INT. PUB - NIGHT                                                50 
A small neighborhood tavern.  Regulars chat amicably with the BARTENDER-OWNER. 
TAUPIN 
Sits alone at a corner table.  A WAITRESS hovers over him. 
TAUPIN Lager and lime. 
LATER 
Taupin's lager is drained.  Lost in thought, he drags a finger around and around the lip of the mug. 
He hand stops.  It twitches.  Shakes. 
Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly out of control.  A warning. 
He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing over him. 
KAHN MacLeod. 
Taupin is anxious, poised for attack. 
Kahn breaks into a broad smile. 
KAHN Spare a chair? 
TAUPIN Kahn? 
KAHN Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night? 
TAUPIN Sit. 
Kahn takes his place across the table. 
TAUPIN (unsure) How are you? 
KAHN Head still secure to the neck. 
TAUPIN How did you find me? 
KAHN How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime? 
Taupin looks to his own glass. 
KAHN Old habits die hard. (to waitress) Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic! (beat) Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence. 
TAUPIN What are you doing here? 
KAHN It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores. 
Taupin tenses. 
TAUPIN And have you something to settle with me? 
KAHN (smiles) Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend. 
TAUPIN It's good to see you, Kahn. 
The waitress sets down two glasses. 
KAHN Come, toast with me the past. (raises glass) To old conquests, old loves, and to a time when we cared about either. 
Kahn drains his glass. 
KAHN Waitress! 
51  EXT. THE WASHINGTON MALL - NIGHT                                51 
Kahn and Taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed government building. 
Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup. 
ROMIREZ You have a gift.  One you must protect. 
CONOR And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt? 
ROMIREZ The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another. 
CONOR (shakes head) If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed. 
Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away. 
ROMIREZ Come.  Enough sword play for an afternoon. 
62  EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                          62 
A friendly horse race.  Their reflections bouncing off a clear glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen tree trunks. 
Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait for Romirez, several lengths behind. 
CONOR (as Romirez rides up) You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders. 
ROMIREZ Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod. 
Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view.  Romirez pulls a leaf from a tree and studies it closely. 
CONOR What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf. 
ROMIREZ All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that. 
He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one. 
ROMIREZ As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing. 
CONOR I do not think I like the sound of that. 
ROMIREZ It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be. 
CONOR I feel hardly nothing. 
ROMIREZ You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned. 
CONOR But why be so concerned about me? 
ROMIREZ This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more. 
CONOR And you? 
ROMIREZ I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something. 
CONOR I am not ready for this. 
ROMIREZ You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them. 
CONOR Of course. 
ROMIREZ You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love. 
CONOR That is not me. 
ROMIREZ With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one. 
VILLAGER Conor! 
A VILLAGER approaches from across the pasture. 
CONOR Yes, Darin. 
VILLAGER Hate to be bothering you like this, but me mare threw a shoe. 
Conor looks to Romirez. 
ROMIREZ Go ahead, Senor. (gestures to wine) I have my friend to keep me company. 
CONOR I'll be back when I can. 
Conor sets off across the pasture. 
64  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               64 
Romirez enters and flops onto a cot. Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing. 
The room is still. Romirez begins to drowse. 
Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness. His hand moves under the cot. 
With an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges and splintered into fragments.  Passing through a cloud of sawdust enters the Knight.  Without pause he topples a kitchen shelf onto a supine Romirez. 
Holding Brenna's photograph, the research librarian is comb- ing through stained binders.  The room is old, disorganized, and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must be in it somewhere. 
RESEARCHER Wilson know about this? 
BRENNA I'm doing it on my own. 
LIBRARIAN Good way to lose your job. 
BRENNA Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do. 
LIBRARIAN I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did. 
BRENNA It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it. 
LIBRARIAN You always were hard to impress. 
The librarian pulls a binder and opens it. 
BRENNA Who is it? 
LIBRARIAN Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania. 
70  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH OFFICE                                     70 
Brenna enters and sits at her desk.  She is looking for something. 
BRENNA (confused) Chris, have you seen my notebook? 
Chris is seated at the desk next to her.  He points at the supervisor's door. 
BRENNA Why, that son of a bitch. 
71  INT. MUSEUM SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE                                 71 
The high backed office chair is spun away from an angry, entering Brenna. 
BRENNA What's wrong Wilson, huh?  Not enough excitement in your own desk?  What the hell were you looking for in mine? 
The chair turns.  Detective Moran, not her supervisor, leafs through her notebook. 
MORAN A murder. 
BRENNA You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it. 
MORAN I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right. 
BRENNA What do you want from me? 
MORAN Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town. (looks at notebook) And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons. 
Brenna lifts the telephone receiver. 
BRENNA I'm calling an attorney. 
MORAN You and I should talk first. 
BRENNA We've got nothing to say. 
Moran presses the post on the phone. 
MORAN What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people? 
BRENNA Four? 
MORAN All fashionably without heads. 
BRENNA Spare me the details. 
MORAN But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin. 
BRENNA What are you getting at, Moran? 
MORAN You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill. (looks at notebook) Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew. (looks up) In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder. 
BRENNA It'll never stick. 
MORAN But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that. 
BRENNA You're an asshole, Moran. 
MORAN I want Taupin. 
BRENNA What makes you so sure he's the one? 
MORAN Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year. 
BRENNA What's all of this got to do with me? 
81  INT. SEDAN                                                      81 
A mile out of town Brenna stops at a farmhouse.  She checks it against the photo she found at Taupin's townhouse.  They match. 
82  EXT. FARMHOUSE DOOR - DAY                                       82 
Brenna KNOCKS. 
TAUPIN You shouldn't have come. 
Brenna whirls around and sees Taupin behind her. 
TAUPIN We're you followed? 
He looks to the road. 
BRENNA No. 
TAUPIN No one knows you're here? 
BRENNA No.  I had to talk to you. 
TAUPIN You had to do _nothing_! 
BRENNA You're wrong. 
TAUPIN You're a fool. 
BRENNA Maybe. 
Pause.  Taupin strides through the doorway. 
TAUPIN Come inside. 
83  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                  83 
Brenna and Taupin enter.  A heavy broad sword sits on the coffee table. 
BRENNA Is this what you killed them with? 
TAUPIN You've been listening to rumors. 
BRENNA Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder. 
TAUPIN You are.  Now. 
Beat.  They're stuck with each other. 
TAUPIN There's several bedrooms down the hall.  Take your pick. 
84  INT. BEDROOM                                                    84 
The room is a strange decor.  18th century paintings hang beside grotesque medieval carvings. 
Brenna's face softens with worry.  What is she doing? 
85  EXT. RURAL PAY PHONE - DAY                                      85 
A plain-clothed POLICE OFFICER is in mid conversation. 
OFFICER No, that's the last place we saw her.  Okay, will do. 
He hangs up. 
PARTNER Well? 
OFFICER (shrugs) We keep looking. 
PARTNER Wonderful. 
86  INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            86 
Taupin sits at his desk.  Before him is spread out blank birth certificates, driver licenses and title deeds.  His eyes lift to the corridor where Brenna is.  An idea has come to him. 
Brenna enters. 
BRENNA What's all that? 
TAUPIN Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared. 
Brenna walks to the window. 
BRENNA You did kill those men. 
TAUPIN Not all of them. 
BRENNA When you finish, what then? 
The soldier hedges. 
STAFF SARGEANT You heard the Major!  Where! 
SOLDIER #3 Whorehouse sir. 
Dupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens. 
DUPONT Your rifle.  Hand it to me. 
The soldier obeys.  Dupont inspects the firing mechanism. 
DUPONT The flint is cracked.  No spark will reach your powder.  You will die tomorrow. 
He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands. 
DUPONT Tomorrow you go to _battle_!  And you look like children! (beat) The General has charged me with seeing that you are prepared, and prepared you will be!  If necessary you stand here all night!  Sargeant! 
The sargeant leaps to attention. 
SARGEANT Yes sir. 
DUPONT See to it. 
SARGEANT Yes sir. 
Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some- thing.  He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen. 
His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking each face carefully. 
One PRIVATE seizes his attention.  The private is cautious. 
DUPONT Your name? 
MULET Mulet. 
It is as if Dupont knows him.  The two stare at each other. Dupont turns and leaves. 
90  INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                          90 
Inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters, Dupont (Conor) and several others eat their evening meal. 
A CAPTAIN finishes his story. 
CAPTAIN (amused) ...And what a sight!  That old mare just kept falling over her own guts till someone finally shot her. 
The OFFICERS LAUGH.  All but Dupont. 
MAJOR (beside Dupont) Complete your inspection? 
DUPONT They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow. 
MAJOR (laughs) I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us. 
DUPONT We need more time. 
MAJOR Won't get it. (shrugs) We are a sacrifice.  A diversion. 
Dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate. 
MAJOR Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last. 
DUPONT (rises) Not likely. 
Dupont goes to the window.  Dusk shines orange on his face. 
In the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up, Mulet, is chopping firewood. 
91  EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            91 
Several hours later. Most are asleep.  Mulet continues his wood splitting. 
From out of the dark cottage steps Dupont. 
DUPONT (CONOR) I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill. 
MULET Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking. 
DUPONT What is your position? 
MULET Second musketeer. 
DUPONT I understand you joined up in Bremen. 
MULET You seem to understand a great deal. 
DUPONT I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me. 
Dupont has backed up a few paces. 
KNIGHT All this time and still a scared little boy. 
Dupont sits down. 
DUPONT Not so scared. 
KNIGHT Perhaps not. (smiles) You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck. 
DUPONT No doubt. 
KNIGHT You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion. 
DUPONT You're wrong. 
KNIGHT I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players. 
The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont. 
DUPONT Romirez understood.  Not you. 
KNIGHT Romirez is dust. 
The Knight looks to the altar. 
KNIGHT Finish your prayers? 
DUPONT Finish yours? 
KNIGHT (smiles) Our common heritage. (beat) I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you. (rises) I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you. 
DUPONT So sure? 
The Knight leans forward and puts his face very near. 
KNIGHT You can't stay in church forever. 
The Knight moves into the aisle. 
KNIGHT Good night, Major. 
He exits. 
Conor sits in the dim church alone.  Very alone. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
94  EXT. WORSTICK CHURCH (PRESENT DAY)                              94 
Richard Taupin sits against the stone of an old Catholic church. Taupin sighs.  A long, weary sigh. 
95  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         95 
Taupin and Brenna sit at a table working on forms. 
Taupin looks up from his work and studies Brenna's face without malice. 
95  EXT. CREEK - DAY                                                95 
Brenna and Taupin are taking a walk along the township's outskirts. 
Crossing a small bridge over a smaller creek, they encounter the elderly caretaker Mr. North and his eight year old GRANDSON. Both with fishing poles. 
MR. NORTH Morning Mr. North 
TAUPIN Same. 
MR. NORTH Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now. 
TAUPIN No. 
MR. NORTH Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing. 
TAUPIN I'm sure that's true. 
The grandson is having difficulty baiting his line.  Taupin bends down beside the young fisherman. 
TAUPIN (takes worm) Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest. 
GRANDSON Thanks. 
Taupin's show of affection surprises Brenna. 
TAUPIN Show you a trick. 
Taupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them around the hook. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
101  EXT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - DUSK                               101 
Conor and a beautiful young woman, KATHERINE, sit on the porch steps in 1800s period dress.  Other young COUPLES relax nearby enjoying the warm summer's twilight.  Katherine's MOTHER shuffles between the couples offering lemonade, cakes, and the like. 
KATHERINE Do it again. 
She is thoroughly charmed by Conor. 
CONOR All right. 
Conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers.  By turning his hand over and bending his knuckles just so, the web becomes the outline of a lion.. 
CONOR A lion. (growls) 
Katherine is delighted. 
Conor starts to remove the yarn.  Katherine touches his arm. 
KATHERINE Oh please.  Another one. 
CONOR What would you like? 
KATHERINE Something pretty. 
CONOR Like you. 
Conor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a four leaf clover. 
KATHERINE That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it? 
CONOR Far away. 
KATHERINE Kiss me. 
Conor shoots a glance for the mother, then kisses Katherine softly. 
YOUNG MAN (o.s.) You'll be leaving the girl alone. 
A YOUNG MAN stands a few yards from the stairs. 
KATHERINE David. 
CONOR Do you have cause to bothering us? 
YOUNG MAN That's my girl. 
KATHERINE David, we've already spoken of this. 
YOUNG MAN He's not what he pretends to be. 
Conor climbs to his feet. 
CONOR You best leave, son. 
YOUNG MAN You think you're so high and mighty, coming into town and taking a man's woman.  Well I know about you.  I know about the things you do. 
CONOR (moving closer) I said you best leave. 
YOUNG MAN You'd like that, wouldn't you? (to Katherine) Ask him about his friends.  The ones he meets in the town square. Ask him about the blade he keeps beneath his bed. 
Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close. 
CONOR (like ice) Leave.  While you still can. 
The youth pushes away from the grasp. 
YOUNG MAN You don't frighten me. 
CONOR I should. 
The young man throws a fist at Conor.  It is easily blocked. Conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks the young man gasping onto the ground. 
Katherine runs up behind and grabs Conor's outstretched arm. 
KATHERINE No!  Leave him.  Please don't hurt him. Please. 
COUGHING painfully, the youth climbs to his feet and staggers away. 
YOUNG MAN He's not what you think. 
He turns and runs down the road. 
YOUNG MAN He's not what you think! 
Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice. 
TAUPIN Yes. 
They do a final turn and finish.  The other DANCERS applaud. 
BRENNA You're using your son's name. 
TAUPIN No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son. 
Brenna is staring at him. 
TAUPIN More punch? 
He leads her to a table. 
BRENNA Then you must be at least 70 years old. 
TAUPIN At least. 
BRENNA That's impossible. 
Several of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across the room. 
103  EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT                                      103 
A bus with "Gettysburg" across the front pulls to a stop at a dark terminal.  A lone passenger steps off into the mist. It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying only a long, narrow case. 
104  EXT. - NIGHT                                                  104 
Brenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall. 
BRENNA It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives. 
TAUPIN A factor of age. 
BRENNA I hope I never get that old. 
TAUPIN You won't. 
Brenna pulls away. 
BRENNA I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same. 
TAUPIN Why are you here? 
BRENNA I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not. (looks at him squarely) It's you. 
TAUPIN I see. 
BRENNA I'm not even sure why. 
TAUPIN Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer. 
BRENNA My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity. 
TAUPIN You are a very perceptive young woman. 
BRENNA Just a little crazy. 
A thoughtful pause. 
TAUPIN Miss Cartwright, it's time I showed you something. 
105  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         105 
Taupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall. 
Taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something.  A press from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway. 
TAUPIN (gestures to interior) Miss Cartwright? 
Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness.  Taupin follows and switches on the light. 
106  INT. HIDDEN ROOM                                              106 
Brenna's expression changes to awe. 
The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic. Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras crowd the shelving and floor space. 
The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had taken the time to keep a scrapbook. 
BRENNA My God. 
The sight is overwhelming. 
TAUPIN I had this room built some time ago. 
Brenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along its intricate weaving. 
TAUPIN Are you here? 
KNIGHT'S VOICE I want you to come to me. 
TAUPIN And if I refuse? 
KNIGHT'S VOICE Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head. 
This affects him. 
KNIGHT'S VOICE Yes laddie, I have her. 
TAUPIN Should I care? 
KNIGHT You have three hours. 
115  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT                                       115 
The unmarked cars shoot by. 
116  INT. HOME                                                     116 
Taupin hangs up the phone. He looks to the sword on the table, reflecting the firelight. 
117  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                        117 
POLICE OFFICERS, placed around Taupin's house, are COCKING shotguns and CHAMBERING pistols. 
Two officers take positions on either side of the door.  A third, after getting the signal, kicks the door open. 
118  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                118 
The officers drop to firing positions in the doorway.  The room is empty. 
119  INT. FARMHOUSE BEDROOM                                        119 
An officer BURSTS in.  It's empty. 
120  INT. MAIN ROOM                                                120 
The Inspector is on the phone. 
INSPECTOR He's not here. 
121  EXT. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                           121 
Spotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding blackness. 
Taupin's face moves into frame. 
122  EXT. MONUMENT STAIRS - NIGHT                                  122 
Sword firmly in one hand, Taupin climb's the monument's steps. 
123  INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                               123 
A twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his quotations. 
A sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands at the statue's base. 
KNIGHT Welcome. 
Taupin stands at the entrance. 
KNIGHT Kahn sends his best. 
In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of death still pressed into the face.  Taupin's eyes return slowly to the Knight and Brenna. 
TAUPIN Let her go. 
The Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall. 
KNIGHT You disappoint me. (looks at Brenna) I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing. 
TAUPIN Leave her out of this. 
KNIGHT As you wish. 
The Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle.  Taupin does the same.  The weapons are CLANKED together twice, then pulled back into battle position. 
The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an opening. 
The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high walls. 
Another ATTACK without result. 
KNIGHT You can do better than that. 
Moran drives up.  There is an empty police car, the door still ajar. 
132 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          132 
Taupin is badly outclassed. 
He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws him again to the floor. 
BRENNA You bastard! 
KNIGHT Be silent. 
BRENNA Leave him alone. 
KNIGHT You will be silent!! 
The voice is THUNDERING. 
Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor.  His teeth grind in pain. 
The Knight smiles. 
KNIGHT I do hope you're enjoying this as much as me. 
MORAN 
Stands in the entryway.  The Knight sees him. 
KNIGHT Get out. 
Moran draws his pistol. The Knight walks toward him, 
KNIGHT This is nothing that concerns you. 
Moran levels his gun. The Knight raises his sword. 
KNIGHT You will leave! 
Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES.  The slugs slam into the Knight, blowing him off his feet. 
He lies still. 
Moran looks to Brenna.  To Taupin.  Then he walks closer to the Knight. 
TAUPIN (hoarse) Don't. 
Taupin curls in a spasm of pain. Moran moves closer. 
The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over his heart.  He isn't breathing. 
Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face. 
TAUPIN Stop.  You don't understand. 
The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's chest.  The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall. 
Taupin crawls for the Knight. 
Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes.  The Knight, blood pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts quickly. 
Moran slides off the sword dead. 
Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest.  The Knight GAGS in surprise and crumples.  Taupin CUTS again, then puts the blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat. 
TAUPIN In mamus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum in nomine Domine. 
He raises the sword. 
TAUPIN Requiescant in pace. 
And CUTS the Knight's head off. 
Taupin drops his sword. His breathing quickens. A sensation sweeps over him. 
Taupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING.  He sucks in painful gulps of air. 
BRENNA My God. 
Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing. 
BRENNA Conor. 
Taupin is looking past her. 
A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder.  She SCREAMS.  The headless body of the Knight stands beside her. 
THE KNIGHT'S HEAD

DARKNESS.  As the MAIN TITLES BEGIN, the theater thrums with a subsonic HISS which mounts in all the rattling power of THX, and we... 
BURN IN, BRIGHT LIVING COLOR: 
EXT. STRATOSPHERE - DAY 
The glory of stratospheric dawn.  The engines of a silver Lockheed U-2F rasp upon the trace oxygen here at 72,500 feet. Scattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of sea far, far below.  In the haze, the looming edge of land. 
SUPER: FLIGHT G-3101. OCTOBER 14TH, 1962. OVER CUBA. 
The spy plane's CAMERA DOORS whine open.  The glassy eye of the 36-inch camera focuses.  And then with a BANGBANGBANGBANG, its high-speed motor kicks in, shutter flying. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAY 
A simple CAMERA, snapping away furiously in the hands of a giggling MARK O'DONNELL, 4.  He's straddling and in the face of his dad, KENNY O'DONNELL, 30's, tough, Boston-Irish, with a prodigious case of morning hair.  Kenny awakens, red-eyed. 
HELEN (O.S.) Mark, get off your father! 
Kenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the O'Donnell house. 
KIDS screech, doors bang all over.  Kenny pushes Mark over, rolls out of bed, snatches up the corners of the blanket and hoists Mark over his shoulder in a screaming, kicking bundle. 
INT. O'DONNELL HALLWAY - DAY 
Kenny, with Mark in the bundle on his shoulder, meets his wife HELEN going the other way in the hall with LITTLE HELEN, 1, in her arms. 
KENNY Hi, hon. 
They kiss in passing.  Daughter KATHY, 12, races by in angry pursuit of her twin, KEVIN, 12. 
HELEN Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin.  You need to do something about this. 
KENNY Kids are supposed to get detention. 
Kenny dumps the bundle with Mark in a big pile of dirty laundry. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. MCCOY AIR FORCE BASE - FLORIDA - DAY 
A pair of massive FILM CANISTERS unlock and drop from the belly of the U-2.  TECHNICIANS secure them in orange carrying cases, lock them under key, fast and proficient.  They whisk them out from under the spy plane. 
The Technicians run for an idling Jeep.  They sling the cases into the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away hard, curving across the runway for another waiting plane. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - DAY 
A kitchen out of the late 1950's.  Kenny drinks coffee, ties a tie, rifles through a briefcase at the kitchen table.  The horde of kids, ages 2-14, breakfast on an array of period food.  Kenny grills the kids while he goes over papers. 
KENNY Secretary of Defense... 
KEVIN Dean Rusk! 
KENNY Wrong, and you get to wax my car. 
KENNY JR. smirk at Kevin. 
KENNY JR. Rusk is State, moron.  Robert McNamara. 
HELEN Got time for pancakes? 
KENNY Nope.  Attorney General? 
A PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse. 
KIDS (chorus) Too easy!  Bobby, Bobby Kennedy! 
Kenny glances up at the wall.  There are two phones, side by side.  One RED, one BLACK.  It's the black one ringing. Helen answers.  Kenny goes back to his papers. 
KENNY All right, wise guys, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. STEUART BUILDING - DAY 
A U.S. Navy truck lurches to a stop in front of the run-down, brick-faced seven-story Steuart Building on 5th and K.  Rear doors BANG open, and out hop two MARINE GUARDS, side arms drawn, film canisters in a carrying case between them. 
SUPER:  NATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION CENTER (NPIC), WASHINGTON D.C. 
As the Marines approach the building, front doors SLAM open. 
INT. OPERATIONS OFFICE, NPIC - DAY 
A bespectacled OPERATIONS MANAGER hands a clipboard to one of the big Marine Guards who in turn hands him a set of keys. The Manager unlocks the film cases.  PHOTO INTERPRETERS swoop in, whisk away the contents: SPOOLS OF FILM. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. O'DONNELL RESIDENCE - DAY 
KENNY Got the touch? 
POL #2 Yeah.  Still moldable, too. 
KENNY Everyone likes a good kid... 
And like that, a congressional candidate is made...  Kenny accelerates, leaving the Pols behind.  Suddenly, outside the windows, the crowd swells forward with a collective ROAR. 
CROWD MR. PRESIDENT!  PRESIDENT KENNEDY! 
EXT. HOTEL - DAY 
Kenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington Bureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way through the crowd for a police car on a side street. 
RESTON How's my favorite President? 
KENNY Busy.  But you've got his heart. 
RESTON I want an hour with him. 
KENNY I said his heart, not his attention. 
RESTON Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me. 
KENNY Well.  There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about. 
RESTON I'm doing a piece on Skybolt.  I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau. 
Kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is behind the wheel. 
KENNY We're giving the Brits Polaris instead. But a story'll just aggravate things. 
Scotty stares at Kenny, determined.  Kenny looks away.  And his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  She is talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  What they're saying is lost in the noise. 
Scotty follows Kenny's gaze.  Then the two men share a look, a silent understanding.  Kenny glances at the Secret Service guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman. 
KENNY (CONT'D) Not today.  He's got tight schedule. 
The Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful Woman.  Scotty acts like nothing has happened. 
RESTON Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it.  He can clear the air on Anglo American relations. 
KENNY Forget it, Scotty. 
RESTON Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you. 
The formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear.  He pretends to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car. 
KENNY All right, you're in.  Half hour. 
Reston's won.  But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel tough in the bargain.  People like Kenny. 
INT. POLICE CAR - DAY 
In the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade goers.  The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman. Disappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd. It's an eerie moment.  Something troubles Kenny, and he glances up at the sky.  A premonition.  But it's a clear, clear blue.  A day like this, all is right with the world... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. NPIC - NIGHT 
Six Interpreters huddle around IMAGES on a light table.  One of them shoulders his way into the group and THUMPS a black BINDER on the table.  There are grim nods of agreement. 
The book is open to a PICTURE of an SS-4 BALLISTIC MISSILE. A photo from Moscow Mayday parade.  An icon of the nuclear age escorted like some devil-god to a holocaust... 
END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE 
EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
The White House casts long shadows this gorgeous October morning.  Blue sky; the first flash of color in the trees. 
SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16TH, 1962.  DAY 1. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Briefcase and coat in hand, Kenny enters his office - and finds THREE MEN.  Standing there.  Thin-haired, bespectacled, academic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security Advisor.  The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS. 
Kenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black display cases.  And suddenly the world is slightly off kilter. 
KENNY Hey, Mac.  You're up bright and early. 
BUNDY No, Ken.  I need to see him now... 
INT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENTIAL FLOOR - DAY 
Kenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy.  They head down the long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail guarding the doors at the end.  But the familiar route feels strange, and lasting an eternity.  Kenny eyes the package under Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible. 
KENNY Morning, Floyd. 
SECRET SERVICE AGENT Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.  Mr. Bundy. 
The Agent opens the door.  Bundy pauses, Kenny with him. 
KENNY What's it about? 
BUNDY Cuba. 
Bundy is tense.  But Kenny relaxes. 
KENNY Just Cuba?  Okay, I got work to do, see you guys downstairs. 
INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
And they enter.  The group of men at the long, ornate Roosevelt-era table, rise as one. 
GROUP Good morning, Mr. President. 
THE PRESIDENT Good morning, gentlemen. 
And the doors close on the eighteen men of EXCOM: The Executive Committee of the National Security Council.  They are the legendary "Best and Brightest." 
The President makes his way down the line: shakes hands with Secretary of State DEAN RUSK, 53, distinguished, with a soft, Georgian accent, a distant reserve. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) Dean, good morning. 
RUSK Mr. President. 
The President leans past him, grasps the hand of the Secretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, a gifted managerial genius... the price of which is a cold, hard personality. 
THE PRESIDENT Bob.  Bet you had a late night. 
MCNAMARA Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President. 
OFF TO THE SIDE, Kenny greets Vice President LYNDON JOHNSON, 54, and ADLAI STEVENSON, 62, Representative to the U.N., intellectual, well-spoken. 
KENNY Lyndon.  Adlai. 
The silver-haired war hero and politically savvy Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff, GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, 50s, shakes the President's hand. 
THE PRESIDENT Max. 
GENERAL TAYLOR McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast.  Carter's here, though. 
He gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of Operations for the CIA.  Carter nods to the President. 
THE CAMERA PANS OVER THE OTHERS. 
DOUGLAS DILLON, ex-banker, Secretary of the Treasury. 
ROSWELL GILPATRIC, studious Deputy Secretary of Defense. 
PAUL NITZE, 55, the detail-driven facts man, Assistant Secretary of Defense. 
GEORGE BALL, 50s, Undersecretary of State.  Eloquent, a man of conscience. 
U. ALEXIS JOHNSON, Deputy Under Secretary of State. 
EDWARD MARTIN, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America. 
LLEWELLYN THOMPSON, laid back, rumpled Soviet Affairs Advisor. 
DON WILSON, Deputy Director of the USIA. 
The President sits down at the center of the table, Rusk and McNamara to either side, and the others resume their seats. Bobby takes one of the over-stuffed chairs at the table. 
Kenny finds one along the wall behind the President, under the windows to the Rose Garden to TED SORENSEN, 30s, the President's legal counsel and speech writer.  They greet each other coolly. 
KENNY Ted. 
SORENSEN Kenny. 
The room falls silent.  The President looks across the table to GENERAL CARTER. 
THE PRESIDENT Okay.  Let's have it. 
GENERAL CARTER Arthur Lundahl heads our photographic interpretation division at CIA.  I'll let him and his boys take you through what we've got.  Arthur? 
Lundahl, standing at the end of the room with briefing boards, steps forward with a pointer. 
LUNDAHL Gentlemen, as most of you now know a U-2 over Cuba on Sunday morning took a series of disturbing photographs. 
SWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO: 
EXT. MISSILE SITE - LOS PALACIOS, CUBA - DAY 
The sweltering Cuban countryside.  Shouting SOVIET ROCKET TROOPS, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete a clearing under scattered, limp palm trees. 
LUNDAHL (V.O.) Our analysis at NPIC indicates the Soviet Union has followed its conventional weapons build-up in Cuba with the introduction of surface-to surface medium-range ballistic missiles, or MRBMs.  Our official estimate at this time is that this missile system is the SS-4 Sandal.  We do not believe these missiles are as yet operational. 
A bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth.  FILLING THE SCREEN.  A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in the bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded cargo. 
INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY 
Lundahl raps his second board: a map of the United States, Cuba visible in the lower corner.  An ARC is drawn clearly across the U.S., encompassing the entire Southeast. 
LUNDAHL IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a 3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles.  So far we have identified 32 missiles served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly all Soviet personnel.  Our cities and military installations in the Southeast, as far north as Washington, are in range of these weapons, and in the event of a launch, would only have five minutes of warning. 
GENERAL CARTER Five minutes, gentlemen.  Five minutes. 
GENERAL TAYLOR In those five minutes they could kill 80 million Americans and destroy a significant number of our bomber bases, degrading our retaliatory options.  The Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is a massively destabilizing move, upsetting the nuclear balance. 
The President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word. 
THE PRESIDENT Arthur.  Are. You. Sure? 
Lundahl looks around the room.  Everyone is hanging. 
LUNDAHL Yes, Mr. President.  These are nuclear missiles. 
The men come to grips with their own fears, own anger. 
Kenny snorts a laugh.  Bobby shoots him a cross look. 
KENNY EXCOM.  Has a ring to it.  Like F-Troop. 
The President stops.  Bobby and Kenny stop, too. 
THE PRESIDENT Okay.  Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into.  Impress us. And do it fast. (to Kenny) You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them. 
KENNY Then we need to do a few things right away.  No Pierre.  He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule - your movements are followed too closely.  And we need to get these guys out of the White House.  George Ball's got a conference room at State. (to Bobby) Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight. 
Bobby nods. 
BOBBY I think we should bring in Dean Acheson. He was fighting Soviets while we were still working the wards in Boston. 
The President nods his approval.  Looks at Kenny. 
THE PRESIDENT Find him, Kenny.  We're going to need all the help we can get. 
INT. WEST WING - HALL OUTSIDE PRESS OFFICE - DAY 
Kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of hallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing.  Suddenly, Scotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny. 
RESTON Hey, Kenny!  Who died? 
Kenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a window.  A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window. Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES. 
A flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast. 
KENNY Way it's going, the Democratic Party. DNC strategy session.  If you can call it that. 
Scotty chuckles.  Kenny moves off, leading him away.  Kenny's assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper. 
ASSISTANT Sir? 
Kenny tries to look him away. 
RESTON It's Tuesday.  You said to call.  When do I get my 45 minutes? 
KENNY Tell you what.  We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff.  I'll get you up front with him during the flight. 
RESTON Deal. 
ASSISTANT Sir. 
Kenny turns, harsh 
KENNY What is it? 
The Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue.  Kenny takes the slips. 
ASSISTANT The number you asked for. 
KENNY I ask for a lot of 'em.  Whose is it? 
ASSISTANT Dean Acheson's, sir. 
That shuts Kenny up.  Reston eyes the slip, then looks to Kenny's face.  And he knows something isn't right here. 
KENNY Gotta go, Scotty.  See you tomorrow. 
INT. TREASURY BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT 
A car jolts to a stop.  The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament revealing half of EXCOM inside.  Kenny stands nearby waiting for them. 
The doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns: Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen, Stevenson, and Nitze.  They're sitting in each others' laps, banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense. 
BOBBY Screw secrecy.  You try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from Foggy Bottom. 
MCNAMARA You were excited.  I say no more. 
The gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage. 
INT. TUNNEL TO WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
A steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel.  It's the infamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House. Kenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others. 
BOBBY Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out.  It's too slow, and they'll have the missiles finished. 
Kenny looks at him.  Then there's only one alternative.  The CAMERA wipes through the ceiling to: 
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
GROUND LEVEL.  Where the brilliantly-lit flag flutters over the spotlit White House: their destination. 
INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT 
GENERAL WALTER 'CAM' SWEENEY, head of Tactical Air Command, stands at the head of the table with a presentation board. The men of EXCOM gather around Sweeney in their rumpled shirts, nursing coffee and cigarettes. 
GENERAL SWEENEY We have 850 planes assembling at Homestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill, Patrick, Pensacola and Key West. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. HOMESTEAD AFB - FLORIDA - NIGHT 
An F-100 Super Sabre stands under lights on a taxiway.  The CAMERA DESCENDS FROM ITS OVERHEAD SHOT, discovering the aircraft's sleek cockpit, menacing tiger-jaw paint job, the four 20mm cannons on its nose. 
GENERAL SWEENEY (V.O.) Due to the tropical foliage, the OPLAN calls for high-explosive and napalm loadouts for our ground attack sorties. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
RESUME 
Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots, discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain. 
The President returns from his desk, shirt untucked, disheveled, back stiff.  He eases into his rocking chair. Bobby lies sprawled on the couch.  Kenny sits down.  They all look at each other.  A beat, something like shock. 
KENNY Jesus Christ Almighty... 
They burst out laughing.  An absurd, tension draining moment. They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills. 
KENNY (CONT'D) Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing. 
THE PRESIDENT Acheson's scenario is unacceptable.  And he has more experience than anyone. 
KENNY There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man. 
The President stares Kenny in the face, understanding. 
THE PRESIDENT The thing is, Acheson's right.  Talk alone won't accomplish anything. 
Kenny considers the President, his face straight as he says: 
KENNY Then let's bomb the shit out of them. Everyone wants to, even you, even me. (there's a point) It sure would feel good. 
The President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional response, not necessarily the intelligent one. 
BOBBY Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong. 
KENNY He's right.  And things are happening too fast.  It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again. 
Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee table. 
BOBBY As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house. 
THE PRESIDENT Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line.  The invasion would succeed.  Castro would be gone.  Just like that.  Easy. 
The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain.  Kenny and Bobby aver their eyes.  When it passes, the President is hushed, grave. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) There's something...immoral about abandoning your own judgement. 
Kenny nods, moved.  The President reaches out for the reconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through.  Bobby hands them to him.  The President looks them over.  And when he speaks, there's humility.  And resolve. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) We can't let things get ahead of themselves.  We've got to control what happens. We're going to do what we have to make this come out right.  EXCOM is our first weapon. (beat) We'll resort to others as we need 'em. 
EXT. AIRPORT - BRIDGEPOINT, CONNECTICUT - DAY 
SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH.  DAY 2 
A LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed platform.  The President, barely recognizable at the distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it, smiling. 
Kenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the crowd. 
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.) Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to work today? 
The crowd goes nuts.  Kenny paces, checks his watch, impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.  Kenny gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with half the White House press corps suckered along.  Scotty catches Kenny's look. 
Kenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over.  The President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny. 
RESTON Kenny!  What happened?  They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time. 
KENNY He was. 
RESTON Yeah?  Who was he talking to?  Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on.  What's Acheson doing in town?  And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War. 
KENNY Why don't you ask him yourself?  You can have him on the way home. 
RESTON I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me.  You can influence how this thing unfolds. 
But Kenny stands there, mute.  Reston just shakes his head, knowing for sure something's up.  He turns and heads back for the press corps. 
EXT. STAIRS TO AIR FORCE ONE - DAY 
Kenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential plane, the crowd cheering him.  He gives a final wave. 
THE PRESIDENT Let's get out of here. 
KENNY Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day. 
INT. GEORGE BALL'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
EXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the State Department.  Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head of the table, very, very alone.  All eyes are on him. 
BOBBY No.  No.  No.  There is more than one option here.  If one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard enough. 
McNamara squirms.  The others react in frustration.  CIA chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh. 
MCCONE Sometimes there is only one right choice, and you thank God when it's clear. 
BOBBY You're talking about a sneak attack! How'll that make us look?  Big country blasting a little one into the stone age.  We'll be real favorites around the world. 
ACHESON Bobby, that's naive.  This is the real world, you know that better than anybody.  Your argument is ridiculous. 
MCCONE You weren't so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing Castro over at CIA. 
And there's nothing Bobby can say to that.  He props himself up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its shiny surface somewhere.  There is only the reflection of his own face. 
BOBBY I can't let my brother go down in History like a villain, like a Tojo, ordering another Pearl Harbor. 
McCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look.  The last resistance to airstrikes is crumbling.  Finally, Bobby looks up at McNamara. 
ADLAI There is a third option.  With either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war.  It seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward. 
He smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone. 
ADLAI (CONT'D) So I guess I'll be.  Our third choice is to cut a deal.  We trade Guantanamo and our missiles in Turkey, get them to pull their missiles out.  We employ a back channel, attribute the idea to U Thant. U Thant then raises it at the U.N. 
Adlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony gazes.  From McCone and General Taylor, contempt.  Dead silence for a long, long beat. 
Kenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man commit political suicide.  Even Sorensen, standing behind him, unconsciously moves away.  At last the President speaks. 
THE PRESIDENT I don't think that's possible, Adlai. (beat, to the room) I will be asking the networks for air time Monday night.  I have not yet made my final decision.  We will announce our course of action then.  I want to thank you all for your advice, gentlemen. 
EXT. TRUMAN BALCONY - DAY 
Kenny, Bobby, and the President lean on the railing of the Truman Balcony, stare out at the city. 
BOBBY Goddman Stevenson.  Jesus.  Peace at any price.  You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two. 
THE PRESIDENT Somebody had to say it.  I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser. 
BOBBY We have to pull him.  He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N.  Zorin will eat him alive. 
THE PRESIDENT We've got bigger problems right now. 
KENNY We have to try the blockades.  It probably won't work.  It may just be delaying the inevitable.  But we can't just go to war without trying not to. 
THE PRESIDENT I don't know.  I don't know. 
He stares out at the Ellipse where a little-league football game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the CHILDREN, so alive, floating to them on the wind. 
EXT. PATIO - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A crowded D.C. party spills out of Jim Rowe's house onto his patio.  Kenny steps INTO FRAME.  He looks at the PARTYGOERS, the Washington social set.  He stands out, oppressed by the knowledge he's unable to share.  He takes a stiff drink. 
Suddenly out of the house totters Adlai, highball in hand. Glassy-eyed, he grins at Kenny and joins him. 
ADLAI Just can't get away from you guys. Escaping for a night on the town, eh? 
KENNY As the town's most popular playboy, the President felt my presence would be sorely missed.  So in the interests of National Security... 
Kenny shrugs.  Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes. 
ADLAI Gotta keep up appearances.  Of course, I don't care anymore.  I'm a political dead man.  You ever seen a man cut his own throat like I did today? 
Kenny has no answer to that.  He looks down, pained for Adlai. 
ADLAI (CONT'D) Well, it's all right. (beat) I came to tell you, just talked to a friend.  Reston and Frankel have the story.  It's going to run tomorrow. 
INT. BEDROOM - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - LATER 
Kenny, shut in the bedroom, paces on the phone. 
KENNY We're not going to make it to Monday. I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're going to have to call Orville Dryfoos. This is the sort of decision the publisher makes himself. 
INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
New York Times publisher ORVILLE DRYFOOS sits at his kitchen table in his underwear, still half-asleep, phone to his ear. 
DRYFOOS Yes, sir, I understand.  But we held on Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  What makes this any different? 
INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The President, on the phone, stops pacing by his bedside table and exhales. 
THE PRESIDENT I'm asking you to hold the story until I can present our course of action on Monday night. 
INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
DRYFOOS All right.  But I need a reason to give my boys.  They're going to be screaming for my head on a plate. 
INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
THE PRESIDENT Orville.  I want you to tell them this: they'll be saving lives.  Maybe even including their own. 
INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
At that, Dryfoos sits up.  Serious.  All resistance gone. 
DRYFOOS Yes, Mr. President. 
INT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY 
SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 21ST.  DAY 6 
AVE MARIA soars over the communion meditation at a crowded Sunday mass.  Kenny, in a pew, glances off to his left. 
The President sits nearby, head bowed.  But Kenny knows he's not thinking about the mass.  And when the President at last lifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise. 
The President has made up his mind... 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Bobby barges into Kenny's office.  Kenny, knowing his unique entry, doesn't bother to look up. 
KENNY Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us; haven't heard from anyone else yet. 
Kenny finally looks up.  Bobby's grim.  And an icicle forms in Kenny's gut as Bobby relays. 
BOBBY He wants to talk to LeMay again. 
-- the voice of the Essex battlegroup: sparkling, alive, a constellation of lights scattered across the sea.  One by one the escort ships answer the carrier's SIREN with their own wailing cries, an alien chorus among the ships, disappearing and reappearing in the swells.  The communication crescendos to its fever pitch -- 
-- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout.  Like a dying universe, the answering sirens cut off, the life-lights wink out, and an appalling darkness falls across the sea... 
FADE OUT 
BLACKNESS, LIKE BEFORE A CURTAIN RISES.  And then a flickering: a FLUORESCENT LIGHT COMES ON. 
INT. BATHROOM - WEST WING - DAY 
SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23RD.  DAY 8 
Kenny, stripped to the waist, Sorensen and Bundy shave in nearby sinks.  Bobby barges in. 
BOBBY We're getting the Soviet response. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Specks of shaving cream still on his face, Kenny paces, reads the inky carbon as Bobby, Bundy and Sorensen read copies. 
KENNY This is all rhetoric. (realizing) They don't know how to respond yet. 
Kenny looks up.  The President enters from the Oval Office. 
THE PRESIDENT So now you're Khurschev.  What do you do? 
INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY 
Kenny, arms folded, stands behind the President, the rest of EXCOM is looking at him. 
KENNY -- run the blockade.  They'll run the blockade. 
ADMIRAL GEORGE ANDERSON, 50s, dapper, the Chief of Naval Operations, nods from the far end of the table. 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President.  We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow. 
MCNAMARA We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier.  If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine. 
MCCONE Or they could use it as an excuse to escalate. 
BOBBY Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not stop, what exactly are our rules of engagement? 
Anderson signals A BRIEFING OFFICER who hits the lights and an overhead projector which SMASH CUTS TO: 
INT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE - DAY 
The bridge of the U.S.S. John Pierce, a Gearing class destroyer.  A RADIO OPERATOR addresses a mike in Russian. 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.) Russian-speakers have been transferred to all of our ships.  Once the quarantine takes effect in the morning, our ships will attempt to make radio contact with the approaching vessels. They will be ordered to reduce speed and prepare for inspection. 
INT. WEAPONS' LOCKER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY 
MARINES in flak jackets grab M-16s off a rack, race by. 
EXT. U.S.S. PIERCE - AFT DECK - DAY 
A ship's boat full of Marines lowers away, hits the water, engine spraying as it launches forward - in dress rehearsal. 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.) An inspection party will then board and search the ship.  If weapons are found, the ship will be ordered to leave the quarantine area or be towed into port upon refusal. 
INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY 
All eyes are on Admiral Anderson's overhead projections. Bobby, restless, gets up, begins pacing. 
BOBBY What happens if the ship doesn't stop for inspection or want to be towed? 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON A warning shot will be fired across its bow. 
Bobby stops, stares directly at the Admiral. 
BOBBY And what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot? 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON Then we fire at its rudder, disable it, and carry out the inspection. 
Kenny looks at the President who remains unmoved, unreadable. 
THE PRESIDENT There will be no shooting without my explicit orders.  Is that understood? 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON Yes, sir. 
The President glances at McNamara. 
THE PRESIDENT Well, Admiral, it looks like it's up to the Navy. 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON The Navy won't let you down, sir. 
THE PRESIDENT General, have we developed any more information on the missiles? 
GENERAL TAYLOR They are continuing to proceed with the development.  We're commencing low-level photography runs this morning. 
MCCONE The pictures will be used to firm up our estimates of the missiles' readiness and develop target packages for strikes should you order them. 
GENERAL TAYLOR Our guy running this show is the best. Commander Bill Ecker of the Navy's VFP 62, the Fightin' Photo.  Something of a character, but the highest efficiency ratings we've ever had. 
He pushes Ecker's personnel file across the table, and as the President opens it, on ECKER'S PHOTO, we SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. READY ROOM - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY 
The man himself, COMMANDER BILL ECKER, 30s, playing cards, smoking cigars with his wingman, LIEUTENANT BRUCE WILHEMY and the PILOTS of VFP-62, the 'Fightin' Photo.'  They lounge, tinker with equipment.  Their ready room is filled with pin ups, movie posters, and all things photographic. 
Suddenly, the door opens and a pale DUTY SERGEANT enters. 
DUTY SERGEANT Sir...telephone, sir. 
INT. DUTY OFFICE - DAY 
Ecker enters, marches over to the phone.  All the SOLDIERS in the room stare at him.  Ecker wiggles his cigar to a corner of his mouth, picks up, styling. 
ECKER VFP-62, Fightin' Photo, here.  But what we really want to do is direct. 
INTERCUT CALL TO: 
INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS 
Margaret works her magic. 
MARGARET This is the White House Operator.  Hold for the President. 
INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Ecker blinks, becomes a mild lamb. 
ECKER Oh shit. 
INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS 
MARGARET Honey, you don't know what shit is. 
BEGIN INTERCUT 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Kenny, sitting on his desk, taps his fingers, looks at the phone.  He's kept Ecker on hold long enough - and picks up. 
KENNY Commander, my name is Ken O'Donnell. Special Assistant to the President. 
INTERCUT CALL TO: 
INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Ecker exhales.  It's not the President, but Ecker is so shaken up it might as well be. 
ECKER Yes, sir. 
KENNY (O.S.) The President has instructed me to pass along an order to you. (beat) You are not to get shot down. 
Did he hear right? 
ECKER Uh... we'll do our best, sir. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
KENNY I don't think you understand me correctly.  You are not to get shot down under any circumstances.  Whatever happens up there, you were not shot at. Mechanical failures are fine; crashing into mountains, fine.  But you and your men are not to be shot at, fired at, launched upon. 
INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Ecker sits down in a chair, sobered. 
ECKER Excuse me, sir, what's going on here? 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Kenny stands, drops the hard nose bullshit. 
KENNY Commander, if you are fired upon, the President will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you.  He doesn't want to have to do that.  It's very important that he doesn't, or things could go very badly out of control. 
INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Ecker lets out a long breath. 
ECKER I think I understand.  What about my men?  If it comes up hot and heavy, and we don't have anyone to protect us... I'm going to be writing letters to parents.  I hate writing letters to parents. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Kenny nods to himself, feeling.  He's done it himself. 
KENNY If the President protects you, Commander, he may have to do it with the Bomb. 
INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Ecker doesn't want to be avenged with atomic weapons.  No sane person would. 
KENNY (V.O.) I've known the man for fifteen years. The problem is, he will protect you.  So I'm asking: don't make him protect you. Don't get shot at. 
Ecker down, deeply affected.  Suddenly, A BELL RINGS.  A TELETYPE goes off.  Ecker knows it's for him.  His orders. 
ECKER Okay, Mr. O'Donnell.  We'll do what we can. 
END INTERCUT. 
As Ecker hangs up, the Duty Officer rips off the ORDERS, hands them to Ecker, who takes one look, then gazes out the window at the runway -- 
EXT. RUNWAY - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY 
A CART speeds down the flight line past the waiting F8U-1P Corsairs.  One by one, the four pilots accompanying Ecker and Wilhemy jump off to mount their planes.  The cart still moving. 
ECKER Get that fuel assayed? 
WILHEMY Yeah.  It sucks.  Ain't for high performance babies like ours.  Shoulda brought some from home, but what can you do?  Last-second deployments... 
And sees the long, canvas-covered objects on the ground.  The missiles.  They draw closer. 
ECKER (CONT'D) Camera. 
A steel fragment CRACKS his window, obscuring our view. 
ECKER (CONT'D) Action. 
And he thumbs the CAMERA SWITCH.  All twelve B-system cameras begin banging away like cannons. 
EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY 
TRACERS lace the air between the two planes as they blast over the missile site.  Over trailers.  Over tents.  Over trucks.  Over trenches.  Over bulldozers. 
And then they're out over forest again.  It's all over in seconds.  The triple-A stops.  In unison, the two planes bank right, heading for the distant blue, blue sea. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kenny paces by the phone.  It rings.  He picks up, listens, reacts.  Relief.  And we know the planes have made it back. 
EXT. RUNWAY - CECIL FIELD, FLA. - DAY 
Ecker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to his battered, pock-marked plane.  Wilhemy and the GROUND CREW CHIEF come running up, the Chief letting out a whistle. 
GROUND CREW CHIEF Lookit what daddy done brung home. 
WILHEMY You shoulda seen it, Chief, they -- 
ECKER -- damn sparrows.  Must've been migrating.  Guess I hit a couple hundred. (to Wilhemy, stern) How many did you hit, Bruce? 
Wilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make of him.  The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more impressed GROUND CREW come up. 
WILHEMY A few.  I guess. 
GROUND CREW CHIEF Was them 20 or 40 million sparrows? 
Ecker, sweat-plastered and foul, steps into the Chief's face. 
ECKER Those are bird strikes.  Sparrows to be precise.  Got a problem with that? 
The Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time, and shakes his head, 'No.'  Ecker takes the Chief's maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker: BIRD STRIKES.  He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and walks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
In Kenny's credenza, a small black and white T.V. plays. WALTER CRONKITE narrates on the television as a train laden with TANKS on flatbeds pulls out of a station. 
WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) Massive military preparations are underway throughout the southeast in what Pentagon officials are confirming is the largest mobilization since Korea. The railways have been nationalized to assist in the deployment, here transporting elements of the U.S. 1st Armored Division from Ft. Hood, Texas. 
A PHONE RINGS.  Kenny turns from the T.V., turns down Walter Cronkite, as he answers. 
KENNY Yeah? 
INT. OAS MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
George Ball stands at the back of a crowded room filled with applauding OAS DELEGATES.  It's for Rusk, at a podium up front. 
BALL Kenny.  The vote just came down. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY 
Kenny opens his door, lets Rusk in.  The President, Bobby and half of EXCOM look up.  Rusk stands there somber. 
RUSK Unanimous.  One abstenation. 
And then he breaks into a huge grin.  Everyone cheers him. 
THE PRESIDENT About time something went our way. 
An Assistant enters behind Kenny.  Kenny senses him, turns as the others move to shake hands with Rusk. 
ASSISTANT Telephone, Mr. O'Donnell. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kenny, grinning, ducks back into his office, closes the door after the Assistant leaves.  He picks up the phone. 
KENNY Hello? 
INTERCUT CALL TO: 
INT. READY ROOM - CECIL FIELD - DAY 
Ecker stands at a phone, stares out a window at a replacement plane being fueled.  A Crusader, not his shot-up one. 
ECKER Mr. O'Donnell, I've been ordered to deliver the film to the Pentagon personally.  What's going on? 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Kenny thinks fast.  Oh shit. 
KENNY The Chiefs must want to talk to you. (beat) Listen to me, Commander, they'll want to know if you were fired on.  Were you? 
ECKER (O.S.) You could say that, sir. 
KENNY Commander.  Do not, under any circumstances, tell the Chiefs. 
END INTERCUT 
INT. PENTAGON - DAY 
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Kenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the North Entrance.  The cool air invigorates him.  He eyes the fence, Pennsylvania Avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world from the living city beyond.  He starts for the main gate. 
EXT. MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS 
A WHITE HOUSE POLICE OFFICER jumps up as Kenny approaches. 
POLICE OFFICER Would you like me to call a car, Mr. O'Donnell. 
Kenny checks his watch. 
KENNY How long will it take to get someone up? 
POLICE OFFICER Fifteen minutes, maybe.  To your house, sir? 
Kenny considers, shakes his head.  He wants to go home, but... 
KENNY No.  No, I'll let her sleep.  Let 'em sleep. 
Kenny says it with a certain finality.  The Police Officer nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering the weight of the world. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Kenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the White House.  A 24-hour drug store's doors are open.  He pauses. 
Inside, a knot of PEOPLE - late-night deliverymen, a cop, the store employees - talk in undertones at the counter.  Behind it, a T.V. is signing off with the national anthem.  Sober voices, sober looks.  Kenny moves on. 
EXT. NEWS STAND - NIGHT 
A cluster of COLLEGE STUDENTS talk at a news stand.  They're waiting for the NEWSIE to cut the bands of the next day's Washington Post, the bundles just being thrown to the sidewalk from the delivery truck.  Kenny approaches. 
In their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem so young, Kenny so old.  Kenny buys a newspaper, its dire headlines, every story about the crisis. 
EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT 
Kenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street. Up ahead, the lights are on in a Catholic Church.  Lines of CHURCHGOERS are at the door.  Kenny stops, surprised at the sight this late.  And then he sees the hand-painted banner: CONFESSIONS 24 HOURS.  PRAY FOR PEACE. 
Kenny is moved.  He glances over his shoulder, and then... joins the line himself. 
INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY 
Kenny's WATCH reads one minute til ten o'clock.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
Kenny, standing just inside the open doors to the White House Situation Room, a state-of-the-art conference room.  A long, central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and screens built in.  T.V. monitors hang from the ceilings in the corners.  There are no windows, just oppressive bunker like walls.  It's far underground. 
Across the room the President paces, phone in hand.  Half of EXCOM is in their seats.  The other half, along with a steady stream of DUTY OFFICERS, are coming and going.  Kenny steps aside for a Duty Officer, listens to the President. 
THE PRESIDENT Okay, Bob, I'm putting you on intercom. 
Suddenly, McNamara's VOICE fills the room. 
MCNAMARA (O.S.) Hey, guys, can you hear me? 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - DAY 
McNamara stands, phone in hand. 
MCNAMARA I have one minute til ten here -- 
THE CAMERA TRACKS AROUND HIM, REVEALING: 
A large, elaborate war room, like Mission Control.  Big screens, plexiglass tracking boards, tiered banks of communications equipment.  A massive LIGHT TABLE on the floor at the center of the room projects a map of the Caribbean and Atlantic.  Arcing across it is a RED LINE: the blockade. 
The map is covered with cryptic military notations; WATCH OFFICERS on a platform which swings out over it update the latest ship positions. 
McNamara's in a booth overlooking the room.  It's open to the next tier below where Admiral Anderson is giving orders. 
MCNAMARA (CONT'D) -- and no sign of them stopping. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY 
Kenny and Bobby move to the President's end of the table, sit down across from each other in mirror-image fashion.  EXCOM looks to the President.  The second hand of the clock on the wall wheels past 12.  A hush falls over the room. 
THE PRESIDENT Bob, the quarantine is now in effect. 
INT. FLAG PLOT - DAY 
McNamara is mute for a beat.  He turns to view the big room. 
MCNAMARA Then it looks like our first customers are the Gagarin and Kimovsk. 
He nods to Admiral Anderson, who calls an order down to a Watch Officer on the floor, and on screens all around the room, a sector of the map MAGNIFIES the unfolding encounter -- 
EXT. BRIDGE WING - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY 
-- between the destroyer, U.S.S. Pierce and the SOVIET FREIGHTERS Gagarin and Kimovsk.  The Pierce's bridge wings are crammed with helmeted OFFICERS and LOOKOUTS.  They peer through binoculars at the distant ships, plowing ahead, straight for them.  The CAPTAIN lowers his binoculars, determined. 
CAPTAIN Helm, shape heading for intercept, zero one zero.  All ahead full -- 
OFFICER (O.S.) -- new contact!  New contact! 
Everyone whirls to the bridge.  The Captain steps forward. 
INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY 
The Captain ducks into the CIC.  The CHIEF SONARAN reports. 
MCCONE (CONT'D) Mr. President! 
The hubub dies away. 
MCCONE (CONT'D) Sir, we have the tally from NSA.  We have twenty ships stopping and or turning around.  Six, however, appear to be continuing for the line.  Including the Gagarin and Kimovsk. 
The elation goes out of the room.  Kenny looks at the President.  The President picks up the phone again. 
THE PRESIDENT Captain, have the ships you're observing changed course? 
CAPTAIN (O.S.) No, Mr. President.  They've just crossed the quarantine line. 
Bobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing. 
BOBBY It's an accident.  They must not have gotten their orders yet.  Let 'em go. 
GENERAL TAYLOR Unlikely, Mr. President.  We've been monitoring transmissions from both the Gagarin and Kimovsk.  Their radios are working fine. 
MCCONE One ship, an accident maybe.  Six: this is intentional. 
The President looks to Bobby.  He has no answer.  Kenny's mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense, suddenly understanding in a flash of insight: 
KENNY They're right.  This is intentional. 
He glances around the room.  All of EXCOM is looking at him. Bobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed. 
KENNY (CONT'D) Khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which are carrying contraband, and he's letting the ones which aren't go through, hoping for an incident.  I think we should let them go. 
Bobby relaxes.  Around the table there are nods. 
MCCONE If we do, it erodes the credibility of the quarantine.  He'll just send more through tomorrow. 
The President looks at Kenny. 
KENNY Then we deal with it tomorrow.  But today he's stopped most of them.  He's done something smart here.  We gave him an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of it, preserving just enough room to save face.  We need to do something just as smart now. 
Bobby's nodding, following the argument.  Kenny looks around the room for support. 
INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS 
McNamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in. 
MCNAMARA Mr. President, I agree.  Let them go. Four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line.  They've stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard. It would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The President holds Kenny's gaze, then lifts the phone. 
THE PRESIDENT Captain, I want you to maintain contact with those ships.  Do nothing until I order otherwise.  Is that clear? 
CAPTAIN (O.S.) Yes, Mr. President.  Contact only. 
He hangs up, turns to Kenny. 
THE PRESIDENT I hope you're right. 
EXT. SOUTH LAWN - DAY 
Kenny, Bobby and the President make their way across the lawn, out of earshot of the building. 
BOBBY What happened to speak when spoken to? 
KENNY Give it a rest.  You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat. 
Bobby likes getting under Kenny's skin.  Bobby aims a punch at his head which Kenny knocks away.  The President changes gear, serious. 
THE PRESIDENT We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships.  But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles. 
KENNY Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too. 
BOBBY We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right. 
THE PRESIDENT McNamara's on his way back here now.  We need to pick the right ship.  No subs. No armed boarding parties either.  We need a little more time to figure this one out. 
KENNY Then let's move the quarantine line. 
It's a simple suggestion.  The President considers him a beat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads for them.  The three friends assume their more reserved, political faces as he comes up. 
MCNAMARA Mr. President.  Bobby.  Kenny.  The Essex battle group has the Gagarin, Kimovsk and the sub escort under their thumb.  We've got a few hours now before we need to worry about any more flashpoints on the line. (beat) We could use a few more hours.  I think we should consider moving the quarantine line back to 500 miles. 
Bobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of Svengali.  Kenny just stands there, poker faced. 
INT. WEST WING - DAY 
Kenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn. They stride down the hall, side by side. 
KENNY Moving the line.  Stroke of genius. 
MCNAMARA (snappish) Of course it is.  But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually. 
They turn a corner, silence for a beat. 
KENNY The Chiefs are looking for a provocation out there.  The President's going to come under enormous pressure.  You have to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob. 
McNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look. 
MCNAMARA You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby.  The President doesn't have to double-barrel me. 
KENNY Listen to me, goddamn it.  We're talking about a possible nuclear war.  You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs -- 
Bundy turns back to him. 
BUNDY Thank God.  Look, everyone is furious about it.  We trade away our missiles in Turkey and we're fucked politically. 
Kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything.  He agrees. Bundy steps up to him, confiding. 
BUNDY (CONT'D) You gotta stop 'em.  We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea - they leaked it to Lippman.  The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone. 
KENNY Then they should speak up. 
BUNDY Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy. 
KENNY Yes it is. 
BUNDY No it isn't.  They don't trust the people that feel this way.  But these people are right.  And the Kennedys are wrong. (beat) We need you to tell 'em, Kenny.  They'll listen to you. 
Kenny prickles, intense, but Bundy presses on, too wrapped up in his own thinking to notice. 
BUNDY (CONT'D) Jack and Bobby are good men.  But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to -- 
KENNY -- You listen to me.  Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way.  You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys.  They may be wrong.  They make mistakes.  But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds. 
BUNDY You know I don't mean they're weak. 
Kenny gets in his face, intimidating. 
KENNY No, they just lack 'moral toughness.' And you think I'll play your Judas.  You WASPS and blue-bloods never understood us, thinking we want into your club. Well we got our own club now. (beat) And you guys don't realize fighting with each other is our way.  Nobody plays us off each other.  And nobody ever gets between us... 
INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting area, newspaper in hand.  The President, buttoning his shirt in a full-length mirror, sees him.  There's a TV on.  The President selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper. 
THE PRESIDENT What's that? 
KENNY Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba. 
The President's eyes flick over to him in the mirror. 
THE PRESIDENT I don't want to listen to this again. 
KENNY If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again.  We'll get clobbered in world opinion. 
THE PRESIDENT It's a goddman trial balloon.  Trial is the operative word, here. 
KENNY Then somebody'd better deny it publicly. 
The President turns around, heads over to the T.V.  Kenny folds his arms, disgusted. 
THE PRESIDENT Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution. 
KENNY Yeah, a good political solution. 
ON THE T.V. 
Live coverage of the United Nations Security Council meetings.  Holding forth in Russian is VALERIAN ZORIN, 50s, tough, likeable, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.N. and chairman of the Security Council.  A translator relays the meaning. 
TRANSLATOR FOR ZORIN (O.S.) We call on the world to condemn the piratical actions of America... 
RESUME 
The President's jaw tightens.  He turns to Kenny. 
THE PRESIDENT You want to turn up the heat?  You call Adlai.  Tell him to stick it to Zorin. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kenny, phone to his ear, suffers as Bobby harangues him. 
BOBBY Adlai's too weak!  We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there. 
KENNY You can't take him out this late in the game. 
BOBBY Zorin will eat him alive! 
KENNY Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble. 
BOBBY What's gotten into you? 
Kenny throws the Lippman article at him. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) Oh, still sore about this. 
KENNY Something your father would've come up with. 
Silence.  Terrible silence.  That paralyzes Bobby.  Kenny stares at him.  He means it, but regrets it, too. 
BOBBY My father -- 
KENNY -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad. 
But Bobby gets it.  Kenny shifts gears, lets it go. 
KENNY (CONT'D) Adlai can handle Zorin.  He knows the inning and the score. 
BOBBY He better.  Because nobody thinks he's up to this.  Nobody. 
INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - DAY 
The U.S. suite is in frantic preparation, STAFFERS coming and going.  Stevenson takes his phone from a SECRETARY. 
ADLAI (CONT'D) And let me say something else.  Those weapons must be taken out of Cuba.  You, the Soviet Union, have created this new danger, not the United States. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
EXCOM is transfixed by the continuing debate. 
BUNDY Come on, Adlai! 
They all crowd the T.V. as if it were a title fight.  Except for Bobby.  Kenny glances over at him.  He has the phone pinned between his ear and shoulder.  Kenny looks back to the T.V. 
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 
Adlai fixes Zorin in his seat, his voice rising. 
ADLAI Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other day you did not deny the existence of these weapons.  But today, again, if I heard you correctly, you now say they do not exist. 
Zorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but doesn't respond, acts bored.  It gets Adlai's goat, and he begins to lose his cool.  A rumble from the U.N.  The CAMERA FINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
EXCOM is worried. 
RUSK Come on, Adlai, don't let him off! 
BOBBY John?  It's Bobby.  Get ready to send your staffer in.  He's going to be coming out. 
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 
But Adlai's tremors are not tremors of fear.  They are tremors of anger.  His voice goes hard and cold. 
ADLAI All right, sir.  Let me ask you one simple question.  Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in Cuba?  Yes or no - don't wait for the translation - yes or no? 
The diplomatic world GASPS as Adlai drops all pretense of civility, all statesman-like grace. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
EXCOM's excitement mounts.  In the chorus urging Adlai on, we find Kenny edge toward the screen. 
KENNY Yeah.  Yeah. 
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 
Zorin shoots Adlai a testy look. 
ZORIN I am not in an American courtroom, sir, and therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor puts questions.  In due course, sir, you will have your answer. 
There's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a tete.  The RUMBLE in the room grows louder. 
ADLAI You are in the courtroom of world opinion right now, and you can answer yes or no.  You have denied they exist, and I want to know if I have understood you correctly. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY 
EXCOM ROARS!  Fists in the air!  Bobby lets the phone dangle a beat, covers it.  And then he lifts it again. 
BOBBY John, I'll get back to you. 
He lowers the phone to the receiver.  Kenny shoots him a triumphant smile.  The President looks at Kenny, shakes his head, a big smile on his face. 
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 
Adlai presses on. 
ADLAI And I'm prepared to present the evidence in this room, proving that the Soviet Union has lied to the world. 
And Zorin cracks.  He looks uneasily to his delegation.  They bend forward to consult.  Adlai sits back in his chair, draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of someone who knows he's kicked ass. 
Adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his answer, managing not to smile.  The diplomatic world is scandalized.  At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his huddle. 
ZORIN If you do not choose to continue your statement, the Chair recognizes the representative from Chile. 
The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands. 
CHILEAN DELEGATE I yield my time and the floor to the representative to the United States. 
The room explodes in laughter.  Not just nervous any more, not just polite.  They're laughing at Zorin's parliamentary ploy blowing up in his face. Zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed.  And he looks like the biggest fool in the world. 
Adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain.  At last, Adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him. 
The PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing boards. 
ADLAI Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since it appears we might be here for a while, shall we have a look at what the Soviets are doing in Cuba? 
The Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to approach Adlai. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
EXCOM celebrates.  Phones ring at several of the chairs at the conference table. The President and Kenny meet as Bundy picks up a phone in the b.g. 
THE PRESIDENT Didn't know Adlai had it in him.  Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52. 
KENNY Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time. 
Bundy steps forward, holding the phone. 
BUNDY Mr. President... 
Kenny and the President turn to see what they already have heard in those two words: concern.  The room falls quiet. 
INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS 
MCNAMARA I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission. 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship.  Firing on a ship means attacking the ship.  We were not attacking the ship.  We were firing over it. 
MCNAMARA This was not the President's intention when he gave that order.  What if the Soviets don't see the distention?  What if they make the same mistake I just did? (beat) There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral? 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON Yes, sir. 
MCNAMARA And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President. (beat) John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral? 
He passes his hand over the enormous plot below. 
MCNAMARA (CONT'D) This isn't a blockade. 
McNamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to Anderson.  And his burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold. 
MCNAMARA (CONT'D) This, all this, is language, a new vocabulary the likes of which the world has never seen. This is President Kennedy communicating with Secretary Khruschev. 
McNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot, and -- 
-- the CAMERA RACES DOWN, TRACKING OVER IT, across the vast ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols and numerology, this language of steel and human life. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
SUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26TH.  DAY 11. 
On Kenny's T.V. Walter Cronkite reads the news to footage of a BOARDING PARTY going up a ladder to the freighter MARCULA. 
WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) At 7:29 this morning, the U.S.S. Joseph Kennedy stopped and boarded the Soviet charter vessel Marcula. 
The Boarding Party wears dress whites and is UNARMED. 
WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) (CONT'D) After a 3-hour inspection, the Kennedy signaled no contraband found.  Cleared to continue.  Pentagon spokesmen expect the next encounter. 
Kenny, who turns from the T.V. as the door to his office opens.  Rusk walks in. 
RUSK Kenny, we need to see the President. Something's happened. 
Kenny reacts to Rusk's enigmatic expression.  And out from behind Rusk steps JOHN SCALI, the ABC News Correspondent. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY 
OFF THEIR REACTIONS, the CAMERA FINDS an under-strength, ad hoc EXCOM - Kenny, Bobby, Taylor, Bundy, Sorensen, McCone, Ball and the President.  Guarded hope all around.  The short, balding, pugnacious Scali looks discomfited. 
SCALI I have lunch with him maybe once a month.  Way he talks, he acts like he knows Khruschev personally, but he's never elaborated.  I've used him as a source in a couple of stories. 
Kenny paces behind the gathered men around the President's desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour. 
RUSK The FBI has identified this Alexander Fomin as the Soviet Resident, the KGB equivalent of one of our station chiefs. He's their highest ranking spy in this country.  And he knows John's a friend of mine. 
BUNDY All the trademarks of a back-channel overture. 
Kenny eyes Bundy, makes him uncomfortable.  The President sizes Scali up. 
THE PRESIDENT So they'll remove the missiles, and we'll pledge not to invade Cuba, destabilize Castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so... 
Nobody dares speak.  It's as if the possibility of a settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves. 
BOBBY I think... this may be our first real message from Khruschev. 
MCCONE The alternative, Mr. President, is that this could be a trap. 
KENNY Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short... 
MCCONE Why else would they approach us in this way?  It's deniable.  The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us.  This could be more of the same. 
KENNY That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy.  We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker. 
MCCONE That may be what they want us to think. 
RUSK The truth is, Mr. President, we don't even really know whom Fomin speaks for. It could be Khruschev. It could be some faction in the Politburo or the KGB itself.  We just don't know. 
BOBBY By the way, Scali, your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the National Security Act.  Sorry, no Pulitzer. 
The gathered men chuckle, only Scali a bit dour but being a good sport about it.  Scali checks his watch. 
SCALI Mr. President, we don't have much time. I'm supposed to meet with him again in three and a half hours. 
THE PRESIDENT Well, it seems the question of the day is -- is the offer legitimate? 
He moves away from his desk.  The men watch him. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) If it is... if it is, then we can't afford to ignore it. (beat, to Scali) John, we'll have instructions for you in a couple of hours. 
Scali nods.  Rusk escorts him out.  They wait until the door closes.  Taylor looks over at McCone who nods. 
GENERAL TAYLOR Mr. President, I'm afraid we have some bad news.  We're getting GMAIC estimates from our latest low-level overflights. It appears the missiles are two to three days away from operational status. 
MCCONE So we don't have much time to play out back-channel communiques. 
Kenny gives Bobby a hard look.  The President appears unfazed. 
GENERAL TAYLOR The quarantine, sir, is not producing results.  The Chiefs feel it's time you take another look at our options. 
The President considers Taylor, then looks over to Kenny. 
THE PRESIDENT Kenny, get over to your old stomping grounds.  Go through everything the FBI has on Fomin.  I need your best call: is this guy legit and is he speaking for Khruschev?  And I need you to tell me by the time I call you, because right after I call you, I'm calling Scali with his instructions. 
INT. FBI, COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT FILES - NIGHT 
EXCOM chuckles. 
THE PRESIDENT Glad to hear we're not alone. 
The President eyes the EXCOM members one by one, an incipient smile on his face. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) Well, gentlemen, I wasn't planning on invading Cuba anyway.  I think we can live with the terms of this deal. 
There are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table. Except from  McCone and Taylor.  The President takes his copy of the letter, flips through it.  He shakes his head, almost unable to believe that Khruschev has given in.  A long beat. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) Ted, I want you to draft our acceptance. 
EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 
A long, black car stops at the end of Kenny's driveway.  The door opens, and Kenny steps out.  He says an inaudible goodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off.  He turns, facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard, the lights out.  And he smiles.  Home at last. 
EXT. O'DONNELL PATIO - NIGHT 
A screen door squeaks open.  Kenny steps out into the darkness of the back yard.  And there, in her robe, sitting startled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the kitchen window, is Helen.  Kenny stands there tired, his coat slung over his shoulder. 
KENNY Hi. 
Helen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his.  For a silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines of each others' face for the changes of a long separation. They see them.  But they've been married a long time, and the awkwardness passes. 
HELEN Hi, O'Donnell.  You look old. 
Kenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds herself into his arms. 
HELEN (CONT'D) This job's going to kill you.  If I don't first. 
They kiss, comfortable.  But not too long, and he lets her go.  She looks at him again, sees he's suppressing a smile. 
HELEN (CONT'D) If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or -- 
KENNY -- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal.  He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President.  I think we've won. 
HELEN A thing like this... who could even think of winning? 
INT. HALL OUTSIDE KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
SUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27TH.  DAY 12. 
Kenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of Duty Officers race past him, almost bowling him over. He slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval Office, DISCOVERING: 
TOTAL CHAOS.  EXCOM guys, Assistants, dart to and from the offices and halls.  On all their faces grim expressions. Kenny stands there a beat in confusion.  And then Bobby swings out of Kenny's office.  There's a desperate edge to Bobby's voice. 
BOBBY Where've you been?  We've been trying to find you all morning. 
KENNY Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight. 
BOBBY We just got a second letter from Khruschev.  The deal's off. 
INT. HALL OUTSIDE CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Kenny and Bobby walk fast for the cabinet room, Kenny still in his coat. 
BOBBY We're getting everyone together as fast as we can. 
KENNY What does the letter say? 
BOBBY They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge.  It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time. 
Kenny is stunned. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) It gets worse. 
Kenny gives Bobby a sharp look as they enter -- 
INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The President, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at Kenny as he and Bobby enter.  Kenny can only bear his look for a second: he blew the call on Fomin.  But the President is clearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile. Half of EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, and Taylor barely notice them as they're already there arguing. 
Kenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins the conversation in mid-stream. 
MCCONE My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev.  Last night's letter was. (beat) The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight. 
KENNY Jesus Christ... 
Bobby gives him a look: told you things got worse. 
THE PRESIDENT Dean? 
RUSK It doesn't necessarily mean there's been a coup.  Khruschev's name is signed to the letter. 
MCNAMARA Aw, come on, Dean! 
RUSK But at the very least... It does suggest he's been co-opted by hard line elements. 
MCNAMARA Which at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup.  A puppet Khruschev, and a hard-line Soviet government pulling the strings.  No deal.  And the missiles are almost operational. 
Bitter silence.  They all look to the President.  Imminent victory has turned to ashes.  The President studies his own folded hands.  Ball and Thompson enter, take seats.  One by one, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the group. 
THE PRESIDENT You know, the problem we have is that this is latest offer of theirs will seem reasonable to everyone.  We remove our missiles, they remove theirs. Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal anyway.  They're obsolete, after all. 
Kenny shakes his head in mute anger.  McNamara and Rusk seem to sense the President's feelings, too. 
RUSK Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom. They'll put a gun to our head again, and expect us to pay again. 
Kenny looks the President in the eye. 
Suddenly a car HONKS.  Kenny turns around.  Bobby is leaning out the rear passenger window of his limo.  And he sees what Kenny is doing.  He doesn't want to cut in, but has to. 
BOBBY Kenny!  We need to talk. 
Kenny looks back at his son. 
KENNY Get back out there, kid.  Remember to hit 'em hard. 
KEVIN What about you?  Where are you going? 
KENNY Back to work. 
Kevin puts his helmet back on his head.  Kenny watches as Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team.  Kenny turns his back on his son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside. 
EXT. SANS SOUCI PARKING LOT - DAY 
Kenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the restaurant's parking lot.  Bobby's Secret Service Agents maintain a discreet distance. 
KENNY If we're going to make a deal, we're going to have to do it fast.  This is only getting out of control.  The only reason we're not at war this very minute is he's been able to stretch, bend and break his own rules.  He won't be able to keep it up forever. 
Bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth.  A beat. Kenny looks him in the eye. 
BOBBY And? 
KENNY And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey. 
BOBBY The Jupiters are obsolete.  They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway -- 
KENNY -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article!  But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade? 
Bobby is speechless with rage. 
KENNY (CONT'D) And if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole, you're so wrong.  It's a deuce. 
Bobby's beyond furious.  They catch their rising voices. 
KENNY (CONT'D) And it's not just me who thinks that. Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is telling you exactly the same thing: make the trade, and they're going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won't trade like Berlin, and we do end up in a war. (beat) Not to mention, that long before that happens, this government will be politically dead. 
Bobby simmers for a long beat, thinking.  And boy, does this guy hate admitting he's wrong. 
BOBBY All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look.  Okay? You happy?  So now what? 
KENNY So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution. 
BOBBY And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution? 
Kenny stares off at the city, agonized. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT 
Kenny enters from his office, finding Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen talking with the President.  The President gives him a brief, meaningful look. 
RUSK Whatever response we send, it will take several hours for the wire to be received by our embassy and delivered to the Kremlin.  So we're looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before Khruschev could respond. 
As Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby.  Bobby whispers: 
BOBBY He gets it, but he's pissed. 
THE PRESIDENT That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em? 
SORENSEN It depends on if we really believe there's been a coup. 
That strikes a cord with Kenny. 
KENNY I agree.  If there has been a coup, and there's a hard-line government in power now, then it doesn't matter what we say. The end of the day we'll either agree to their terms, they'll agree to ours, or we'll go to war.  But what if there hasn't been a coup?  What if... what if what is happening is a series of accidents? 
SORENSEN The second letter is an accident? 
KENNY No.  The letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended. (beat) What if our Jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something? Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to the hard line, not really caring if we reject it or not? (beat) And then these accidents have happened. 
BOBBY Making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is. 
SORENSEN The Guns of August. 
KENNY Exactly. (beat) If they're sane and human like we are, then maybe we just refuse, and they'll let it slide, like we've been letting things slide. 
SORENSEN So we reject the second letter. 
And Kenny looks at Bobby.  The world stops. 
KENNY No.  We don't reject it... 
It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt. 
BOBBY ... We accept the first letter and pretend the second doesn't exist. 
The President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute. 
INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT 
HOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire assembled EXCOM.  Finally McCone breaks the spell. 
MCCONE It won't work -- 
Bobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises his voice over theirs. 
MCCONE (CONT'D) -- because it's wishful thinking!  It's the same wishful thinking that blinded us all these months while the Soviets were sneaking those missiles in under our noses! 
McNamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical. 
-- onto the portico.  Standing there in the dark, by the white neoclassical pillars of the cloister, are Bobby and the President.  They're holding drinks.  Kenny joins them. 
The President gestures out across the South Lawn to the gleaming Washington Monument. 
THE PRESIDENT We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys. 
BOBBY He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons. 
THE PRESIDENT Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet.  It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on. 
KENNY All he had was his character. 
The President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark. 
BOBBY How does a guy get a rep like that? 
THE PRESIDENT Doesn't matter to me.  If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy.  All they say about him today is -- 
KENNY -- he kept the peace. 
Kenny looks at the President.  The President feels it, and gazes back to him. 
The three of them stare out at the glittering city.  The grandness of the world lies before them, and they are deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. The silence is beyond power. 
And for a long moment, they know not to disturb it.  There is nothing left to say.  The President, at last, finishes his drink. 
THE PRESIDENT You know, we never did control it.  Not really.  Not like we think. 
He looks at Kenny.  Kenny nods.  He knows that now too. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) But we did our best.  Now it's up to them. 
EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 
Kenny's limo pulls away, leaving Kenny, coat in hand, at the bottom of his driveway.  He watches it go, silently urging it to return for him with some call from the President telling him he's desperately needed.  But it doesn't. 
He turns to his house.  The lights are all out. 
He notices he's CLUTCHING the handle of his briefcase.  His knuckles are white.  With conscious effort, he unfolds his hand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway. 
He stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his job... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of Armageddon, Kenny is our Everyman of the Nuclear Age. 
INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Helen stands in the kitchen, a ghostly white figure in her robe, the windows open and curtain flapping as she breathes the air.  Kenny enters.  He stands in the doorway. 
HELEN I saw you out there.  You want him to call you back, need you. 
KENNY No.  I'm glad I'm home. 
And she knows the worst. 
HELEN How long do we have? 
Kenny's voice breaks. 
KENNY If the sun rises in the morning, it is only because of men of goodwill. (beat) And that's all there is between us and the Devil. 
They take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic age so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a thread... yet a thread so powerful.  The CAMERA RISES FROM THEM, finding the OPEN WINDOW and the DARKNESS. 
INT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAWN 
The RED DOME OF NUCLEAR FIRE rising over Washington.  It roils the air in its expanding, blood-red glory. 
It is the sun.  The dawn in the East. 
PULL BACK THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW. 
SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.  DAY 13 
into Kenny and Helen's bedroom.  And silence.  Kenny and Helen lie together on the bed.  The light burns into Kenny's half-shut eye.  Kenny is only dimly conscious of the light's meaning.  Until the PHONE SHRILLS downstairs. 
Kenny is instantly up, launched out of the room. 
INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Kenny snatches the RED PHONE from its hook. 
KENNY Yeah? 
BOBBY (O.S.) Kenny.  It's over. 
EXT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY 
THE CHURCH BELLS TOLL in raucous celebration.  Kenny, Helen and the five O'DONNELL KIDS join the throng packing through the doors to the church.  They're all smiling except Kenny who searches fro faces in the CROWD. 
And then he spots Bobby with his FAMILY.  Bobby grins at him. That makes Kenny grin back. 
RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) This is Radio Moscow.  Moscow calling. 
But Kenny keeps looking. 
RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D) The following statement is the text of a letter from General Secretary Khruschev to President Kennedy. 
Kenny spots him emerging from the Presidential limo, surrounded by Secret Service Agents - John Kennedy.  His FAMILY also is with him. 
RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...I regard with respect and trust the statement you made in your message of 27 October 1962 that there would be no attack, no invasion of Cuba, and not only the part of the United States, but also on the part of the Western Hemisphere, as you said in your same message.  Then the motives which induced us to render assistance of such a kind to Cuba disappear... 
Kennedy, greeting well-wishers, a brilliant smile on his face, is carried through the crowd toward Kenny and the doors of the church.

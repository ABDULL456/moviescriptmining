The Black Dahlia 
Written by 
Josh Friedman 
Based on the novel by 
James Ellroy 
CREDITS ROLL OVER 
Black and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from prize fights featuring two different boxers against various opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a headhunting puncher. 
The intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck. 
END CREDITS 
CLOSE UP ON: 
A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank spaces. 
INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943... REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT 
EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK 
A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop for their arrival. 
We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier. 
Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three pound truncheon. 
BUCKY'S POV: 
Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by- fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans. 
Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters. 
Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos. 
Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING-- 
away from the action... 
down a side street and onto a 
QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK. 
He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a voice: 
VOICE Bleichert! Bleichert! 
EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME 
A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway. 
The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by- fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet, dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is. 
VOICE OVER I already knew him by reputation, had our respective records down pat: Lee Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight, formerly a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium. 
The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard, trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the marines' blows with his own truncheon. 
LEE BLANCHARD Code three, Bleichert! 
Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in, fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick. 
VOICE OVER And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light- heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring magazine in 1937 fighting no-name opponents in no-man's-land division. 
On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft midsections. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) In our first year at Central we'd never spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard fight, and who would win. 
And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into a heap. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by early KO; Bleichert by decision; Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but Bleichert by knockout. 
The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads him away. He motions for Bucky to follow. 
Lee turns back to the marines: 
LEE To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds. 
One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing. 
The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night. 
LEE (cont'd) (re the Zooter) Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive warrant for manslaughter committed during the commission of a Class B Felony. Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she keeled of a heart attack. 
BUCKY You come all the way down here to roust-- 
LEE (smiling) I came all the way down here same as you did. (jerks a finger to the riots) Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar-- (nudging Dos Santos) Habla Ingles, Tomas? 
The man shakes his head "no". 
LEE (cont'd) He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's about six weeks away from the Big Adios. Been better off getting a couple cracked ribs from our Privates First Class back there. 
Blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front porch. 
LEE (cont'd) We'll never get him booked tonight. 
CUT TO: 
LEE JIMMYING THE FRONT DOOR... 
INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER 
Tomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from the kitchen cupboard. 
Dos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of "The Chattanooga Choo Choo" before slumping to his side and passing out. 
Bucky covers him with a blanket. 
LEE Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle. 
BUCKY (not impressed) Impressive. 
LEE (not impressed either) Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you could take me. 
Lee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames. 
BUCKY Whatta we do about the Mex? 
LEE We'll take 'em in the morning. 
BUCKY You'll take him. 
LEE He's half yours, partner. 
BUCKY He's all yours. And I'm not your partner. 
LEE (without turning) Someday. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CUT TO: 
A HAMMER HITTING A BELL 
and the fight is on. 
INSIDE THE PACKED ACADEMY GYM 
Cops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder, cigar smoke like L.A. haze as 
LEE CHARGES BUCKY, the big man trying to cut of the ring. Bucky engages, dodging Lee's thundering blows and peppering back with counterpunches... 
**The general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal match see-sawing back and forth, Bucky doing all he can to make it into the middle rounds. Somewhere around the fourth or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins trying to win at all costs. The two men hurt each other badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight. Bucky punches toe-to-toe with Lee, abandoning his strategy. Lee knocks Bucky out. 
INT. BUCKY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Bucky lies in bed, radio playing jazz. He looks horrible-- face swollen, lip split, stitches across his nose. He sips whiskey from a bottle through a straw. 
The phone rings and rings. He refuses to answer it... 
INT. A REST HOME - ANOTHER DAY 
Bucky, bruised but somewhat better, stands in the hallway of a very nice rest home. He surreptitiously watches his father as the old man tries to grab at a nurse. 
EXT. THE REST HOME - MINUTES LATER 
Pete Lukins waits outside on the porch for Bucky. 
PETE Well? 
BUCKY He'll catch on soon enough. 
The scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on the facility: 
KING DAVID VILLA 
Jewish stars adorn the sign. 
INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Bucky stands in front of his mirror clipping at his stitches with scissors. He hears a voice outside his window. 
VOICE OVER Hey. Canvasback! 
Bucky recognizes the voice and goes to the window. 
EXT. THE COURTYARD - SAME 
Lee Blanchard, his own bruises fading, stands in the yard. 
LEE You gonna hide in there another week? Ain't you bored yet? 
BUCKY Gettin' there. 
LEE Wanna work Warrants with me? 
BUCKY What? 
LEE Harrell's been callin' to tell you. You been hibernating-- 
BUCKY But I lost. Loew's deal-- 
LEE Don't you read the papers? The bond issue passed yesterday. Want the job, partner? 
Off Lee's devilish grin: 
VOICE OVER Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the snitch. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - MORNING 
A door marked "DETECTIVE'S MUSTER ROOM". Bucky, wearing his best SPORTS COAT AND SLACKS, pushes through the door. 
INSIDE THE MUSTER ROOM 
Full of the LAPD's plainclothes hotshots. All stand and give Bucky a standing ovation. Lee's there, too, playing to the crowd. 
On the blackboard at the front of the room: 8%!!! 
CAPTAIN JACK TIERNEY is at the podium. 
TIERNEY (as introduction) Officer Bleichert, the men of Central Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et cetera. I'm Captain Jack Tierney. You and Lee are the white men of the hour, so I hope you enjoyed your ovation. You won't get another one until you retire. 
Everyone laughs. Tierney raps the podium and speaks again. 
TIERNEY (cont'd) Enough horseshit. This is the felony summary for the week ending November 14, 1946. First, three liquor store stickups... 
Tierney begins the summary as Bucky's eyes wander around the room, taking in his new surroundings... Older men, coats and ties... He tunes back in... 
TIERNEY (cont'd) And here's a collar'd please Cap'n Jack to no end. Sergeants Vogel, Koenig, have you read the SID memos on the Bunker Hill burglaries? 
FRITZ VOGEL AND BILL KOENIG, both hulking and unpleasant- looking (Fritzie being the elder version of his son Johnny). The two men shake their heads "no". Tierney disapproves. 
TIERNEY (cont'd) Set of latents at the last break-in ID's one Maynard Coleman, two sodomy priors. A surefire baby raper. Highland Park's got four child sodomy unsolveds. Maybe he's our boy, maybe not. But between that and the B&E's I'd put Maynard as a high priority lamster right now. There's a list of his known associates on the bulletin board. Let's all take a look... 
INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER 
The meeting's breaking up. A tall, elegant man (RUSS MILLARD) and a squat disheveled man (HARRY SEARS) approach Bucky. 
RUSS MILLARD (introducing himself) Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids thank you for the raise, Officer. 
Bucky smiles a dumb smile, not knowing what to say. 
RUSS MILLARD (cont'd) (re the other man) My partner, Harry Sears. 
HARRY (stuttering) Y-y-y-yes.  Th-th-thanks Officer B-B- Bleichert. 
Before Bucky can answer ELLIS LOEW grabs him by the elbow and leads him away. 
ELLIS LOEW Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central Warrants-- 
When he gets him out of ear shot: 
ELLIS LOEW (cont'd) You shouldn't have slugged with him. You were ahead on all three cards. 
BUCKY The proposition passed, sir. 
ELLIS LOEW Yes but some of your patron's lost money. Play things smarter here. Don't blow this like you blew the fight. 
Bucky's about to respond when Lee saves him-- 
LEE Ready to roll, canvasback? 
He grabs Bucky and they head out the door. 
INT. LEE'S CAR - LATER 
Lee cruises them through downtown, rambling about the job description. 
BUCKY Why'd you really quit fighting? 
He pulls the car into a parking lot of a Mexican restaurant. 
BUCKY Hm? 
FAY The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy tale. 
BUCKY Can't say I believe in fairy tales. 
KAY Then you've never really had to. Lucky man. (beat) Lee! Dinner! 
INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER 
The food is finished. So is a bottle of champagne. Kay pops another one, hitting Lee in the chest with the cork. Everyone laughs hysterically. They fill the glasses again. 
LEE A toast...To Proposition B! 
BUCKY To the Bleichert/Blanchard rematch! Bigger than Louis/Schmeling! 
KAY To fairy tales! 
BUCKY (abruptly, drunk) To...us! 
He's referring to all three of them--something which doesn't escape or displease anyone. They clink glasses and drink. 
ANOTHER LAPD TRIPLE CARBON INCIDENT REPORT: 
JANUARY 10, 1947...Raymond "Junior" Nash... 
INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A. 
Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline: "Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48 Primary?" 
Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into the room-- 
LEE Goin' into politics, Ellis? Give us a quote. (as FDR) "The only thing to fear is fear itself." 
Loew smiles thinly and hands over a photo and a rap sheet. 
ELLIS LOEW Here's the man to fear. 
ANGLE ON THE MUG SHOT AND RAP SHEET: 
RAYMOND "JUNIOR" NASH:  Statutory raps, armed robbery, felony mayhem...Texas State Prison...Alcatraz... 
The cops are impressed. 
BUCKY Give us the good news. He's in LA and actin' uppity? 
ELLIS LOEW Witnesses made him at a stickup near Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol- whipped an old lady. She died about an hour ago. 
RUSS MILLARD Anything common in the sex beefs? 
ELLIS LOEW Negro girls. Young ones. All the complainants have been colored. 
LEE Seeya in Leimert Park. 
As they walk out... 
ELLIS LOEW Sergeant Blanchard? Try not to kill the man. I'd like to do it in court. 
Lee flashes a demon smile. 
EXT. CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - DAY - LATER 
A montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom. 
VOICE OVER From November through the New Year, Lee and I captured a total of eleven hard felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and three parole and probation absconders... 
On Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo shopping centers and movie theaters. 
VOICE OVER After tours of duty, Lee and I would go to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she made dinner for us, other times the three of us would go dancing, or see a flick. 
Southbound, older wooden structures looking more and more unkempt. Empty lots... 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) Always she'd be there, never in between us, but always in the middle. It was the best time of my life. 
EXT./INT. THE CAR - A FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the car-- 
LEE This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm callin' in some favors. 
He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it. 
BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER 
Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating. 
LEE Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's shacking with some poon in a crib near Slauson and Hoover. 
BUCKY It's all colored down there-- 
LEE We fuckin' roll. 
He pulls out. 
CUT TO: 
EXT./INT. THE CAR - HOOVER AVE - MINUTES LATER 
Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner. Three are black and one is white. 
LEE Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address or a name. 
As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white guy glances at Lee: 
WHITE HOPHEAD What the---Blanchard? 
LEE Shut up, shitbird. 
Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him. Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some marijuana cigarettes. 
Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt-- 
BUCKY Partner! 
Bucky pulls his .38... 
THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the face-- 
THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in the neck-- 
ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES. 
LEE Bucky duck! 
Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer. 
Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood- covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter. 
FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS. 
Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket. Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from the blood. 
BUCKY Nash is renting a room in that building over there. 
RUSS MILLARD Blood on the premises? 
BUCKY No. This isn't him. 
RUSS MILLARD The lab'll be the judge of that. 
Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming up against a line of cops keeping them from the body. 
Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at the body. 
BUCKY Hey. Junior Nash, remember? 
LEE He didn't do this. 
BUCKY No. He beat an old woman to death. That's why he's our priority warrantee. 
LEE Not anymore. 
BUCKY This ain't ours, partner-- 
LEE (on edge) It is now, partner. 
EXT. THE CRIME SCENE - LATER 
Too sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's wagon. The doors slam shut and the car pulls away. 
CUT TO: 
RUSS MILLARD DIVIDING A STREET ATLAS INTO FOOTBEATS 
as fifteen officers (including Lee and Bucky) wait for their assignment. 
A MONTAGE OF QUESTIONING 
Cops ring doorbells throughout Leimert Park: 
OFFICER (to an old woman) Have you heard female screams... 
BUCKY (to an off-duty serviceman) ...anyone discarding women's clothing? 
LEE (to a little kid) ...seen anyone in the lot on 39th... 
BUCKY (to a housewife) ...and what about this man? (holds out a photo of Junior Nash) 
To all of these questions a big fat "no". 
INT. THE OLYMPIC BOXING ARENA - NIGHHT 
Bucky watches two Mexican bantamweights beat each other bloody. An EMPTY SEAT next to him. Irritated, he gets up and leaves. 
ENT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER 
Bucky gets out of his car and finds Lee standing inside the crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds. The entire area is lit up by arclights, illuminating the two quicklime outlines of the body parts. 
BUCKY You were supposed to meet me at the fights tonight, remember? 
LEE Priority. Remember. 
BUCKY Priority for the Bureau. Not for us. 
LEE Nice white girl gets snuffed. Gotta show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue. It's a showcase. It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this. 
BUCKY We've had enough headlines for the week. 
Lee points to the body outline. His hand shakes a bit and maybe for the first time we sense he's wired on something. 
LEE With or without you, partner. 
Bucky shakes his head and begins walking away. 
LEE (cont'd) With or without you. 
BUCKY I heard you. 
INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY 
Bucky enters a mob scene. One cop holds up a front page headline: "Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying" 
Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion: 
OFFICER Confessors. 
Just then the interrogation room door opens and Bill Koenig leads a doubled-over fat man out of the door. 
KOENIG He didn't do it. 
A couple officers clap satirically at their desks. 
BUCKY (to another cop) Blanchard? 
OFFICER In with Loew.(beat) And reporters. 
Off Bucky's concerned look we 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Bucky walks in to see Loew holding a press conference, Lee dressed in a suit and sitting at his side. 
ELLIS LOEW ...and the heinous nature of this killing makes it imperative to catch this fiend as soon as possible. A number of specially trained officers, including Mr. Fire and his partner Mr. Ice... 
ON BUCKY'S FACE 
Disbelief. Disgust. 
BACK IN THE WARRANTS CUBICLE - LATER 
Lee catches up with a pissed off Bucky. 
BUCKY You got us detached? 
LEE Slow and easy, Bucky. First I gave Loew a memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction-- 
BUCKY You did what? 
LEE It's all right. The APB still stands. We've got the pad staked. He's covered. 
Bucky's face says he's not sold on Lee's reasoning. 
LEE (cont'd) One week. Just one week. After that, it's back to Junior. I promise. 
Bucky studies Lee's resolve; he relents. 
LEE (cont'd) Copacetic. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PATHOLOGY ROOM - LATER 
Antiseptic white with metallic slab tables. Two objects covered in sheets lay on the table. 
The two men walk out, disgusted. 
LEE Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire U.S. Armed forces as suspects. 
BUCKY Flip to see who writes it up? 
LEE I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See if we get any strange drive-bys at the murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in on Kay. She's worried about me. 
BUCKY She's a smart woman. 
INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Bucky opens the front door to find Kay reading a book on the couch. She doesn't even look up. 
KAY Hi, Dwight. 
BUCKY How'd you know it was me? 
KAY Lee stomps, you tread lightly. 
Bucky appreciates her subtext. 
BUCKY Lee's-- 
KAY Let me guess...Lee's up all night-- probably on Benzedrine again--working that poor girl's murder-- 
She says this as fact, not judgement. She knows him. 
KAY You're worried about him. And he's worried about me. (beat) But who's worried about you? Is that left for me? 
BUCKY No need for that. 
KAY For such a cautious man you're quite a hardcase. 
BUCKY It's just...He's done a lot for me. 
Kay smiles, sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as if to reinforce to Bucky all Lee's done for her. 
The point is not lost on him. 
She crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek. 
KAY (cont'd) Good night. 
INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Bucky sits at their kitchen table, eating a ham sandwich with a glass of milk and filling out the police reports. 
INT. THE HOMICIDE BULLPEN - MORNING 
Bucky walks in reading the Herald front page: A picture of Elizabeth Short in a striking black dress. Underneath:"The Black Dahlia". 
He stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects. 
RUSS MILLARD (O.S.) (re trunk) Found it in storage down at the railway. Carbons of mash notes to sailors. Hundreds of 'em. 
Bucky shows him the newspaper. 
RUSS MILLARD Thank our friend Bevo Means at the Herald. Bevo's painting Betty and her black dress like some actress in that Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should triple our confessions. 
BUCKY Great. 
RUSS MILLARD (cont'd) Hollywood will fuck you when no else will. What do you think? 
BUCKY I think I want to go back to Warrants. 
RUSS MILLARD No dice. You're a bright penny and I want you here. (hands him a piece of paper) Betty's last known residences and KA's. Go to University Station and pick up Bill Koenig. Fritzie's sick. Keep Bill on a tight leash, and you write the report because Billy's practically illiterate. 
BUCKY Lieutenant-- 
RUSS MILLARD Call me Russ and get out of here. 
Millard gestures for him to leave. 
EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER 
Bucky and Koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house. 
BUCKY How do you want to play this, Sarge? 
KOENIG Fritzie usually does the talking and I stand back up. (re a leather sap in his belt) Muscle job? 
BUCKY Let's try talk job. 
Bucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on his piece of paper. He stops at "S. Saddon". 
INT. THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS - LATER 
Bucky knocks on the door. 
BUCKY Miss Saddon? 
A young woman dressed in a metallic Egyptian costume opens the door. 
SHERYL You the driver from RKO? 
BUCKY Police. 
The woman shuts the door. Seconds later the TOILET FLUSHES. She returns and opens it again. 
SHERYL If this is about those jaywalking-- 
BUCKY It's about Elizabeth Short. 
SHERYL I did all this on the phone this morning. Nine thousand questions about Betty's nine thousand boyfriends and I don't remember any of the names. Can I go now? The extras truck is due any minute. 
BUCKY How about you sit dawn and answer my questions or I bust you for the reefer you flushed. 
She lets him in and sits defiantly. 
BUCKY (cont'd) First question. Does a... (re to his paper) Linda Martin or a Marjorie Graham live here? 
SHERYL That's Betty's other place. DeLongpre and Orange. 
BUCKY She moved around quite a bit. You know why? Was somebody threatening her? 
SHERYL Betty's problem wasn't enemies. It was too many friends. 
BUCKY I've gathered that. Let's change the subject. 
SHERYL How 'bout "the world of high finance"? 
BUCKY (cont'd) How about movies? You girls are all tryin' to break in, right? 
SHERYL (re her extras costume) I'm in mister. 
BUCKY Congratulations. What about Betty? 
SHERYL Maybe once. Maybe not. 'Round Thanksgiving she showed up bragging about gettin' her big break...Had one of those viewfinders around her neck? But who knows where she really got it. Betty had a tendency to-- 
BUCKY ...stretch the truth? 
SHERYL Lie. 
CLOSE-UPS OF BLACK DAHLIA CRIME SCENE PHOTOS 
spread out on Lee and Kay's dining room table. 
Bucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him: 
KAY Hi, Dwight. 
LEE (wired) It ain't a random job. Horseshit. Guy who did this...hated her. Bad. Wanted the whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor? 
KAY Lee, Dwight's here. 
LEE Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay. Babe's got ideas. Good stuff-- 
KAY This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but I'll give you a theory if you'll eat something to calm yourself down. 
LEE Theory on, teach. 
KAY Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were two killers. Because the torture cuts are crude, while the bisection and the cut on the abdomen are neat and clean... 
CLOSE ON: Lee's face, somehow both intense and unfocused... 
VOICE OVER Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA. Three days since we killed four men. 
BACK ON: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits, catching Kay's eye as he goes. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) Maybe nobody cared. Maybe they cared too much. 
EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER 
Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress. 
INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT 
Bucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT. 
HIS EYES DRIFT TO: 
A WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt craps table with various betting spaces: "Solved--2 to 1", "Random Sex Job--4 to 1", "Uhsolved--Even Money", "Boyfriend(s)--l to 4"... 
Next to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate hangers...a crude joke. 
Bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot inside. He dials the phone: 
BUCKY Administrative Vice Squad? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - THE VALLEY - NIGHT 
Bucky pulls his car up to a low-slung building with a log- cabin facade and swinging Western doors. He enters. 
INT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS 
A dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with soft girls in cashmere skirt suits. 
Bucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and slides him a whiskey. 
BARTENDER Beverage Control? 
BUCKY (downing the whiskey) LAPD Homicide. 
BARTENDER Who got snuffed? 
Bucky slides her a photo of the Dahlia and Linda Martin's ID. 
BUCKY Seen either of 'em? 
BARTENDER Huh. The Dahlia's a sister? 
BUCKY You tell me. 
BARTENDER Never seen her 'cept in the papers. And the little schoolgirl twist I've never seen. We don't truck with underaged stuff. Capice? 
BUCKY Capice when your girls tell me that. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE BAR - SOON AFTER 
as the photos are passed from patron to patron. Aside from a few raised eyebrows over the Dahlia, nothing to indicate anyone knows anything. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. A DIFFERENT LESBIAN BAR - LATER 
This time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out of the ordinary. 
He takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEWAY - LATER 
A tropical motif. Faux bamboo wrap-around booths shield women snuggled deep into the dark corners. 
A bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar with the two photos. More of the same... 
He approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides over the photos. 
BUCKY Black Dahlia. 
BARTENDER No shit. 
He taps a finger onto Linda Martin's ID. 
BUCKY What about this girl? 
The bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates-- 
BARTENDER Never seen her. 
He leans over the counter. 
BUCKY Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's fifteen fucking years old. So you come clean or I slap a contributing beef on you, and you spend the next five years servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in Tehachapi. 
The bartender looks again at the ID card. 
BARTENDER A couple times. Two, three months ago. Just to cadge drinks off the sisters, though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not the Dahlia. Never. 
Out of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute, change her mind and make for the door. 
A baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to Elizabeth Short. 
Bucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out after the woman. 
EXT. THE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
The woman gets into a beautiful snow-white Packard. 
CUT TO: 
SHOTS OF VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
She looks down again. The cops look at each other. Linda's harder and more desperate than they imagined. 
LINDA MARTIN (cont'd) You'll let me have it back, won't you? You won't let people look at it? 
Now its the cops turn to look away. 
EXT. THE HALLWAY - AFTER 
Russ and Bucky. 
RUSS MILLARD Whattya think? 
BUCKY I think she's covering on the Mex angle. Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play cellmate for a day. 
RUSS MILLARD Bleichert you are a very bright penny today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue movie night at City Hall. 
INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER 
A projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee. 
A clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the headline: "Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released --LA Bound after 8 years of Custody" 
LEE (raggedy) Gettin' any? 
Bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred image hits the screen. It begins to focus. 
A title: "Slave Girls From Hell" 
The movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance... 
An audible breath in the muster room. 
A hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks it, eyes wide open and glassy. 
An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness. 
Another cut: Betty mouthing the words "No, please" to the camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch. Betty tonguing next to the dildo... 
BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM 
The atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues... 
CHIEF HORRALL Whattya think, Russ? This got anything to do with the girl's murder-- 
RUSS MILLARD Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play as the killer. But maybe he showed it to someone-- 
Suddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen. 
LEE Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her! I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room for less than this! 
He yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard. 
INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
Lee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and sits on a bench next to him. 
LEE Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see? 
BUCKY Yeah. I did, partner. I did. 
Bucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in his fist. He pries it loose. 
Ellis Loew and Russ Millard enter. 
ELLIS LOEW Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants. You're my man, and you made me look like a fool in front of the two most powerful men in the Department. If you weren't Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty already. You've gotten personally involved in the Short case-- 
BUCKY (holding up the newspaper) Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short-- 
ELLIS LOEW Shut up, Bleichert. (back to Lee) You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow. Report to me at 0800 with letters of apology for Green and Horrall. For the sake of your pension I'd suggest you grovel. 
LEE I want to go to TJ-- 
ELLIS LOEW Blanchard! 
Poison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels. 
INT. THE SQUADRON - DAY 
Bucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The clock behind him reads "12:30". Loew approaches. 
ELLIS LOEW You've been skating around all morning, Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to check out a radio car and get out there. 
BUCKY Yes, sir. 
ELLIS LOEW And if you see that phantom partner of yours, tell him this no-show's gonna cost him three days pay. 
Loew walks off. Bucky dials the phone. 
MADELEINE (VO) Hello. 
BUCKY It's me. You want to get together? 
MADELEINE (VO) When? 
BUCKY I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes. 
MADELEINE (VO) Not at the house. Daddy's having a business soiree. The Red Arrow. 
BUCKY I have an apartment, you know. 
MADELEINE (VO) Room 11. Forty-five minutes. 
She hangs up. 
INT. RED ARROW MOTEL - ROOM 11 - LATER 
They lie naked in the bed. Bucky's lost in thought. 
MADELEINE Smile at me. Look soft and sweet. 
He looks anything but. 
BUCK They picked up Linda Martin yesterday. She had a stag film of her and Betty Short playing lez. Spooky stuff. 
Madeleine sits up. 
MADELEINE Did she mention me? 
BUCKY No. And I checked through the case file. There's no mention of that note-leaving number you pulled. (beat) Babe, I'm withholding evidence for you. It's a fair trade for what I'm getting, but it still shakes me. Is there anything you haven't told me about Betty and Linda? 
She runs her fingers down his ribcage, teasing his boxing scars. 
MADELEINE Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that one time we met last summer. I just did it to see what it would be like to do it with someone who looked like me and-- 
BUCKY Jesus Christ. 
He jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants. 
MADELEINE Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay-- 
He pulls on his shirt, his handcuffs and his .38. Grabs his jacket-- 
MADELEINE (cont'd) Stay sugar stay-- 
Bucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists, hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths prowling for drunks to roll... 
EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS 
The two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces. 
Bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the children scatter, squabbling over the coins. 
IN THE BACKGROUND 
Fritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock building. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A FILTHY MEXICAN JAIL - SOON AFTER 
Vogel and Bucky walk quickly down a corridor lined with empty cells. A Mexican jailer unlocks the last cell and the two cops walk in to face 
BOBBY DEWITT 
the hatchet-faced tough of 1939 now a grizzled and bloated well-used piece of work. He stands up, full of con bravado. 
DEWITT Cops, huh? Well at least you're American. Never thought I'l be glad to see you guys. 
VOGEL Why start now? 
Vogel kicks in the balls, dropping him to his knees. Vogel smashes him with a thick backhand across the face. 
CUT TO: 
BUCKY HANDCUFFING BOBBY DEWITT TO A CHAIR 
Vogel stands over him. 
VOGEL Lee Blanchard's here in TJ, and you came here flush out of Big Q. That's a goddamned strange coincidence and I don't like it. I don't like you and I don't like being down in this rat-infested country when I could be home with my family. 
DeWitt pisses his pants. 
VOGEL (cont'd) Did you know Blanchard was in TJ? 
DEWITT Ain't seen Blanchard since my fuckin' trial. 
Vogel smashes him across the face. 
VOGEL Do not use profanity with me, and address me as sir. 
DeWitt's head bobs up and down. 
VOGEL (cont'd) Now Blanchard's scared of you. Why? 
DEWITT Man o Manieschewitz, what a laugh. Lee beauty gotta be scared of me 'cause of how I flapped my trap at trial, but all I know is what I read in the papers. Maybe I was thinkin' revenge, maybe talkin' trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty killed them niggers-- 
Vogel topples DeWitt with a right hook and then picks him back up by the neck, squeezing the life out of him. 
VOGEL Bobby boy I do not like Sergeant Blanchard but he is a fellow officer and I will not have syphilitic scum like you defaming him. Now you risked a parole violation for a trip down here. 
He lets go of his neck, the color returning to DeWitt's face. 
VOGEL (cont'd) Why are you here, Bobby. You tell me. 
DEWITT (a beaten dog) I came down to cop some heroin and move it back to LA. I'm meeting a guy, Felix Casco, at the Gardena Motel. Please. Don't hurt me no more. Please. 
Vogel claps his hands together, gleeful with this bonus bust. 
VOGEL (heading out of the cell) I'm gonna call Ellis. 
Bucky turns back to De Witt, who's much more relaxed now that Vogel's left the cell. 
BUCKY Finish up with you and Blanchard. 
DEWITT Sir, all that's between me and Blanchard is that I fucked this cunt Kay Lake-- 
IN SLOW MOTION-- 
Bucky leaps on De Witt, grabbing him around the neck and choking him. De Witt turns blue, his eyes bulging out-- 
BEHIND BUCKY, VOICES IN SPANISH 
and then hands on his shoulders as Ducky is hurled backwards into the cell bars. And then 
BLACKNESS 
which slowly becomes grey, and then back to normal as Bucky finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell. 
Refocusing on the scene: 
Two Rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with matchsticks as Fritz Vogel pulls Bucky to his feet. 
BUCKY How long-- 
VOGEL I let Bobby boy go so we could tail him to his pal. But he blew his tail while you were catching up on your beauty sleep, which is too bad for him. 
CUT TO: 
A STUDEBAKER PATROL CAR WITH LIGHTS FLASHING 
INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER 
Vogel, Koenig, a Rurale, and Bucky (holding a piece of ice to the back of his head). 
The car arrives at a horseshoe-shaped auto court. Two Mexican policeman stand guard outside one of its rooms. 
INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER 
As the American cops walk in on a cordite-reeking slaughterhouse. Bobby De Witt and a Mexican man lay dead on the floor, bullet holes oozing blood all over them. 
Bucky notes the bruises on De Witt's neck from where he choked him. Bucky squints at the men, still a little disoriented... 
VOGEL The spic's Felix Casco, a known dope trafficker. Maybe it was other dope scum, maybe Lee, maybe it was God. I say let our Mexican colleagues handle their own dirty laundry and we go back to LA and find the son of a bitch who sliced the Dahlia. 
INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Kay sits curled into a corner of the couch, defensively. Bucky sits on a small chair next to Lee's large easy chair. 
KAY I spent the morning with Internal Affairs. I told them...everything I knew. I gave them so much...and in the end it didn't seem like anything at all. 
BUCKY He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it. 
KAY You don't know anything, Dwight. But that's what I like about you. 
BUCKY Kay-- 
KAY I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone now-- 
BUCKY He's coming back. 
She nods, mollifying him. 
CUT TO: 
A NEON SIGN: THE EL NIDO MOTEL 
CLOSE ON: ROOM 204 
Bucky smiles weakly; Russ knows him. 
RUSS MILLARD It's not as much fun once it moves to the back pages, is it? (changing subjects) I hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez for the Bobby De Witt murder. 
BUCKY I heard that, too. 
RUSS MILLARD You must be relieved. 
BUCKY They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he doesn't show up in thirty days he's out. 
RUSS MILLARD He'll be found if he wants to be found. 
BUCKY Like the guy who killed the Dahlia? 
Russ smiles grimly. 
EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - EVENING 
Bucky rings the doorbell. Fritz Vogel answers. 
VOGEL Boyo! Glad you could make it. 
He claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house. 
INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels, which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's food taster. 
ELLIS LOEW I called this little meeting for a couple reasons, Bucky. We'd both like to see the Short case closed out and get back to normal business. 
Bucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this. 
ELLIS LOEW (cont'd) We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants you for his partner when he gets his lieutenancy, and-- 
BUCKY Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires. 
VOGEL You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is a sob sister, and I'm much more your type. 
Bucky considers the truth in this. To Loew: 
BUCKY What do you want, Ellis? 
ELLIS LOEW Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There are four confessors still being held at City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't coherent when they were first questioned, and they're all violent, frothing-at-the- mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated. It's a muscle job. 
VOGEL I wanted Bill Koenig-- 
ELLIS LOEW But Bill's a bit too enamored with violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no? Because if it's yes, I'll make sure you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an inside track to some stripes. If not, it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard gets tired of you. We both know that Russ is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight. That could be a long time. Yes or no? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CITY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
as four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon while Bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots. 
INSIDE THE DRUNK WAGON 
the four men sit in the back as Bucky drives the truck. The camera pans their faces. The first, LOREN BIDWELL, pale, old and palsied. 
VOICE OVER On my way over I played out their rap sheets in my head, trying to work up a head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated sexual assault on minors. Between prison jolts he confessed to all the big sex crimes. 
EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE BUILDING 
Bucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building, its street facade illuminated: "KOUNTY KING LUNCH MEAT--SERVING L.A. COUNTY WITH INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SINCE 1923"... 
THE CAMERA finds the second man, CECIL DURKIN. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) Cecil Durkin--hophead, knife fighter and a jailhouse rape-o who played jazz drums with some good combos. He took two Quentin jolts for Arson and was caught masturbating at the scene of his last torch. 
AT THE FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING 
Fritz Vogel opens the door and leads the men inside. 
INT. THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
A huge sawdust-covered roam, meathooks dangling from the ceiling. Beef dangles over half the hooks. The four men look terrified. 
The camera finds the third man, CHARLIE ISSLER: 
VOICE OVER Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career confessor specializing in copping to hooker homicides. His three procuring beefs had netted him a year county jail time, his phony confessions two ninety day observation stints at the Camarillo nut farm. 
And the fourth man, PAUL ORCHARD: 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) And finally Paul Orchard. Jack roller, male prostitute, and a former San Bernardino County deputy sheriff. 
The group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where FOUR UNUSED MEATHOOKS DANGLE OVER FOUR CHAIRS. 
Bucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as Vogel stands each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over their respective meathooks. 
Bucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees A SHEET-COVERED TABLE sticking out. Before his curiosity draws him over Vogel addresses the prisoners. 
VOGEL You all confessed to killing the Dahlia. We can't prove you did, so you're gonna have to convince us... Query on, Bucko. 
Bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man Bidwell. The man's palsy has him shaking and Bucky grabs the meathook above him to steady him. 
BUCKY Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd you kill her? 
Bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes. 
VOGEL Don't be timid, boyo. That bird made little boys suck his hog. 
Bucky's hand twitches on the meathook. 
BUCKY Come clean, pop. 
BIDWELL I didn't kill her mister. I just wanted a ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and a cot, that's all. Please, mister. 
The man's weakened state makes his argument for him. Bucky moves on to Cecil Durkin. 
BUCKY Tell me about it, Cecil. 
DURKIN (laughing) You get that line from Dick Tracy or Gangbusters? 
Bucky catches Vogel out of the corner of his eye. Measuring... 
BUCKY One more time, shitbird. Tell me about you and Betty Short. 
DURKIN I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your mama! I'm your fucking daddy! 
Bucky one-two's him in the solar plexus. His legs buckle, but he keeps his feet on the chair. 
DURKIN (cont'd) You think you clever, don't you. You the bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. Older than vaudeville. 
BUCKY I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in mind. 
This shuts Durkin up. Bucky moves to Charlie Issler. 
ISSLER (sincere) Please. I didn't kill Liz. I don't know why I do these things, and I apologize. So please don't let that man hurt me. 
BUCKY Convince me. 
ISSLER I...can't. I just can't. 
BUCKY You're a pimp. You know Betty Short? 
BUCKY Issler did. 
RUSS MILLARD The pimp? I thought he said he'd never heard of her. 
BUCKY You know what else he said? 
A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE 
As Vogel cracks Issler's ribs. 
VOGEL What did you know about the Dahlia's missing days? 
ISSLER I knew you at Ad Vice-- 
INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Harry Sears cradles the phone in his ear as he flips through a large metal file cabinet. Behind him the glass door reads in reverse: "ADMINISTRATIVE VICE'. 
HARRY SEARS (INTO PHONE) N-n-no, Russ. No file on Issler. Gone. 
BACK AT THE EL NIDO - SAME 
Bucky and Russ sit in silence, thinking. They know they're onto something... 
BUCKY Fritzie didn't give a damn about those other three. It was all about Issler. Never occurred to me before. 
Bucky gets to his feet. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Meet me back here. Late. 
RUSS MILLARD Bright penny-- 
But Bucky's already out the door. 
EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Bucky stakes out the dark house. 
EXT. VOGEL'S SERVICE PORCH - LATER 
Bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides into the house... 
INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
as Bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed door. He opens it, entering 
FRITZIE'S STUDY 
He stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing gooseneck lamp and turns it on. The walls are covered with pictures of Fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty-five years. 
Bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and begins rifling through its file drawers. What he finds surprises him: 
--carbons of official LAPD intelligence reports, lists of account balances, financial dealings, payments made--all cross-referenced to each individual being investigated. 
A veritable how-to primer on how to extort from criminals.. 
Bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out: 
ISSLER'S AD VICE FILE complete with mug shots. 
BUCKY Hello, Charlie. Get lost? 
Bucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of names, looking for something familiar. He stops at one: "SALLY STINSON". Beside her name a handwritten note: "Biltmore Hotel". 
He writes it down and moves to another list of names: "Known Associates, no Prostitution Record". 
And there it is: "Betty Short". 
INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LATER 
Bucky bops to jazz on his radio, pumped with adrenaline. 
INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT 
Bucky tears through a file as Russ watches. 
RUSS MILLARD So good ol' Fritzie's shaking down crooks, maybe sellin' 'em tip-offs before a roust. 
BUCKY I want him nailed. 
RUSS MILLARD Easy, penny. They'd have to testify against him first. And that's not likely after he burns those carbons. But this Issler business--why hide the Issler- Betty connection? 
BUCKY (finding a file) Maybe Charlie pimped her out...to somebody Fritzie doesn't want us to know about... 
A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE 
as Fritz beats on Charlie-- 
FRITZIE Tell me what you know about the Dahlia's missing days-- 
BACK TO THE EL NIDO 
Bucky reads through a letter. 
BUCKY I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of her phantom servicemen boyfriends: (reading aloud) "...had drinks with a great girl, Sally Stinson, who thinks she way be able to help me get a job cocktailing..." 
RUSS MILLARD Cocktailing. 
BUCKY Yeah, I know. That's what made it stick with me...What next, padre? 
RUSS MILLARD You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch. Me and Harry'll poke around. 
BUCKY (displeased) I want him. 
RUSS MILLARD You'll get him, too. But you've got to cool your temper. It's all patience with the big fish or they wriggle off. 
INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Bucky lies awake while Kay sleeps. 
VOICE OVER What kept me up that night wasn't the idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals, or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie the pimp to see if Betty had told him something about one of her johns...maybe even Vogel, himself...No... 
A FLASHBACK - FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE 
Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel and Bucky drink cocktails and eat pretzels... 
VOICE OVER ...what kept me up was this thought: if Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I would have overheard. Fritz was confident he could keep me quiet. 
Ellis and Fritz clink glasses...Smile at Bucky. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) And that was an underestimation I would bleed him for. 
BACK IN KAY'S BED 
Her hand brushes against his cheek. He reaches for it. 
OVER THIS SCENE WE HEAR A PHONE RING AND THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGE. 
BUCKY (VO) Hello? 
RUSS MILLARD We've found her. Meet me at 1546 North Havenhurst in half an hour. 
INT. THE POLICE STATION - SAME 
RUSS MILLARD Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your cherry. He bought you a woman for two days. Is that right? 
JOHNNY Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer. 
Johnny turns the syllable into a long laugh. 
RUSS MILLARD This was at the Biltmore? 
JOHNNY Daddy got a good rate on the room. He knew the house dick...This ain't right... 
RUSS MILLARD We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz Short at the Biltmore, too? 
JOHNNY What's her name introduced me...the hooer. 
RUSS MILLARD And what did you and Liz do? 
JOHNNY We...played horse and rider. Gave her the Big Schnitz. 
RUSS MILLARD Did you whip her? 
Johnny thinks back, his head lolling to and fro... 
JOHNNY Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider. 
RUSS MILLARD Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short? 
Johnny jerks back spasmodically. 
JOHNNY No no no no! I didn't kill her! 
RUSS MILLARD Easy son-- 
JOHNNY I didn't slice her! 
RUSS MILLARD It's all right...Do you know who did? JOHNNY No! No! 
Johnny's starting to sweat. Russ and Bucky lean in... 
RUSS MILLARD When your Daddy found out you'd been with her, he tried to fix things didn't he? 
Johnny nods yes. 
RUSS MILLARD (cont'd) He found out Charlie Issler had been picked up and he knew Charlie had this confessing problem, right? 
JOHNNY Daddy...went to Ellis...to the Jewboy. Wanted to get Charlie released...but the Jewboy said no...Daddy had a morgue friend owed him a favor and got this DOA cooze...Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but Ellis Jewboy said take Bleichert. (looking right at Bucky) Daddy said you'd do it cuz without Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a sob sister, weak sister... 
Johnny starts laughing hysterically, shaking his chained hands like a zoo animal trying to get loose. Russ steps in front of a red-hot Bucky-- 
RUSS MILLARD (to Bucky) I think you should go outside. 
EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - LATER 
Bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by. Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement. 
RUSS MILLARD His statement. Signed. 
Bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket. 
RUSS MILLARD We should sit on this for a little bit. Until I can talk to a legal officer. 
Bucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window. 
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Bucky handcuffs Johnny's hands behind his back as the big man cries... 
JOHNNY Daddy... 
RUSS MILLARD (to Bucky) It's the shithouse until you retire, you know that. 
BUCKY I owe her this one. 
He squeezes Johnny's handcuffs tighter. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - BOOKING - NIGHT 
Reporters follow Bucky and Johnny inside, piqued by the sight of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside. 
BUCKY No comment...No comment... (whispering in Johnny's ear) Tell your Daddy I know everything. Including his extortion deal. Tell him I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow. 
He approaches the desk sergeant. 
DESK SERGEANT What the hell is this? 
A flashbulb goes off in their faces. Johnny sobs. 
BUCKY I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is Officer John Vogel. 
He hands over Johnny's signed statement. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Book him. 
Another flashbulb. 
EXT. CENTRAL STATION - LATER 
Bucky jogs up the steps inside. 
INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
He dresses in his blue uniform, preparing to go back to work. 
INTERCOM Officer Bleichert, go to the watch commander's office immediately. 
Bucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat. 
INT. LIEUTENANT JASTROW'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER 
Bucky walks in, saluting like an idealistic rookie. Jastrow stands, ignoring the salute. 
JASTROW You're on two weeks vacation leave as of now. When you return to duty, report to Chief Green. He'll reassign you to another division. 
BUCKY Why? 
JASTROW Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out. That's why. 
All Bucky can think to do is salute again, rock firm. He walks outside and crosses into 
INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Crammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look down. Defiant. 
As he passes he can hear the hisses: "Traitor". "Bolshevik". He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he hears applause. 
Bucky turns to see,Russ Millard, Harry Sears and Thad Green clapping good-bye... 
INT. THE CASTING OFFICE - DAY 
Clapstick: "Elizabeth Short Screen Test #4" 
She sits on an ugly brown sofa, sides in her hands. Silence. 
MAN #4 (O.S.) Are you all right, Miss Short? 
CLOSE ON THE WALL OF STILLS: 
A row of light-heavies: Gus Lesnevich, Billy Conn, and Bucky. Three stills over, next to Joe Louis, is Lee's photo. They all look so young...So good... 
An old voice in English breaks his reverie: 
OLD MAN Bleichert? Jesus. First Blanchard, then you. Who's next? Willie Pep? 
Bucky wheels and finds himself face to face with an old man. 
BUCKY Blanchard? You've seen him? When? 
OLD MAN Couple months ago. Heavy rains in February. Musta talked fights for ten hours straight. You know Blanchard thinks the feathers are the best division? me, it's the middies for sure. La Motta, Graziano-- 
BUCKY Is he still in town? 
OLD MAN Don't think so. I own this place. He ain't been back. You lookin' for a rematch? 
BUCKY I'm looking to get him out of a shitload of trouble. 
The old pug looks him up and down. 
OLD MAN Well. I'll tell ya the little I know. Heard he caused a ruckus over at the Club Satan, had to bribe his way out big with Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook. Tell him I said to be kosher with you. 
BUCKY Thank you. 
OLD MAN You ain't been in there. 
INT. CLUB SATAN - LATER 
Bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the bandstand. 
Up on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken servicemen shout "Donkey! Donkey!" 
Bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman. 
OLD WOMAN You wan' the bar, handsome? Breakfast of champions, one dollar. Round the world, two dollars. 
BUCKY Ernie. I need to see Ernie. 
OLD WOMAN Vamanos! 
And grabs him by the arm... 
INT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
ERNIE, a half-Mexican half-Chinese man, stands next to a huge vat of stew. Bucky flashes Lee's photo. 
BUCKY I heard this man gave you some trouble a while back. 
ERNIE Who wants to know? 
Bucky flashes his badge, giving him a glimpse of his gun. 
ERNIE You his friend? 
BUCKY He's my best friend. 
The chef tucks his hands into his aprons, fidgeting. 
ERNIE Your friend drink fourteen shots of my best Mescal, a house record. That I like. He make toasts to dead women. That I don't mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey show, and that I don't take. 
BUCKY What happened? 
ERNIE Four of my guys he take, the fifth he don't. Rurales take him home to sleep it off. 
BUCKY That's it? 
Ernie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and scratches the back of his neck with it. 
ERNIE Finito. 
EXT. THE CLUB SATAN - LATER 
Bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him. 
He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street, breaking into a slow jog. 
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SECONDS LATER 
Bucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them. 
INT. THE FLEABAG MOTEL - LATER 
Bucky stands in front of his door. He runs his finger up and down the door jamb. The hairs are gone. 
With one swift kick he breaks down the door. 
INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER 
A white man stands with his hands raised. 
MAN Whoa, Bleichert. I'm a friend-- 
Bucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall. He frisks him, pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed. 
MAN (cont'd) Milton Dolphine, citizen of San Diego and a licensed private dick. I got seventy bucks in there but that money's jackshit compared to what Blanchard was holding. You go partners with me and it's easy street-- 
Bucky kicks the man's legs out and pushes his to the floor. 
BUCKY You tell me all of it and you watch what you say about my partner, or it's a B&E roust and the Ensenada jail. 
Dolphine pulls himself up. 
DOLPHINE You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew to follow you? He's got a vested interest in you not finding out about Blanchard. 
Bucky eyes the door. 
BUCKY Does he know I'm staying here? 
DOLPHINE No. 
Bucky steps back from Dolphine. 
BUCKY So. Let's hear it. 
DOLPHINE About a month ago this Mexican woman shows up at my office in Dago. Chubby, ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the nines. Offers me five hundred to find Blanchard. Just like you I track him here where he's playing the rich gringo-- 
A FLASHBACK - LEE TEARING UP AN ENSENADA BAR 
DOLPHINE I even see him beat up two spics who insult this Senorita--Rurales stand by and do nothing. So I know he's paying protection dough. A lot of it. Then  I hear he paid off two plainclothes Rurale to snuff a coupla guys in TJ-- 
A FLASHBACK - BOBBY DE WITT AND FELIX CASCO BLOWN AWAY... 
DOLPHINE I leave a message in Dago for the woman tellin' her what I know... 
BUCKY What's her name? 
DOLPHINE Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos and I'm betting she's one of his. Revenge on Blanchard for offin' Felix. 
Bucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair. This is hitting him hard. 
BUCKY Go on. 
KAY Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think you could fix it? 
BUCKY (relieved) Sure, babe. 
The phone rings. Bucky answers it. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Hello...Hey Vic... 
Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot suicide. 
KAY Sounds lovely. Where is it? 
BUCKY Hancock Park. 
EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING 
Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a technician's canvas bag. 
An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door. 
WOMAN Yes? 
BUCKY I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express my condolences, Mrs.-- 
WOMAN Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted. You're the lab man? 
He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows. 
JANE CHAMBERS It's the study in back of the dining room. You'll see the police rope. If you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden. 
He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening. 
INT. THE STUDY - MORNING 
Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN. 
Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains decorates the white wall and crown mouldings. 
CUT TO: 
A SERIES OF SHOTS 
as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag. 
INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards the main foyer. He stops short. 
ON THE OPPOSING WALL 
hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks like one continuous deep scar. 
It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound. 
Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby family photos--two young women linked arm in arm. 
JANE CHAMBERS The other survivors. Pretty aren't they? 
She arrives next to him, dusty with soil. 
BUCKY Like their mother. How old are they? 
JANE CHAMBERS Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you finished in the study? 
BUCKY Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use pure ammonia... (looking at the two girls) Mrs. Chambers-- 
JANE CHAMBERS Jane. 
BUCKY Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha Sprague? The next block over? 
JANE CHAMBERS (snorts) Those girls and that family. How do you know them? 
BUCKY I did a little work for them once. 
JANE CHAMBERS Consider it lucky if it was a brief encounter. 
BUCKY How do you mean? 
The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it. 
JANE CHAMBERS Back to condolences. Thank you for being so nice, Mr.-- 
BUCKY Bucky. Good-bye, Jane. 
JANE CHAMBERS Good-bye. 
INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER 
Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in. 
VIC You finish working up the suicide, Bucky? 
BUCKY Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about the husband? 
VIC Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was depressed, failing health. The terrible burden of all that money'll get you every time. 
BUCKY Wonder how he made it? 
VIC No mystery there. Real estate. 
BUCKY Oh really? 
INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING 
The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a large box open on the work bench. 
INSIDE THE BOX 
Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS. 
It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his high school sweetheart. 
OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO: 
ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION 
"Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5" 
She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera. 
ELIZABETH SHORT ...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand. He was in a tank battalion. A Commander. He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the deep water you see from a fishing boat... 
She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a scene, her real life, or just a sad lie... 
THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING 
BACK TO SCENE 
Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into the driveway. He covers it back up. 
KAY (getting out) What're you doing? 
JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) Sorry. 
BUCKY So how well do you know the Spragues? 
JANE CHAMBERS Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They served on the California real estate board together. But Emmett was a bit of a crook. My husband got him kicked off the board for building dangerous buildings under phony corporations. 
BUCKY Your husband sounds like a good man. 
JANE CHAMBERS He had his moments. Most of it was out of guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro. When he learned he had cancer, he really started feeling guilty. He voted Democratic last year. Even went in and had meetings with the City Council. I'm sure he gave them dirt on Emmett. 
BUCKY I read an article in the paper. 
JANE CHAMBERS Same day Eldridge killed himself. Apropos, I guess. 
BUCKY Maybe your husband-- 
JANE CHAMBERS My husband was rich and did a mean Charleston. I loved him until I found out he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting to love him again. How strange. 
BUCKY It's not so strange. 
They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A strange emotional peace. 
JANE CHAMBERS You're very accepting of other people's frailties. You're young. You should have illusions. 
BUCKY I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard issue. 
JANE CHAMBERS So how'd a cop get mixed up with Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I assume? 
Bucky's gut clenches. 
BUCKY I stopped her at a red light. One thing led to another. Why do you assume it was Madeleine? 
JANE CHAMBERS Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a roundheels. Always has been. 
BUCKY Jane. Don't be catty. 
JANE CHAMBERS I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure. She probably inherited it from her mother. 
Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced tea. The visit is over. 
JANE CHAMBERS You figure out the rest, officer. 
He follows her back inside. 
INT. THE HALLWAY - SAME 
As they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting. 
BUCKY God that is spooky. 
JANE CHAMBERS Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my birthday a couple years ago. I hate it. Want to take it with you? 
BUCKY No thanks. 
JANE CHAMBERS Thank you, then. You were my best condoler. 
BUCKY And you mine. 
Jane gives Bucky a warm handshake. 
EXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER 
Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on. 
We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to night... 
And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur. 
INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Bucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him. She decides not to and leaves. 
The minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes... 
EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING 
Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box. Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not... 
INT. CRIME LAB - DAY 
Bucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen burner. 
EXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING 
Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up. 
ACROSS THE STREET 
Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky guns his car to follow... 
EXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT 
Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot. He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out of her car he is staggered: 
It's ELIZABETH SHORT. 
Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides into the bar... 
INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT 
Bucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is already taking place. 
Madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her. Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost on anybody. Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals for a drink. 
INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
Four bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him out of the bar. 
EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER 
Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the office with the key and lets the two of them in. 
He watches as the light goes on; and then off. 
INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER 
Bucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him. 
KAY Dwight-- 
He moves to her, pulling off his clothes as quickly as he can. 
KAY (cont'd) Dwight-- 
He's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down her neck and her breasts. 
She responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him, hoping to catch up with his lust. 
She doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection. 
It doesn't work... 
INT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range. 
KAY Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile. 
She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns the engine and disappears. 
INT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER 
Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half the record collection gone, no candlesticks. 
He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window. 
IN THE BEDROOM 
Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed. 
IN THE BATHROOM 
he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with one blow... 
In a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so scavengers can pick the place clean... 
INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT 
Bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall. Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the Black Dahlia. 
A collage of photos and file folders... 
VOICE OVER It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye Bleichert at the bus stop, adios shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool pigeon harness bull. 
EXT. THE SLUMS - LATE NIGHT 
Bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon to anyone who would do him harm. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) You traded a good woman for skunk pussy, you've turned everything that's been handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your "I will's" amount to the eighth round at the Academy gym when you stepped into a Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into clover that you turned into horse dung. 
ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION 
No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings. Not sexy. Empty and resigned. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't meet before 39th and Norton, it just might have worked. Maybe us would've been the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up past redemption... 
EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER 
An apartment complex has been erected at the murder site. 
EXT. AN AERIAL VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - DAY 
ANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign changes, the "D" dropping off the end. It now reads "HOLLYWOODLAN". 
EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY 
Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on a working class residential street. He stares across at a modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize it hopefully; we've been here before. 
EXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk. 
He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the Victorian house and rings the bell. 
EXT. THE PORCH - SAME 
Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical twin to Elizabeth Short. 
Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue. 
GIRL (Boston accent) Can I help you? (no response). Great. Take a hike you big sicko-- 
BUCKY Wait-- 
She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it back open. 
Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father. 
CLEO SHORT It's all right, dear. I know this pug. 
INT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER 
The two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look- a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo. 
Bucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo, who, while five years older, looks much better than last time Bucky saw him. 
CLEO SHORT Came into a little change a while back, managed to trade in that shit shack out back for these digs. (beat) And I don't give a fuck what you think, you and your partner ain't much to look at now. I read the papers. 
Bucky can't deny that. 
The young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky checks her out again. Cleo knows why. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) My youngest, Christine. 
He squeezes her hand affectionately. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) Best housekeeper of the bunch. Can't cook a damn, though. Got her sister's star-eyes for the pictures, damn straight. Thinks she's gonna be another goddamn Jayne Mansfield. Get out of here, Chrissie... 
She rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the porch. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) Used to be dozens'd stop by, you know. Drive up from Dago or San Berdoo just to snap a shot of the goddamn garage back there. Thought maybe they'd find one of Betty's dresses in the garbage. Jackals. 
BUCKY You didn't move far. 
CLEO SHORT Wouldn't a mattered if I did. (beat) Whatcha here for, mug? I know you ain't smart enough to solve the case, and you ain't dumb enough to still think I did it...I had an alibi. 
BUCKY Tighter'n a popcorn fart. 
CLEO SHORT And that's air tight, mug. Air tight. 
Bucky takes a swig of his beer. Cleo's eyes scour Bucky. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) You're hooked on her still, ain't ya? Ha. That's a plug nickel you can't spend, ain't it, mug? Ha. Yea. Betty'll do that to a fella. Especially someone like you. (off Bucky's look) Like I said, I know you mug. 
BUCKY I just thought...Maybe after all this time...There's something you might have forgot...Anything she might have said... 
Cleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost looking like a father who'd lost a daughter. 
CLEO SHORT She was a terrible actress. I'm sure folks've told you that. She'd practice in front of the john mirror. Once or twice she got me in on it...Reading parts with her for some audition. She stunk. Even a parent could tell. What Beth was good at was writing. All her teachers used to say that. Not that a grease like me'd know the difference. Maybe she coulda written for the pictures. But she wanted to be an actress like every other silly girl. 
His gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) Your folks still alive? 
BUCKY My father. 
CLEO SHORT (poking) He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or maybe he thought you'd end up champ? 
Bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it. 
CLEO SHORT Your momma? 
BUCKY She killed herself a long time ago. 
Cleo takes a swig of his beer. 
CLEO SHORT Probably better off then. 
INT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME 
A scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a bicycle tire, rags. 
They move through the house, each roam, each closet and corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing. 
From the kitchen: 
RUSS MILLARD Bucky. 
Bucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off. Through the empty window they see: 
AN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open. 
You know it before they even get there. But as soon as they step inside... 
INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS 
They know something bad happened here... 
Half the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books, including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures. 
RUSS MILLARD God help her. 
Bucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his forensic kit. 
He opens it, revealing the test tubes, fingerprint powder, tweezers, etc. 
BUCKY (throwing Russ gloves) Box up the books and papers. Maybe light that lantern. 
Russ grants Bucky his take-charge attitude. He snaps on a pair of gloves. 
A GRUESOME MONTAGE 
1. Bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube. 
2. Russ flips through the pornographic material--some of it very intense. 
3. Bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed from the caked blood on the mattress. 
4. Underneath the mattress, Bucky finds small pieces of rope... 
5. Bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a piece of paper. 
6. Bucky finger prints the whole fucking place, pulling good prints from the door jamb, the door, and the wall near the head of the mattress. 
OUTSIDE THE GARDENING SHED 
Russ fiddles with the books, making himself busy. Finally he walks back inside. 
INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS 
Bucky sits on the floor, his hands shaking as he holds a fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the other. 
RUSS MILLARD You all right? 
Bucky hands him the fresh plate. Russ studies it. Bucky hands him the piece of paper with a blown-up set of prints on it. The two sets of prints are identical. Russ sees the name at the top of the paper: ELIZABETH SHORT. 
He exhales deeply. 
BUCKY Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's another set of latents up there on the doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad I can't transfer 'em. 
CUT TO: 
RUSS MILLARD HACKING A FOUR INCH SECTION OF THE DOOR JAMB OFF WITH HIS KNIFE AND SLIPPING IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG. 
Bucky sits on the ground outside. 
EXT. UNDERNEATH THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - LATER 
The last of the "LAND" letters has come down and a party has ensued. A marching band plays "There's No Business Like Show Business". 
Bucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands. 
INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT 
Bucky sits on the bed, the evidence spread out around him. Russ stands in the doorway. 
BUCKY We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All of her. (gesturing around the room) All right here. 
RUSS MILLARD Are you sure you don't want to came home? Mrs. Millard'll fix up the couch. 
BUCKY No. Thanks. I'll stay here. (re the doorjamb piece) I want to get up early and confirm these prints. 
Russ nods. 
RUSS MILLARD You're a very very bright penny, Officer. 
He closes the door, leaving Bucky alone with Elizabeth. 
INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT 
Bucky lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling. 
BUCKY (cont'd) That night I pictured myself the way I wanted Elizabeth to picture me--her knight in shining armor, a reborn two-bit harness bull who cracked the biggest unsolved homicide in California history. A war hero, a heavyweight champion. 
INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - DAWN 
Bucky flips through Gray's Anatomy, killing time. 
BUCKY (cont'd) I stayed with her that night and dreamed of all the bullshit that would never happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at all. Because there was no way for me to make the arrest without admitting that I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The case would always be open. And so while it killed me to wait 'til morning, in some ways...this was our last night together. 
INT. THE CRIME LAB - MORNING 
Bucky transfers the killer's prints from the doorjamb to a plate. 
INT. A LARGE ROOM WITH FILE CABINETS 
Bucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet. He shuts the cabinet. The tab on the outside reads: "City Employees". 
EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING 
Bucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side window is open and he pulls himself inside. 
INT. THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS 
Moving boxes fill the front hallway. Bucky hears voices coming from the main hall. Madeleine and Emmett. 
Bucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a SILENCER and screws it on the muzzle. 
EMMETT SPRAGUE (O.S.) ...besides, one of my foremen said the goddamn pipes are spewing gas...There'll be hell to pay. It's about time I showed the three of you good ol' Scotland. 
MADELEINE I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is. 
EMMETT SPRAGUE ...they've got what you need, lassie. 
Bucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side. 
BUCKY And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me? Direct line to the straight dope? Or is that what you needed? 
EMMETT SPRAGUE Aaah, laddie. 
He eyes the gun. 
JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of course you've been staking out the Sprague house. Four nights in a row. (off his surprise) I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost as nosy as you. 
BUCKY (covering) Yeah, well. Old habits die hard. 
He gets up from the table. 
INT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Bucky wanders over and stares at the slash-mouthed clown painting, always transfixed by it. 
JANE CHAMBERS (re the painting) I'd been thinking about giving it to charity, but it's too valuable. I found Eldridge's receipt... 
She wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from her late husbands desk while Bucky continues to stare at the clown. She returns, reading from the sale slip. 
JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) It's a Frederick Yannantuono original, inspired by an old classic novel--The Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo. 
A FLASHBACK - THE GARDENING SHED 
A blood-spattered copy of The Man Who Laughs on the pile of pornography-- 
BACK TO SCENE 
As the slash-mouthed clown towers over Bucky, his head buzzing... 
JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) The clown in the painting is the book's main character, Gwynplain. When he was a child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear and then sold to the 16th century Spanish aristocracy to be used as a court jester. 
Bucky steps back. 
JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) Are you all right, Bucky? 
BUCKY Yes, I'm fine. 
He focuses on her. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Where'd Eldridge get the painting? 
JANE CHAMBERS You'll appreciate the coincidence-- 
She hands him the receipt. 
ANGLE ON THE RECEIPT: 
"Received from Eldridge Chambers, $3500 for the sale of the F. Yannantuono painting. Ramona Cathcart Sprague, January 15, 1947." 
Speechless. 
JANE CHAMBERS What is it-- 
He's out the door. 
EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - SAME 
Bucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down the street... 
EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - SAME 
Bucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the driveway. 
He crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to find it unlocked. He goes inside. 
INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS 
Gun drawn, Bucky cases the downstairs. He hears a noise. 
RAMONA I'm in here, officer. 
A red wave of sweat washes over him. He walks carefully into 
RAMONA'S SITTING ROOM 
where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa, her arms lost in a silk dressing gown. Her face puffy and her eyes dark, her gray hair frizzy. 
Bucky trains a gun on her. 
BUCKY I know what you did, Ramona. You and Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold it the day of the murder. You know I've got the book. And now I've got you. 
She smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she speaks, it's with complete control. 
RAMONA We see you out there, you know. Every night. We see you. You don't fool us. You didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt Madeleine. And as much as I wish you would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a voyeur. That's all the lesser classes have. Pressing their nose up against the glass. 
BUCKY So tell me. Let me see. 
She smiles at him again, loving his need. 
RAMONA Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked just like Georgie. When he got out of the hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely spoke. 
Bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her. 
BUCKY Tell me about Betty Short. 
Her face hardens. 
RAMONA (cont'd) (with venom) It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become obsessed with her...That filthy film. 
BUCKY Your husband bought her for George. 
RAMONA Emmett never stopped hating me. 
BUCKY For George-- 
RAMONA For being richer than he was. 
She looks over her nose at him. 
RAMONA (cont'd) I followed them to the bungalow. There was a baseball bat under...under a tree...She tried to run from me...but she was drunk. The first swing knocked her out. I made Georgie tie her to the mattress....The second swing woke her up. 
BUCKY You tortured her. 
She seems to drift. 
RAMONA (cont'd) She looked so much like my Maddy. It was...the cruelest of jokes. 
Her thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky. 
RAMONA (cont'd) Martha mustn't know. She's all that's left of this family that isn't dying. You consider her when you decide whether we're worth it. 
Bucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite well. 
RAMONA (cont'd) Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought Martha was going to bring the whole family down around her by chance. Her little stunt about tipping the police to LaVerne's-- 
BUCKY She lied about that. To get Madeleine's goat. 
Ramona's eyes brighten up.

"SIGNS" 
SIGNS

M. Night Shyamalan 
FADE IN: 
INT.  WINDOW - MORNING 
We are looking out a second story window of a house.  The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a picnic table. 
The backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. Six feet high. 
Everything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING 
GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS OUTSIDE CHIRPING. 
Graham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the bedroom door. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING 
Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat. 
He relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his bedroom. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING 
A bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED. 
Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's ghostly stained forever on the blank wall. 
A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY. 
The water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very still. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
The bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his children's room.  There are children's books everywhere. Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners. 
Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both empty. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING 
WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE. 
MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and looks around bewildered. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING 
Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the backyard.  He spins as he looks around. 
Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side stairs adjacent to the garage building. 
Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each other across the yard. 
MERRILL Where are they? 
Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes. 
CHILDREN (yelling in the distance) Daaaad! 
Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS. 
CUT TO: 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME 
Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table. 
Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him. 
Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. 
As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. 
Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK. 
Beat. 
They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak. 
MORGAN (soft) He wanted to kill Bo. 
Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son. 
GRAHAM Did he hurt you? 
Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him up in his arms. 
GRAHAM (whispers in his ear) I'm so sorry Morgan. 
Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both his children as they cry in his arms. 
He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of food. 
MERRILL I used a little Tabasco in the potato salad. 
Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym. 
BO Houdini's sick. 
GRAHAM Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed.  Make sure the knot's tight. 
Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He nods. 
The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed. 
Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door. 
The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - LATE EVENING 
Graham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself. 
GRAHAM They're tough cookies, those two. They think Houdini's playing with you up there. (beat) At least it got them to sleep. 
Graham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little. 
GRAHAM Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one for you... What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field... and what would scare every animal in this county? (beat) Have you figured it out yet? (smiles) You probably have... (beat) Give me a hint Colleen... Is it bigger than a bread box? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT 
The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight. 
A MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND. 
THEY SUDDENLY STOP. 
AN UNNATURAL SILENCE FILLS THE YARD. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is five inches away from his face. 
Graham gets startled. 
GRAHAM What's the matter? 
GRAHAM (whispering) It doesn't sound natural when I curse. 
MERRILL (whispering) Just make noises then. 
GRAHAM (whispering) Explain noises. 
MERRILL (whispering) Are you going to do this or what? 
GRAHAM (whispering) No I'm not. 
MERRILL (whispering) You want him coming in the house next time? 
Beat. 
They HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.  Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness. 
MERRILL (hushed tone) On the count of three. (beat) One... two... three. 
Merrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite directions. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT 
Merrill is in a full sprint.  He hugs the side of the building as he runs. 
MERRILL We're gonna beat your ass bitch! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  GRAHAM'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT 
Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house.  He waves his arms. 
GRAHAM Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger. 
Graham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead of him. 
GRAHAM I've lost my mind!  It's time for an ass whoopin'! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT 
Merrill turns a corner full speed.  THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME TO A STOP IN THE SHADOWS AHEAD OF HIM.  HE SEEMS TO BLEND INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN HE'S STILL. 
MERRILL I'm gonna tear your head off! 
Merrill charges.  WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS AS THE FIGURE DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT 
Graham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come to a stop facing each other.  Beat. 
They look around, panting heavily. 
GRAHAM I cursed. 
MERRILL I heard. 
Graham's eyes drift above them. 
GRAHAM He's on the roof. 
They follow the roof around the corner.  They find themselves in the backyard. 
Their eyes catch movement away from the house.  They just catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the crops.  The swing on the swing set is still moving from being hit. 
They stare across the yard silently.  ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR HEAVY BREATHING. 
MERRILL (V.O.) It was very dark. 
GRAHAM (V.O.) Yes it was. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  PORCH - DAY 
Officer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad open.  He faces Graham and Merrill. 
Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow Graham up the 
STAIRS. 
MERRILL That roof is over ten feet high. 
GRAHAM He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high. 
They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his bedroom.  He moves into his 
BATHROOM. 
They all move in with him. 
OFFICER PASKI They got women's high jumping in the Olympics.  They got these Scandinavian women who could jump clean over me. 
Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open the back. 
GRAHAM Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I have double A's in here. 
Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the bathroom. 
GRAHAM I know you're making a point Edgar. I just don't know what it is. 
They moves down the STAIRS. 
OFFICER PASKI Yesterday afternoon, an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. Scared a couple of customers.  No one's seen her since... My point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw.  We should just keep all possibilities available. 
They move through the FAMILY ROOM. 
Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon. 
BO Dad, where's the remote? 
Bo starts looking around the couch. 
Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over to the television. 
There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen. 
GRAHAM Bo, you're too old to still be doing this.  The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it. (beat) Now what's wrong with this one? 
Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her father.  Looks at the glass. 
BO There's dust in it. 
GRAHAM This one? 
BO A hair. 
GRAHAM This one? 
BO Morgan took a sip.  It has his amoebas in it. 
Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads towards the kitchen. 
MERRILL Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else is a possibility? 
OFFICER PASKI I'm not done asking questions and I don't appreciate the sarcasm. 
They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into the KITCHEN. 
Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio. 
OFFICER PASKI Do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you? Maybe a church member, who might not have liked the fact, that you left the church? 
Graham looks at Edgar. 
GRAHAM I don't think so. 
OFFICER PASKI Do you owe anybody money?  You can tell me off the record if you need too. 
GRAHAM No. 
MERRILL No. 
Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts replacing the batteries. 
OFFICER PASKI Is anything missing? 
GRAHAM No. 
GRAHAM Six months. 
Edgar stares at Graham. 
GRAHAM And three weeks. 
OFFICER PASKI It's left its mark still.  The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.  Take them into town.  Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things.  It's good medicine. 
GRAHAM It's good advice... (beat) Say hi to Marcia for me. 
OFFICER PASKI You take care of yourself... (beat) Graham. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON 
WE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.  RURAL PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL.  TREE LINED STREETS. WHITE PICKET FENCES.  APPLE ORCHARDS. 
The Hess family rides in their station wagon.  Graham drives. Merrill is shotgun.  The children are in the back. 
Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO. 
RADIO VOICE ... signs intended to be seen from the sky -- 
CLICK.  Graham TURNS IT OFF. 
GRAHAM No radio either... Just for a while. 
Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON 
Downtown Bucks County.  A group of small stores along a quiet street. 
The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter. 
Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around.  Merrill puts change in the meter. 
Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo. 
MORGAN Book money. 
Morgan holds out his hand.  Graham gives his son a look as he reaches into his back pocket. 
GRAHAM Only one. 
Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand and walks down the sidewalk. 
Graham watches them turn into a store. 
Merrill steps onto the sidewalk.  Hands in his pockets as he walks away. 
Graham turns and calls after him. 
GRAHAM (calls out) Meet back in fifteen minutes. 
Merrill waves over his shoulder.  He keeps walking. 
Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON 
A mom and pop bookstore.  Three isles wide.  MR. AND MRS. NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their counter and watch a black and white TV.  The PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD.  THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES SURROUND A CIRCLE. 
Morgan steps up to the counter. 
MORGAN Extraterrestrials? 
MR. NATHAN That's what they keep alluding to. It's just a bunch of crock. They're trying to sell sodas, plain and simple.  I've been watching these reports since morning.  I've seen twelve soda commercials so far.  Twelve! 
MORGAN Do you have book on extraterrestrials? 
MR. NATHAN Don't tell me you believe this horse manure? 
Morgan shrugs.  Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside. 
MRS. NATHAN As a matter of fact, I think we have one.  Came by mistake in a shipment.  Decided to keep it for city people. 
CREWCUT GUY You got two minor league home run records don't you? 
Beat. 
MERRILL Five.  The five longest. 
CREWCUT GUY Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A? 
YOUNG MAN (O.S.) Cause he also has the minor league strike out record. 
Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at the folding table. 
MERRILL Hello Lionel. 
LIONEL smirks. 
LIONEL He'd just swing as hard as he could every time.  It didn't matter what the coach said, didn't matter who was on base, he'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could... Looked like a lumber jack chopping down a tree. (beat) Merrill here, struck out more times than any two players. 
Beat. 
CREWCUT GUY You really hold the strike out record? 
Beat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times. 
MERRILL Felt wrong not to swing. 
Beat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and starts walking. 
As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches and covers his face. 
Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON 
PHARMACIST I cursed thirty-seven times last week... I said the f-word a couple times, but mostly "shits" and "bastards." (beat) Is "Douche bag" a curse? 
Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the counter. 
GRAHAM I suppose it's in its usage. 
PHARMACIST How about "John you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara?" 
GRAHAM That's a curse. 
PHARMACIST Then it's not thirty-seven.  It's seventy-one. 
Graham's eyes widen. 
PHARMACIST I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip stick from K-mart... I punched my brother in the back three times... 
Graham looks around the empty store for help. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON 
Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water. There is another glass, half-full, on her table.  Mrs. Nathan watches as the little girl takes careful sips. 
Beat.  Bo looks up with a grimace. 
BO It's contaminated. 
MRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE. 
MRS. NATHAN Carl, there's something wrong with our water! 
Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book. 
MORGAN Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing about her drinking water.  She's had it her whole life.  Like a tick people have.  Except it's not a tick. 
MRS. NATHAN (fascinated) Is that right? 
Bo shrugs.  She places the glass she sipped on the table with the other glass. 
Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old. 
MR. NATHAN (O.S.) Thirteen! 
Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan points to the TV screen.  A Coke Cola commercial is on. 
GRAHAM It's broken Morgan.  It'll just keep doing this. (beat) Let's get out of the car okay? 
MORGAN We might lose the signal. 
GRAHAM We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this. 
MERRILL We'll look like mental patients. 
Beat.  Nobody gets out of the station wagon. 
GRAHAM I'm getting out now. 
MORGAN Don't do it. 
Graham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right after. 
OUTSIDE CAR 
Graham stands and closes his driver side door. 
THE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS.  THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS.  THE STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND TEXTURE. 
MORGAN Nobody move! 
Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon. Three of the doors are open. 
IN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE... 
MORGAN Voices.  Did you hear that? 
Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand. 
MORGAN Not English though.  You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill? 
BO I heard them Morgan. 
Graham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to Merrill over the roof of the station wagon. 
GRAHAM It's probably picking up another baby monitor. 
MERRILL That's right. 
THE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE STATION WAGON. 
MERRILL Let me see it. 
Beat.  Graham moves.  He hands the monitor over the hood. Merrill reaches for it. 
THE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES. 
MORGAN Stop! 
Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over the roof of the station wagon. 
WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN QUICKLY FADE AWAY. 
MORGAN It doesn't sound like words. 
Merrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE BABY MONITOR. 
Graham looks around at his rapt family. 
GRAHAM See this is why we're not watching those news reports.  People get obsessed. (beat) I'm letting go now. 
BO No dad! 
MORGAN Don't do it! 
MERRILL You'll lose the signal! 
Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them.  Beat. 
Morgan is the first one to move. 
MORGAN Don't let go. 
He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper where he begins to climb onto the station wagon. 
GRAHAM Morgan? 
MORGAN It gets clearer, the higher you hold it. 
GRAHAM I can see how people can get carried away with this type of thing. 
Graham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM. 
Graham starts toward the crops. 
GRAHAM It's a kind of faith.  It's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see. 
THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and then steps into the field of 
CORN CROPS. 
We can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM. 
GRAHAM You were always good at that... 
THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either side. 
GRAHAM Believing in things you couldn't see. (beat) You would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor. 
SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD. 
Graham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing but crops disappearing into darkness. 
GRAHAM It'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be -- all just make believe. 
THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS. 
GRAHAM (yelling) You're wasting your time here!  I'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or TV or anybody!  You're not going to get famous! 
Beat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF HIM. 
Beat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM. 
Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND. 
GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS FAST AND LOUD NOW. 
Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the "on" button.  He does. 
A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY. 
It instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts running. 
Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING BEHIND HIM. 
Graham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM. 
Another sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his 
BACKYARD. 
Graham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS FRANTICALLY. 
When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns. 
There is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet away sway in the gentle night breeze. 
Graham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING 
Graham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He locks the back door. 
The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes. 
Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. He sees Merrill there. 
Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't notice him either. 
Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind.  Beat. 
Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the children at the sink, he turns off the faucet. 
The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They follow his stare to the kitchen table. 
Beat.  Graham looks up at them. 
GRAHAM (soft) Okay. (beat) Let's turn on the TV. 
MORGAN There are pictures. 
Beat.  Morgan opens the tome. 
MORGAN Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book -- 
GRAHAM Bimboo? 
MORGAN Dad. 
GRAHAM I just asked his name. 
MERRILL You had a tone. 
Beat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a tone. 
MORGAN He says there are two reasons why Extraterrestrials would visit us. 
Morgan turns the page. 
MORGAN To make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe. 
Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human. 
MORGAN Or the other reason... They're hostile.  They've used up the resources on their planet and are looking to harvest our planet next. 
Morgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at it.  Beat. 
GRAHAM Looks a little like our house doesn't it? 
Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat. 
BO The same windows. 
MORGAN (soft) That's weird. 
The three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children. 
THE PHONE RINGS. 
The children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes the book. 
GRAHAM That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for now.  Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something. 
Graham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under his arm and picks up the phone. 
PHONE VOICE Father. 
THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects. 
GRAHAM Hello? 
NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then slowly hangs it up. 
Graham walks down the hall to a small window. 
The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FRONT HALL - DAY 
Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it. 
Merrill looks up from the television. 
GRAHAM I'm going out for a few minutes. No one leaves this house.  No one. 
Merrill nods. 
MERRILL Where are you going? 
GRAHAM Ray Reddy's house. 
Graham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked. 
MERRILL Why? 
Graham unlocks the front door. 
GRAHAM I think he just called here. 
RAY I worked so long that night.  I ain't never fallen asleep driving before.  And never since.  Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car insight in either direction.  If I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended up in a ditch with a head ache.  It had to happen at that right moment. That certain ten-fifteen seconds when I passed her walking.  It was like it was meant to be. 
Ray finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks. 
RAY I guess if this is the end of the world, I'm screwed right?  People who kill Reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven. 
Ray starts the car. 
GRAHAM Where you going Ray? 
RAY To the lake.  The way I see it, all the places marked in the crops and such -- none of them are really near water.  I figure they don't like water. (beat) Can't be any worse than here. 
Beat. 
GRAHAM Ray, did you see one of them? 
Ray looks at Graham. 
RAY I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours. 
The two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away. He puts the car in drive. 
RAY And don't open my pantry Father.  I locked one of them in there. 
Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down the driveway. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLOSET - DAY 
Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats. His eyes are closed. 
TV ANCHOR ... The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a forty-two year old Romero Valadares. 
Merrill's eyes open. 
TV ANCHOR This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday, in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the local news bureau there and satellited to us a few minutes ago. All initial opinions are; this is genuine. 
THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED. 
TV ANCHOR What you are about to see, may disturb you. 
Merrill sits up in his chair. 
THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING GLASS WINDOW. 
THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS. 
THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE BACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE. 
THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL AROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES. 
The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen. 
WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE. 
THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING INTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN. 
THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE. 
MERRILL Move children!  Vamonos! 
THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD. 
WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A SMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE BUILDING. 
WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE. 
BOY WITH HAT Esta atras da garagem!  Esta atras de ai!  Is behind! 
THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE SETTLES BACK ON THE WINDOW.  WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT. 
AND THEN WE SEE IT. 
THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON- HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE WALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND. 
Merrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little. The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE VIDEO. 
THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT REWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A FLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN. 
THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES. 
THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES. 
Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon comes to a fast stop. 
Beat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the road. 
A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed. 
Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat. 
Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY above him. 
GRAHAM (soft) Douche bag. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY 
Graham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room. 
Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat. 
MERRILL They're skin changes color.  That's why we couldn't see him that night. 
Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes a seat on the second to last step. 
He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat. 
GRAHAM Tell me something Morgan.  In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? 
MORGAN Yes.  They would invade us using only ground tactics.  Hand to hand combat.  They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them. 
MERRILL I'm sorry, what book is this? 
GRAHAM Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade? 
MORGAN They said one of two things could happen.  One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later. 
GRAHAM What's two? 
MORGAN They win. 
The words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second step of the stairs. 
GRAHAM What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something? 
MORGAN Sounds made up. 
Beat. 
GRAHAM We can choose to believe it and pack up and leave. (beat) Or we can stay here.  Board up this house.  Hide inside our home and wait it out.  Either way, at least we'll be together. (beat) All those in favor of the lake, raise your hand. 
No one raises their hand. 
GRAHAM All those in favor of home, raise your hand. 
All four put their hands in the air.  Beat.  They lower them and sit in silence. 
MERRILL How do we know boards will do anything? 
Beat. 
GRAHAM (soft) Because, they seem to have trouble with pantry doors. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room after another. 
WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch. 
OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at us.  She is shivering. 
OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. He's moving into the main house. 
Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around carefully as he moves. 
Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs encased in glass cases. 
The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it. 
MERRILL (whispers) You guys okay? 
They don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto trucks on the television. 
MORGAN Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. (beat) Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill? 
MERRILL Don't worry. 
Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle. 
MORGAN You sure right? 
Beat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He turns back to the children. 
MERRILL You know about signs Morgan?  Not like the ones people write on. It's like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it.  Then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled.  They're things that happen by chance or luck, but make you feel that someone's watching out for you. 
The children think it over.  Beat. 
MORGAN I once had a bad dream and I couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and I woke up.  It was a picture of mom.  She was smiling. It made me feel safe... You mean like that? 
Beat. 
MERRILL Yeah, like that. (beat) I believe in signs Morgan.  I think there's someone watching out for us.  I got to believe he's going to make sure we're all right in the end. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 
Merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the door half-way. 
He stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep breaths as everything hits him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON 
Morgan turns off the television. 
He and Bo sit quietly in the closet under the stairs. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FAMILY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Graham sits in a chair by the windows.  He has a board on his lap.  He has a hammer in his hands.  Graham drowns in his thoughts as the skies darken behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING - EVENING 
Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway. There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls. 
Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools. 
MERRILL Too many windows in the bedrooms. We don't have enough boards. 
Merrill stands and leans against the wall. 
GRAHAM We'll have to board up the bedroom doors. 
MORGAN Where are we going to sleep? 
GRAHAM The family room. 
Everyone sits quietly for a moment. 
MORGAN What about Isabelle? 
GRAHAM We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner. 
Beat. 
MERRILL I'll make sandwiches. 
BO I want spaghetti? 
MERRILL We should eat fast Bo. 
GRAHAM Spaghetti sounds great. 
Merrill glances at Graham. 
Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight... The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a few inches lower than Merrill's reach. 
GRAHAM Let go. 
Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to the attic. 
Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds the weight of the attic door. 
After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat. 
It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet door with a THUD. 
The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. THUD. 
The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges keeping it upright. 
Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING 
THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE. 
Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON THE DOOR. 
THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR UPSTAIRS. 
Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the stairs. 
ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING 
The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he enters the kitchen. 
Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the table against the swinging door. 
They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and jam the rest underneath the table. 
Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at the pile of furniture. 
MERRILL This is going to do nothing. 
GRAHAM We have to go in the basement. 
Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a darkened door at the bottom. 
MERRILL There's no way out of there. 
Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children. 
GRAHAM Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? 
THUD. 
MERRILL Should we make a run for it out the back? 
GRAHAM They're right behind the door. 
Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall. 
GRAHAM He was only a year and half old. 
MERRILL (to Graham) What are you doing? 
GRAHAM He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar.  Your grandma said, "No."  He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it. 
THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen. 
GRAHAM I must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle.  His elbow popped right out of the socket. 
THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL. 
WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS. 
GRAHAM He didn't scream or anything.  His arm just flopped to his side and he got real still. 
MERRILL They're coming. 
MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS. 
THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO LESSEN. 
Beat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S FACE. 
GRAHAM Where's Bo? 
THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES, BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT. 
BO I'm okay. 
ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT. 
HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO. 
He turns the knob to "on."  The radio lights up, but no sound emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS. 
Beat. 
MERRILL What's happening out there? 
Beat. 
GRAHAM (in the dark) I can't even imagine. 
THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS. 
MORGAN I hope they're doing better than we are.  We don't even have helmets. 
THERE IS A LOUD BANG. 
BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME TO A STOP ON THE DOOR. 
ANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE. 
BANG. 
GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door and then turns and faces the lights. 
GRAHAM They're just making noises. They're not trying to get in. (beat) Why are they doing that? 
Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL. 
MERRILL They want our attention on the door? 
BANG.  A beat of silence. 
GRAHAM They're distracting us? 
MERRILL From what? 
MORGAN The book says they're probably very good problem solvers. 
MERRILL What book! 
MORGAN They'll find a way in. 
BANG. 
GRAHAM Morgan, give me your flashlight. 
Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR. 
THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it up. 
GRAHAM Is there an air vent in here? 
Merrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR. 
They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The brothers move in opposite directions. 
GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE CEILING AS HE MOVES. 
MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS. 
A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR. 
Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now. 
GRAHAM I can feel air. 
A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON. 
GRAHAM There we go... We don't have to be scared at all... We know it'll pass.  We believe it... Don't be afraid Morgan. 
Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand. 
THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR THROUGH A STRAW. 
Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his son. 
GRAHAM Feel my chest... Breathe with me. Together... The air is going in our lungs... Together... We're the same.  We're the same. 
Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with Graham's. 
THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO LABORED BREATHS. 
Graham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one. 
GRAHAM (soft) I hate you. 
Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each other tight. 
THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST IN THEIR THOUGHTS. 
Beat. 
MERRILL I should save the flashlights. 
Beat.  Graham nods without looking over. 
MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS. 
Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE HER AND MERRILL. 
Merrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the button. 
THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  BASEMENT - MORNING 
WE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS. IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER. 
VOICE ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have also confirmed. 
Graham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT. 
Merrill steps into his vision. 
MERRILL I found a pack of light bulbs. 
Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF THE RADIO. 
RADIO VOICE ... Parts of China and Northern Korea are among the few remaining to verify withdrawals. 
GRAHAM They're broadcasting... 
MERRILL It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up. (beat) We won Graham. 
Merrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat. 
MERRILL It went on all night.  Everywhere. It was completely a ground battle. Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see them unless you're up close.  A lot of people died.  Some from combat. But most from poison gas inhalation.  They secrete it. 
Beat. 
GRAHAM How many died? 
MERRILL They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. (beat) But we held strong. 
GRAHAM How do they know it's over? 
MERRILL A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now. (beat) They're leaving. 
Beat. 
MERRILL You didn't think we'd make it. 
Beat. 
GRAHAM No. 
She points at the closet. 
Morgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at him. 
GRAHAM You want to see it? 
Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe. 
GRAHAM I'll bring the TV in here. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLOSET - MORNING 
THE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS.  A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE. 
TV REPORTER Today there are no countries, and no races, and no differences -- we are all apart of the same -- 
Graham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black. 
Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and the television cart out into the hall. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING 
Graham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful not to trip it on the carpet. 
THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR. 
Graham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS. 
THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE TELEVISION SCREEN. 
The TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. His back is to the family room. 
Graham straightens and turns around slowly. 
Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up. 
For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes. 
There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly, it almost disappears. 
It blinks. 
Graham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the front hall. 
Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and Merrill in the middle of the family room. 
Morgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT. 
The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand. 
Graham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE. 
The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM. 
A small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING. 
Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's. 
GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM. 
GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES. 
WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION IN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT. 
GRAHAM (soft) He's reading my -- 
THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.  THE ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  STREET - NIGHT 
WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. 
The car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze. 
We are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances. 
GRAHAM Good. 
Graham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts crying with her. 
COLLEEN (crying) ... Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly. 
GRAHAM (crying) ... I will. 
COLLEEN (crying) ... Tell Bo to listen to her brother.  He'll always take care of her. 
GRAHAM (crying) ... I will. 
COLLEEN (crying) ... Tell Graham -- 
GRAHAM (crying) I'm here. 
COLLEEN (crying) Tell him... See.  Tell him to see. 
Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests on it.  Her eyes are distant. 
COLLEEN (soft) And tell Merrill to swing away. 
GRAHAM (soft) What? (beat) Colleen?... Colleen? 
WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING 
WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM.  THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM. 
THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING RELEASED. 
THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE. 
THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN WINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL. 
Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat. 
GRAHAM (soft) Swing away, Merrill. 
Morgan's face is obscured by gas. 
GRAHAM (loud) Merrill. 
Merrill turns and looks to Graham. 
GRAHAM Swing away. 
Graham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him. 
Beat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting place. 
The creature starts to move. 
Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg. 
The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the room. 
Merrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through the air of the family room... Contact. 
The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball bat. 
Morgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop lifelessly to the carpet. 
The creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. The creature falls to the ground. 
Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham picks up his son's limp body in his arms. 
The creature moves to its feet. 
Merrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on fire. 
Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine on the ground. 
Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND. 
Bo and Graham look up. 
THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS INTO A POWDERY WHITE.

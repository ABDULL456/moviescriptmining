1   MUSIC UP. It's a tad eerie. If a Zydeco band died in a     1 bus crash this is the kind of music they'd play in heaven. FADE IN ON: WHITE SCREEN which transforms to a milky white and eventually into a bright high noon sun. A large black bird flies in circles overhead. As it wipes the sun a bright flare causes... CLOSEUP - PAIR OF EYES to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open.    They look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed. CLOSEUP - MAN 
the owner of the eyes. Though we only see from his shoulders to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field. His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears to be resting comfortably. MUFFLED VOICES and WHISPERS fill the air but they seem to come from another place. The man doesn't notice them. His name is BUTCH. A gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw wipes across his forehead. Then, oddly enough, it is followed by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters across his face. It is followed by another and another, a five, a ten, a single. Butch pays no attention. He's in another world. DISSOLVE TO: 2   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MADISONVILLE, TX. - DUSK                 2 SUPERSCRIPT:    OCTOBER, 1963. A small country town. Normally quiet at this hour, the street is tonight alive with trick or treaters dressed as witches, goblins and superheroes making their annual door to door rounds. 3   EXT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     3 GLADYS PERRY, 30 going on 45 due to single motherhood and having worked two fulltime minimum wage jobs the past ten years, looks out the window with disgust and pulls the curtains closed. 4   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     4 Gladys retreats   from the sparsly decorated living room to the predictably drab   linoleum kitchen. At the table, hands on their laps, sit   her children, NAOMI and RUTH, twin girls aged 10, and PHILLIP,   a quiet boy of 8. (CONTINUED) 
4   CONTINUED:                                                    4 Gladys sets a casserole on the table and goes to the frig for a container of milk. The children WHISPER to one another... NAOMI Judy Baumer is going as a twirler. RUTH But she's so fat.     I'd go as Cinderella... or Peter Pan. NAOMI Peter Pan's a boy. Tinker Bell's a girl. Phillip could go as Peter Pan... 'cept you gotta' fly. 
10    EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                          10 Superman lofts a BALLOON and grabs another as the first hits the door of the Perry house and SPLATTERS. SUPERMAN Bombs away! Dancing Skeleton does his best Warren Spahn and tosses a wet fastball at the door. SKELETON Here's your trick! At the window, Phillip, his nose pressed to the pane, stares expressionless at the onslaught. He barely flinches as a BALLOON SPLATS only inches away. Gladys arrives and pulls the curtains shut once more. 11A   EXT. PRISON - NIGHT                                         11A Butch kicks the top off a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the roof. Jerry follows as Butch shimmies to the wall. At the edge, Butch and Jerry survey the yard as a searchlight routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light. 11B   THEIR POV - GREEN IMPALA                                    11B parked almost directly below them, next to the Administration office of the prison. JERRY You'n'me must be livin' right, Butchie boy! BUTCH Let's get something straight. I don't like you. As soon as we're on our way, that's it. JERRY Who said I liked you? Butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on the roof of the building below. 12    INT. ADMIN OFFICE - NIGHT                                   12 A SOFT THUD causes a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as he spots Larry departing, files in hand, waving goodbye. GUARD Have a safe trip now, Larry. 
13    EXT. YARD - NIGHT                                          13 Just as Larry reaches the Impala, Butch and Jerry leap down and land on him. The spotlight showers them in a flash of light as it passes by. Butch cups his hand over Larry's mouth while Jerry reaches into his jacket -- Bingo -- a shiny .38. BUTCH (to Larry) Keep yer' mouth shut. JERRY (to Larry) Gawd I'd love to blow yer' head off. 
14    EXT. PRISON GATE - NIGHT                                        14 Larry, driving with his eyes straight ahead, stops at the gate and waves a palm at the Guard, who opens without hesitation. GUARD 'Night, Larry. 15    INT. CAR - FLOORBOARD - NIGHT                                   15 stuffed and hidden half on the floor and half under the mats are Jerry and Butch. JERRY 'Night, Larry. 16    OMITTED                                                         16 16A   INT. SMALL, WELL-LIT DINER - NIGHT                              16A A weathered finger drops a quarter in a jukebox. 
MAN (O.S.) B-5.   Haven't heard that one in awhile. The woman, MAE, 45, a dog-tired waitress, punches in the numbers and returns to her post behind the counter. A lonesome HANK WILLIAMS tune pours forth. MAE Not since last night.     How's the pie? RED GARNETT, 60, a grizzled but handsome Texas Ranger, sits at the counter slowly chewing. RED Kinda rubbery.   It was better yesterday. (CONTINUED) 
16A   CONTINUED:                                                     16A MAE Same pie as yesterday. Not much call for rhubarb. Sell one slice a day. In the background we hear a SIREN. Red turns and watches a police patrol car whiz past, lights on. MAE Yer off duty. Tell me, if I stopped bakin' 'em would you still come by every night? Red, preoccupied, takes another rubbery bite. RED I don't know. 
Mae smiles and turns her back to Red as she cleans the grill. MAE Naw, Red Garnett, you don't come in here for the coffee and pie. You come in here for the company. To see me. Another patrol car races past.   Red's eyes follow it. 
16B   ANGLE ON MAE                                                   16B MAE Now that I've said that, I'll go   one better. What say I cook you dinner at my   place sometime? Steaks, baked taters,    cold beer, the works. Well?... I'm askin'    you out. She turns to face Red but he's gone. A coupla dollars lie next to the half-eaten pie. All she can do is sigh. 
16C   INT./EXT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT                                   16C Red pulls up in front of a small house in a residential section of town. Police cars are everywhere and several officers are behind their vehicles, guns pointed at the house. Red steps out of the car and is greeted by a POLICE SERGEANT, about the same age as Red. SERGEANT Long time, no see. What are you doin' here, Chief? RED Couldn't sleep.   Whattaya got? (CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:                                                     17 Jerry skims through a girly magazine, turning the pages with the gun. Butch, wearing Larry's plaid jacket, jimmies open the cash register. He looks to the floor then to... Jerry, who catches Butch's gaze, holds it, looks down at the floor, then, smiling, looks back to Butch. He returns to the skin mag. Butch holds his stare at Jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store. Jerry notices Butch leaving, grabs a handful of assorted Brach's candies and hurries after. 
JERRY Hey, wait up! Jerry's feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a quivering hand. 18   INT. D.P.S. - TEXAS RANGERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT               18 It's very late, after midnight, and only a handful of people, half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices. A light from an office at the end of the hall catches our eye. A MUFFLED  VOICE over the phone... RED (V.O.) I understan' your concern, Johnny. 19   INT. RED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                      19 Red, behind a huge    ranchstyle desk covered with files and paper, sips coffee    with one hand, works a buffalo nickel through magician's    paces with the other and balances the phone receiver in    the crook of his neck. RED (on phone) Cons are creatures o' habit. Like old coyotes, they'll crawl back into familiar holes. Uh huh... Yeah... Sure yer' right. Listen you go back to bed and I'll call you in the A.M. with an update. I'll have the files by then. Say hullo to the Mrs.. Red sighs, puts the PHONE back in the hook and stares at it until it RINGS again. 20   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT (JUST BEFORE DAWN)                    20 The CLANGING wind up alarm CLOCK reads 5:30 and Gladys opens her eyes and gently quiets it with a touch. She groans and rises, not happy but used to the daily ritual required of her. 
21   INT. PERRY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                 21 As the kitchen light comes on we see that the couch has been opened up to a bed in which all three children sleep. The twins sleep soundly but Phillip tosses and turns away from the light. 22   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                      22 The Impala creeps through the previously seen neighborhood without its lights. 23   INT. IMPALA - NIGHT                                            23 Butch drives while Jerry scours the block. JERRY There's a Buick. BUTCH Don't want a Buick. Want a Ford. JERRY Ford's leak oil.     A car's a car. Butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop. BUTCH Then take the Buick. JERRY Soon as we cross state line I'll do just that. (beat) I'm tired of riding around. I'll check down the block... for a Ford! Jerry gets out, slams the door, lights a cigarette and walks away. Butch waits a few seconds, quietly turns the key one notch and checks the gas ggauge. It reads almost empty. He taps it with his finger but it doesn't budge. He sighs, looks up and sees... JERRY as he checks one locked car, then feeling eyes on his back, turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a corner. BUTCH discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the door without a sound. 24   INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               24 Gladys steps into a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs into a skillet. By rote she salts, stirs, and pops bread into the toaster. 
25    EXT. PERRY BACKYARD - SOMEONE'S POV - NIGHT                  25 FROM BEHIND a fence, THROUGH the opened, screened windows we see Gladys at work. Phillip enters, dressed in cotton briefs and a T-shirt, drags a chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his mother by buttering the toast. POV MOVES CLOSER. GLADYS Thank you, Phillip. Go wake up your sisters. Phillip dutifully steps down and returns to the living room. Gladys works to adjust her slip, then grabs plates and silverware and takes them to the table. 
JERRY I take mine fried. 26    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         26 Gladys gasps at Jerry's face pressed against the screen, but controls herself when he brandishes the pistol. He motions for her to open the back door. She does. He slides into the room and sits down at the table. 27    EXT. ON STREET - NIGHT                                       27 A Ford sits in a driveway. In the far b.g. a back porch light glares. Butch ENTERS FRAME, looks at the light, turns to the Ford and starts to jimmie the lock. No luck. He rises and looks to the light. 28    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         28 Jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys and makes a motion to the counter. JERRY A lil' on the bland side.   Gimme' that ketchup. She picks up a bottle of Heinz and inches toward him. When she gets close, he grabs her and forces her onto his lap. He holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear. JERRY Don't got a man around here, do ya'? 29A   INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                29A MR. CUMMINGS, 70, puts on his glasses and peers through the window. 
29B   HIS POV - PERRY KITCHEN                                        29B Gladys sits on Jerry's lap, thanks to .38 caliber coercion. The convict's hands move freely over the frightened woman's body. 30    INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               30 JERRY Feed me, sweet thing. Her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips.    He licks them once then gobbles with gusto. Phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks. JERRY Well lookie here, you do got a man! Jerry smiles at Phillip while he kisses and licks Glady's neck. At once, Phillip darts across the room at Jerry, who backhands the boy with his gunhand, sending Phillip sprawling. Butch blasts through the door in an instant. With a swift kick to the head, Jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor against the cabinets. The gun slides across the floor and lands at Phillip's feet. JERRY (holding his ear) I'm bleedin'! You happy? Butch gives Jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level with Phillip. Butch looks at the gun and then at Phillip. BUTCH What's your name, boy? 
PHILLIP (scared shitless) Ph...   Phillip... BUTCH Well, okay Phillip. Reach down and pick up that pistola. JERRY Give it to me. BUTCH (to Jerry) Shut yer' mouth. (to Phillip) Pick it up and bring it over here. (CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:                                                    30 Phillip reaches down and slowly picks up the gun by the handle. He takes one step toward Butch, then another. Gladys, petrified, sobs. Phillip arrives armslength from Butch. CLOSEUPS - PHILLIP AND BUTCH BUTCH Now say 'stick 'em up.' PHILLIP (hesitant) Stick 'em up... 
RED Adler...    what is this? Adler searches the messy desk for something. ADLER Rings a bell, Red. Believ' they sent us something about her this mornin'... RED Who sent?... ADLER ... Guvner', Red. Adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands it to Red. (CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 34 ADLER ... Here it is. SALLY (introducing) Uh, I'm Sally Gerber. Criminologist with the State Prison System. Sally offers her hand. Red, perusing the telex, ignores but Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed to like her or not. ADLER Tom Adler.   Deputy. State Police... System. 
SALLY It's a relatively new procedure but I was assigned by Governor Connally... RED (reading from telex) ... 'to work with State law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the State Police.' It don't say nuthin' about... SALLY ... It includes parole and work release programs as well as penal escape situations. The office PHONE BUZZES.    Adler picks it up. ADLER (into phone) On our way, Marge. 
Adler hangs up the phone. ADLER Gettin' antsy, Red. You scheduled it. Adler hangs up, grabs Red's tie and coat from a brass rung on the wall and hands them over. Red puts down the telex, stares at Sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable. SALLY The idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations could, conversely, identify those self-same traps as an aide to apprehension. (CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED:   (4)                                              34 Adler stares at Sally then turns to Red with a "never heard the like" look of amazement on his face. Red, roguishly handsome in his tan, western cut blazer, clip on tie and ten gallon hat, makes his way to the door. But, before he exits... RED In the first place, Miss Gerber. SALLY Sally, please. RED In the first place, Sally, it ain't a 'penal escape situation.' It's a manhunt. Fancy words in a circle don't help much. SALLY And what does? RED A nose like a Blue Tick, a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee. And with that he's out the door. 35   INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY                                         35 A throng of photogs and news writers stuff the undersized room. The clamor settles when Red enters and steps behind the lectern. RED Listen up, I'll only say it once. At approximately ten o'clock last night two inmates over to Huntsville, Robert 'Butch' Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through an air shaft, grabbed a prison employee's car and got out through the main gate. At approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed the store's owner. REPORTER #1 Is the prison employee with them? RED Was when they left the prison. Sally and Adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern observing. Red notices them. (CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:                                                     35 REPORTER #2 What's the rap sheet on these guys like? RED Long as Christmas eve to a kid. Haynes was doin' 40 for armed robbery and Pugh was ridin' 20 hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios. REPORTER #3 Is there any indication of... RED ... Lemme' finish, Billy. This mornin' another hostage was taken... from a private home in Madisonville. A boy, age 8. Grabbed him out of bed. REPORTER #1 Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh? RED Yer' askin' if they're preverts.   Well, one is. REPORTER #4 You got inter-agency cooperation on this? RED Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the D.P.S. share responsibility with the F.B.I. due to the kid being taken. But I doubt they're out of bed yet. A few chuckles. 
REPORTER #3 Red, how do you plan to apprehend the escapees? RED Officially I can only say we have a full manhunt team on their trail and we'll proceed with due haste. REPORTER #3 And unofficially? Red hesitates a moment, something's bothering him, then blurts out... RED Unoffically? I'm gonna' hunt 'em like the rabid dogs they are. (CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                35 Every hand in the place shoots up and Ad Lib questions fly like bullets. RED That's all I've got but I'd like to introduce ya' to Miss Sally Gerber. She's straight from the Governor's office. Knows all about psychological profiles and the like. You probably have some questions for her. Red steps back and to one side. Sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but.... 
40   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                40 Adler moves through the door to the RV carrying Red's favorite desk chair. He's followed by BOBBY LEE, 20's, cocksure, wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots. ADLER (to Saunders) S'cuse me. (to Red) This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist with the Feds. They want him to tag along. Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods.   Bobby Lee steps into the Airstream. SAUNDERS Please, Red, ya' gotta' believe me... Red spots Suttle, 35, bright-eyed, with a cowlick, sitting at the wheel of the Chevy truck. RED Who are you? SUTTLE Dick Suttle, the driver. RED Not anymore.   Bradley. BRADLEY, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in. Suttle shrugs and steps out. Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red. SAUNDERS This man stays with the vehicle wherever it goes, Red! RED (to Suttle) You know how to operate the gadgets? SUTTLE Yessir. RED (to Suttle) Grab a seat. Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck. Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red. Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea. (CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:   (3)                                               40 SAUNDERS Please Red, I'm beggin'. I mean, what am I suppose to tell the Governor? Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word... RED Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it. Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window. SAUNDERS Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle? Not a scratch! Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally.   She's pissed and overloaded with files. AIRSTREAM about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop.    A second later the door opens and the steps pop out. Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door... ... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream.   The Airstream moves another 20 feet then stops. Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. Again, when she gets close... 
...the Airstream moves. Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box in anger. The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a   few AD LIBS, i.e. -- "Okay, Okay." More LAUGHTER. Red steps    out the door, turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and  comments stop on a dime. Smiling slightly he turns to Sally,   moves straight for the file box, picks it up and walks back to  the Airstream. When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to  Sally, who stews and holds her ground. RED You comin' or not? She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red, grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him. 
41   OMITTED                                                          41 42   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             42 Sally enters, balancing the   boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her. A smiling    Red, a grinning Adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll,   a nervous KAISER, the radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty   smirk from Bobby Lee. When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye. SALLY I've got it. She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her.     She looks up to the men staring at... Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh. She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin. SALLY You've got shit on your face. Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face. 43   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                            43 The IMPALA BLASTS along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light township. It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth. 44   INT./EXT. IMPALA - DAY                                           44 JERRY Why the hell we stoppin'? BUTCH You said you had a cousin near here. JERRY So? BUTCH So give him a call. See if we can shack there til' things cool down. Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe, grabs the keys from the ignition. Then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth. (CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:                                                   44 In the b.g. we see Jerry strut to the phone booth and pore through a thin directory. Phillip steals a glance at Butch, who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth. PHILLIP Why'd he take the keys? BUTCH So I won't leave him. PHILLIP (a tad hopeful) Would you leave him? BUTCH Oh yeah. In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off. JERRY Musta' moved. Prolly' couldn't have heard 'em anyway. Goddam ear's still bleedin'. You ever try that shit again... BUTCH What? JERRY What? BUTCH You were in the middle of threatenin' me. JERRY (from the movies) Ain't a threat. It's a fact. Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the steering wheel. BUTCH Here kid, take the wheel. Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch turns back over the seat to confront Jerry. BUTCH In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose. That's a threat... (CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             44 Before Jerry has time to snicker Butch hits him full in the face and grabs the gun. Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound. Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip. BUTCH ... And that's a fact. Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred. JERRY I'm gonna' kill you for that. 
BUTCH And that's a threat. Beginnin' to understand the difference? Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and turns into... 45   EXT. RURAL STORE - DAY                                       45 The Impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store, which is bordered by a giant hay field. 46   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                      46 BUTCH Okay, Phillip, listen up. I'm gonna' run in here and get some smokes. JERRY Get beer. 
Butch hands Phillip the revolver. BUTCH Here, hold it like this.... And point it right between his eyes. JERRY What the hell?... BUTCH (to Phillip) If he so much as moves you pull the trigger ... right here... Put your finger on it. Jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally. Butch reaches over and cocks the pistol. Jerry's guffaws stop on a dime. JERRY Yer' a fuckin' crazy man. (CONTINUED) 
BUTCH Hey, Phillip, check for a radio, too. 70   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            70 Phillip, still in his skivvies, legs cut up and muddied from his escape from Jerry, sneaks up to the car and quietly peers into the open window. The keys dangle when his small hand touches them. Phillip closes the door, looks around and then runs pell-mell to the passenger window of the Impala. PHILLIP It's got keys and a radio.   I checked. BUTCH Good man. 
Phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet. PHILLIP Can we stop at a fillin' station. BUTCH What for? PHILLIP Number one. BUTCH This here's nature, Phillip.   Pee in the ditch. Phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while Butch steps out of the Impala, tosses the keys into the field and walks toward the Ford. (CONTINUED) 
70   CONTINUED:                                                    70 The FARMER stops his tractor and notices Butch and Phillip. Phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having trouble coaxing relief. Butch slides into the Ford, pumps the gas pedal and turns the key. The ENGINE GRUMBLES and DIES. The Farmer is walking now, slowly and then at a trot as he realizes what's happening. Phillip finally starts to pee. Butch cranks again and again but the Ford is flooded. 
BUTCH Start, you sonofabitch! The Farmer runs faster, comes closer... FARMER Hey, that's my car! Hey!!! Butch floors the gas to clear the flood and the ENGINE finally STARTS. He throws it into reverse and peels out backwards into the road beside the ditch where Phillip continues to relieve himself. BUTCH Get in the car, Phillip! The Farmer, only 30 yards or so away, is racing toward them madder than a wet hen. Phillip tries to hurry but the RC continues to run through him. 
BUTCH Phillip!   Get in the car! Phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car. He leaps into the open passenger door at the same moment Butch steps on the gas and the Farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it closes. 71   INT. FORD - DAY                                               71 The CAR is SCREECHING down the road but the Farmer holds on for dear life and auto. He claws at Phillip, who does his best to fend off flailing hands and fingers. Butch reaches under the seat for and grasps the pistol. Phillip sees what's about to happen and bites the Farmer's hand as hard as he can. (CONTINUED) 
71   CONTINUED:                                                     71 FARMER Aaaaaayyyyyy!!!! The Farmer releases his grip on the door and falls backward, summersaulting into the adjacent ditch. Butch places the gun back under the seat. BUTCH Goddam, boy, how many RC's did you drink anyway? PHILLIP Four. 
Butch shakes his head and laughs. BUTCH One thing's for sure. You got one helluva set of chompers. 72   INT. TRUCK - DAY                                               72 Sitting still. Bradley tries to light a cigarette with the lighter but gets no heat. BRADLEY (to Suttle) Lighter don't work. Put that on the list. INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY Bobby Lee sits alone in the back corner of the main room of the RV. He just sits and stares, occasionally smiling cynically at Sally. 
Adler takes the latest info off the radio while the others listen in. ADLER (into radio) Highway 16 north. Four miles south of Desdemona. Got it. (to Red) Stole a vehicle. Kaiser radios up front, the ENGINE STARTS and the Airstream moves. RED (to Adler) What kinda' shape's it in? (CONTINUED) 
BUTCH See there! All you gotta' do is say your name and people are waiting on you hand and foot. Like a goddam king or somethin'. Phillip can't help but smile at the notion. 75   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                               75 Bradley and Suttle lean against the parked RV, chatting. BRADLEY You responsible for engine maintenance on this thing? SUTTLE Uh, yeah.     I'm the full time driver. (CONTINUED) 
75    CONTINUED:                                                     75 Bradley shakes his head.   "Too bad". SUTTLE What?   Why? BRADLEY You notice how it keeps    wanting to slip a bit goin' into second.     Feels to me like somebody's been a little    heavy-footed with the clutch. (beat) I'd take care of that if   I was you. PAN TO: an ambulance door opens and the Farmer, strapped in, is rolled toward it as his wife, sobbing, attends to him. 
Several local police scour the surrounding field, walking four feet apart, looking for what they hope they won't find. Red leans on the trunk of the Impala, chews and spits on the ground. He sniffs the air. Unsavory. Adler strides up from the field. ADLER No bodies this time, thank Gawd. RED You got the keys to this thing? ADLER Uh... naw... RED Get me a crowbar. (to Sally) You might wanna' wait in the boat. 
SALLY No thank you. 76A   INT. TRUNK - DAY                                               76A But it's black as night. A   CROWBAR CRANKS at the lock until the trunk blasts open like a  bottletop. A blast of light gives way to the silhouetted  faces of Red, Adler and Sally, who turns and walks away in  nauseous disgust. RED Well.... THEIR POV - OPEN TRUNK In it lies the crumpled, bent, bloody remains of Larry, the prison employee, the original hostage. RED ... there's our bureaucrat. 
76B   RED                                                            76B spits a chaw, turns and walks to the RV.    Near the entrance Sally is heaving. RED (to no one in particular) It's sure nice to know the boy's in good hands. Sally straightens herself, ready to bite back, but Red's face is soft. He offers a handkerchief. She takes it. RED Gallows humor, Sally.    Without it we'd all be heavin'. 
77    EXT. SMALL TOWN (NOODLE, TEXAS) - DAY                          77 The Ford slides down the Main Street and into a side alley next to a Department Store. 78    INT. FORD - DAY                                                78 BUTCH You ready to get out of those skivvies and into some britches? Phillip nods. BUTCH Well all right then. But first we gotta' come up with some A.K.A.'s, fake identities, ya' know. Names to call each other when we're around other folks. (beat) Go ahead and think one up. Whatever name you want. 
Phillip is amused by the sport of it all. PHILLIP Any name I want? 79    EXT. STORE FRONT - ESTABLISHING - DAY                          79 A small time Dry Goods store with a sign over the entrance proclaiming: "FRIENDLY'S - The Friendliest Store in Texas!" 80    INT. FRIENDLY'S - DAY                                          80 A small, well-organized country dry goods store with a dozen or so aisles carrying everything from DDT to used boots. (CONTINUED) 
80   CONTINUED:                                                       80 A long counter at the front of the store is backed by a small office with a large glass window that gives the Manager, MR. WILLITS, 45, bespectacled, anal-retentive, a clear view of the store. A nuclear family with two kids exits the store just as Butch and Phillip enter. Butch holds the door open and smiles at them. They say "thanks" but can't help but notice Phillip, cowering behind Butch, still clad in his underwear. He hides behind a nearby display which reads: Cast Your Vote For Friendly's Friendliest Clerk! A clerk, LUCY, 30, holding a handful of shoeboxes notices their entrance. She's schoolmarmish with a smile that looks like it's painted on. LUCY Well, hello there and welcome to Friendly's. Looks like the little fella' needs some pants. BUTCH As a matter of fact. Shoes and new skivvies, too. He'll tell you his size. Go with the lady, Buzz. Phillip, still in somewhat of a daze, doesn't recognize his own "name". BUTCH Buzz! Phillip snaps to, cracks a smile at Butch and follows the lady to the children's section of the store. LUCY Buzz, what a cute name.   Like a bee. BUTCH 
102   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                            102 The four Highway Patrol VEHICLES from before BLAST past at 90+, sending stray dogs and roadrunners scurrying for cover. CRANE    DOWN to reveal the Ford off the same roadside, but behind    a burm in a field. As soon as the patrol cars pass, Butch    STARTS up the ENGINE and humps it to the road and off in the    opposite direction. 103   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             103 Sally, deep in her files.      She looks up from the file to... ANOTHER ANGLE Bobby Lee who sits by himself, whittling away at a stick and leering at her. Adler is at the map, holding the shortwave mike and wearing the earphones. Behind him, Red stares out the window. ADLER Haynes bought tape, rope, and some clothes for the boy. Red comes to and turns to Adler. Sally smiles almost to her- self. She was right -- Haynes is looking after the boy. Everyone knows it, but no one says anything. ADLER One puzzler though. They say the boy could have gotten away but didn't. SALLY Probably scared to death. ADLER That's not all. The kid stole a Halloween outfit. 
RED Holy Jeezus, they're a team. ADLER With the pit stop in Noodle looks like he's headed for the Panhandle. Red sighs and groans. Unpleasant news but somehow he knew it. He moves to the back room for another shot of Geritol. SALLY (to Red) What? ADLER There's more roads than people in the Panhandle. (CONTINUED) 
103   CONTINUED:                                                     103 SALLY How's that happen? KAISER (over his shoulder) Poor counties. They tend to half finish roads then start on another one. ADLER But if anybody knows them backroads it's Red. Sally lifts her head, watches Red reenter the room, then stares out the window. 
SALLY Okay, so... I'm Robert Haynes. Called Butch by everyone. I was born in Amarillo, but grew up in the French Quarter of New Orleans. ADLER (sotto voce) What's she doin', Red? SALLY I killed a man when I was eight. Silence. Nobody seems willing to play along.    Red turns from the window to Sally. RED How'd ya' kill him? SALLY Shot him with a pistol. There was always one around the dance hall. That's what they called it but it was a whorehouse. We lived there. Red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front of the Airstream, staring out the front window. ADLER What'd the authorities do? SALLY The victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet Cajun-style. ADLER They didn't even stick him in juvy? (CONTINUED) 
103   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 103 SALLY Put me in school.     Three years behind but I catch up. KAISER Sounds like things are goin' okay' now? SALLY They were.     For awhile.   When I'm twelve mom dies. ADLER What happened? SALLY Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself in the bathroom of the brothel. Could have saved herself the trouble. Post-mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis. KAISER Where's yer' father? Red's face tells us he's listening. SALLY Nobody knows where he is now. Ditched when I was six. He was a small-time felon. Popped up again after Mom died -- he'd just been paroled. Moved us back to Amarillo. A year later I'm in trouble again. ADLER Yeah?     Kill somebody else? SALLY Took a joyride in a Ford coupe that I just couldn't resist. KAISER Hell, that's no big deal. SALLY Judge gave me four years in Gatesville, toughest juvy farm in Texas. ADLER That's where the son-of-a-bitch learned to be a criminal. Seen that before, ain't we, Red? Red doesn't answer.     He seems in a faraway place. (CONTINUED) 
103   CONTINUED:   (3)                                              103 BOBBY LEE (smart ass) So, Butch, why don't you tell us where yer' goin', save us the trouble o' huntin' you down? SALLY Where I'm going isn't as important as 'Why am I going there?' BOBBY LEE (tired of the game) Shit. 'Caus' I'm runnin' and they're chasin' and I'd jus' as soon go north as south as east as west. It's a fun lil' parlor game, lady, but right now Butch Haynes don't have the slightest idea where he's headed! 104A INT. FORD - DAY                                                104A Phillip, now fully-attired in his Casper outfit and mask, is looking at a folded map while Butch drives. BUTCH An inch is 24 miles. Hold yer' pointin' finger along the line of the road. You got three lines on your finger, don'tcha'? Each one's an inch. So how many inches to Childress? Phillip holds one finger to the map, then another. PHILLIP One, two... six. BUTCH Yer' a helluva' navigator, Phillip. A lot smarter than Jerry. But I guess that's not sayin' a lot. Something catches Phillip's eye. PHILLIP Lookie there! 104B HIS POV - TRUCK AND AIRSTREAM                                  104B coming TOWARD them on the highway. 105   INT.

Bradley, caught, just smiles.

Butch HONKS the HORN TWICE and waits for a retort. 107   INT. TRUCK - DAY                                                  107 Bradley smiles, looks to Suttle, who nods an "okay."    Johnson sits on the HORN for TWO solid BLASTS. 108   INT. FORD - DAY                                                   108 Phillip laughs and waves.

HER POV Butch is hard to make out, but there's no mistaking the Casper outfit Phillip wears with pride. BACK TO SCENE SALLY You said the boy stole a Halloween costume... What character? ADLER I believe it was Casper... Casper the friendly ghost. SALLY That was them.   They just passed us. RED Turn this thing around! Adler jumps on the radio to the truck. ADLER (into mike) Turn it around! That was them! 110   EXT. ROAD - SAME TIME                                             110 The Airstream slows to a grind, pulls off the narrow shoulder and begins to make a wide U-turn. (CONTINUED)

AIRSTREAM - DAY                                            111Q Adler, still wearing the headphones, rises first and goes to the radio to answer an incoming call. Red groans. Sally crawls to her feet and offers Red a helping hand, which he accepts. ADLER Uh... Red? 
RED What? ADLER They wanna know if the boy looked okay? SALLY He was laughing and waving. RED Don't tell 'em that. 112   INT. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE (AUSTIN, TEXAS) - DAY             112 A large group of very serious advisors sit and stand in a circle around the Governor's desk. Across from GOVERNOR CONNALLY sits a nervous, near tears GLADYS PERRY. An AIDE on the telephone, turns to the Governor. AIDE They say the boy looked A-okay. Governor Connally nods, sighs, and reaches hand across the desk and touches Gladys's shoulder. GOVERNOR He'll be fine, Mrs. Perry. This whole nightmare will be over and done with very soon and you'll be home with your boy. I promise. Gladys, distraught, nods. Governor Connally discreetly nods to a photographer in the group while keeping his hand on Gladys's shoulder. A CAMERA'S FLASH causes everyone to blink in reaction. The Governor shakes it off and continues... (CONTINUED)

It's an amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment. Another FLASH. 113 OMITTED                                                           113 thru                                                                  thru 115A EXT. FIELD - DAY                                                 115A 
The Airstream, the amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment sits beat to hell and leaning to one side in the dry pond bed. All the tires are flat and dents and bruises abound. The door tries to open but is stuck. Red applies a boot to it and the whole thing comes off its hinges and flies to the ground. Red exits. He groans and shakes his head when he spots... Bradley and Suttle limping toward him across the field. Red sighs and starts slowly walking in the direction Butch and Phillip headed. 115B INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             115B Sally, her hair a bird's nest, does her best to collect her files before she sits down, takes a deep breath and glances out the window at Red in the distance. 115C EXT.

Standing in the middle of the field, staring at the horizon. He sticks a chaw in his mouth without diverting or blinking his eyes. 116   EXT. ROAD - CLOSEUP - BUTCH - DAY                               116 Staring at the horizon. ANOTHER ANGLE Butch sits on the hood of the Ford, which is stopped on an asphalt road which, a few feet farther, turns into dirt and a few feet farther a dirt clod field. (CONTINUED) 
116   CONTINUED:                                                      116 BUTCH Started this road 20 years ago and it still ain't finished. (beat) Appears to me we got a decision to make. Phillip, aka Casper, exits the car and, imitating Butch, leans against the car. BUTCH It's up to you, Phillip. We can backtrack to the highway or we can try it on foot. PHILLIP Where we goin'? 
Butch reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a folded postcard. He hands it over to Phillip. INSERT - CARD It's at least 20 years old, crumpled. It unfolds to reveal a beautiful green valley with a snow capped mountain behind it. BACK TO SCENE BUTCH It's Alaska, Phillip. Last of the wild frontier. PHILLIP It's pretty. BUTCH It's beautiful! 
PHILLIP You been there? BUTCH Naw. Just got the one postcard. But anyhoo, back to our present dilemma. You feel like a hike? PHILLIP How far? BUTCH Can't be more'n, oh, say, fifteen hundred miles. Phillip seems a tad apprehensive about the prospect. (CONTINUED) 
The Airstream is fast becoming a pig sty. Coke bottles, coffee spills, overfull ashtrays, etc. are everywhere. Adler holds the mike and stares at the thumbtacked map. ADLER (into mike) Spur 208 northbound. And 83 at Aspermont coming and going. (to Red) That it? RED Yeah. Adler moves to set down the mike and topples a cup of coffee. It spills on the floor. Suttle grabs a towel to wipe it up but realizing the futility of keeping the Airstream clean, he simply throws it aside. 
127   INT. FORD - LATER - DAY                                        127 Butch drives while Phillip digs through the sack and comes up with a jar of mustard. BUTCH You sure there's no meat in there? Spam maybe, Vienna sausages, anything like that? PHILLIP Nawsir. BUTCH Well, I bet you can make us some mustard sandwiches, can't ya'? PHILLIP Yeahsir. BUTCH Well go to it. Phillip breaks out the loaf of bread and lays out four slices on the dashboard. PHILLIP How many? BUTCH Many as you want. Phillip   lays out six more slices. The dashboard is now covered   with bread. Phillip pulls out the mustard but has no knife.    Butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to Phillip   to spread with. As they drive  along they pass a large, happy family (Mom, Dad, girl 5, boy 7)  picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside the highway.   From the look of their brand-new loaded down station wagon  they are on vacation. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Mesmerized by the family. CLOSEUP - BUTCH Ditto.    He pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something. 128   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                128 Butch brings the car to a stop near the crest of the hill, sets the emergency brake, grabs the first completed mustard sandwich and gets out, leaving the Impala running. (CONTINUED)

Phillip nods and continues piling the yellow goop on each of the slices of bread. BUTCH walks ahead to the crest of the hill, the tallest hill in the county. He takes in the 360 degree view. His eyes settle on... LINE OF CARS 
IDLING as they wait their turn to pass a roadblock at the bottom of the hill. PHILLIP spreading even more mustard. Every so often he sneaks a peek back at the picnicing family. EMERGENCY BRAKE slips a little, then gives all at once. FORD starts to roll backwards. PHILLIP Whooaaa!   Butch!    Butch!!! BUTCH 
turns and sees the Ford rolling backwards, picking up steam back down the hill. BUTCH Step on the brake! Put your foot on the brake! The middle one!! PHILLIP panicked, slides over and grabs the wheel. Of course, he is too short to press on the brake and when he bends down... FORD swerves off the road and onto the shoulder. (CONTINUED) 
128   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                128 FAMILY headed by BOB, 35, their Ward Cleaverish father, looks up to see... FORD barrelling backwards toward them, swerving to and fro and followed by Butch shouting instructions. BOB (O.S.) Everybody, run!    Quick! BOB 
makes a beeline for the station wagon. BOB'S WIFE Forget the car, Bob! BOB Are you crazy.    It's only got a 1000 miles on it! He jumps in the Driver's seat of the WAGON and frantically REVS it just as... PHILLIP gains control of the wheel and steers the rapidly reversing Ford around the Wagon. FORD continues backwards to the bottom of the hill, but it has enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline of the previous hill. BUTCH comes to a heaving halt next to Bob, who is near heart attack himself. BUTCH Bad brakes. BOB That was close. Bob gets out of the station wagon and stands next to Butch. They watch for the Ford for a second, see that it's losing momentum and smile at each other. (CONTINUED) 
128   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                  128 BOB Bob Fielder. BUTCH Edgar Poe. PHILLIP breathes a sigh of relief as the Ford loses momentum and comes to a stop. But then, of course, ... FORD like any car on a roller coaster, starts to move downhill, slowly at first, but then picking up speed. 
137   CONTINUED:                                                     137 BOB'S WIFE (to herself) Damn that kid! The little girl is crying harder than ever now. Bob reaches back over the seat and tries to touch his daughter. BOB It's okay, sweetie. Daddy's not mad. BOB'S WIFE So much for the new car smell. The little girl muffles her tears. 
Butch smiles sincerely then looks to the passing landscape. BUTCH This will do fine right here, Bob.   But I do have one more favor to ask. 138   EXT. ROAD - DAY (FIVE MINUTES LATER)                           138 The entire Family Bob is standing along the roadside, their luggage and belongings by their side. The looks on their faces say it all -- Stranded. Butch hands over the stuffed animal to Patsy, pats Bob Jr. on the head and sticks out his hand to Bob. BUTCH Just a loaner, Bob. Not to worry.    You'll get her back. Bob reluctantly shakes Butch's hand in an attempt to impress upon Butch his most important concern of all... 
BOB Please, it's new. Hold it under 45... at least for the next 500 miles. BUTCH You know I will, Bob. Butch gives a snappy salute and is off to the wagon. 139   INT. STATION WAGON - DAY                                       139 Butch STARTS the CAR and he and Phillip slowly pull away. BUTCH Wave, Phillip. Phillip does so.   Bob's kids wave back.   Phillip starts to giggle. (CONTINUED) 
139   CONTINUED:                                                     139 PHILLIP They look funny. BUTCH Maybe, but Bob did the right thing. What if he'd put up a fight? I mighta' had to shoot him, and where would that family be then? Naw, Bob's a fine family man and that's about the best thing a fella' can hope to be. Butch floors the wagon and the CAR SCREECHES rubber on the highway. BOB 
cringes as he watches his pride and joy rocket toward the horizon. 140   EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY (LATER)                                   140 The Highway Patrol continues to monitor cars one by one. One of the Officers sees something and nudges his partner to look at... FAMILY BOB cresting the hill carrying their hats in their hands along with their luggage and coolers. 141   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                           141 Adler drops his headphones and turns to Red. ADLER He got through!    At Aspermont. 
BRADLEY What? ADLER Coerced a motorist. Red sighs. RED Well goddam, shout at Amarillo. Tell 'em we got a notion he's headed their way. Adler gets right to it. (CONTINUED) 
141   CONTINUED:                                                       141 RED (almost to himself) Truth is I wish he'd cross the border so we could turn this over to the feds. Nobody in the room expected to hear this. RED I got work to do back home. Red rises and stretches, walks to the open door and stares out at the late afternoon light. RED I'm hungry.   This thing got any food? 
SUTTLE Well, uh... Adler jumps up and goes to the frig. ADLER Got T-bones in the frig, Red! SUTTLE Uh, uh, those were stocked for the Governor. I don't think that he would approve of... Adler finds a plastic bag in the freezer and inspects it. ADLER -- And look, Red!     Tater Tots!   Those kind you like! Red turns and looks. 
A SIRLOIN STEAK hits a grill beside a Tater Tot shiskabob and SIZZLES to beat the band. A homemade barbecue pit, built from nearby abundant rocks, sits square in the middle of the highway with red flares set up just in case a car did come by. Red smiles and shakes a liberal dose of Lea and Perrins onto the flesh. He's obviously a veteran of many back yard B-BQs and this is definitely one. We see Sally THROUGH the window. She's inside, still going over her files. She gets up and walks into the back room to look for something. (CONTINUED) 
146   CONTINUED:                                                      146 BOBBY LEE sitting outside, rises and slides into the Airstream while BACK TO SCENE Red continues to cook with Adler and Bradley looking on. 147   INT. AIRSTREAM - BACKROOM - DUSK                                147 Sally turns on a nightlight and looks at herself in the mirror. She splashes a little water on her face and is startled when ... Bobby Lee slides in behind her. 
BOBBY LEE Think yer' pretty smart now don'tcha'? She doesn't back down, instead looking him straight in the eye. SALLY Excuse me? BOBBY LEE Well yer' not smart but you are pretty. Sally stares right at Bobby Lee then moves for the door.    He shifts his position and blocks her. SALLY Excuse me. Bobby Lee smiles a crooked-tooth grin, refusing to move. BOBBY LEE Work and pleasure should naturally go together don't you think? Take me, I enjoy my work. SALLY I could give a shit. BOBBY LEE You got a mouth, don't ya? RED (O.S.) How you take your steak, Sally? Bobby Lee and Sally both look up to see Red standing in the doorway. (CONTINUED) 
147   CONTINUED:                                                   147 SALLY (relieved) Uh.. rare. RED A woman after my own heart. She takes this opportunity to slide between Red and Bobby Lee on her way into the main room. As she goes... RED I'll just wipe its ass, herd it through and you can cut off a hunk. How'd that be? SALLY Maybe medium-rare. Bobby Lee and Red are left standing face to face. RED I don't give a damn who you work for. You're here for one reason and one reason only. BOBBY LEE Anything else, Chief? RED Yeah.   Yer' in my office. The hot line PHONE RINGS... Bobby Lee flinches first and moves back into the main room. Red follows. ADLER That's the Governor's line, Red! Red calmly walks past Sally who smiles a "thanks". He gives her a one finger to the hat salute, walks to the phone, reaches down and yanks out the cord. The RINGING STOPS. RED Nuthin' as impolite as callin' at the dinner hour. 148   INT. DOTTIE'S    CAFE - NIGHT                                148 Phillip, at the booth, plays with the parsley on his empty plate, which sits across from Butch's barely touched one. The boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a peek at Butch, who sits at a barstool watching Eileen work behind the counter. (CONTINUED) 
148   CONTINUED:                                                    148 AT COUNTER Butch leans over and whispers something sexy into Eileen's ear. She giggles and licks her lips. Butch feels eyes on his back and looks at Phillip, who immediately turns away from them. When Butch returns his attention to Eileen she's moved a few feet away and is refilling ketchup bottles. BUTCH Buzz, go ahead and chew on mine if you want. PHILLIP No thankyew. 
Eileen slides back down toward Butch. She makes refilling condiment bottles the sexiest pasttime since the hula hoop. EILEEN Very polite. BUTCH I try hard but, ya' know, since his mama died... PHILLIP -- My mama's not dead! Butch, a tad annoyed, turns to Phillip and gives him a look. Once again, when he turns back, Eileen has moved. She's flirting with Butch, moving, bending, wiping her hands on her hips. His eyes are focused on her every squirm. BUTCH (over his shoulder) Okay now, Buzz, you go on out in the parking lot and chunk some rocks or something. BACK TO SCENE Phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks out the door. His eyes stay on Butch and Eileen, barely concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy. EILEEN So is she dead or not? BUTCH (covering badly) Well his biological mother is alive. Gave him up for adoption to me and my wife. My dead wife, that is. She is, was Phil, er Buzz's stepmother, so she's his mom, was his mom, stepmom, but... she's dead. (CONTINUED) 
148   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                148 EILEEN I'm so sorry. But she's not.     In fact it seems to have turned her on even more. She puts her hand behind Butch's neck and slowly pulls him close for gentle kiss. 149   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                        149 Phillip tosses a rock then turns to the diner. They're gone. Phillip drops his handful of rocks and walks to the front window of the diner. 
PHILLIP'S POV - DINER It is empty. He sees that the kitchen swinging door is still swinging on its hinges. 150   INT. DINER - ADJUNCT OFFICE - NIGHT                             150 A one room addition office built onto    the kitchen. It has a desk against one wall, a few chairs, a    fan -- pretty sparse. Two large windows throw light from the    outside neon sign onto the room. A large lamp provides harsh     light. Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door behind them. At once they are all over each other. Butch lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and neck. Then, in an instant, he flips her over, pulls the ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress outfit to the waist. He kisses her neck, her back and suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins kissing her voluptuous backside. 
Butch KILLS the ENGINE but keeps the RADIO MUSIC on low. BUTCH Things go our way we'll be in Alaska in four or five days. Get the jump on winter. Phillip looks a little sad. BUTCH What's wrong? PHILLIP I wanna' go home. BUTCH If you wanted to go home so bad, why didn't you stay at that store today? (CONTINUED) 
156   CONTINUED:                                                     156 PHILLIP Caus'. BUTCH Caus' why? PHILLIP 'Caus' I stole. They'd put me in jail. Prolly' go to hell. Butch chuckles at the notion. BUTCH Same difference.    We'll get you home soon. I swear, okay? 
PHILLIP Butch? BUTCH Yeah, Phillip? PHILLIP I can drive. BUTCH Done proved that ain'tcha'? There's lots and lots of stuff you can do, Phillip. (gets an idea) Reach in that glovebox there. See if Bob's got a notepad or something. Phillip extracts a small ringed memo pad. BUTCH Good old Bob. Can you write? 
PHILLIP I can print. BUTCH Good enough. Now I want you to make a list of everything you ever wanted to do but wasn't allowed to. Okay? PHILLIP Like what? BUTCH Like... cotton candy. PHILLIP Cotton candy? (CONTINUED) 
156   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                156 BUTCH Hell I don't know. It's yer' list. Butch settles in for a catnap.      Just as his eyes close... PHILLIP Butch?... BUTCH Yeah?... 157   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                                              157 Only the dome light and the LOW MUSIC bring attention to the car sitting lonely in the middle of the massive field. 
PHILLIP (V.O.) How ya' spell 'rocketship?' 
158   INT. AIRSTREAM - NIGHT                                          158 The aftermath of a full scale Texas Bar-B-Q: plates full of gristle and bone, cigarettes burning in ashtrays and swirl- ing in half-drunk bottles of Coke and mugs of coffee, men groaning and picking their teeth with toothpicks. Bradley, Adler and Suttle are dead-ass asleep and snoring. Bobby Lee, too mean to sleep, sits by himself cleaning his fingernails with a pocket knife. 
159   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                                              159 Red leans against the Airstream and sips coffee from his thermos. Sally walks up, sipping from a mug, and leans against the bumper. Red doesn't even turn. RED Figger to give 'em another hour of shuteye, then grab the patrol cars and head for the Panhandle. SALLY Bring back any memories? RED Too many. Red turns to her.    They both know he's divulged something. RED They got a file on me, too? (CONTINUED)

LOTTIE You wanna plate? MACK Not jus' yet. (to Cleve) Boy, go get my thermos from the truck. Cleve, still whispering and giggling with Phillip, isn't really listening. MACK Don't ya hear good, boy?! Mack firmly cuffs the boy's ear and Cleve jumps up and out the door, one hand holding the side of his head. Butch and Phillip both look up at Mack. MACK Boy don't got the sense Gawd gave a chicken. 175   INT. LEAD PATROL CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY                           175 JONES Want me to stay on Highway 70?

MACK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                          176 Phillip sits on   the couch and watches as Butch shows Cleve a trick. Cleve    bends over, puts his hands between his legs and Butch grabs   them and pulls -- a flip. Cleve is ecstatic at the   result. Phillip and Butch laugh along. CLEVE Agin'!   Do it agin'!

Butch spots an old phonograph. BUTCH Say, lookie here. He gives it a spin with his finger and searches through a stack of 78s. 
LOTTIE Mr. Andrews give 'em to us when he got hisself a newfangled one. Butch finds a particular favorite. BUTCH Jeezus. Now this is music. You know how long it's been since I heard this. LOTTIE That's an oldie all right. Mrs. Andrews' maiden name was Bougeois -- half-Creole herself she is, but Mr. Andrews he don't like nobody to know. 'Suppose that's why he give 'em to us. 177   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                          177 Mack drops his pants and sits on the throne. He reaches over and turns ON the RADIO resting on the wash basin. A FARM REPORT comes on just as... 178   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       178 A NEEDLE DROPS on a 78, filling the room with the SCRATCHY sounds of a Coonass waltz. Butch's eyes come to life. BUTCH You dance, Lottie? LOTTIE Lawd goodness no. (CONTINUED) 
178   CONTINUED:                                                       178 BUTCH Here, jus' follow me. He takes her in his arms and slowly but surely adjusts her movement to his. After a few rough turns they're not too bad. Phillip can't help but smile as he and Cleve watch and giggle. Butch and Lottie dance, swirling around the room. LOTTIE Mr. Poe, you sure can move. 
BUTCH Oughta be able to. Was raised in a dime a dance whorehouse. LOTTIE Yer' foolin' me? BUTCH No, ma'am. My mama would dance their asses out of the fryin' pan and into the back room fire. Butch spots Phillip and Cleve, watching, giggling. BUTCH Get on yer' feet, Buzz.     You'n Cleve shake a leg. LOTTIE (encouraging) Well go on! 
Cleve and Phillip reluctantly stand and stare at one another. BUTCH Dance, boys! The little boys do their best to emulate the adults and soon they're laughing and dancing, too. The RECORD STOPS. They all clap and laugh.         Butch hears something... The RADIO in the bathroom. 179   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                              179 Mack sits, cleaning his fingernails with a Barlow knife as the radio announcer begins a news flash. (CONTINUED)

He is believed to have a hostage with him, an eight-year-old boy. A finger turns OFF the RADIO. We FOLLOW the finger UP an arm TO Butch's concerned face. He sits down on the edge of the tub across from Mack and takes the knife away from him. BUTCH We'll be leavin' soon enough. I'll kill all of you if you try anything stupid. Mack swallows hard. 
180   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                        180 Lottie quizzes Phillip... LOTTIE What's Texarkana like? I ain't never been there. PHILLIP (through his teeth) Oh, it's real nice. I got a dog named... Phillip and a tree house and... Mack, nervous, enters the room followed by Butch. BUTCH Come on, Buzz.   Time for us to hit the road. LOTTIE Whass' wrong, Mack? You look like you seen a ghost. Cleve runs up to Butch, turns around backwards and puts his hands between his legs. CLEVE Do me agin'! MACK (scared for the boy) No!   Boy! Get over by yer' Mammaw! Lottie senses something is wrong.   Cleve, too young to smell trouble, persists... CLEVE Come on, Mister, do me agin'! (CONTINUED)

Butch finishes tying, sticks the knife in his pocket and walks over to the PHONOGRAPH. He turns it back ON. The SCRATCHY RECORD plays. He turns UP the VOLUME. BUTCH (to Phillip) You can go wait in the car or you can watch. Yer' old enough to think for yer'self. Phillip, unsure what to do, stands his ground. 
Butch returns to his seat   on the coffee table and stares at the three hostages. He    appears as if he's about to cry, closes his eyes and rests   his chin on the barrel of the revolver while he recites   instructions... BUTCH Shut yer' eyes, Cleve. Mack, you and Lottie hold the boy tight. Shut yer' eyes, too. Phillip, awkwardly aware that he's going to witness an execution, starts to cry out, then squelches himself. Butch seems to be in another world now -- taken to another place and time. A slight smile finds its way to his face, then disappears. LOTTIE Please, mistah', ain't no use in it. MACK We'll give you ever'thing we got! But Butch doesn't even hear the words. He slowly opens his eyes, pulls his chin from the pistol barrel and points it at Mack. LOTTIE Our Father, which are in heaven, Hallo be thy name... BUTCH (to Lottie) Shhh... shhh... shhh... LOTTIE ... Thy Kingdom come, Lawd, thy will be done... here on Earth as it is in Heaven.

Butch looks to Phillip in a strange way, sets the gun on the floor between them, and crawls amongst the candy, gum and wrappers until he finds the electrician's tape. Phillip watches, not knowing what to do. The revolver -- cocked, resting on the floor. 
MACK, CLEVE & LOTTIE Giv' us this day our daily bread and forgiv' us, Lawd, our trespasses as we forgiv' those who tresspass agin' us... Butch rips tape from the roll and slaps a piece over each of their mouths, silencing their prayers one by one. Out of breath, he kneels down in front of them and stares at the three while he reaches his hand behind him for the .... pistol -- but it's not there... Butch looks up to see... Phillip -- teeth gritted, holding the pistol, pointing it directly at Butch. CLOSEUP - BUTCH His expression is blank -- then a slight smile. For a second it's as if none of this has happened, that Butch will grasp Phillip in his arms... A DEAFENING GUNBLAST turns his expression to blank. Phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver's kick, recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf. The MAMBO RECORD comes to an END, but SCRATCHES ON AD INFINITUM. Butch falls back to his knees, still staring at Phillip. He looks at his stomach, where a stain of brown-red gushes through his T-shirt, and back to the boy. BUTCH (as if he hasn't seen him in years) Phillip?.... (CONTINUED)

Then, in a flash, he runs, pell-mell, out of the house. 185   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             185 Phillip blasts out the screen door and runs straight to the well. He drops the gun into the well, catches his breath and heads for the road. After a few yards he has a thought, runs back to the station wagon, grabs the keys and throws them as far into the adjacent field as he can. Then he resumes his race for the road. 186   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                             186 Butch gropes to his feet, still in shock. He stumbles toward the door, then stops, reaches in his pocket, extracts Mack's Barlow knife, holds it up and walks toward them, staring hard. Mack, Cleve, Lottie -- Afraid they'll be killed after all. Butch, surprisingly, meekly sets the knife down on the coffee table... BUTCH Thanks for yer' hospitality. And walks away. 187   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             187 
Butch emerges and stumbles out. BUTCH (to the horizon) Phillip?!... No answer. He drags himself to the station wagon and, with much effort, slides himself into the seat. No keys. He opens the door, crawls out, leaving a trail of blood, looks out to the road and starts to walk. PHILLIP runs down the road, looking back every so often to see if Butch is following (CONTINUED)

I won't hurt ya', I swear! PHILLIP is running out of steam on the road ahead.   He stops for a blow and looks back. HIS POV 
A few hundred yards back, Butch struggles forward. BACK TO SCENE Phillip crawls through the ditch beside the road and squeezes through a barb wire fence. His costume hangs on a barb. He rips away from the fence leaving a foot-long strand behind. In the b.g. -- a pickup truck drives by. 188   INT.

As opposed to someone I don't know, I mean. All things considered, I feel pretty good, though. Could use a beer, though. PHILLIP What's beer taste like? BUTCH Oh, it's about the best thing there is.

BUTCH (yelling back) All this for me. I'm touched, but I'm afraid ya'll gonna' have to back it up a step or two. I'm headed to Mexico. (to Phillip) Lyin' to 'em, of course. 201   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                        201 
Red leans against a patrol car, accompanied closely by Adler, Sally and Hendricks. RED (into megaphone) Hate    to tell ya', Butch, but yer' headed the    wrong direction. Tell ya' what. You    let the boy go and we'll talk about it.     Discuss it over a cold beer. 202   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                       202 BUTCH (to Phillip) Beer. What'd I tell ya'. (to Red) Appreciate the offer, Cap'n, but ya' know I can't do that. If you and yer' pals back outta' here, I'll drop the boy at the border. (beat) If you don't I'll shoot him in the head. I mean it! Phillip, betrayed beyond comprehension, stares at Butch. BUTCH (to Phillip) Don't look at me like that. I don't even have a gun. What did ya' do with the pistola' anyway? PHILLIP Threw it in the well. BUTCH Good thinkin'. 
203   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          203 ADLER Ya' think he means it? Red mulls it over, replaces his old chaw with a fresh one and looks to Sally. RED What do you think? SALLY Based on what's happened the past two days I don't think he would. RED One thing's for sure. If he gets outta' here with the boy, we're right back to where we started. BRADLEY If he kills the boy he'll get the chair. ADLER Shit, he'll get the chair anyway.   He's killed two in two days. SALLY We don't know that he pulled the trigger on either of the innocent victims. ADLER Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-O- Lounger. 'Sides, who killed Pugh? Casper? RED All right, both of you, that's enough! From the trail of blood I got a feelin' it ain't gonna' make any difference. Let's jus' concentrate on gettin' the boy out for now. Bobby Lee approaches with a leather case, bypasses Red and goes straight to Hendricks. BOBBY LEE Where ya' want me, sir? RED Can you shoot off a hood? Bobby Lee nods. In the b.g., a HELICOPTER circles, preparing to land. (CONTINUED) 
203   CONTINUED:                                                   203 ADLER That'd be the boy's mother. RED Bring her on over. 204   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                         204 Butch and Phillip watch the helicopter land. BUTCH See, Phillip, dreams do come true. There's yer' rocketship. PHILLIP Think I'll get to ride it? BUTCH Today's the day. RED (V.O.) (megaphoned) Butch, we got the boy's Mama here. She wants to say something. Phillip is visibly stunned by the news. He crawls up to the crest of the creekside and squints, looking for his mom. BUTCH What's wrong, Phillip? PHILLIP It's my mama. Phillip still cranes his neck to see. 
BUTCH Now that ya' got yerself a ghost suit, do ya' think she'll let ya' trick r' treat? PHILLIP (better than none) I got to do one house. Butch smiles.   He has an idea. BUTCH Put yer' mask back on. 205   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          205 Bobby Lee carefully unsnaps the latches on his leather case and opens it on the hood of the patrol car. (CONTINUED) 
212   CONTINUED:                                                     212 PHILLIP What are you gonna' do? BUTCH Somethin'll come to mind. Butch sticks out his hand.    Phillip shakes it, afraid. BUTCH 'Bye, Phillip.    It's been one helluva' ride. Butch nods and smiles. BUTCH (yells) All right, Cap'n. Make way for Casper the friendly ghost. The friendliest ghost I know. Butch nudges Phillip and the boy starts toward the field. 213   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                            213 Adler, looking through binoculars, can't help but smile. RED Gimme' them things. Adler hands over the binoculars.    Red takes a look. HIS POV - PHILLIP nee Casper, walking in his full whitehood, arms reaching for the sky. 
214   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                               214 Phillip reaches level ground and for the first time sees the full strength of the amassed police forces -- at least 20 cars, swirling lights, guns everywhere, pointing at him. 215   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                            215 Red watches. RED (yells) Come on. Keep walkin'! HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCS Phillip stops walking and stands perfectly still. (CONTINUED) 
215   CONTINUED:                                                   215 BACK TO SCENE Red lowers his binocs. RED (to himself) Why the hell's he stoppin'? (to Gladys; direct) Call for yer' boy to come! Gladys, near shock, AD LIBS commands to Phillip. "Come on honey," "Phillip, keep walking," that kind of thing. (NOTE: Her commands become more and more shrieking and frantic and continue throughout, giving rise to even more confusion than is already present.) 216   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                             216 Phillip turns back and sees ... Butch -- He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for it, but his strength is gone. He collapses. Phillip, standing still, with his mother's shrieks filling the air behind him, watches Butch for a second then runs back toward him. 217   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          217 Red sighs and lowers the binocs. 218   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                         218 Phillip stands before a struggling Butch. 
BUTCH Personally I think we negotiated a pretty fair deal, but if there's somethin' else you want... PHILLIP (disbelief) Do they want to shoot you? Butch starts to lie to the boy but can't. 219   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          219 A finger strokes the trigger of a high-powered rifle. Bobby Lee -- Smiling, ready, waiting. Red shrugs and wipes his brow. (CONTINUED) 
219   CONTINUED:                                                     219 HENDRICKS He thought better of releasin' the hostage. SALLY It doesn't necessarily mean that. RED (to Bobby Lee) Stay on ready. 220   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                           220 Phillip holds his hand out and helps Butch get up. Butch stands, dusts himself off, grabs the boy's hand and to- gether they walk toward the field. 
221   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                            221 Red, through the binoculars. RED I seen it all now. 222   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                               222 Butch and Phillip, hand in hand, walking across the field. 223   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                            223 Red scratches his head. HENDRICKS What's he up to? RED Hell if I know. 
SALLY He's giving himself up. HENDRICKS Keep in mind -- he still has the gun. RED (yells; to Butch) Butch! Stop and let the boy go! Put yer' hands up and let the boy go!!! (NOTE:   AD LIB instructions from Red continue as well.) 
224   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                               224 With all the yelling, it's hard to make out what's being said. Butch and Phillip continue to walk and talk. BUTCH So I guess that's it for Alaska, Phillip. 225   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                            225 RED Stop and put your hands on your head! GLADYS Run, Phillip!   Come here, Phillip! SALLY (to herself) Come on, come on... HENDRICKS (a warning) Chief, we've got an armed killer and an innocent boy out there. RED (to Bobby Lee) You clean? BOBBY LEE As a whistle. RED Keep him locked down.    Don't squeeze til' I say 'when.' Red holds Bobby Lee's eyes until the young Fed nods.    Then Red unstraps his holster and moves between the cars.

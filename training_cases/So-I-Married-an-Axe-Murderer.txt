Screenplay by 
Robbie Fox 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
OPEN ON: 
MONTAGE OF VARIOUS SHOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK 
Over this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San Francisco which is accompanied by a BE-BOP trio. Kerouac's poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to "THE CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous "I'm looking into the distance, having a brilliant thought" pose... 
CHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into... 
INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE 
We FOLLOW him through the store. By day he is the Assistant Manager, by night he is a poet. 
A MAN in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading, Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed A Bit. 
Charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal. 
CHARLIE (sotto) O' SCOTLAND YOUR SUCKLED TEET OF SHAME 
CUSTOMER approaches. 
CUSTOMER Do you have the book On The Road by Jack Kerouac? 
Every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in to get copies of On The Road. Charlie is use to this and without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display of thousands of copies of On The Road. Another TOURIST COUPLE approach. 
TOURIST Do you have a copy of On The Road by Jack Kerouac? 
Again not looking up, Charlie just points. 
TOURIST Thanks. 
EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT 
Charlie puts the "CLOSED" sign on the door and proceeds to walk home. 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS 
The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace. RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger. Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance. Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto: 
HIS STREET 
He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his window. A CRASHING sound from within. 
CUT TO: 
HANDS 
taking papers out of a desk drawer. 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE 
carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand. Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs. 
CUT BACK TO: 
SHATTERED PICTURE FRAME 
with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde. 
CUT BACK TO: 
CHARLIE She smelled exactly like Campbell's Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty, physically dirty. 
SHERRI Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're gonna say were my problems? Are you gonna tell your friends that I was a junkie, that I wasn't supportive enough or that I smelled like relish? Charlie, I loved you. It could have worked out. (she goes to the door) Think about it. 
She leaves. 
ANGLE ON - THE BROKEN PICTURE 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - CHARLIE'S CAR - DUSK 
Charlie and his best friend, TONY SPILETTI, are out for a night on the town. 
Tony is second generation Italian-American with very Mediterranean features. They're listening to Teenage Fan Club. They pass Ghierardeli Square. 
CHARLIE Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're Scottish you know? 
TONY Oh. 
CHARLIE I had that dream again. 
TONY Oh, is that the one where you suspect that a fat man in a diaper, on a lazy susan has interfered with your plans for the evening? 
CHARLIE No, but I have had that one. No, in this one I'm in love... 
TONY Yeah. 
CHARLIE And I say to myself, 'I've finally found somebody that I'm truly comfortable with.' You know when you're so comfortable that you'll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl. Anyways you know what I do in the dream next? 
TONY You propose? 
CHARLIE (after a pause) No. I die. 
TONY But Charlie, you're a normal suburban guy at heart, from a normal suburban family. Didn't you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a family. 
CHARLIE Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There are seven main rites of passage in a man's life. Birth, first day of school, last day of school. Marriage. Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at marriage. I'm two rites of passage away from death. 
TONY I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. 
Tony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind them. He slouches down into his seat. 
TONY Christ. It's the cops. 
CHARLIE Tony, you are a cop. 
TONY I know. Isn't it awful? I work with those guys. They're assholes. 
The police car passes. 
INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Tony and Charlie enter. There is a poet on stage. The club is full of art tarts and college bohemians. They are greeted by the club's owner, GIUSEPPI, an Italian man in his fifties. 
TONY Salve zio mio. 
UNCLE Allora? Che catzo fai, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Hi, Uncle Giuseppi. 
UNCLE Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa e' in galera per la terza volta. 
Tony's uncle shows them to a table. 
UNCLE I'll have the waitress bring you cappuccino. 
CHARLIE What did your uncle say? 
TONY He says my Dad's back in jail again. 
CHARLIE Ah, I'm sorry, man. 
TONY You know, it's funny I don't even feel related to my parents anymore. I feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents. I feel more Scottish than Italian. 
IN THE JOURNAL 
THIS POEM SUCKS 
After the last line he scratches out the entire poem. He closes the book and turns on the TV set to CNN to veg out. The show is "What's Cooking! With Burt Wolf." 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET 
Charlie is driving in his car. He drives slowly looking for an address. Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front. 
EXT. BUTCHER'S SHOP - MEATS OF THE WORLD 
Adorning the front are a "GRAND OPENING" sign and miniature flags of the world. Charlie goes inside. 
INT. BUTCHER'S SHOP 
It's a small, hip shop selling specialty meats from around the world. Charlie looks around. Suddenly, an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a blood-stained smock enters. It is HARRIET MICHAELS. She has a cleaver in one hand and something bloody in the other. 
HARRIET (angry) Goddamn shoplifter. (conscious of Charlie's presence; holding up bloody meat) But I got him! (smiles) You're next. 
CHARLIE (backing out the door; terrified) I've come at a bad time. 
HARRIET No stay! 
CHARLIE No, no, really... Obviously you've got things you have to do. You've got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow grave. Cover the body with quick lime. Really so much to do, so little time and I'm only in the way here, I'm just gonna go. Good luck. 
HARRIET (referring to meat in hand) Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he stole. This isn't a piece of him or anything. This is Icelandic Shank. 
CHARLIE I bet it goes well with a nice Chianti. Fittfittfitt. 
HARRIET (laughs) Can I help you? 
CHARLIE Yes. Do you have haggis? 
HARRIET Yes, we do. It's over here in our Scottish Cuts section. One? 
This is a section under glass flying a Scottish flag, with haggis and various cuts of Scottish meat. 
CHARLIE Yes! I've never been able to find haggis anywhere, except at my parents' house. They're Scottish. 
Harriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis. Behind her is the large "PRUSSIAN VENISON" sign. 
HARRIET (ringing up his order) That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine. Will there be anything else? 
CHARLIE Yes. I know it's a long shot, but you wouldn't by any chance happen to have any Prussian Venison? 
HARRIET Now where in the world would I get Prussian Venison? 
Charlie's charmed. 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET 
Charlie is driving along listening to Kerouac. We absorb the flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street. 
EXT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
An old crappie apartment building in San Francisco. Charlie's car pulls up. We hear "SATURDAY NIGHT" by the Bay City Rollers. 
INT. OUTER HALLWAY OF CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Charlie approaches a door. 
CHARLIE (calling up) Mom, Dad, I'm here. 
STUART (O.S.) We're in here, son. 
The apartment is a shrine to Scotland. Scottish paraphernalia, miniature Scotty dogs, shortbread tins and, on wall, framed pictures depict famous Scotsmen, Sean Connery, Jackie Stewart, Alexander Graham Bell, James Doohan (Scottie from "Star Trek"), Sheena Easton, Billy Connolly. 
CHARLIE'S POV - AS WE ENTER THE LIVING ROOM 
We see STUART, MAY, TONY, and little WILLIAM, Charlie's fourteen year old little brother all singing: 
CHARLIE Thank you, no. 
MAY Sherri's late. 
CHARLIE Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up. 
MAY Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the daughter your father was never able to give me. 
CHARLIE I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm twenty-nine and my poems haven't even been published yet. 
STUART But it's not just the poetry is it son? You're afraid if you get married you'll lose your muse. Look at me, I was a strapping young butcher, at the height of my creative powers. When it came to de-boning a side of beef, there was nobody that could touch me. Then I married your mother. And people would still stand in awe as I filleted a shoulder of lamb. 
MAY Maybe it's just as well not to get married, look at the news. Where did I put it? 
STUART Heed. Move that melon of yours into the bathroom and get the paper for your mother. 
William gets the National Enquirer and brings it back. 
CHARLIE That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with that paper. 
STUART What are you talking about? It's the fifth highest circulating paper in the United States, I'll have you know. 
MAY Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon Murderer. She marries men under fake identities, and then murders them. She killed some German martial arts expert, and some plumber named Ralph Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown. 
There's another goal on the TV set. 
STUART Scores! Two nil. Magic! 
TONY Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the TV set. 
Time passes. The TV set 
CROSS FADES: 
TO THE END OF THE GAME 
The two teams are shaking hands. And the final scores chyron shows Celtic beating Rangers three nothing. We see Charlie and Tony are leaving. Stuart is blind drunk. 
STUART (singing Rod Stewart's song) YOU'RE IN MY EYES, YOU'RE IN MY DREAMS... YOU'RE CELTIC, UNITED AND BABY I'VE DECIDED... 
MAY Ah, you're steaming. 
She meets Charlie and Tony at the door and kisses him good- bye. She turns to kiss Tony, and holds on the kiss far too long. 
TONY (pulling away) See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie. 
MAY Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian bastard. 
CHARLIE See you later, mom. (calling out) See you later, Dad. 
STUART Fine. Go! You've stayed your hour. 
Charlie and Tony leave and enter... 
THE HALLWAY 
where they find William sitting on the stairs waiting for them. 
WILLIAM Take me with you. 
EXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD - LATE AFTERNOON 
Charlie's drives by and notices Harriet, who's unwinding the store awning in Dutch national costume. The banner announces "DUTCH WEEK." "MEATS OF THE WORLD SALUTES DUTCH MEAT." 
Charlie slows down to look at her. She looks great in her little Dutch costume. 
INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - DAY 
Charlie is again writing at the counter. Another PERSON enters. 
MAN Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to have... 
EXT. PIER - NIGHT 
Charlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs. As Charlie puts the relish on, he smells the relish. 
CHARLIE (sniffing the relish) This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend. 
HARRIET I hate talking about old relationships. 
CHARLIE Then let's not and say we did. 
HARRIET (she laughs) That was easy -- What a nice guy. You've probably never done a mean thing in your life. 
CHARLIE You'd be surprised. 
HARRIET I'd like to hear. (to his confused look) Name me something bad you've done in your life. 
CHARLIE Are you kidding me? 
HARRIET No. Did you ever steal anything? You ever hit someone? 
CHARLIE Well, I've been in fights. Let me think. 
HARRIET (as Charlie thinks) Not one bad thing, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Tell me something bad you've done. And it better be bad. I mean, evil. 
HARRIET How evil? 
CHARLIE Really evil. (thinks) Like how many people have you brutally murdered? 
HARRIET "Brutal" is such a subjective word. I mean, what's brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to another. 
Next to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking through a coin-operated binocular. He says something which causes her to cry. 
CHARLIE This just reminded her of that scene in "Brian's Song". 
HARRIET Actually, he just proposed to her. Those are tears of joy. 
She lifts her soda to toast them. 
HARRIET Prost. 
The man and woman smile and nod. 
MAN Danke, Fraulein. 
CHARLIE You're very smart. It's a shame I'm going to have to destroy you. 
HARRIET Do bright women intimidate you? 
CHARLIE No, not at all. 
HARRIET Really, what do you look for in women you date? 
CHARLIE (thinks) Well, I know everyone always say "sense of humor", but I'd have to go with breast size. (she laughs) How about you? In a guy. 
HARRIET Income of course, and then... (thinks) ...savings. 
He smiles at her. 
CHARLIE Me likey how you thinkey. 
INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The lights turn on, and then they enter a very bohemian apartment. There is artists paraphernalia strewn around. A small bar separates the living area from the kitchen. She smiles and walks off into the kitchen. 
HARRIET I'll make us some tea. 
He checks out her apartment. On the wall there is a huge poster of the BOARDWALK IN ATLANTIC CITY. 
CHARLIE Hey, you know what this apartment needs? A really large oversized poster of Atlantic City. 
ROSE Go away. 
CHARLIE Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me. 
He backs out of the room. 
INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT 
The door opens and a hurriedly dressed Charlie emerges. Before he gets to the door he once again encounters Rose. She's completely dressed. Even her hair is dry. 
CHARLIE Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have scared the... I'm Harriet's friend, Charlie, and you must be... (hopefully) Ralph? 
ROSE I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this is Harriet's note. 
He reaches for it, but she reads it aloud to him. 
ROSE (reading) 'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake you, make yourself at home, thanks for making me smile.' Harriet. 
CHARLIE That's a very nice note. 
ROSE I'll make you some breakfast. 
CHARLIE Gee, I'd love to but I'm running late. 
ROSE What would you say to blueberry pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape juice and Kona coffee? 
INT. KITCHEN - LATER 
Charlie and Rose sit at the table each eating a bowl of dry cereal. 
ROSE I'm sorry I didn't have any of those other things. 
CHARLIE Hey, that stuff'll kill you while Fruit Loops are light and probably reasonably high in Fiber. I like Apple Jacks too. 
ROSE Got 'em. 
CHARLIE So this is your apartment? 
Rose starts sketching Charlie. 
ROSE Yes. She's been here the past three months... ever since she came back from Miami. I used to visit her occasionally. She didn't speak of me? 
CHARLIE (shakes his head, no) She told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about Ralph... 
ROSE She spoke of them...? 
CHARLIE She spoke of the martial arts guy and screamed about Ralph... 
ROSE (affectionately) Well, you know Harriet. 
CHARLIE Actually, I really don't. 
ROSE (puzzled) But you did have sex with her? 
CHARLIE (taken aback) Hello. 
ROSE Yet you still don't know her. (contemplates this) See, that's the problem with sex. It's not very revealing. 
CHARLIE My, look at the time. 
He stands up. 
ROSE (after a pause) You should be careful, Charlie. 
CHARLIE I am... usually. I just... You should know, this is very unusual that I would do this so soon, in this day and age particularly, but... We just really hit it off. We did. And... 
ROSE I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet that anything happened. 
CHARLIE But... nothing did happen. 
ROSE Exactly. Or she would be jealous. And when she gets jealous, we both know what she's capable of. 
CHARLIE Exactly. That's what's gonna be different this time. Something strange happens, let it go. It's not my business... Like Ralph. She says Ralph in her sleep. 
TONY Who's Ralph? 
CHARLIE I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover, I don't want to know. 
TONY Good. 
PARK RANGER And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't enough retribution for Kelly, the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing into the "bitch's" ocular cavity. 
Tony and Charlie look at each other. They're a little queasy. 
CHARLIE Exactly. (beat) Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw this one up. 
INT. EL TORO - IN THE MISSION - DAY 
They are eating Bay burrites. 
ROSE Did you have a nice date last night? 
HARRIET Rose, I don't really -- 
ROSE He disturbed me while I was naked in the shower this morning. 
HARRIET Yeah, he stayed over? 
ROSE I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed about it over breakfast. 
HARRIET That's good. 
ROSE He said you had great sex last night. 
HARRIET He did? (a beat) Yeah. 
ROSE He seems really stuck on you. I hope for you that it lasts. 
HARRIET Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving person. We like each other, but I don't want to think any further. It's taken me a long time to get back to dating, and I want to take things real steady this time. 
ROSE Well, you can trust me not to tell him anything. 
HARRIET He was quite happy not to talk about the past. 
ROSE I did a sketch of him. 
Rose shows the sketch to Harriet. 
HARRIET (looking at the picture) That's good. 
ROSE Think I've caught him? 
HARRIET The eyes are good. 
ROSE Charlie really liked it. 
HARRIET It's a good likeness. 
ROSE Boy, I really hope it works out. 
HARRIET Rose, I don't wanna screw this one up. 
EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Charlie enters the building, holding a handful of poetry books. He passes a UNIFORMED DELIVERY GUY coming out. The guy nods and Charlie nods back. 
INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
Charlie gets three feet down the hallway. Stops in his tracks and heads back to the front door. He opens it and yells to the delivery guy: 
CHARLIE Hey, uh... Ralph...? 
DELIVERY GUY (turning around) I'm Gilbert. 
HARRIET She's just being kind. Show Charlie one of your photographs, Rose. Rose is a great artist. 
ROSE No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're not good. 
HARRIET You're so modest. If I weren't here to brag for you, I just don't know... (taking out a posterboard from cabinet) Show it to him, Rose. Do it. 
He turns it over and there is a picture there. A collage of unrelated images put together. And it is beautiful. 
But it's very abstract. Violent perhaps. Confused definitely. He likes it. 
CHARLIE It's beautiful... 
ROSE Thanks. 
CHARLIE What is it? 
ROSE I dunno. 
CHARLIE What do you call it? 
ROSE I dunno. 
CHARLIE A lot artists don't like to title their work. They feel it biases the viewer. 
ROSE It is titled. It's called "I dunno". 
Charlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet. It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for Rose. A hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty. 
HARRIET We should get going, Charlie. Thanks, Rose... See you later. 
ROSE Bye, Charlie. 
CHARLIE Rose, great to see you. We should all go out together some time. The three of us. That would be great. That would be... interesting. 
Charlie and Harriet walk out. 
EXT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT 
Charlie and Harriet wait in line with bohemian types and poetry lovers from the suburbs, and all walks of life. Directly behind them are TWO OLD LADIES. The marquee reads: "POETRY FESTIVAL - TONIGHT ALLEN GINSBERG." 
CHARLIE I think you're going to love Alan Ginsberg. He's great. 
HARRIET Oh, I know all about him. 
TONY (O.S.) Hey Charlie! 
Tony is getting out of a cab accompanied by Susan, the girl from Spiletti's Coffee House. He approaches Charlie. 
TONY Sorry we're late. 
Tony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the Little Old Ladies on the other side of Charlie. 
TONY You must be Harriet. I've heard a lot about you. 
CHARLIE (to Tony; re: Harriet) This is Harriet. 
TONY Oh. Sorry. Of course. (whispering to Harriet) I apologize. Charlie described you as much older. And heavier. 
HARRIET (smiling) Oh, he did...? 
CHARLIE Thank you, Tony. This is my best friend. 
TONY And this is Susan. Charlie, you remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's. 
CHARLIE Yes, I do. 
SUSAN You're funny... 
Then she GIGGLES. The girls start inside, Tony lags back with Charlie. 
TONY (whispers to Charlie) I give Susan one night. 
CHARLIE No, no, not that. Just, in general some photos. Any little snapshot would do. 
ROSE I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates being photographed. 
The sound of a key in the door as Harriet enters the apartment. 
HARRIET (O.S.) Rose -- did I see Charlie's car out in front? 
ROSE We're in here, Harriet. 
HARRIET (walking in) What are you guys doing? 
CHARLIE (covering up) Oh, nothing. Just looking through some of Rose's work. 
ROSE ...Charlie wanted a photo of you. 
CHARLIE And that. That too. 
HARRIET Why of me, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Well, sentimental reasons. Something to remind me of you when we're not together. 
She takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss. 
HARRIET There, can you remember that? 
CHARLIE Okay, it's just, I was gonna give one to my parents, too, and... (getting nowhere) Another time would be fine. It's hardly a matter of life and death. 
TV SET - PLAYING THE EVENING NEWS 
NEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) In the news tonight, regarding a Beverly Hills Jeweler, Morris Cohan, who died last week, police are now suspecting that Morris's partner, Lawrence Sachs, may have murdered him with an untraceable poison. 
Reveal: we are in... 
INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Charlie is on a Stair Master, as Harriet walks in wearing a robe. The TV is on in the b.g. 
CHARLIE Where you been? 
HARRIET Downstairs. I have a surprise for you. 
CHARLIE Great. I just wanna do a quick twenty minutes on the Stair Master before bed. 
Harriet drops her robe, and from over her shoulder we see that Charlie prefers what he sees to working out. 
CHARLIE I'll do forty tomorrow. 
HARRIET (getting into bed) I got something much healthier for you than that. 
She pulls out a milkshake from behind her back. 
CHARLIE What is it? 
HARRIET It's a health shake. Eggs, malt, cinnamon, oranges. It's great. I mixed it up downstairs. 
THE TV SET 
continues on about poisons and poisoners. Charlie glances at it. 
NEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Poisoning has become the second leading method of murder in recent years, due to... 
Charlie watches the TV, looking a bit disturbed. Harriet offers him the shake. 
CHARLIE Oh, look, I'm full. Dinner and... No... 
HARRIET You'll like it Charlie. 
CHARLIE No, really, thanks. 
HARRIET (putting it up to his lips) You won't try it. I spent twenty minutes making it. 
HARRIET Well, good night. 
CHARLIE Good night. 
She doesn't close her eyes. He's scared to close his. Pause. 
CHARLIE Well... good night. 
HARRIET (smiling) Good night. 
They both look over at each other. She closes her eyes. He takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes. 
And covers his ear with his hand. 
INT. BART PLATFORM - DAY 
Charlie is on the crowded platform. Next to him is an old lady with a lot of shopping bags. Three kids on skateboards whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands. Cat toys and cans of cat food go everywhere. Charlie bends down and starts to help her gather her stuff. 
LADY Thank you very much, young man. I've gotta get all this stuff back to my children. 
CHARLIE Your children? 
LADY When I say my children I mean my cats. You see my children moved out years ago, so all I've got is my cats. I have over one hundred of them. 
CHARLIE That's a lot of cats. 
HARRIET (O.S.) Charlie. 
Charlie looks up and sees Harriet waving to him from the subway stairs. He waves back and motions. "I'll be there in a second", and continues to help the old lady. She watches from the stairs. 
LADY You see this red toy? That's for the Captain, he's finicky. and this blue one? That's for Marco Polo. 
Two train headlights are seen off in the distance. 
CHARLIE Do you have a name for all of your cats? 
LADY Oh, yes. 
Charlie glances over at Harriet, who slowly makes her way down the platform towards him. 
LADY Let me see! There's Winston Churchill, Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie... 
The train is getting closer and closer, and so is Harriet. 
CHARLIE ...He was Scottish. 
Harriet moves forward a step, Charlie moves back a step. 
LADY Wasn't he Irish? 
As Harriet seems to get closer Charlie continues to back up, picking up cat toys. Charlie realizes he has no where else to turn. so he side steps down the platform, never stopping his conversation with the lady. 
CHARLIE Actually he was Scottish. Trust me, I know these things. 
Harriet is moving in on him. Charlie steadily makes his way down the platform, feigning accidentally kicking cat food down the platform. The old lady is unsure what is going on, she tries to keep up with him. 
LADY Now that you say it, he was Scotch. 
Charlie runs out of platform. Harriet is very close to him. The train is closer, so is Harriet. Charlie lets out a scream. 
CHARLIE Noooooo! 
Charlie is standing at the edge of the platform, Harriet is a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by. Charlie is safe. People are all staring at Charlie curiously, including Harriet and the old lady. Charlie is embarrassed. 
CHARLIE (embarrassed) Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink. Scots are a people. Sorry, that just always bugged me. 
No one knows what is going on. 
LADY I'm sorry, I didn't know it meant so much to you. 
CHARLIE Hi, Harriet. 
CHARLIE The truth. Okay. The truth is... 
She is so close to him, and so very beautiful, it's distracting. 
CHARLIE The truth is... I'm afraid that you are... (he can't) You're going to laugh. 
HARRIET I don't think so. 
CHARLIE Okay... the truth is that I'm afraid you're going to ki... leave me. 
HARRIET I'm going to "cleave you?" What does that mean? 
CHARLIE Leave me. Not "cleave me." Reject me. And so I decided to take matters into my own hands and get it over with by... 
HARRIET Rejecting me. 
CHARLIE (he feels awful) Purely preventive... It's not anything you've done. 
HARRIET I know that... So why are you leaving me? 
CHARLIE (heartbroken) Harriet, maybe I'm not meant to be in a relationship. 
A single tear runs down her cheek. She brushes it away quickly. 
CHARLIE I never wanted to hurt you. 
HARRIET You haven't. At least you left early on. (she's crying) So, that's it, then. I've got a lot of work to do. (to Customer) Now, where were we? 
Charlie goes. 
INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Charlie lies on the bar head down. Tony rushes in, looks around and sees Charlie. 
CHARLIE (without lifting head) Two hours and four minutes. Tony, I need you, and two hours and four minutes later you show up. 
TONY Sorry. I know it was irresponsible to stay at the drug bust until it was over, but... What happened? 
CHARLIE (slowly sitting up) I'm gonna tell you, but when I do, just say nothing. Don't judge me. Just be my friend. Okay? 
TONY Fine. Okay. 
CHARLIE I broke up with Harriet. 
TONY You're an asshole. 
CHARLIE What's your point? 
TONY I'm sorry, I just... why? 
CHARLIE Tony, she's a killer. The... everything. 
TONY But nothing's proven. The only thing you're actually sure she did so far is she's treated you like a King. 
CHARLIE I dunno, Tony, I just... 
TONY Besides, everyone has something going on with them. I mean, you can't find everything in one person. I mean, she's bright, she's funny, she's independent. So maybe, and it's really just a maybe, she kills her husbands. Marriage is give and take, Man. You take the good with the bad. 
INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
Charlie lies in bed. He's writing in his journal. He stares out into space. Inspired, he writes... 
ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL 
DON'T BE DISILLUSIONED BY THE SCOTTISH SON AS HE FLIES, IN BAT-LIKE UNISON 
CHARLIE 
pauses a moment to reflect, then writes... 
ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL 
CHARLIE (through door) Harriet, it's me, Charlie. 
HARRIET (O.S.) Go away, Charlie. 
CHARLIE I've gotta talk to you, cause I miss you, and I made a mistake... and if you give me another chance I'll change. I will. I promise. I'll get help, or therapy, or... Yeah, that'll be great. Therapy. Even twice a week. I'll check with my insurance to see if I'm covered, but forget that. Harriet... 
The chain opens on the door. 
HARRIET You really hurt me. 
CHARLIE I'll make it up to you, can we at least talk. 
HARRIET Sure, talk. 
Rose steps up behind Charlie. 
ROSE (O.S.) Hi, Charlie. 
CHARLIE AAAhhhhhh. 
ROSE (as she now proceeds to be let in by Harriet) Trust your first instincts, Charlie. You never do. It's your big mistake. That and the haircut. 
Once again, baffled by Rose, Charlie touches his hair, shakes it off and looks Harriet right in the eye. 
CHARLIE I don't want to lose you. 
HARRIET You didn't lose me. You rejected me. 
CHARLIE I'm unrejecting you. 
HARRIET How do I know you won't reject me again? 
CHARLIE I love you. 
HARRIET (after a long pause) I love you. But you blew it, Charlie, you blew it. 
She goes into the house. Charlie stands there dejected. He knows he's blown it. 
INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Harriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied work clothes. Suddenly she can hear the sound of MUSIC, very loudly. 
Annoyed, she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors off. Just as she's about to knock on the door, she realizes it's not the source of the music. At that moment her neighbor, who is a STEWARDESS, comes out in nightclothes. 
STEWARDESS I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a stewardess, and I have an early flight out in the morning. Can you please keep your music down? 
HARRIET I thought it was coming from here. 
STEWARDESS But someone keeps shouting your name over and over. 
Puzzled, Harriet rushes back to her own balcony. 
EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT 
Harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the noise. Charlie serenades Harriet in the street below, accompanied by a TRUMPETER with a MUTE, a DOUBLE BASS PLAYER AND A GUY ON A SNARE. 
CHARLIE HARRIET, HARRIET HARD-HEARTED HARBINGER OF HAGGIS BEAUTIFUL, BEMUSED BELLICOSE BUTCHER UNTRUST-ING UNKNOW-ING UNLOV-ING HE WANTS YOU BACK HE SCREAMS INTO THE NIGHT AIR LIKE A FIREMAN GOING TO A WINDOW THAT HAS NO FIRE EXCEPT THE PASSION OF HIS HEART I AM LONELY, IT'S REALLY HARD THIS POEM SUCKS 
A crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on their balconies. They break out into APPLAUSE. Charlie proudly takes the applause and bows to Harriet. She throws him a flower. He's won her back. 
INT. BATHTUB - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Romantic with candles surrounding the tub. Harriet and Charlie are bathing together. Wherever one of them moves, the water extinguishes a candle and Charlie lights it. This is keeping him pretty busy. 
HARRIET I've been there for almost a year. I only planned on stay with her for a few weeks, but she gets upset every time I say I'm moving. 
CHARLIE You were close as kids? 
HARRIET I pretty much raised her. You know the scene. Depressed mother... withdrawn father. (she remembers) My dad was a photographer too. 
CHARLIE Really? 
CHARLIE Hey Dad, I got an anniversary present for you... 
Stuart looks up, and Charlie gets him in a headlock and pins him to the ground. 
STUART I'm proud of you, son. I'm proud of you. (Stuart addresses the group) I just wanna propose a toast. To my wife. Forty five years ago today May and I got married. Some of you were there, some of you weren't born yet, some of you are now dead, but... We both said, "I do" and we haven't agreed on a single thing since. But, I'm glad I married you May cause... It could have been worse and besides... I still love you. 
They kiss and everyone APPLAUDS. Uncle Angus breaks into, "Stand By Your Man." May and Stuart start to dance. Charlie looks at another young couple who are touched by this sincere display of love. He looks over at Harriet. Stuart and May feed each other cake. Charlie approaches Harriet. 
CHARLIE Harriet, I wanna talk to you. 
HARRIET Boy, you really made some impression with Ralph. She can't get over you. 
CHARLIE (stalling; nervous) I'm just so happy for you to have friends like Ralph. What a great friend to have. 
HARRIET Is everything all right, Charlie? You're perspiring. 
CHARLIE Harriet... marry me. 
HARRIET What? 
CHARLIE I want to have a wedding. With you. 
HARRIET No. 
CHARLIE Please. 
HARRIET I don't know, Charlie. It's so good like it is. Why don't we just live together first? 
CHARLIE Because, I love you and I want you to marry me and be with me for 45 years. I want you to have my children, and I want to have your children. I know that sounds like a lot of children, and they might not all get along, but... I'm finally ready to trust you and to make a commitment. Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my wife. 
Harriet flinches slightly at the word "Wife", but Charlie is too wrapped up in the moment to notice. Stuart addresses the group. 
STUART I'd like to thank Charlie for throwing us this party. I hope some day you have the same great 45 years that we've had. 
People clap and smile. Harriet looks at Charlie. He has tears in his eyes. 
HARRIET Yes. 
At first it doesn't register. Then... 
CHARLIE You will? 
She smiles. 
HARRIET Let's get married, Charlie. 
They kiss. 
MAY (from across room) Harriet, come here a minute. I want you and Uncle Angus to play a song together. 
Harriet and Charlie kiss one last time and she goes to the piano. 
Charlie stays in the corner, and Tony comes over. 
TONY Hey, sorry I'm so late. What's happening? 
CHARLIE Nothing. Nothing at all. Just two little things... (as Tony looks in) That woman over there in the corner... She's Harriet's friend, and her name is Ralph. 
TONY No shit. 
CHARLIE And secondly... That woman over there... (Re: Harriet) That's Harriet, and we're getting married. 
TONY (excited) Fantastic... What did I tell you. She's a great girl. And the last thing in the world she'd be is a murderer. 
And then Harriet begins singing at the piano. 
HARRIET (singing) ONLY YOU... CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT... ONLY YOU... CAN MAKE THIS DARKNESS LIGHT..." 
Tony and Charlie look at each other. "Only you?" Then Charlie looks at his bride with confidence. 
He walks over and joins her. She sings to him. It's a moment. 
HARRIET Sorry. The flash just... 
The band kicks into a new dance. A YOUNG BOY comes up to the bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his ear. The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and then breaks into Rod Stewart's "IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY." From across the room we hear Stuart singing. 
STUART (full volume; singing) IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY... AND YOU WANT MY BODY... COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW. 
Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up. The young people in the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests start getting into the swing of things. The bagpipe man continues playing. It is clear that he is far too drunk to play. He slowly keels over, drunk. And as he falls over face first, he lands on his Bagpipes. The bagpipes let out an ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a tortured animal. The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene. 
EXT. HIGH ABOVE COAST - DAY 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet. 
INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - DAY 
They drive along the beautiful coast. Harriet is still eating. They're listening to TEENAGE FAN CLUB. 
CHARLIE This is Teenage Fan Club. They're from Scotland. 
HARRIET They're great. 
CHARLIE We'll have the whole lodge to ourselves practically. 
HARRIET I can't wait, Charlie. 
CHARLIE I wish you could be me, so you could know how great it feels to be with you. 
HARRIET It sounds wonderful 
CHARLIE Do you think that would be a good line for a poem? 
HARRIET Honestly? It sounds a little Hallmark. 
CHARLIE Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft. I have a habit of sabotaging relationships, and there were a million times during me and you that I could have blown this, and I just thank God that I didn't... 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Tony is at his desk. The captain kicks open the door, knocking Tony's feet off the desk. The captain is now dressed in suspenders, a loosened tie, and a shirt with pit stains. 
CAPTAIN O.K., Spiletti, I got word from upstairs that you been pokin' your nose into that Ralph Elliot case. 
TONY Yes, Captain. 
CAPTAIN Don't "yes, Captain" me, Spiletti. You're outta line. This is strictly homicide. 
TONY Captain, I got this friend... 
CAPTAIN Friend? Yeah, we all got friends, Spiletti. I'm warning you, Stay away from this one. Back off, Italian boy. You're getting too close to this one. 
TONY Captain, I know what I'm doing. Trust me. What's the news. 
CAPTAIN I can't believe I'm doing this, but that girl who confused to Ralph Elliot's murder also confessed to other murders. 
TONY I knew she would! I knew it! 
CAPTAIN Yeah, apparently she also confessed to killing Abe Lincoln, Julius Caesar, and Warren G. Harding. She's a nut, Spiletti! 
TONY (getting up) Oh, my god! I gotta go! 
CAPTAIN Yeah, screw this one up Spiletti and you'll be writing parking tickets for the rest of your days. 
TONY I won't let you down, Captain. 
Tony exits for a beat, then pokes his head in the doorway. 
TONY That's much better Captain. 
CAPTAIN (nice again) You think so? Well, thank you very much. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Tony hurries to his car. 
ROSE It didn't come out. 
TONY Look, Rose. I need a photo. 
ROSE The picture didn't come out. (he waits) It was unflattering. In made her look ten pounds heavier. (he waits) She's my sister. 
TONY She's been implicated in a crime. I need the photo to eliminate her as a suspect. 
ROSE And if she's not innocent. If she's, you know, "quirky?" 
TONY If she's "quirky" we'll save Charlie's life. 
Rose pulls out a photograph -- Charlie and Harriet. Looking young and in love. 
EXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - LATE IN THE DAY 
A beautiful old Colonial Mansion, nestled in the mountains and forests of the North-West. Romantic and from another day. Charlie and Harriet pull up in front of it. 
The Valets open the door for them. 
HARRIET It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so beautiful. 
VALET Welcome to the Dry Creek. You just beat the rainstorm. Two hours later and the roads'd probably be closed. 
CHARLIE Great. If you could help us with the luggage, we have these two in the back seat and... 
As they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head. She walks straight at the CAMERA, so only we can see her expression. Her expression is one of simply "losing it". 
CHARLIE Harriet? What are you doing honey? 
Harriet turns around and smiles at Charlie. He smiles back. 
INT. LOBBY OF DRY CREEK LODGE - EVENING 
Charlie and Harriet stand at the desk. Harriet is not quite paying attention. Her attention span has slipped to none. She's fidgety. She looks around suspiciously at everything and everyone. 
DESK CLERK Welcome, Sir. We have you with us for four nights, Mr. MacKenzie. Dinner reservations are at eight-thirty. 
CHARLIE Great. Sounds terrific. 
DESK CLERK Also, you might wanna prepare some candles by the bed. We're expecting the rainstorm to get even worse. We might even lose the power tonight. 
CHARLIE Did you hear that, Harriet? A storm. I can't think of anything more romantic than the two of us trapped in our room in the middle of a rain storm. (noticing her) You okay, Harriet? 
HARRIET Just a little head-ache. (to clerk) Excuse me, is there a drug store in the hotel? I want to get some aspirin. 
DESK CLERK Right beyond those trees, Ma'm. Anything you need. 
HARRIET Thanks. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. 
Harriet walks off to the lobby store, backwards, looking at Charlie. Charlie watches her walk off. The Desk Clerk sits staring at Charlie. 
DESK CLERK You think she's really got a head- ache? 
CHARLIE What? 
DESK CLERK Ah, nothing. Here's your key. You're in the Oak Room. 
Charlie looks back at the drug store, where Harriet is shopping. She waves to him. Charlie looks back at the Desk Clerk and grabs the key. 
CUT TO: 
FAX OF THE PHOTO OF CHARLIE & HARRIET 
coming out of a fax machine. 
INT. WALTER'S PLUMBING - EARLY EVENING 
WALTER, the owner of the Plumbing store, dressed in overalls takes the Fax out and then picks up the phone. 
WALTER That's Ralph Elliot's wife, alright. She had shorter hair in those days. 
CHARLIE No, no. That's a natural fear. I've thought about that fear. 
HARRIET It really worries me, Charlie. 
CHARLIE (quite confused) Well, look, they have, doctors -- I assume -- that deal, only with, webbed feet. And, God Forbid, and I'm talking strictly hypothetically, should that happen, we'll find one. 
HARRIET (kissing him; happy now) You're the greatest Charlie. 
CHARLIE (confused, to say the least) Thanks. We should get ready for dinner. 
EXT./INT. CHARTERED CESSNA - NIGHT 
A small plane flies through the clouds. It's just Tony and DENNIS the pilot. 
Dennis never really realizes this is more than a sightseeing tour, and constantly points out scenic points along the way. 
DENNIS Out your left side, you can see the Sierra Nevada, which is the largest mountain range west of the Rockies... 
TONY Great. Rockies. I don't care. Oregon. Move. 
INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM AT DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT 
Charlie is dressed very sharply in sport coat and tie. He yells into the bathroom where we can see part of Harriet from behind. 
CHARLIE You almost ready? The first seating is in five minutes. 
HARRIET (from other room) I just wanna look good for you, Charlie. That's all. 
CHARLIE I'm sure you look great. I'm sure you look... 
Harriet turns the corner, wearing a nice dress. Her hair looks okay. She's wearing perfume. The only problem is, she has two lines of mascara running down her cheeks. She's been crying. Charlie looks curious. 
HARRIET Do I look okay, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Yes. Well... 
Charlie points to his own eye. 
HARRIET What's wrong? 
CHARLIE Nothing. You kind of look like Tammy Faye Baker right now. 
She looks in the mirror. 
HARRIET Oh, yeah. 
She goes back into the bathroom. 
EXT. CESSNA - NIGHT 
The plane descends towards the runway. The rain comes down hard. 
DENNIS (V.O.) As we prepare to land, we can see off to our left Lake Shanony, which is... 
TONY (V.O.) Just land. Don't worry about Lake Shanony. I don't give a shit about Lake Shanony. 
The plane touches down. 
EXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT 
Rain pours fantastically on the gothic castle. Wind blows hard. 
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) A toast to our new friends, Charlie and Harriet... 
INT. BEAUTIFUL FRENCH RESTAURANT IN HOTEL - NIGHT 
A beautiful dining room with a small dance floor. Charlie sits at an intimate table for two with Harriet. A small band plays in the b.g., as the BAND LEADER is making the toast. The five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up their glass. 
BAND LEADER ...we're honored to be here for this very special day in... 
The CONCIERGE at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a TELEPHONE. Everyone stops and watches and waits. 
Then Rose strikes a match. She lights a candle and comes toward him. He looks around. The window is open. And Charlie is gone. 
INT. COMMANDEERED CAR - NIGHT 
Tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy, winding road on the way up to the hotel. Tony is drumming on the dash. 
MAN Could you stop doing that please? 
EXT. CASTLE-LIKE ROUND TOWER/LEDGE OF TOWER - NIGHT 
Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and sees MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC playing in the room 
CHARLIE Call the police! 
INT. THE LEVENSTEIN'S ROOM - NIGHT SAME 
The Levensteins prepare for bed. Charlie races by their window. Then Rose races by. 
CHARLIE Call the police! 
Mr. Levenstein closes the curtains. He can't hear. 
EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT 
Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the Axe, still. 
ROSE (mostly to herself; slurring most words) Charlie, did you like your note? I thought it was pretty accurate. I did all the husbands' notes. I can forge anyone's handwriting, I can write in anyone's style. See, I'm an artist. Harriet isn't an artist. Sure she could get a husband, but she could never have done this. And you know what I'm most proud of? 
CHARLIE What's that, Rose? 
ROSE Harriet never knew. She thought they all just left her. I protected her. She's my sister. 
Charlie turns and runs. Rose chases him. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn. 
TONY (shouting) Charlie! 
HARRIET (from closet) Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. I'm in here. 
Carefully, Tony opens the closet door. 
HARRIET Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. They're out on the ledge. 
TONY (not believing) Get on the floor and put your hands behind your back. 
Harriet willingly goes on the floor. 
HARRIET Sure, anything. You've got to save Charlie. 
Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Tony is standing with his back to the window, between it and Harriet. She looks out of the window and screams. 
HARRIET Look! It's Charlie! 
From Harriet's POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along. He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the pursuing Rose, and rushes off. 
Tony looks behind him out the window. Nobody is there. 
TONY Nice try. 
HARRIET I swear to you... It was Charlie... Look! Now there's Rose! 
Rose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand. 
TONY No you don't.

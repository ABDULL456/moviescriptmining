HELLRAISER 
A Screenplay by Clive Barker 
Paragan Film Productions Ltd (C)  Clive Barker 28.7.86            115 Flood Street, London.  SW3 
1    TITLE SEQUENCE 
In darkness, a blood-curdling cacophony:  the squeal of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented souls.  Above this din one particular victim yells for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage. 
By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the surrounding tumult, until without warning his voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time reduced to naked scream. 
And with the sound, an image. 
A house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin to run, as we approach the house down the driveway. 
We move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are louder now. 
Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for many years, though much of its furniture remains, covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room, a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a glass. 
We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn; an open suitcase; more liquor. 
We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into the passageway. 
As we reach the door, the screams from within halt abruptly. 
We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing steadily throughout this opening sequence. 
As we move through the door, the titles end. 
2    INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT 
The bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently, disorienting us.  There are chains - dozens of them - disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated, others simply drip blood. 
The bell tolls on. 
On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function. It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains an enigma. 
A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles, reaches down and picks the box up. 
In close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers.  It is open at present, its polished innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box. 
CENOBITE (unseen) It's over ... 
Delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box, sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the tune simplifying with each manoeuvre. 
The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing into the gloom. 
We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest of moments.  Then they're gone. 
The box is almost returned to its unopened condition. 
The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box, and the bell. 
It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place. 
The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune stops. 
At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is dust settling through the air. 
Otherwise it is empty. 
The bell fades. 
It's as if nothing ever happened here. 
Except ... 
Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp of a thing barely alive. 
3    INT.   HALLWAY    DAY 
The wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number 55. From the doorstep, voices.  One is that of LARRY COTTON, the other his wife JULIA.  Clearly LARRY is attempting to get inside.  We hear the sound of keys tried in the lock. 
LARRY It's one of these. 
JULIA We're going to freeze to death. 
JULIA I thought half of it was your brother's? 
LARRY He won't complain.  He can pay off some of his creditors. 
LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA to explore further. 
LARRY You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it.  She'll love it. 
JULIA You mean we're moving in? 
LARRY pauses.  Looks at her. 
LARRY You don't like it? 
JULIA shrugs. 
JULIA It's better than Brooklyn. 
She turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then follows. 
LARRY You're still blaming me. 
JULIA No.  I'm not. 
LARRY You wanted to come back to London.  We came back. 
We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens of times, which immediately annoys them both. 
JULIA All right. 
LARRY So what's the argument? 
JULIA (cold) No argument. 
LARRY Oh Christ.  Julia ... 
JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then starts to climb. 
LARRY (exasperated, to himself) Shit. 
8    INT.   LANDING   DAY 
JULIA climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed feeling.  She's sick of LARRY; his enthusiasm depresses her, his compromises anger her.  What's between them is stale, like this house. 
9    INT.    TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
The door opens a fraction. 
10   INT.   KITCHEN    DAY 
LARRY has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence, now rotted and fungal.  It smells, to judge the expression on his face.  It also puzzles him. Then, from above: 
JULIA Larry! 
He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs. 
Larry! 
LARRY I hear you. 
He starts up the stairs. 
11   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY 
LARRY reaches the top of the stairs. 
LARRY Where are you? 
JULIA (out of sight) In here. 
LARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor. JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then. 
JULIA Squatters? 
LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets. Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs. LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked Chinese girl. 
LARRY Frank. 
At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name. 
KIRSTY I said: I found a room. 
We begin to draw back from KIRSTY now, as she continues to speak to her father.  She's sitting on a battered chair by the door.  The room she's in is cramped and dirty. From outside, the sound of trains going by. 
LARRY (V.0.) I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile? 
KIRSTY (pained) No Dad. 
LARRY (V.0.) You'd like the house. 
KIRSTY YOU'D like my room. 
LARRY (V.0.) Do you want me to come over? 
KIRSTY (hastily) No, no.  Not just yet.  It needs ... er ... some work. 
That it does.  The place, now we've got a good view of it, is a total dump. 
LARRY (V.0.) Well I want you to see the house. 
KIRSTY I'm not going to change my mind, Dad. 
As she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture, tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts collaged onto it, down.  She succeeds.  Beneath there's a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there to conceal.  Plaster falls from it. 
KIRSTY (mouths the word) Great. 
LARRY (V.0.) Well come over, will you? See the place? 
KIRSTY Maybe tomorrow.  I got to go look for a job. 
LARRY (V.0.) O.K. Honey. Well you take care. I love you. 
KIRSTY I love you too. 
She puts the receiver down.  As she does so the small table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses.  She covers her face with her hand. 
22   INT.   HALLWAY OF LODOVICO STREET    DAY 
JULIA is three steps from the bottom of the stairs. 
LARRY Well? 
JULIA (resigned) Why not? 
LARRY (smiles; he's pleased) We'll move in Sunday. 
23   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY 
A church bell rings.  Off-screen, we hear voices: two men are attempting to move a bed into the house with LARRY masterminding the manoeuvres.  We HEAR their efforts, but we don't yet see them.  Our interest is in JULIA, who is unpacking a tea-chest in a room which is still full of draped furniture. 
1ST MAN (O.S.) We're not going to get it in. 
2ND MAN (O.S.) Tip it!  Tip it! 
LARRY (O.S.) Wait!  Wait!  Watch the fucking paint work. 
1ST MAN (O.S.) Look, do you want the bed in or not? 
LARRY (0.S.) Just take it slowly. 
1ST MAN (O.S.) Oh, sod you. 
2ND MAN (O.S.) Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says. 
LARRY (O.S.) It'll go in. 
1ST MAN Famous last fucking words. 
JULIA's face through this has been almost devoid of expression.  She's holding so many feelings inside; deep inside.  Now she moves from one box to another, and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric-a-brac. She picks it up and goes through into the hallway. 
The bell continues to ring. 
24   INT.   HALLWAY    DAY 
The three sweating men have the bed wedged in the door. 
LARRY (not seeing Julia) Alright, let's give it another try. 
2ND MAN (sees Julia) Do you really need this bed, lady? 
JULIA But you said - 
FRANK I don't want to see the dress. 
JULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front of her.  She stares at FRANK. 
FRANK You know what I want. 
Still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall. She stares though, and there's an invitation in her eyes. 
FRANK I want you. 
Now we 
CUT TO 
FRANK.  He is not so beraggled as in the first scene, but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat to his face.  Standing half in shadow he looks almost dangerous. 
Now JULIA lets the dress drop, putting it on the bed behind her. 
FRANK That's better 
FRANK steps towards her. 
JULIA What about Larry - 
FRANK Forget him. 
FRANK takes hold of her.  She doesn't resist him, though there is barely disguised fear on her face. He puts his hand inside her blouse. 
42   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
In extreme CLOSE UP, JULIA blinks into the light through the window, as LARRY's voice from downstairs calls her from her reverie. 
LARRY Slowly, will you?  Slowly! 
Again, a white-CUT, from which emerges: 
43   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY 
The two are naked on the bed, both sweating now. Beneath them, the wedding dress, crushed under their weight. 
Their love-making is not straight-forward: there is an element of erotic perversity in the way FRANK licks at her face, almost like an animal, his hold on her too tight to be loving.  The sequence escalates into a series of strange details from their locked bodies.  Nails digging into palms; sweat rivulets running down their torsoes.  And once in a while we see their faces.  JULIA watching FRANK, mesmerized and amused by his intensity; FRANK almost pained by his desire to push the experience TO THE LIMIT.  Their passion is rendered stranger still by the way the light through the window falls on their bodies, making striped creatures of them. 
At last, as their urgency increases, we move up until we're looking directly down on the bed. From here it is JULIA's face we can see, and the ecstasy of the moment has seized her.  Her arms are flung up over her head; her eyes are closed as she murmurs: 
JULIA Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God. 
The scene whites out. 
44   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
JULIA is still staring into the light.  She sobs, very quietly. 
JULIA (a whisper) Oh Frank ... 
45   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY 
Downstairs, LARRY and the men have moved the bed across the hall to the bottom of the stairs. 
All three are weary now, and getting careless. 
As they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead for LARRY, whose hand is moving closer and closer to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the bannister. 
LARRY (to Movers) Will you take the weight while I take a step up? 
He backs towards the stairs - and the nail. 
Damn it, will you take the - 
The side of his hand is impaled bythe nail.  He cries out.  The weight of the bed, which he cannot relinquish, drives the nail deeper, and gouges a long cut from the ball of his thumb to his wrist.  Blood pours out. 
LARRY Christ! 
1ST MAN What's the problem? 
LARRY My fucking hand! 
He drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand from the nail upon which he's injured himself.  He lifts his hand, from which blood is pouring. 
54   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT 
The sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here; it's barely audible.  But there is another sound, a shifting sound in the corner of the room. 
She reaches for the light switch, and turns it on. The bulb's been broken however.  She stares around the room, trying to make sense of the shadows. 
Nervously, she approaches the wall, on which four streaks of light from the window fall.  Now she looks towards the window and realizes that the newspaper has been torn, as if by four fingers.  Her breath catches.  Suddenly, she's afraid. 
She stands absolutely still, eyes wide in the gloom. 
JULIA Who's there? 
On the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows. 
JULIA almost retreats, but something keeps her staring into the murk, as SOMETHING - the remnants of a human form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh, raises its head.  It's squatting against the wall, unable to lift itself into a standing position.  Its eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger. This, though he's unrecognizable, is FRANK. 
FRANK (a pained whisper) Julia. 
JULIA Oh my God. 
FRANK Don't look at me. 
JULIA Who are you? 
FRANK I said: don't look. 
She looks away. 
Help me. 
JULIA Tell me who you are. 
FRANK Frank. 
JULIA's face registers horror and disbelief. 
JULIA No.  God no. 
FRANK Believe me.  It's me.  It's really me. 
JULIA What happened to you? 
FRANK His blood ... on the floor ... It brought me back. 
JULIA Back from where? 
FRANK Just help, will you?  Please God, help me - 
From downstairs, dimly, laughter. 
55   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT 
LARRY has just told another story.  General drunken laughter.  KIRSTY stands up. 
STEVE You're not going? 
KIRSTY Just upstairs. 
She staggers a little bit. 
STEVE Need any help? 
KIRSTY I AM house-trained. 
Further hysteria. 
STEVE (covered in embarrass- ment) No ... I meant ... 
LARRY It's round on the left - 
KIRSTY I know. 
She steps out into the hallway. 
56   INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT 
She starts up the stairs.  She smiles to herself, thinking of STEVE. 
57   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT 
KIRSTY Yeah, there's room.  And there's Julia. 
STEVE I see. 
KIRSTY She's so damn ... English. 
STEVE Meaning what? 
KIRSTY Oh, I don't know.  Up-tight. Frigid. 
STEVE stops walking. 
STEVE I beg your pardon? 
KIRSTY (lightly) There ya go. (imitates his tone) I beg your pardon? 
STEVE We're not all frigid. 
KIRSTY has turned to look at him.  Both of them are aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on their faces as they speak. 
KIRSTY Oh no? 
STEVE Oh no. 
KIRSTY It's not what I heard. 
STEVE (moves closer to her) Well you've just been talking to the wrong people. 
He kisses her, with considerable feeling. 
62   INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT 
LARRY snores loudly.  JULIA lies beside him, wide awake, staring at the ceiling. 
LARRY turns over, muttering to himself. 
63   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT 
The door opens.  JULIA is standing there, in her night-gown. 
FRANK raises his wretched head. 
FRANK Well? 
JULIA stares at the thing moving in the shadow. 
JULIA Yes. 
64   EXT.   NUMBER 55    DAY 
The door opens.   JULIA steps out of the house, and starts towards the street.      As she does so, she glances round. 
65   EXT.   WINDOW OF TORTURE ROOM    DAY 
We approach the window, knowing that FRANK watches behind it. 
66   EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY 
JULIA heads off down the street. 
67   INT.   PIZZA RESTAURANT   DAY 
The din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables full, and everyone hungry.   In the middle of the melee, KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things at once.  Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining. She's doing her best, but losing the battle.  She serves a table with their food, and then starts back to pick up another order.   As she does so she's harangued from every side. 
1ST CUSTOMER Excuse me, Miss - 
2ND CUSTOMER I'd like some more lager. 
1ST CUSTOMER Miss! 
KIRSTY In a moment. 
2ND CUSTOMER Did you hear me? 
KIRSTY starts back to the counter.  As she does so somebody else's voice cuts through the din. 
STEVE Hey, sex-bomb - 
She wheels round. 
PRUDHOE You know it's not often I ... you know ... 
JULIA There's a first time for every- thing. 
PRUDHOE I suppose that's right. 
JULIA You want something to drink? 
PRUDHOE I'm already way over my usual limit.  You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years. 
He approaches her:  his gestures made slightly clumsy by the alcohol he's drunk.  He kisses her.  She presses him off her. 
PRUDHOE Oh, come on. (he takes hold of her breast) It's what you brought me here for, isn't it? 
JULIA Yes.  I just think we'd be better off upstairs. 
PRUDHOE Oh.  Oh fine. 
72   INT.  TORTUPE ROOM    DAY 
FRANK's view, from the corner of the room.  We hear the sound of JULIA and PRUDHOE's approach up the stairs. 
PRUDHOE This your place? 
JULIA Let's not talk about it. 
PRUDHOE No personal details, right? 
JULIA Right. 
PRUDHOE You know, you're incredible - 
JULIA opens the door. 
JULIA Come on in.  Make yourself at home. 
She steps inside.  PRUDHOE does as he's instructed.  He stares at the bare floor, as JULIA closes the door behind him. 
PRUDHOE There's no bed. 
JULIA That's right. 
PRUDHOE Huh? 
JULIA I prefer the floor. 
PRUDHOE First time for everything, right? 
JULIA Right. 
JULIA moves towards him 
JULIA Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm. 
PRUDHOE Yeah, why don't I? 
She slips the knot of his tie.  We can hear her pulse on the soundtrack.  She glances over PRUDHOE's shoulder.  He follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the cheek. 
PRUDHOE (takes over his undressing) Why don't you do the same? 
JULIA Maybe I will. 
PRUDHOE, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant. 
We watch from FRANK'S P.O.V. as he drops his underwear. He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton. We move back into a tighter shot. 
PRUDHOE (voice slightly slurred) You know, you're very beautiful. 
JULIA Am I? 
PRUDHOE You know you are.  Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on. 
JULIA smiles. 
PRUDHOE stops unbuttoning his shirt. 
PRUDHOE Oh Christ. 
JULIA What's wrong? 
Come here, damn you.  I want to touch you ... 
Still she doesn't move. 
FRANK (more softly) Come to Daddy.  I only want to touch ... 
She takes a step towards his outstretched arm.   His fingers touch her face.  She steels herself against them. Now, he starts to trace the line of her jaw, stroking her.  Now her lips, caressingly. 
Suddenly, a sound from downstairs.  The front door is opened. 
LARRY (from below) Sweetheart? 
JULIA withdraws from his touch 
LARRY (from below) Where are you? 
77   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY 
Shot from the stairs of LARRY.  He looks up the flight. He takes a step towards the stairs. 
78   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY 
JULIA takes a step backwards, her foot hitting PRUDHOE's corpse. 
79   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY 
LARRY is still at the bottom of the stairs. 
LARRY Are you there? 
For a moment it looks as though he's going to climb the stairs, then he thinks better of it, and goes through to the back of the house. 
80   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY 
JULIA has wrapped the corpse of PRUDHOE up in its clothes and is now lifting it.  The body is lighter now, having been drained of nourishment.  Its head lolls back and its dentures drop out, hitting the floor loudly.  She freezes. No sound from below.  She backs out of the room with her burden. 
FRANK's arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at them. 
FRANK Who's a pretty boy then? 
Soft laughter from the darkness. 
81   INT.  JUNK ROOM    DAY 
JULIA pushes the door of the Junk Room, which is on the upper landing, open.  Inside, a chaos of tea-chests and bric-a-brac.  She lays the body down. 
82   INT.  KITCHEN    DAY 
LARRY has come through to look for JULIA.  He hears a noise above.   He looks up. 
LARRY (quietly) Julia? 
He leaves the kitchen. 
83   INT.  HALLWAY     DAY 
Again, LARRY Steps into the hallway, and gazes up the stairs. 
LARRY Are you there? 
He starts up. 
84   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY 
JULIA steps into the bathroom, and then locks the door behind her. 
LARRY ascends to the top of the stairs. 
LARRY Julia? 
JULIA (from bathroom) I'm here. 
LARRY (at the door) Sweetheart ... I've been calling you. 
He tries the door.  It's locked. 
Are you all right? 
JULIA Just feeling a bit sick. 
The thunder carries over to a dream. 
We are in the Dining Room of Number 55, except that everything is once more shrounded in sheets. 
We CUT to KIRSTY, moving through the room, her face pale, her hair glued to her forehead with sweat. 
Somewhere, a bell is ringing.  Flies buzz.  On the dinner table, a form is covered in a sheet.  It's clear that the shape is human.  She reaches the table, and looks at the body. 
Suddenly, blood begins to seep through the shroud, beginning at the head - eyes and mouth - then spreading across the body.  There are sobs beneath the shroud. 
She reaches for it, to snatch it off the body. 
The blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet. 
She pulls. 
We glimpse only a moment of what'd beneath: a naked body, scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot. 
She screams. 
Her scream becomes louder, as we 
CUT TO 
88   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT 
STEVE sits bolt upright in bed, while KIRSTY yells. 
The sheet is snatched off him.  He looks across the room to see KIRSTY at the end of the bed, with the sheet in her hand. 
STEVE What are you doing? 
KIRSTY's eyes are still closed. 
Kirsty! 
Her eyes open.  She looks down at the sheet she's snatched from the bed, and drops it in horror. 
STEVE Christ.  What was that about? 
KIRSTY, weak with fear, just shakes her head. 
89   INT.  HALLWAY, NUMBER 55    NIGHT 
A phone is ringing. 
LARRY crosses the hallway, bleary-eyed, and disappears from sight.   The phone is picked up. 
LARRY'S VOICE Hello? 
90   INT.  BEDROOM    NIGHT 
JULIA lies in bed, the pillow empty beside her.   She's wide awake, staring at the ceiling.   Downstairs, the murmur of LARRY's voice. 
91   INT.  TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT 
FRANK stands in the corner of the room, breathing softly in the shadows. 
92   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM   NIGHT 
LARRY is on the phone. 
LARRY I'm O.K., honey.  It's all right ... 
93   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT 
KIRSTY is on the phone.   STEVE sits up in bed, having reclaimed the sheet. 
KIRSTY I just wanted to be sure you were O.K. 
94   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM    NIGHT 
LARRY Never better.  You sleep well. 
KIRSTY (on phone) Yeah. 
LARRY I love you, honey. 
KIRSTY (on phone) I love you too. 
JULIA So they cheated you 
In the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving.  It's difficult to be sure what the forms signify.  Is this torture, or some elaborate pleasure? 
FRANK Oh no.  They kept to their bargain.  They gave me experiences I'd never forget ... 
The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and they are APPALLING.  Flesh torn open; blood running across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines. 
FRANK But their pleasure was my pain. 
His voice has begun to tremble.  The images in the box are more horrific by the moment.  And flowing between them, highly distorted, the CENOBITE's faces, and that of FRANK, screaming and screaming. 
FRANK Terrible pain.  Appalling ... 
He can't speak for a moment.  After a pause, he goes on, his voice heavy. 
My body was forfeit.  But my spirit ... they left that here. In the boards.  In the walls. Watching the world, but never able to touch it ... 
JULIA And the blood let you out? 
FRANK There are ways to resurrection. Blood's one of them.  I won't let them take me back, Julia. 
JULIA looks at the horrors in the box, and understands his desire. 
FRANK I want to be whole, and then get out - 
He lifts the box up. 
I won't let them take me. 
JULIA You won't have to.  We'll be gone.  Somewhere they'll never find us. 
There's a rumble of thunder. 
Not in the whole wide world. 
102  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT 
More thunder, and the sound of heavy rain against the windows. 
The television is on.  LARRY and JULIA are sitting on the couch.  LARRY is watching a boxing match.  He has consumed several beers:  the cans are beside his feet; and there's another in his hand. 
JULIA reads a magazine, glancing up at the screen to see the match getting more heated.  Blood is starting to flow. 
LARRY Is this upsetting you? 
JULIA I've seen worse. 
LARRY looks at her. 
LARRY Are you all right? 
JULIA Fine. 
LARRY Only I'll turn it off - 
There's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen, as one of the boxers hits the canvas.  LARRY turns his attention back to the match. 
COMMENTATOR And he's down!  He's down! 
The thunder rolls on. 
103  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT 
The lightning finds its way through the holes in the newspaper.  FRANK is watching through the window, his face occasionally washed with light.  His hand, on the window frame, taps out the same tattoo he's tapped out before.  He turns away from the window, and his foot catches the box.  It rolls across the floor. 
104  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT 
The boxing match is heating up again. 
COMMENTATOR - and now he's in trouble, he's really in trouble - 
LARRY What was that? 
JULIA looks up from her magazine. 
JULIA Thunder. 
The violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen faces burst beneath punches. 
He kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss. 
Let's go  down.  I'll make it better. 
He kisses her again. 
108  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT 
A shadow moves across the screen as the door opens, and LARRY puts on the light. He has hold of JULIA's hand.  He leads her inside.  She sits on the bed, illuminated by the light from the landing, and the occasional flicker from the window.  LARRY kneels between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes closed. 
JULIA glances into the shadows of the room.  She senses FRANK's presence. 
LARRY ... oh babe ... 
He starts to unbutton her dress.  She's distracted by her suspicions; he has his hands against her almost before she realizes what's happening. 
We have her P.O.V. as she looks around the room.  The dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the window.  Does something move in the shadows? 
A flash of lightning.  No.  There's nothing. 
LARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him, kissing her.  This is not the intense, slightly dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK, but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange.  LARRY is so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he doesn't register the fact that JULIA's attention is elsewhere. 
Now we have a P.O.V. from the far side of the room, of the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder and LARRY's murmured words of seduction, which we can barely make out. 
LARRY ...I love you, honey ... let me ... oh God ... I love you ... 
Neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace of eroticism from the scene. 
A CLOSE UP of JULIA's head, laid on the pillow, shows just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works, eyes closed.  JULIA looks down the length of her husband's body.  The door of the wardrobe swings open.  FRANK is watching.  She registers horror.  LARRY is oblivious to all of this, of course. 
We have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making. Now he steps out of the wardrobe.  JULIA makes a moan of horror, which LARRY takes as enthusiasm. 
LARRY Oh baby ... I love you ... 
From JULIA'S P.O.V., we see the form of FRANK shamble towards the lovers. 
From FRANK'S P.O.V. we see the lovers on the bed, LARRY's back vunerable.  JULIA seems to realize what he intends. 
JULIA ... no ... 
LARRY barely hears her. 
FRANK is at the very end of the bed now, and JULIA becomes highly agitated. 
JULIA No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE. No. 
LARRY stops his love-making. 
LARRY (looks at her) Huh? 
JULIA Please ... 
LARRY What's wrong with you? 
JULIA (almost sobbing) Please.  I can't bear it ... 
LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He disengages his arms from around her. 
JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats. 
LARRY rolls off JULIA. 
The wardrobe door closes.  Click. 
LARRY I don't understand you.  One moment you're all over me, the next it's:  Don't touch me. 
He sits on the edge of the bed. 
I just don't understand. 
He gets up and leaves the bedroom.  JULIA remains where she is.  We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it, from FRANK's end of the room.  She stares at the wardrobe.  Through the crack of the open door, FRANK stares back.  A flicker of lightning illuminates his face; his skeletal grin. 
Softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof, we hear laughter. 
109  INT.   A SMALL RESTAURANT   EVENING 
KIRSTY and LARRY are sitting eating a meal together, in an intimate restaurant.  LARRY has little appetite, to judge by his plate.  He looks as if he hasn't slept for several nights.  KIRSTY, by contrast, is sparkling 
LARRY ... maybe we should never have come back. 
From the top of the stairs we watch JULIA lead SYKES upstairs. 
SYKES I get lonely sometimes. 
JULIA Everybody does. 
117  EXT.   STREET   DAY 
KIRSTY starts towards the house. 
118  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
In the corner of the room FRANK stands, tapping out the rhythm with his fingers.  It's 'Colonel Bogey', and now he hums it too.  Outside the door, a footfall. 
JULIA Come in. 
The humming stops. 
JULIA opens the door. 
119  EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE   DAY 
KIRSTY starts down the path. 
120  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
SYKES is looking at JULIA. 
SYKES What is this?  A game? 
FRANK moves in the corner.  SYKES catches the motion from the corner of his eye.  He turns. 
What ? 
FRANK steps from the shadows. 
Jesus Christ. 
JULIA hits him with the hammer. 
121  EXT.   DOORSTEP   DAY 
KIRSTY hears SYKES scream.  She freezes.  Then steps back from the doorstep and looks up at the house. 
122  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
In the Room, pandemonium.  SYKES, blood pouring down his face, flails out at JULIA.  The hammer flies from her hand.  He lunges for the door, but she manages to kick it closed. 
SYKES Christ help me! 
123  EXT.   HOUSE   DAY 
KIRSTY makes her way around the back of the house. 
124  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
SYKES has taken hold of JULIA, and is using her as a shield against FRANK, whos is bearing down upon him.  For the first time we see FRANK's true colours where JULIA's concerned - 
SYKES (to Frank) Don't! 
Casually, FRANK throws JULIA aside.  She falls, sobbing. 
FRANK descends on SYKES. 
SYKES No! 
125  INT.   KITCHEN   DAY 
SYKES' scream covers the sound of KIRSTY forcing the back door open.  She steps inside. 
126  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
FRANK has SYKES face to the wall.  SYKES is sobbing now. The room is covered in blood. 
FRANK (to Julia) Get out of here. 
She picks herself up. 
SYKES (to Julia) Please ... don't let him kill me ... please ... 
FRANK has closed in on her by now.  He Lakes hold of her face. 
FRANK I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you?  Beautiful. 
KIRSTY This isn't happening. 
FRANK I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.  But why kid yourself?  Some things have to be endured.  Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ... 
As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his abdomen, and PULLS.  There's a flow of fluids. FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams. She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin. 
She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over it.  She falls, heavily. 
Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her. 
On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her. She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now. Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more. 
She raises the box to retaliate.   FRANK sees what she's holding.  His  attack stops. 
FRANK Give that to me. 
She dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool. 
KIRSTY (breathless) No. 
FRANK One last time.  Give me the box. 
KIRSTY You want it? 
The monster's eyes glitter. 
Fucking have it! 
She throws the box.  It sails past FRANK and smashes through the window. 
FRANK NO! 
He goes to the window.  She takes her chance.  She's out of the door in a moment. 
NO! 
136  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY 
KIRSTY propels herself out of the Room, and down the stairs, while FRANK vents his anger above her. 
137  INT.   HALLWAY   DAY 
She flings open the front door, and pitches herself - bleeding and bruised - into the daylight beyond. 
138  EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY 
As she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box at her feet, in a litter of broken glass.  She picks it up, and continues to run. 
139  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY 
A series of shots from KIRSTY'S P.O.V., as she staggers along the street.  The sound-track whines; the image threatens to be eclipsed by darkness.  People stare at her as she runs.  A child points. 
Finally, the CAMERA slows.  She stands still. 
A voice, off camera: 
VOICE (O.S.) Are you all right? 
The CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of the speaker.  A WOMAN comes into view. 
WOMAN Do you need any help? 
As she speaks, the picture fades to white. 
140  KIRSTY'S DREAM  (PART TWO) 
The whiteness continues to fill the screen.  Distant, incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood in the inner ear. 
Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as sexual or horrific imagery.  With the darkness, soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous dialogue. 
FRANK Come to Daddy. 
KIRSTY This isn't happening. 
FRANK Some things have to be endured ... 
FRANK There's very little I can do about it. 
JULIA Maybe we should just leave - 
FRANK Like this?  Look at me! LIKE THIS? 
JULIA Well we can't just stay here - 
FRANK I need a skin.  Then we leave - 
143  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT 
KIRSTY is sitting up in bed.  On the bedside table, a telephone.  She is now thoroughly engrossed in the problems of the box.  Her fingers speed over the surfaces, looking for some way in, testing its strength. 
Suddenly, a click.  Her face lights up with pleasure, as she slides a part of the box open, revealing new intricacies.  And to accompany the revelation, a tinkling tune. 
She smiles.  It's a musical box. 
The light beside the bed flickers, but she doesn't notice. 
The door opens.  It's the NURSE. 
NURSE Comfortable? 
KIRSTY (smiles) Sure. 
NURSE Any luck with your father? 
KIRSTY (shakes her head) He's probably got a meeting. I called a friend of mine.  He's coming; is that O.K.? 
NURSE Of course. 
The NURSE exits.  As she does go the light flickers again. The box clicks.  A new facet is revealed ... 
KIRSTY smiles. 
144  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT 
The front door closes. 
LARRY (inside) Julia? 
145  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT 
LARRY stands in the hall.  JULIA comes down the stairs. She looks pale; even ill. 
LARRY What's wrong? 
JULIA I don't know where to begin ... 
LARRY What are you talking about? 
JULIA It's better you see for your- self - 
She turns and starts up the stairs.  He follows. 
146  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT 
KIRSTY has opened more of the box.  The tune is more complex now. 
Somewhere a bell has started to ring.  Now, she works the final mechanism of the box.  The bedside light flickers and goes out. 
The bell rings.  Light pours out of the box.  She drops it, shocked. 
The bedside light comes on again. 
She looks up. 
In the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow doorway has simply opened in the wall. 
Leaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to the gap.  As she approaches she hears the distant, rhythmical sob of a baby.  She stands at the doorway. 
147  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT 
We look back at her, a diminutive figure framed against a shot of light, from way, way down the corridor. 
148  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT 
The sobbing goes on.  KIRSTY stares down the corridor - which is lit brightly in some places, and is absolutely dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down it or not. 
KIRSTY This isn't for real. 
CENOBITE You solved the box.  We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures. 
The chattering CENOBITE steps towards her. 
KIRSTY Don't touch me! 
The door opens.  It's STEVE. 
KIRSTY's face floods with relief.  STEVE does not register the CENOBITES' presence however. 
KIRSTY Steve.  Thank God you came. 
STEVE What happened to you? 
He steps between the CENOBITES. 
KIRSTY These THINGS ... they want to take me - 
STEVE What things? 
CENOBITE (to Kirsty) He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty.  And you to us. 
KIRSTY No! 
STEVE What's wrong? 
KIRSTY Don't let them take me, Steve - 
STEVE I won't let anybody take you. 
He starts to walk towards her, but the creature in the dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts the hook to STEVE's neck.   STEVE's hand moves to the place; he makes a small sound of pain. The CENOBITE takes off its glasses, to see its trick better.  The eyes beneath are sewn shut.  It pulls a little more on the hook. STEVE winces. 
FEMALE CENOBITE If he takes another step, we open his throat. 
KIRSTY (to Steve) Please go, Steve. 
STEVE What? 
KIRSTY Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll look after me - 
STEVE (protesting) What did I say? 
KIRSTY Will you GO, damn you? 
Mystified, STEVE retreats a step. 
STEVE I'll come back later, huh? 
KIRSTY Sure.  Why not? 
Still puzzled, STEVE crosses to the door. 
STEVE 'Bye. 
KIRSTY 'Bye. 
FEMALE CENOBITE Good. 
CENOBITE It's time we were away. 
KIRSTY (almost crying) Let me alone, will you? 
CENOBITE No tears please.  It's a waste of good suffering. 
The chatterer comes for her.  As it does so desperation brings a plan to KIRSTY's head. 
KIRSTY Wait! 
He stops. 
CENOBITE No time for argument. 
KIRSTY You did this before, right? 
CENOBITE Many times. 
KIRSTY To a man called Frank Cotton? 
LARRY Come to Daddy. 
Her gaze moves up to JULIA, who is on the stairs. 
JULIA No, damn you - 
169  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT 
KIRSTY (mouths) Oh my God. 
Everything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack. 
LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into view. 
JULIA Frank! 
KIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her.  The lights in the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out. 
KIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door.  She's trapped. His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the lining. 
Suddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair. 
FRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow.  JULIA shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as it's buried to the hilt in her side. 
KIRSTY slips from between them.  JULIA collapses into FRANK's arms.   He holds her up. 
KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY.  JULIA falls back against the wall, dying.  KIRSTY retreats to the bottom of the stairs.  FRANK follows. 
FRANK You're not leaving now - 
As he follows, JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve. 
KIRSTY flees the only route she can, upstairs.  The house is creaking in every board and rafter now. 
FRANK turns on JULIA, trapping her against the wall., 
JULIA Help me, Frank. For God's sake. 
He puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards her.  At the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left. 
JULIA No, Frank - 
From the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon her. 
Then she looks away, and runs up the stairs. 
When we look back JULIA is withering in FRANK's arms. 
170  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT 
The landing is smoky.  The lights have taken on a yellowish tinge.  The air is full of moans. 
KIRSTY is desperate for a hiding place.   She tries one of the doors, but it's locked.   She opens another, and the din of birds' wings gets louder. 
171  INT.  BIRD ROOM    NIGHT 
A P.O.V. shot, lunging towards KIRSTY in the doorway. She slams the door in the face of whatever's coming for her. 
172  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT 
FRANK hears the door slam.   He drops JULIA to the ground.  She's dead, her flesh rotting on her face. 
FRANK starts to climb the stairs, his eyes burning with hunger. 
173  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT 
KIRSTY is cornered.   From below, FRANK's voice. 
FRANK Where are you, beautiful? 
KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs, as FRANK's shadow is thrown up on the wall below. 
174  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT 
KIRSTY is faced with a choice.  The Torture Room door is open, but the skinned body is in there, so instead she heads for the Junk Room, and opens the door. 
175  INT.  JUNK ROOM    NIGHT 
Moonlight falls through the window, illuminating a chaos of furniture and boxes.  She crosses to the window, and tries to get it open.   It won't budge. 
FRANK What's going on? 
Light begins to pour through the walls of the room. 
No. 
He starts towards the door.  But he's too late.  The CENOBITES are standing in his way.  He backs off from them. 
CENOBITE Frank - 
KIRSTY (to Cenobite) What took you so long? 
FEMALE CENOBITE We had to hear it from his own lips - 
FRANK turns on KIRSTY. 
FRANK You set me up!   You bitch. You set me up! 
The pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate, and the CENOBITES move through it towards FRANK. 
CENOBITE (to Kirsty) This isn't for your eyes. 
KIRSTY crosses towards the door.  As she reaches for the handle she hears FRANK roar behind her.  She turns.   He breaks between the CENOBITES, knife in hand, but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead. 
They have their hooks in him, we see.  In his arms and legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and temples.   Hooks attached to countless chains, which arrest his progress.  They plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leader of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand. 
CENOBITE (to Kirsty) Out! 
She turns back to the door and opens it.  FRANK is hauled back towards the centre of the room. 
FRANK Bitch! 
The house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as KIRSTY steps onto the landing. 
180  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT 
Behind her, FRANK howls. 
She looks back. 
They have him IN EXTREMIS,    his body spread-eagled; hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh.  He fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing.  They pull the chains tighter. 
181  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT 
A close up of FRANK's face.   He suddenly stops fighting. He raises his head, his eyes staring up at KIRSTY from beneath a bleeding, sweating brow.  He flicks his tongue over his bloodied lips. 
Then - 
- he comes apart. 
182  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT 
The door slams as FRANK's body is torn apart in a welter of blood and flesh fragments. 
Something heavy thuds against the door. 
KIRSTY turns and starts down the stairs. 
183  INT.  STAIRS    NIGHT 
As she reaches the place where STEVE is half-sitting, half- lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations are about to give way.  STEVE's nose is bleeding, and his face is bruised, but he's conscious. 
KIRSTY We have to get out of here. They'll kill us for the fun of it. 
STEVE staggers to his feet.   KIRSTY picks up the box, which is on the lower landing. As she picks it up, the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows. 
FEMALE CENOBITE Don't leave us yet - 
KIRSTY starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands. 
FEMALE CENOBITE We've got such sights to show you - 
KIRSTY manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back into place. 
FEMALE CENOBITE ... don't ... 
Her voice becomes a howl, and she's sucked away into darkness. 
STEVE (behind Kirsty) Jesus Christ.

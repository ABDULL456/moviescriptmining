The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird. Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the plastic pouch, and writes... "ENGLISH CLASS... DAY ONE." 
CHARLIE (V.O.) My last class of the day is advanced English, and I'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school... 
A SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him. 
SMART ASS FRESHMAN (whispers) Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot. 
The kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist. 
BILL Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English. This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz? 
All hands go up.   Except Charlie's.   Bill paces the rows. 
BILL (CONT'D) I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book. Anyone? 
As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats. 
BILL (CONT'D) He's British. He also invented the serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence, the term cliffhanger. Anybody? 
FRESHMAN GIRL Shakespeare. 
BILL That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else? (off their silence) The author was... 
Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has already written... Charles Dickens. 
BILL (CONT'D) ... Charles Dickens. However, if you and I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can you imagine that? We would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office. And that's where we get the term... anyone? 
KIDS (O.S.) "Office Depot!" "Office Supplies!" 
Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that Bill is staring at him. Waiting for him to raise his hand. 
BILL I'll give you a free "A" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right. 
Charlie looks down.   He's not going to answer. 
BILL (CONT'D) Box office. 
The kids groan. They should have known.     Charlie smiles to himself. He's going to like this class. 
11   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - LATER                                      11 
The bell rings. The students chatter their way out of class. The last to leave is Charlie. 
BILL You should learn to participate. 
Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board. 
BILL (CONT'D) Why didn't you raise your hand? (off Charlie's shrug) They call you teacher's pet? Freak? (off Charlie's nod) I used to get spaz. I mean, come on, spaz? 
Charlie smiles.   Bill takes a moment.   Then... 
BILL (CONT'D) So, I heard you had a tough time last year. But they say if you make one friend on your first day, you're doing okay. 
CHARLIE Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing. 
BILL Yeah.   I could see that. 
CHARLIE Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay. 
Bill nods and watches Charlie exit.   He gets swallowed up by the hallway as the bell rings. 
12   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     12 
Charlie looks through the thick office glass. He sees Patrick use his charms on MRS. SMALL, (58) the Principal. 
PATRICK (to Mrs. Small) I would happily not take shop... 
Out of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book. 
SENIOR BULLY Hey, Freshman Toad. 
The bully rips the cover. He throws it on the ground as his friends laugh and disappear down the hall. Charlie walks up and picks up his book. 
The reading is done. Charlie proudly puts To Kill a Mockingbird on his newly dubbed "Shelf of Fame." 
19   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                   19 
The songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to day life over the next few weeks. Charlie exits his English class. FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by... 
SMART ASS FRESHMAN Did you already do the term paper on To 
Silence. They grab and drag him into the boy's room.     We hear the toilet flush for the swirly. 
20   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                       20 
Charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin. He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with RC cola. 
21   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                              21 
Charlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions on TV. He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him. 
22   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     22 
Charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria. Not giving up. Looking for somewhere to sit. 
CUT TO: 
23   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     23 
Charlie sits by himself in the corner. He looks around the cafeteria, wanting to break in. Not knowing how. After a moment, he returns to his book. The song ends. 
24   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT              24 
Friday Night Football in Western, PA. Charlie buys his Coke and nachos and wanders to the bleachers. He sits alone, trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students. When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears... 
PATRICK Come on Devils! Woooooo! 
Charlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off.    TWIN SENIOR GIRLS pass him, taunting. 
TWIN SENIOR GIRLS Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing. 
PATRICK Suck it, virginity pledges! 
Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly. After driving himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches. 
CHARLIE Hey... Patrick. 
PATRICK Hey! You're in my shop class, right? How's your clock coming? 
CHARLIE My dad's building it. 
PATRICK Yeah. Mine looks like a boat. (off Charlie's awkward silence) You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends? 
CHARLIE No.   I'll sit if that's okay. 
Patrick motions for Charlie to sit.   Charlie sits.   Elated. 
PATRICK Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by the way. It's an endless nightmare. And these assholes actually think they're being original. 
Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field. Charlie dries his hands on his pants. So nervous. A 5 second silence that feels like a year. Think of something to say. Anything. 
CHARLIE So, uh... you like football? 
PATRICK Love it. 
CHARLIE Then, maybe you know my broth-- 
PATRICK Hey, Sam. 
Charlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's ever seen. SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every father nervous. She is alive, adventurous, and a world class flirt. Great attitude. Great taste. Great banter. 
SAM Question. Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting? 
PATRICK Yes, they call it the men's room. 
Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick. Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy. 
SAM You could write about us. 
PATRICK Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.      Make us solve crimes. 
Sam laughs.   Charlie smiles. 
CHARLIE You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? (off their laughs) What? 
SAM He's my step-brother. My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago. 
PATRICK But Sam's not bitter.     Make no mistake. 
SAM Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic.      I'm a bulim-ist. 
They laugh at their inside joke.    Charlie has no idea what's so funny. 
CHARLIE I'm sorry.     I don't know what that means. 
PATRICK She just really believes in bulimia. 
SAM (cracking up) I love bulimia. 
26   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      26 
Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck.    The music blares. 
PATRICK Thanks for paying, Charlie. 
CHARLIE (so eager) No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey... maybe I'll see you around in school? 
SAM (distracted - to Patrick) God, would you turn that down? You're going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie. 
PATRICK Bye, Charlie. 
CHARLIE Okay.   Bye. 
Charlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face. The happiness from one night of company. 
27   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      27 
Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news. He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement. 
28   INT. DOORWAY TO BASEMENT - NIGHT                                  28 
As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting. 
DEREK (O.S.) I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it. Please talk to me. 
CANDACE (O.S.) Maybe your mom and I should have a "drive us to our hair appointment" contest. Then, I could spend a Saturday with you. 
Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find... 
DEREK There's nothing I can do-- 
CANDACE Do you always want to be a mama's boy? 
DEREK I am not a mama's boy-- 
CANDACE Yes! You are! Every time I go to your house-- 
DEREK Shhh.   Shut u-- 
CANDACE -- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy needs you to stay at home because she can't drive herself." She's only 51. 
DEREK SHUT UP, CANDACE! 
29   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS                   29 
Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging. 
CANDACE And you just stand there like a little bitch dog. 
SNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him. 
SAM Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo. 
CHARLIE Are you sure it's okay that I come? 
SAM Of course. Just remember, Charlie... Bob's not paranoid. 
PATRICK "He's sensitive." 
Sam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so often that people can't tell the difference anymore. 
BOB Sam... that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease. Will you marry me? 
SAM Only if I have Patrick's blessing. 
BOB Patrick? 
PATRICK You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say "no" on that one, but nice try. Charlie? 
Patrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam. 
BOB Touché. 
35   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                              35 
PATRICK Charlie... this is a party. 
The music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed with kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a watermelon. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) This is what fun looks like. 
Patrick smiles when he spots two friends. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) You ready to meet some desperate women? 
MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together. Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary Elizabeth's "beta female." 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies. 
They shake hands and say their hellos. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) This is Charlie's first party ever. So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you. 
MARY ELIZABETH Patrick, you're such a dick. 
PATRICK Where the hell did you go? 
MARY ELIZABETH The dance was a little boring, don't you think? 
PATRICK You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone. 
MARY ELIZABETH Cry me a river. 
PATRICK How is it that you got meaner since 
MARY ELIZABETH Just lucky I guess. 
PATRICK I think you're doing something wrong. 
MARY ELIZABETH Or something very right. 
Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam calls out from the other side of the room. 
SAM (O.S.) Hey!    Look who's here! 
The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback, enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked. 
CHARLIE Is that Brad Hays? 
ALICE Yeah.    He comes here sometimes. 
CHARLIE But he's a popular kid. 
MARY ELIZABETH (offended) Then, what are we? 
CHARLIE Charlie.     Charlie.   Weird. 
Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost. He finds the door to the master bedroom and opens it. He sees Patrick and Brad Hays... kissing. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Woah. 
PATRICK Charlie? 
BRAD HAYS (nervous) Who is that kid? 
PATRICK Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine. Stay here. 
Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie. 
CHARLIE I didn't see anything. 
PATRICK I know you saw something, but it's okay. 
Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to know... wait, are you baked? 
CHARLIE "Like a cake." That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny. 
PATRICK Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret. 
CHARLIE Our little secret.     Agreed. 
PATRICK Thank you.     We'll talk later. 
CHARLIE I look forward to that big talk. 
Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door. 
39   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - NIGHT                                         39 
The party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth. 
CHARLIE Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one. 
Patrick walks downstairs.    Sam motions him over. 
SAM (barely audible whisper) I need to talk to you. Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself. I don't think he has any friends. 
Patrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd. 
PATRICK Everyone.     Raise your glasses to Charlie. 
Charlie looks up.   A little paranoid.     Everyone is staring. 
CHARLIE What did I do? 
PATRICK You didn't do anything. We just want to toast our new friend. (off his look) You see things. And you understand. You're a wallflower. 
Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants.     He looks around the room at the nods and friendly faces. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) What is it? What's wrong? 
CHARLIE 
PATRICK Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone... 
SAM & EVERYONE To Charlie. 
They all drink.    Sam approaches him.    A knowing smile. 
SAM Welcome to the island of misfit toys. 
Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
40   EXT./INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        40 
44   INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON                                         44 
The xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY! Halloween Issue! Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school. She also steals jeans from the mall. I don't know why because her family is rich, but I'm trying not to be judgemental. Especially since I know how they were all there for Patrick last year. Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened. 
Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life. 
[Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.] 
45   EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT                                    45 
Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer. Moments later, Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field. 
CHARLIE When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around. 
46   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                           46 
Patrick whispers while the gang studies their SAT books. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Then, Monday in school, Brad would say, "Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember a thing." This went on for 7 months. 
47   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING                   47 
Charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes. He turns to see Brad with his father and mother. Proper family. Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry. CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) saying his dad would kill him. And saying he was going to hell. 
48   INT. LIBRARY - DAY                                              48 
We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library. They reach the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they simply... PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him. 
Brad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying hard for her SAT's. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I think that I understand because I really like Sam. I asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties. I guess she had a reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like. 
49   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                   49 
We see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) So, I've been making her a mix tape so she will know how I feel. 
The two cassettes run. The song is just about to finish when... the side runs out of tape and snaps off. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Ah, shit! 
50   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 50 
The marquee announces it's time for the... 
51   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 51 
... Rocky Horror Picture Show! The ROCKY EMCEE, dressed as Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy. 
ROCKY EMCEE                           CROWD Gimme an R! Gimme an O!           R-O-C-K-Y!   Rocky!   Rocky! Gimme a C! Gimme a K! Gimme       Rocky! a Y! What's that spell!? 
The crowd cheers!   Charlie claps from the front row. 
52   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER                      52 
The movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly. Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in full drag is... Patrick. 
PATRICK Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same. 
Patrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing! Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Give yourself over to absolute pleasure. Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any measure. And sensual daydreams to treasure forever. Can't you just see it? Woah oh oh! 
Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick, Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt). 
53   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT                     53 
CHARLIE Yeah. 
ALICE Don't you write poetry, Craig? 
CRAIG No.     Poetry writes me.   You know? 
Charlie sighs. Craig's upbeat song begins to play. He dances over to Sam. Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam hug on Craig. 
56   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     56 
In a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers. Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall. 
57   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING                                    57 
The bell rings.    Charlie sets down his On the Road paper. 
BILL Wow.    That was fast.   You want another one? 
Charlie nods. Bill smiles and reaches into his desk. He hands Charlie a copy of A Separate Piece. Charlie takes the book and starts to walk out, but he turns back. 
CHARLIE Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something? 
BILL Yeah. 
CHARLIE Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date? 
BILL Are we talking about anyone specific? 
Charlie nods. Bill looks straight at him. Not preaching. Coming from a history of personal experience and pain. 
BILL (CONT'D) We accept the love we think we deserve. 
CHARLIE Can we make them know they deserve more? 
BILL We can try. 
Charlie smiles. 
58   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - MORNING                         58 
Charlie waits nervously at a booth. He sees Sam enter. He fixes his hair, then pretends to read his SAT PREP BOOK. 
SAM Hey, Charlie. 
CHARLIE Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.     You want to work on probabilities and statistics? 
Sam nods. They open their books, and a Christmas song begins. In a quick passage of time, we see them study next to Halloween decorations. Then, Thanksgiving. And finally, Christmas decorations. 
59   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   59 
The song continues. Charlie's mom and sister hang the Christmas ornaments as Charlie helps his dad find that "one 
CHARLIE Hey, dad.    Can I have 30 dollars? 
FATHER (old joke) 20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars for? 
CHARLIE Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please. 
Charlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a bill. It's a fifty. Dad winks, in a great mood. 
FATHER Have fun. 
CHARLIE Thanks. 
60   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY                               60 
Lockers are opened by Charlie. Sam. Patrick. Wrapped gifts are deposited. Mischief smiles. Lockers closed. Everyone loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks. 
61   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                                 61 
Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the Rye. He smiles. 
BILL Charlie... this was my favorite book growing up. This is my copy, but I want you to have it. 
GANG "Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your dad's!" "See you at New Year's!" 
Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway. 
CHARLIE Have a good time at your mom's. 
PATRICK Thanks. And Charlie... since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart. 
CHARLIE Thank you, Patrick. 
Sam gives Charlie one last hug.       Patrick and Sam watch their friends leave. 
PATRICK I love you guys! 
68   EXT. DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH - NIGHT                                     68 
We fly as high as Charlie feels.      Above the city on Christmas Eve. 
69   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         69 
The front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad. 
FATHER Hey!   Look who's here! 
He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19). Chris is handsome, charismatic, and an all around winner. 
CHRIS Come here, little sister. 
CANDACE Hey, Chris. 
Big hug.    Chris smiles big and "son flirts" with his mom. 
CHRIS Ma, you look so thin! 
MOTHER 10 pounds... Weight Watchers. 
Big kiss.   When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles. 
CHRIS Charlie... 
Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence. Then, hug. As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris gives him a quiet... 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Happy birthday. 
70   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                           70 
MOTHER Make a wish, honey. 
We move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out his 16 candles. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
71   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                            71 
The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags. The suburb is quiet. Not a creature is stirring. Except... 
Charlie. He fills a brown paper bag with    sand and a candle. He lights the candle, making the bag glow   like a beautiful lantern. He looks down his street, where    families are out with their kids, doing the same luminaria   ritual. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
72   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          72 
The same street. Christmas Eve. Many years ago. Aunt Helen and the kids finish their luminaria bags. Aunt Helen lights up the candles. They glow. 
AUNT HELEN Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus. 
The image goes wide. All of these bags glowing.     Beautiful. Aunt Helen rattles her keys. Whispers. 
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D) Keep an eye out for him with your brother and sister. I'll be right back. 
She bends down and whispers into his ear. 
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D) I'm going to get your birthday present. 
SAM (CONT'D) Isn't it quiet? 
CHARLIE Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you? 
SAM All the time. So, you want to put on these glasses? They'll protect you. 
Sam puts her arm around his shoulder. Protecting him. Charlie looks through the glasses. The sky bends like a globe. When he breathes, the sky ripples. 
78   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        78 
Charlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind. He sits down on the sofa. The world unbends as Charlie takes off the glasses. Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts of themselves behind. 
Charlie looks upstairs to find... Sam and Craig kissing. Craig leads her to the bedroom. 
Charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the New Years countdown. Patrick leads the charge. 
PATRICK 
79   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                       79 
In a QUICK FLASH, we see 7 year old Charlie with Aunt Helen on Christmas Eve. She bends to whisper in his ear. 
AUNT HELEN It'll be our little secret, all right? 
80   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT (PRESENT)                              80 
We are BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie takes a deep breath and tries to remember that he's at a New Year's party. 
PATRICK 7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year! 
The crowd cheers, leaving ghosts of themselves.   Charlie gets up from the sofa and walks out of Bob's house. 
81   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT                                     81 
Charlie walks down the road under a streetlight. Silhouette. The road is icy. Charlie lays down and starts moving his arms in the snow. The memories begin to haunt him. 
82   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         82 
7 year old Charlie waves goodbye to Aunt Helen as she drives away through the landing strip for Santa Claus. 
83   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                           83 
16 year old Charlie blinks.   The memories come faster. 
84   INT. AUNT HELEN'S CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         84 
Aunt Helen drives past a tall snow drift. She looks down at the 45 of The Beatles in the seat next to her. She smiles at Charlie's birthday present. Then, she looks up as the headlights of the semi truck smash the windows with a CRASH! 
85   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          85 
Charlie's mother opens the door, revealing a POLICEMAN. He turns to Charlie in his party hat. 7 years old and confused. 
86   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                           86 
16 year old Charlie lays on the snow, shivering, as the image goes high above to reveal he's made a snow angel. 
87   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON                                    87 
The Emergency room is bustling on New Year's Day. Charlie looks up as the POLICE, DOCTORS, and his PARENTS tower over him. He is terrified and does what any kid would do. He lies his ass off. 
POLICEMAN Did your older friends pressure you? 
CHARLIE No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never. 
POLICEMAN Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning? 
CHARLIE Well, um... I was really tired, and uh... I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out. 
He waits to see if this worked.    And then, unexpectedly... 
MOTHER (worried) You're seeing things again, Charlie? 
CHARLIE (oops) Not, uh... Not really. 
The song ends. The cast bows. Sam and Patrick push Charlie in front for his own curtain call. Everyone cheers. It's the night he'll never forget. 
95   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                   95 
The wind whips. That bracing February cold. Charlie helps Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car. 
CHARLIE Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something? 
MARY ELIZABETH We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college. I could put in a good word for you. 
CHARLIE That'd be great. Thanks. 
They put the box in her trunk. Snap it closed. We can't help but notice the "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" bumper sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt. 
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie... have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance? 
CHARLIE The one where the girl asks the guy. 
MARY ELIZABETH Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist. It's like, "Hey, thanks for the crumb." And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture. But, you know, it's my last year, and... would you maybe want to go with me? 
CHARLIE You want to go with me? 
MARY ELIZABETH I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked really cute in your costume. So, what do you say? 
Charlie thinks and thinks and... 
96   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK                                       96 
Ding dong. Charlie's mom opens the door for MARY ELIZABETH. Charlie straightens out his church suit. So nervous. 
MOTHER You must be Mary Elizabeth.    It's so good to meet you. 
MARY ELIZABETH You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis. 
FATHER (shit eating grin) Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist. 
97   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - FIREPLACE - DUSK                           97 
Charlie and Mary Elizabeth stand next to Candace and Derek. 
FATHER OK, a little closer together. That looks nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more. There you go. Nice. 
Cheese!   White flash.   The picture of 4 kids.   Smiling big. 
98   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                 98 
Charlie and Mary Elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song. Sweaty palms. Awkward. Hands on hips. Horror. 
Charlie looks around the gym. He sees Alice dancing with her date, an EFFEMINATE GOTH KID (17). We'll never meet him, but he'll make us laugh once. 
Charlie then watches Patrick dance with Sam. He follows Patrick's gaze across the floor to Brad, who dances with a SENIOR GIRL (18). Charlie sees the boys look at each other. For one moment, it's like they're dancing together. 
99   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER                 99 
Mary Elizabeth is at the punch bowl with the gang. Charlie sees Sam, standing by the wall, looking sad. He approaches. 
CHARLIE Are you having a good time? 
SAM Not really. How about you? 
CHARLIE I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to. 
SAM Don't worry. You're doing fine. 
Charlie joins her at the wall.   Mary Elizabeth gives them a quick, jealous look. 
CHARLIE I'm sorry Craig didn't come. 
SAM Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance. Can't say I blame him. 
CHARLIE I don't know. If you like it, he should come. 
SAM Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first date. You deserve it. 
She gives him one last kiss.      Content, she lays down on his lap. Peaceful. 
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I didn't know how it was going to go tonight, but it was really nice, huh? 
CHARLIE Yeah. 
MARY ELIZABETH I can't believe it. You of all people. I just can't believe you're my boyfriend. 
We land on Charlie's face.       "What?"   And then, we hear the GARAGE DOOR OPEN. 
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Oh, shit!     My parents! 
The mad scramble for clothes begins. 
CUT TO: 
103   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          103 
Mary Elizabeth's car pulls in front of Charlie's house. Charlie gets out. Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend. Not knowing how. Mary Elizabeth smiles. Smitten. 
MARY ELIZABETH See you Monday. 
With that, she backs out of the driveway. We see him from the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller. His stomach already filling with acid. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster. 
104   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                         104 
Sam, Patrick, and Alice are seated around the table. Mary Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie. Smothering him. 
MARY ELIZABETH We're literally making out, and I'm in my bra. Hello! And the front door opens. It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe? 
Charlie nods, tortured. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) I probably should have been honest about how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings. 
105   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING              105 
Ash Wednesday. Charlie gets out of the school bus to immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him. She sees the cross of ashes on his forehead. She thinks his ashes are a smudge. She cleans it. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone. And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy, I tried hard to love her like I love Sam. 
MARY ELIZABETH Can you believe it's almost our two week anniversary? 
CHARLIE I know. 
106   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                   106 
A double date. Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) So, I took her on double dates. 
MARY ELIZABETH (proud) Your first foreign film. 
CHARLIE 
MARY ELIZABETH Vegans don't eat butter. 
Charlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty. 
107   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   107 
Just like Sadie's except... the fire in the fireplace is out. We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) And I had to admit something really upsetting. But I am tired of touching her boobs. I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music once in awhile, we might have a chance. 
Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo.   Sighs. 
108   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                          108 
The gang is there.   Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray. 
PATRICK How is your first relationship going? 
CHARLIE It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her. 
PATRICK Charlie?   Truth or dare? 
Charlie blinks.   It was all fantasy. 
CHARLIE Dare. 
PATRICK I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips. Notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it... I'd smoke all you bitches. 
Alice hits him. Laughter. Charlie thinks. He looks at Mary Elizabeth, then turns to Sam. Before Sam can even react... Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips. When he opens his eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his mistake. Everyone stares. After a horrible silence... 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Now that's fucked up. 
Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and goes into the kitchen. 
CHARLIE Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm-- 
Alice follows Mary Elizabeth.    Sam is close behind. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry. 
Sam turns and looks at him.    She doesn't even recognize him. 
SAM What the hell is wrong with you? 
Charlie is devastated. 
113   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         113 
They move to the driveway.     Charlie feels awful.   Panicky. 
CHARLIE 
PATRICK Trust me.    You don't want to go back there. 
CHARLIE But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to do anything. 
PATRICK I know you didn't, but look... I hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam. Other guys. Things that have nothing to do with you. But... it's best if you stay away for awhile. 
CHARLIE (crushed) Oh. Okay. How long do you think? 
Silence. Charlie looks over at Patrick, who wears a grave expression. It's going to be a long time. We hear the sound of the typewriter. 
114   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING                                    114 
Charlie sits at his desk. It looks like he's barely slept. He begins typing. The keys up close and loud. Clak. 
CLOSE UP TYPING: "Dear friend, I have not seen my friends for 2 weeks now. I am starting to get bad again." 
Charlie stares at the typewriter.    And remembers. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
115   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          115 
Little Charlie pops his head around the corner from the hallway. He looks at something we can't see yet. 
BACK TO: 
116   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING (PRESENT)                          116 
Present.   Knock.   Knock.   Charlie's mom opens the door. 
MOTHER We're going to be late for Easter Mass. 
CHARLIE I'll... I'll be there in a minute. 
Charlie forces a smile, then looks back at the typewriter. And tries to shake off the memory. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
BOB Don't worry about it.   Hey... you hear from Patrick? 
CHARLIE No.   He told me to stay away. 
BOB Oh... you don't know? 
CHARLIE (concerned) Why? Why? What happened? 
BOB Brad's father caught them together. 
125   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING                 125 
As kids open lockers and move to morning period, Charlie stares at Brad. He has a black eye and cuts on his face. He look like he was beaten up badly. Students whisper gossip. 
GOSSIP WHISPERS (O.S.) "Some Lebo kids jumped him outside the O." "It was some kids from North Hills." "That's not what I heard." 
Brad moves into the arms of CHARLOTTE (18), cheerleader cute. As Brad kisses her, Charlie sees Patrick down the hall, watching them. Patrick closes his locker. Hurting. 
CHARLIE Are you okay? 
PATRICK Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry. 
Patrick storms off. 
126   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                          126 
Charlie sits at his table, alone. He watches Patrick leave the lunch line, passing a chorus of... 
TWIN SENIOR GIRLS 
Patrick says nothing. He's too sad to fight the mob today. He just moves to his table when the Nose Tackle sticks out his leg. Patrick falls on his tray. The kids laugh. 
NOSE TACKLE Oops.   Sorry, Nothing. 
Patrick smiles to himself, dusts off, and turns to Brad. 
PATRICK You going to do something? 
BRAD HAYS What are you talking about? 
PATRICK Your pet ape just tripped me.    Are you going to say something? 
BRAD HAYS Why would I? 
PATRICK You know why. 
It's too far.   Brad can feel people staring. 
BRAD HAYS This is pathetic, man.    Your fixation on me. 
Brad's friends laugh.   Patrick's eyes narrow. 
PATRICK Do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises? Really? 
BRAD HAYS I got jumped in a parking lot. 
PATRICK Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know about Schenley Park? (to Brad's friends) Do you guys know about Schenley Park? 
Brad stands and gets right in Patrick's face. 
BRAD HAYS I don't know what kind of sick shit you're trying to pull. (real warning) But you better walk away now... Nothing. 
PATRICK Fine.   Say hi to your dad for me. 
Patrick turns and leaves.    And then, as an afterthought... 
BRAD HAYS Whatever... faggot. 
Brad's friends laugh.    Patrick stops and turns.   Last chance. 
PATRICK What did you call me? 
BRAD HAYS I called you a faggo-- 
Mary Elizabeth looks at us because she wants us to know... 
MARY ELIZABETH I'm dating Peter now. 
She motions to PETER.    College.   Glasses.   Good looking-ish. 
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) He's in college with Craig. He's opinionated, and we have intellectual debates. You were very sweet, but our relationship was too one-sided. I know this is hard for you. 
CHARLIE I'm just glad you're happy. 
MARY ELIZABETH Okay. 
Mary Elizabeth joins Peter.    Charlie looks at his friends. 
that says, "They forget. I don't." After a beat, Patrick comes downstairs. He looks sad with his bruises. 
PATRICK Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon. 
MARY ELIZABETH We're going to miss the movie. 
CRAIG Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step. 
As Craig moves upstairs, Patrick approaches Charlie. 
PATRICK Hey... you wanna get out of here? 
CHARLIE Sure, Patrick. 
130   EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT                               130 
Patrick drives Sam's truck up the hill to the overlook. 
PATRICK (V.O.) I'll tell you something, Charlie. I feel good. You know what I mean? Maybe tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke place downtown. And this club off the strip. They don't card. And the Schenley Park scene. You gotta see the "fruit loop" at least one time. 
131   EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT                               131 
Charlie and Patrick walk the lighted path, howling at the moon. Patrick holds a thermos, filled with who knows what. 
PATRICK Oh, my God. My life is officially an after school special. Son of a bitch! 
CHARLIE (laughing) It kind of is. It so is. 
More laughter.   They arrive at the lookout.   They drink. 
PATRICK So, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller? 
CHARLIE I don't know. 
PATRICK Really? I thought your brother would have told you. It's a classic. 
CHARLIE Maybe. 
PATRICK So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker. And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. So, she did it really proper. She packed a picnic. Stole a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. So, what do you think happened? 
CHARLIE I don't know. 
PATRICK They did it with one of the sandwich bags. 
They start laughing and screaming. 
CHARLIE Ew!   That's disgusting! 
PATRICK Yes! It is! Let's keep the train rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie! 
Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks... 
CHARLIE Uh. Well... there was this girl named Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the 4th grade-- 
PATRICK Mosquito bites. Promising.     Go. 
CHARLIE And she let some of the boys feel them. 
PATRICK That's your suburban legend?     Did you at least cop a feel? 
CHARLIE Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition. 
SAM That sounds like fun. 
CHARLIE Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore. 
SAM Yes, I will. 
Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.   They stand next to each other. Close. 
SAM (CONT'D) I had lunch with Craig today. 
CHARLIE Yeah? 
SAM He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him. But I'm driving away, and I just felt so small. Just asking myself why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing? 
CHARLIE We accept the love we think we deserve. 
He says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in. Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she turns to him. 
SAM Then, why didn't you ever ask me out? 
Charlie didn't expect that.       He is silent.   Heart pounding. 
CHARLIE I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that. 
SAM Well, what did you want? 
CHARLIE I just want you to be happy. 
SAM Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel that. It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me. 
CHARLIE I know who you are, Sam. 
Sam waits.    And Charlie finally speaks from the heart. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I know I'm quiet, and I know I should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. How much we are alike. And how we've been through the same things. And you're not small. You're beautiful. 
He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing. 
We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water. 
SAM What's wrong, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Oh, ah... nothing. 
Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues 
149   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          149 
It's like a dream for Charlie. He watches Sam hug Alice and Mary Elizabeth goodbye. But Charlie is somewhere else. 
SAM I'll call all the time. 
MARY ELIZABETH Promise. 
SAM And we'll all see each other in New York. 
SAM'S MOM Come on, Sam. 
Charlie can't take it. He moves to the side of the truck and puts in the last suitcase. He looks over at Sam. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
150   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      150 
QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers kissing Sam the night before. Her hand touches Charlie's knee. 
BACK TO PRESENT: 
151   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          151 
Charlie snaps himself out of it. He turns back as Mary Elizabeth and Alice part ways. Charlie locks eyes with Sam. They take a moment. And then they come together to hug. She kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry. 
QUICK FLASH.   Little Charlie's mom opens the door to reveal a policeman. 
165   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)                             165 
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie is in the same entry hall in the same house 8 years later. Banging his head against the wall. "It's my fault. It's all my fault." 
He passes the photo wall on the stairs. We see the images of the family. Church. Communion. Baby pictures. Years of history staring at us. Ghosts on the wall. 
166   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                           166 
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie sits at his desk. We see him from behind. Perfectly still. Trying to keep himself calm. 
CHARLIE Stop crying. 
167   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY (FLASHBACK)                           167 
QUICK FLASH. Charlie thinks everyone is staring at him. His sister and her friends. His brother and mother. Mary Elizabeth and Alice. And worst of all... Sam and Patrick the night they toasted him. A paranoid nightmare. 
168   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             168 
BACK TO PRESENT.   Charlie's falling to pieces.   The tears run down his face. 
CHARLIE Stop crying. 
169   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - VARIOUS TIMES (FANTASY)                   169 
QUICK FLASH. Derek hits Candace.   Patrick hits Brad.    The cafeteria erupts into violence. 
And Charlie remembers what he's blacked out. 
We see him in the cafeteria. Terrifying. He thinks he sees Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose. Hits another in the throat. And pushes another. Charlie looks at his hand, covered in blood. The whole school staring at him. 
170   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             170 
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie holds his head. Trying to stuff the pictures back in his brain. But he can't. They keep coming and coming, faster and faster. Sam's hand, Little Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt Helen is dead. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) It'll be our little secret. 
We go behind his head. The image moves closer and closer. Until it feels like we are inside Charlie's mind. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
171   EXT. HOUSE SWIMMING POOL - DAY                                     171 
We see Candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friend's backyard pool. Her FRIEND (18, pretty) holds the cordless. 
CANDACE'S FRIEND Candace... your brother's on the phone. 
Candace casually picks up the phone. 
CANDACE Hello. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Hey, Candace. 
CANDACE Charlie? 
CHARLIE Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something. 
CANDACE What? 
CHARLIE Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over. 
Candace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone. 
CANDACE Call the police and send them to my house. 
CHARLIE And I can't stop her.   I'm crazy again. 
CANDACE No, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad are going to be home with Chris any second. 
CHARLIE I was just thinking... what if I wanted her to die, Candace? 
CANDACE What?    Charlie... Charlie! 
Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement. 
CHARLIE She was... insane. 
The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today. 
DR. BURTON Charlie, are you going to let me help you here? 
Charlie cries and nods. 
CHARLIE Okay. 
DR. BURTON Do you remember anything before you blacked out? 
CHARLIE I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home... 
We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off. 
175   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                      175 
The sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks at Sam's typewriter. "Dear Friend" is already typed. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't go into detail about all of it. But I will say there were some very bad days. And some unexpected beautiful days. 
Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam. 
176   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                       176 
Dr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me. 
In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop.    Shocked. 
177   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                       177 
Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway. 
MOTHER Honey? 
His mother comes to hold him. 
MOTHER (CONT'D) I'm so sorry. 
For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page, before he chokes it down. He walks over to his son and kisses his forehead. 
178   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   178 
Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) The best days were those when I could have visitors. My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job. 
179   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                              179 
Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand.    His mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton. 
DR. BURTON There he is. So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right? 
Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together. 
Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital. 
180   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT                             180 
The family sits at the dinner table. 
FATHER God bless this food that we are about to receive. We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 
After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until... 
CHARLIE How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad?

THE GREAT GATSBY 
Written by 
Baz Luhrmann & Craig Pearce 
Based on 
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald 
A BLACK SCREEN. 
The blackness is pierced by a single, pulsing green light... 
We drift, as if by boat, across a dark bay toward the light. 
Then, we hear a troubled voice. 
NICK (V.O.) In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice: "always try to see the best in people," he would say... 
A gentle snow begins to fall, obscuring the light... 
NICK (V.O.) As a consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgements. 
The snow grows heavier. 
NICK (V.O.) But even I... have a limit. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SANITARIUM - WINTER - DAY 
Continue drifting, through the snow, across an icy lake... 
NICK (V.O.) Back then all of us drank too much. 
DISCOVER: A stately Victorian building... 
NICK (V.O.) The more in tune with the times we were, the more we drank. 
CLOSE ON: The sign, "The Perkins Sanitarium." 
NICK (V.O.) And none of us contributed anything new. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY 
DISCOVER: A man shrouded in darkness. He leans against an old fireplace, hand covering his face. 
NICK When I came back from New York I was disgusted. 
REVEAL: NICK CARRAWAY (37), unshaven, morbidly alcoholic. 
NICK (CONT'D) Disgusted... with everyone, and everything... Only one man was exempt from my disgust. 
REVEAL: A kind, elderly DOCTOR. 
DOCTOR One man...? Mr. Carraway? 
NICK (WHISPERS) Gatsby... 
DOCTOR Was he a friend of yours? 
NICK He was... the single most hopeful person I have ever met... And am ever likely to meet again. There was something about him... 
Nick wanders slowly towards the window, remembering. 
NICK (CONT'D) A sensitivity. He was like one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away... 
DOCTOR Where did you meet him? 
Nick stops and stares out the window, haunted. 
NICK At a party. In New York. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY 
THROUGH THE CLOUDS: New skyscrapers pierce a clear blue sky. 
NICK (V.O.) In the summer of 1922, the tempo of the city approached hysteria... 
ON WALL STREET: A fever pitch of buying and selling... 
NICL (V.O.) Stocks hit record peaks. And Wall Street boomed, in a steady golden roar... 
IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK'S V.O. Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up...! 
NICK (V.O.) The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired... making the liquor cheaper. 
FADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street. 
NICK (V.O.) Wall Street was luring the young and ambitious. 
PUSH TOWARD: One of the hats. Its wearer stops, and gazes up. 
NICK (V.O.) And I was one of them. 
REVEAL: A clear-eyed, hopeful, 29 year old Nick Carraway. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LONG ISLAND - WEST EGG - DAY 
BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen. 
FOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house. 
NICK (V.O.) Her husband was heir to one of America's wealthiest families. 
BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! 
Tom whacks the polo ball... 
NICK (V.O.) His name was Tom Buchanan. 
The ball nearly hits one of Tom's gardeners... 
NICK (V.O.) When we were at Yale together he'd been a sporting star. 
BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! 
Tom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch... 
NICK (V.O.) But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs. 
Tom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty. 
TOM (INTO PHONE) I thought I told you not to call me here...! 
PULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony. 
Clunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and grasps his hand with overbearing strength. 
TOM (CONT'D) Shakespeare! How's the great American novel coming...? 
NICK Oh, I'm selling bonds now Tom... with Walter Chase's outfit-- 
TOM Never heard of em. 
Tom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness! 
TOM (CONT'D) Hey! What say after dinner we go into town? 
NICK CAN'T-- 
TOM Catch up with the old wolf pack? 
NICK Big day on the new job tomorrow-- 
TOM Nonsense! We're going. 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - HALL OF CHAMPIONS - LATE AFTERNOON 
Tom leads Nick down a grand hall lined with the trophies that chronicle Tom's infinite sporting achievements. 
TOM First team, all-American! 
Tom admires his own achievements. 
TOM (CONT'D) You see? Made me who I am today. 
Tom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet-- 
TOM (CONT'D) Here-- Forest Hills... I played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy! 
Tom exchanges the trophy for a football. 
TOM (CONT'D) Life's something you dominate Nick. 
He pelts Nick with the ball-- 
TOM (CONT'D) If you're any good. 
Nick fumbles as Tom charges him-- 
TOM (CONT'D) Ha-ha-ha! 
Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into... 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON 
A shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white curtains whip and snap in the breeze... 
CLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck. 
We hear the giggle of naughty children... 
BOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with it, a low, thrilling voice... 
DAISY (O.S.) Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely? 
Suddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are framed by a strawberry-blonde bob. 
CLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating... 
NICK (V.O.) Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see... 
She whispers dramatically... 
DAISY Do they miss me in Chicago? 
NICK Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love. 
DAISY (UNIMPRESSED) How gorgeous. 
NICK They're absolutely in mourning... They're crying... 
DAISY NO-- 
TOM (CONT'D) Will have control of things. 
DAISY (WICKEDLY) Tom's been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in THEM 
TOM It's been proved. Its scientific. 
DAISY (subtly mocking Tom) We've got to beat them down. 
SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. BRINNNGGG! 
TOM Excuse me... I'll be right back. 
He goes inside. 
An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down. 
DAISY I'm sorry... 
She follows Tom into the house. 
Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan. 
NICK Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor... 
JORDAN Shhhh... Don't talk. I want to hear what happens. 
A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond. 
NICK Is something happening? 
JORDAN I thought everybody knew. 
NICK I don't. 
JORDAN Tom's got some woman in New York. 
NICK Got some woman? 
JORDAN She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time... Don't you think? 
Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang open and Tom and Daisy return to the table. 
DAISY (a tense gayety) I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn't he? 
NICK I'm not even faintly like a rose-- 
TOM So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club. 
DAISY Nicky, stay-- 
NICK I have to work early. 
TOM Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two. 
Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. 
SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG! 
PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek. 
NICK (V.O.) None of us could ignore that fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER 
Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides: 
DAISY Oh Nicky... 
NICK What? 
DAISY Its just, well, you see, I think everything's terrible anyhow. You know I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I've had very bad time Nicky... I'm pretty cyncical about everything. 
Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. 
Nick tries to change the subject-- 
NICK Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything? 
DAISY Pammy? Oh yes... 
Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.' 
She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers... 
DAISY (CONT'D) All the bright precious things fade so fast... 
And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby's castle... 
DAISY (CONT'D) And they don't come back. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT 
WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby's dock, A MAN - his dark silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky. 
In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, pulling up at his bungalow. 
EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can see The Man gazing intently across the bay. 
NICK (V.O.) When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor's dock. 
INT. WILSON'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office. 
TOM Hello Wilson! How's business? 
WILSON (UNCONVINCING) I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car? 
TOM I've got my man working on it. 
WILSON Works pretty slow, don't he? 
TOM (COLDLY) Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else? 
WILSON I don't mean that, I just... 
Wilson's grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual. 
MYRTLE If its business you're talking, you should be talking to me... (to her husband) Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down... 
Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom. 
MYRTLE (CONT'D) (WITHOUT TURNING) Hurry up! 
WILSON Oh, sure... Sure... 
Wilson hurries out back. 
TOM Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway. 
MYRTLE A pleasure... 
TOM Nick's a writer... 
Myrtle is completely uninterested. 
NICK (FEEBLE) I'm in bonds, actually... 
TOM (intently to Myrtle) Get on the next train. 
MYRTLE (playing hard to get) Now...? Are we gettin' that dog? 
TOM Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... (glancing to Nick) She'll like him... 
NICK Oh no, that's alright, I'm busy... 
MYRTLE Catherine's said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know. 
NICK Really I can't... 
TOM (whispers to Nick) Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That's rude. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The muffled sounds of sex... 
CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk. 
Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. 
Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE. 
She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand. 
CATHERINE I'm Catherine; ain't we havin' a party? 
NICK Oh, I'm... I'm not sure now's a good time-- I was just going-- 
But Nick's exit is blocked. 
MRS. MCKEE Hello...! 
MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek. 
MR. MCKEE (extending his hand) Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you. 
NICK Nick Carraway. 
MRS. MCKEE Where're the kids? 
Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him... 
CATHERINE What's the matter? Don't ya like me? 
SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress. 
MRS. MCKEE Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable! 
MYRTLE (with impressive hauteur) It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like! 
Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt. 
TOM Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep. 
Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet. 
NICK (making for the door) Tom, I really should be going... 
TOM (grabbing Nick's arm) Nonsense... 
NICK Tom; I don't think-- Daisy's my-- 
Tom pulls Nick back toward the party. 
SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle's nose! 
CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION! 
PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one more of the countless many that play out in this vast city... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY 
Nick's been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits... 
NICK I have no clue how I got home. 
EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING 
Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light. 
CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake. 
He realizes he's been sleeping on the porch in his underwear. 
NICK (V.O.) But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling... 
His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... 
A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up... 
NICK (V.O.) ....that Gatsby was watching me. 
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY 
The Doctor leans forward. 
DOCTOR (SLIGHTLY INCREDULOUS) Watching you...? 
NICK Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me... 
DOCTOR And how do you know that? 
NICK Because I got an invitation... I was the only one. 
FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick's doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation... 
NICK(CONT'D) No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby's... 
The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: "Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party..." 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TWILIGHT 
A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby's gates. 
NICK (V.O.) You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited... 
As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby's gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by... 
NICK (V.O.) The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby's... 
CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby's magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT 
Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs. 
NICK (V.O.) And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby's door... 
A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into... 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS 
A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...! 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT 
Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays. 
Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby's... 
NICK (V.O) A caravansary of... 
IMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over... 
NICK (V.O.) Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby's beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors... (MORE) 
NICK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven! 
Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar... 
NICK (to the bartender) Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby? 
He brandishes his invitation. 
NICK (CONT'D) I live just next door... 
BARTENDER Mr. Gatsby? I've never seen him sir. Why, no one has... 
The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini. 
NICK (V.O.) Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk. 
He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT 
TEDDY (CONT'D) I'm stealing her away Carraway! 
Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces... 
ORCHESTRA LEADER Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's "A Jazz History of the World", and accompanying fireworks! 
Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off-- 
TEDDY Look around you! Rich girls don't marry poor boys-- 
On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... 
Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray... 
MAN Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war? 
NICK Yes; The Ninth Battalion. 
CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty. 
MAN I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport? 
NICK (VERY TIPSY) The whole thing's incredible - I live next door... (brandishing his now CRUMPLED INVITATION) He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby, no one's met him; they say he's third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil! 
At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter's tray and hands it to Nick... 
MAN I'm afraid I'm not a very good host, old sport... I'm Gatsby. 
CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops. 
NICK (MUTTERING APOLOGIES) Oh.. I'm very sorry-- I... I've had so much to drink... 
The delirious opening chords of Tostoff's "History" coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky! 
GATSBY (APOLOGETICALLY) I thought you knew, old sport. 
Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum. 
NICK (V.O.) His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in. 
All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby. 
HERZOG Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire. 
Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick. 
GATSBY I'm trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? 
Nick shakes himself from his reverie. 
NICK What time? 
GATSBY Any time that suits you. 
Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Lovely to see you Miss Baker. 
He kisses her lightly on the hand. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) (TO NICK) If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me. 
As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement. 
NICK I expected him to be... 
JORDAN Old and fat? 
NICK Well, yes; young men don't just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island. 
JORDAN He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it... 
NICK Why not? 
JORDAN I don't know... I just don't believe he went there... 
Jordan is interrupted by a voice. 
HERZOG I beg your pardon... 
She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them. 
HERZOG (CONT'D) Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone. 
JORDAN (SURPRISED) Me? 
HERZOG Yes, madame. 
As Vladimir Tostoff's erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... 
Nick, unsettled, watches her go... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER 
Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... 
Seeing Nick, she rushes to him... 
JORDAN Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense... 
Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan. 
TEDDY Where have you been!? The car's waiting! 
PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
I/E. GATSBY'S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY 
Gatsby hasn't stopped for breath... 
GATSBY Then came the war, old sport... 
NICK (V.O.) Just when I thought it couldn't be any more fantastical... 
GATSBY It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life... 
NICK (V.O.) He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army! 
CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion. 
GATSBY In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... 
Something catches Nick's eye... 
NICK'S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson's Garage. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) ...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead. 
SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing! 
GATSBY (CONT'D) I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea. 
SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick's lap. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Here! That's the one from Montenegro. 
It looks authentic. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Turn it. 
NICK (READS) Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary. 
GATSBY That's right. 
SLAP! A photograph joins the medal. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Here's another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster. 
CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand. 
NICK (V.O.) What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true? 
DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues... 
GATSBY (O.S.) But don't take my word for it. At lunch, I'm going to introduce you to one of New York's most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I've told you, and vouch for my good character... 
I/E. GATSBY'S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY 
Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway. 
NICK I'm sure that's not necessary... 
Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity. 
GATSBY Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don't want you to think I'm just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I'm going to make a very big request of you today. 
NICK A big request? 
GATSBY Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon. 
NICK (caught off guard) Jordan...? What's she got to do with it? 
GATSBY Oh, I assure you it's nothing underhand. Miss Baker's an honest sportswoman; she'd never do anything that wasn't alright... 
RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside. 
COP Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb! 
GATSBY (CALMLY) All right, old sport! Alright. 
Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket... 
COP (EMBARRASSED) Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me! 
The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge! 
NICK One of your old Oxford pals? 
GATSBY Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. (ADDS PROUDLY) I imagine he'll be at lunch too... 
NICK By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... 
Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. 
An orchestral melody surges... 
NICK (V.O.) I didn't know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all... 
As the orchestra builds, Gatsby's car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... 
SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity... 
NICK (V.O.) Even Gatsby could happen... 
BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into: 
INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY 
WOLFSHEIM (CONT'D) Finest specimen of human molars... 
Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns. 
GATSBY Gentlemen. Everything alright...? 
NICK Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people's wives... 
GATSBY (taking his seat) Other people's wives? Ah... I see. 
Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Other people's wives... Meyer? 
Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls... 
WOLFSHEIM Well, my work here is done. I'll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women... 
Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off... 
GATSBY You'll have to excuse him... In his old age, he's prone to "digress..." He's a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway... 
NICK Who is he anyhow? 
GATSBY Meyer? He's a gambler. 
Over Nick and Gatsby's shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction... 
NICK An actor? 
GATSBY Meyer? No. He's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. 
NICK Fixed it? 
GATSBY Fixed it. 
NICK How did he manage that? 
GATSBY He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He's a very smart man. (tries to change subject) Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of... 
Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table. 
TOM Hey Nick! Nick! Where've you been!? Daisy's furious you haven't called up. 
Nick and Gatsby stand. 
NICK This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. 
CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand. 
GATSBY I'm so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance. 
Tom turns back to Nick. 
TOM I wouldn't have expected to find you in this temple of virtue. 
NICK I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-- 
Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. 
PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK 
Jordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful Arrow shirts. 
DISCOVER: Nick, frustrated, dodging the fashionable and famous... 
NICK I'm looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer... There... I've spotted her. 
Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan. 
NICK (CONT'D) What game are you and Gatsby playing at!? 
An immaculate MAITRE'D offers Nick a chair. 
MAITRE'D Will the gentleman be joining? 
NICK (FRUSTRATED) One moment please-- 
JORDAN Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant. 
As Nick's frustration and Jordan's embarrassment grow-- 
NICK It's all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he's going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is-- 
JORDAN If you'll just have a seat-- 
NICK What is this big request!? 
JORDAN Nick--! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea. 
NICK Tea? (not what Nick expected) Daisy...? And Gatsby...? 
Nick sits... 
NICK (CONT'D) Why? 
JORDAN Well... I don't know quite where to start. You see... I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY 
But before the letter disappears completely we read one more line: "The truth is..." 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LOUISVILLE CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON 
Daisy and Tom, newly married, pose for photos. 
JORDAN (O.S.) Anyways, that day, at five o'clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT 
Jordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs. 
JORDAN After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually... (MORE) 
JORDAN (CONT'D) I'd never seen a girl so in love with her husband. (MUSES CYNICALLY) A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers... 
As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he's struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought. 
NICK It's a strange coincidence, isn't it? Gatsby's house being just across the bay... 
Jordan whirls round-- 
JORDAN It's no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she'd wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her. 
Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time. 
NICK All that for a girl he hasn't seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...? (TO HIMSELF) The modesty of it. 
JORDAN Kind of takes your breath away, doesn't it? 
A cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door... 
INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS 
Jordan slides in... 
TAXI DRIVER Evening sweethearts! Where to? 
JORDAN Long Island, please. 
NICK And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby? 
JORDAN (a stern whisper) She's absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can "happen to drop by." 
CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure... 
NICK (V.O.) I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew? 
As Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
Nick's taxi pulls past Gatsby's mansion, ablaze with light. 
NICK (V.O.) When I returned home, Gatsby's was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn't a sound. 
EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
As Nick's taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick. 
NICK Your place looks like the World's Fair... or Coney Island! 
GATSBY (TERRIBLY ANXIOUS) Ah, does it? I've... I've just been glancing into some rooms... Let's go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car-- 
NICK It's too late tonight. 
GATSBY Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use of it all summer... 
NICK I must go to bed... 
Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery. 
NICK (CONT'D) Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea. 
GATSBY Oh, that's alright. I don't want to put you to any trouble... 
NICK What day would suit you? 
GATSBY What day would suit you...? I don't want to put you to any trouble... 
NICK Day after tomorrow alright? 
GATSBY Day after tomorrow? Well, I'd... I'd want to get the grass cut. 
They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick's ragged lawn ends and Gatsby's manicured one begins. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) There's another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you? 
NICK Not really. 
GATSBY If you'll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I'm saying right? You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport? 
NICK Trying to. 
GATSBY Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money. 
NICK I've got my hands full. 
Gatsby's face falls. 
DAISY Come back in an hour, Ferdie! (GRAVE MURMUR) His name is Ferdie. 
INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY 
Daisy continues ahead into the living room. 
Nick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy's reaction at discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted... 
DAISY (O.S.) Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can't believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse? 
INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
DAISY (TO HERSELF) He is in love with me... 
Nick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not there. Daisy's merely been admiring the flower display... 
NICK That's funny. 
DAISY What's funny? 
KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door. 
NICK One moment... 
INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Nick opens the door. 
Gatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick. 
NICK What are you doing? 
Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into... 
INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... 
The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy's, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur. 
DAISY I'm certainly glad to see you again. 
Gatsby's face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. 
Finally, he finds words... 
GATSBY I'm... certainly glad to see you as well. 
Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating. 
EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the TENSION-- 
CUT TO: 
INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair. 
The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur. 
GATSBY We've met before... 
SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby's elbow... 
And falls! And breaks! 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Ah... sorry... 
He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again! 
NICK (IDIOTICALLY) It's an old... clock. 
DAISY (desperate for small talk) Lovely though. A lovely... clock. 
Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. 
Gatsby takes a seat. 
A long silent beat. 
DAISY (CONT'D) We haven't met for many years. 
GATSBY (an automatic reflex) Five years next November. 
The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing. 
NICK (ABRUPTLY) Tea? 
GATSBY (DYING) Thank you old sport. 
DAISY (ALSO MORTIFIED) Darling thank you. 
Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. 
A long, terrible silence... 
Suddenly Nick stands. 
NICK I just need to... pop into town. 
GATSBY (HORRIFIED) Town...? 
NICK The village; I'll be right back. 
As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows. 
TOM I'd really rather not be the polo player... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GARDEN TABLE - NIGHT 
Tom, Daisy, Nick and Gatsby sit an elaborately conceived dinner table, watching the band... 
DAISY (TO NICK) These things excite me so... 
Gatsby turns to Tom... 
GATSBY I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago. 
TOM That's right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop... 
GATSBY That's right. See... I know your wife. 
TOM Is that so? 
GATSBY Yes. 
As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity. 
HERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is here... 
Herzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'. 
Gatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes off her, whispers fiercely... 
GATSBY Not now. 
Herzog silently recedes... 
A romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces... 
TRIMALCHIO And now...! Dice, Brass Knuckles and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot! 
Gatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy... 
GATSBY Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly? 
Tom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the garden momentarily catch his eye. 
TOM Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused. 
As Daisy takes Gatsby's arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom's breast pocket and murmurs... 
DAISY In case you need to take down any addresses... 
As Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor. 
PUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 
As Daisy and Gatsby dance, Daisy murmurs thrillingly. 
DAISY Is all this made entirely from your own imagination? 
GATSBY No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... 
DAISY It's perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination... 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT 
Tom and Nick watch Gatsby and Daisy dance. Tom looks around, perplexed by a distant thought. 
TOM I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...? 
He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him... 
TOM (CONT'D) (TO NICK) I'll find you... 
He leaves Nick alone. And Nick watches as Gatsby simultaneously leads Daisy from the dance floor... 
EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT 
Daisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside... 
Gatsby follows, but upon entering the secluded, starlit world sees no sign of Daisy. 
Then, from out of the shadows, the sparkle of jewels... 
Gatsby turns, and Daisy's lips suddenly find his. 
A long, still kiss... 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT 
Nick is keeping watch, gazing down to his yard and the tree. 
When Tom suddenly appears... 
TOM Have you seen my wife...? 
Startled, Nick turns... 
NICK (LIES) Ah... no... Not for awhile. 
TOM That's funny. The Senator said he saw her down here. 
Tom follows Nick's gaze down toward the tree... 
TOM Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... 
DAISY'S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle. 
TOM (O.C.) (CONT'D) I'd like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I'll make a point of finding out. 
As the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby's "guards." 
CLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby's gate, GATSBY'S COAT OF ARMS READS: "Ad Finem Fidelis" ("Faithful to the End"). 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT 
It is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... 
Nick descends the stairs, drunk. 
NICK Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... 
Gatsby is not amused. 
GATSBY She didn't like it. 
NICK Of course she did. 
GATSBY No, she didn't like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It's hard to make her understand. 
NICK You mean about the party? 
GATSBY The party!? I couldn't care less about the parties! You see... (SHOCKING INTENSITY) (MORE) 
GATSBY (CONT'D) She has to tell Tom that she never loved him. 
NICK What...? 
GATSBY Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents' house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we'll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. 
NICK I wouldn't ask too much of her... 
GATSBY Ask too much? 
NICK No. 
Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself. 
GATSBY I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- 
NICK Jay... You can't repeat the past. 
Gatsby wheels around... 
GATSBY Can't repeat the past? 
NICK No. 
GATSBY Why of course you can. Of course you can. You'll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything's been so... so confused since then... 
Gatsby looks out to the green light. 
NICK (V.O.) He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something... 
GATSBY If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. 
NICK (V.O.) Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy... 
IN THE CLOUDS, AMONG THE STARS, THE IMAGE OF DAISY'S HOUSE IN LOUISVILLE APPEARS, as if frozen in time... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
I/E. DAISY'S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
PUSH TOWARD: A wide veranda, strung with banners in support of the American war effort, and beyond into a parlour; pretty Southern girls and fresh-faced soldiers, dancing, clapping... 
NICK (V.O.) Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy's house by colossal accident. 
Amidst the many revellers, DISCOVER: Daisy, hurrying through the crowd. 
GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I'd never been in such a beautiful house before... 
Daisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... 
At the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer's uniform. 
NICK (V.O.) But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself. 
Daisy's Mother stops her on the steps. 
DAISY MOM Daisy, don't scamper. (WHISPERS) There's so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family's... 
CLOSE ON: Gatbsy, watching Daisy... 
GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I always knew that I could climb... But I could only climb if I climbed alone. 
Against his better judgement he follows Daisy up... 
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT 
Checking to make sure no one has seen, Daisy slips quietly through a set of doors, into the conservatory... Gatsby is not far behind... A secret rendezvous. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT 
GATSBY I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her... 
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT 
Locked away deep in the castle, Gatsby and Daisy make love. 
FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: "WHO IS THE MYSTERY WOMAN?" 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - WHARF - DUSK 
At the end of the wharf, Gatsby and Daisy look out across the bay, watching as the sun slides into the horizon, and the green light pulses... 
CLOSE ON: Daisy. She leans to Gatsby and whispers... 
DAISY I don't want to go home. 
Gatsby hold her tighter. 
GATSBY Then don't. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Long shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... 
WIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited men. 
We hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby... 
GATSBY (O.S.) I've been meaning to call you up. I'm sorry, I've been... so busy. 
NICK (O.S.) Is everything alright? 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
An unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent paintings. He hunches over the phone... 
GATSBY Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love. 
NICK (O.S.) I hear you fired all your servants? 
GATSBY Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn't gossip... until we decided what we're going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? (CLARIFIES) They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. 
Herzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman pours coffee and then recedes... 
GATSBY (CONT'D) What's the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...? 
INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Nick holds the phone close to his ear, trying to hear Gatsby above the din around him; his work is piled high... 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Gatsby whispers into the phone... 
GATSBY (EXCITED) Nick... Daisy's ready. Shes ready. But there's just one thing. She's requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? (AN ADMISSION) Daisy needs you. I... We need you. Will you come old sport? 
INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
PUSH IN ON: Nick. A decision looms...

EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY 
WIDE SHOT: The imposing Buchanan mansion bakes in the sun... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter. 
TOM You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year... 
Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates... 
TOM (CONT'D) Or wait a minute; it's the opposite... 
Tom stands and strolls to the open French window... 
TOM (CONT'D) The sun is getting colder every year... 
Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. 
CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. 
The tension is excruciating. 
Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay. 
TOM (CONT'D) How I'd like to be out on that bay today. 
CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle. 
GATSBY I'm right across from you. (POINTS) Right there. 
TOM (UNIMPRESSED) So you are. 
Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy. 
GATSBY Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking. 
TOM What light? 
Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy's... 
JORDAN (O.C.) (MOCKING) We're almost out of gas Tom... 
EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON'S GARAGE - DAY 
SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson's... 
Wilson doesn't budge. He's staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg. 
TOM Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let's have some gas... (GETS OUT) Do I have to do it myself? 
WILSON I'm sick. I'm all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West. 
TOM Your wife does...? 
Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle's face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates... 
NICK (V.O.) Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control... 
WILSON I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin' whether she wants to or not. 
Tom isn't listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust! 
TOM What do I owe you!? 
WILSON Dollar twenty. 
The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg. 
TOM You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow! 
He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé! 
I/E. GATSBY'S CAR/TOM'S COUPÉ - DAY 
VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close. 
As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... 
PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city... 
SLAM CUT TO: 
INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY 
CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes... 
TOM That's enough... 
The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration. 
DAISY Open another window. 
NICK There aren't any more. 
DAISY Then telephone for an axe... 
TOM Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it. 
GATSBY Why not let her alone, old sport? 
TOM That's a great expression of yours, isn't it? 
GATSBY What is? 
Tom turns to Gatsby... 
TOM 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up? 
DAISY Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute. 
Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly. 
TOM Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man. 
GATSBY No, not exactly. 
TOM Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford. 
GATSBY Yes - I went there. 
Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting. 
TOM Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford! 
DAISY Tom...! 
Gatsby stands. 
GATSBY (slow, intense) I told you I went there. 
TOM I heard you, but I'd like to know when. 
GATSBY You'd like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. 
Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war. 
Nick can't help but smile. 
NICK (V.O.) I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back. 
DAISY I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... 
But Tom's not done yet. 
GATSBY You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you. 
TOM Nonsense. 
DAISY (with visible effort) I am, though. 
TOM She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler! 
Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby. 
TOM (CONT'D) Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim's bunch. 
Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly. 
TOM (CONT'D) See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter! 
GATSBY What about it, old sport? 
TOM Don't call me `old sport!' This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now. 
GATSBY Well your friend Walter Chase isn't too proud to come in on it. 
TOM I've been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim? 
GATSBY It's called `greed,' old sport. 
TOM That's right; you've got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... (TO NICK) I'm surprised he hasn't tried to drag you in... 
Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this. 
TOM (CONT'D) My God, he has... 
GATSBY He's got nothing to do with-- 
TOM With your little racket... (TO DAISY) Daisy... Can't you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he's just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...! 
GATSBY (a vicious sneer) The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that's it, and now I've just as much as you; so that means we're equal!! 
Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn. 
TOM Oh no, no, we're different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and JORDAN) They are... (now at Daisy) SHE IS; (MORE) 
TOM (CONT'D) we're all different from you - we were born different, it's in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...! 
Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage. 
GATSBY SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!! 
Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart... 
NICK (V.O) Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had "killed a man." 
Tom snorts a dismissive laugh. 
TOM That's right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners... 
Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears. 
DAISY My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper. 
Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists. 
GATSBY Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don't listen to him Daisy. 
Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently. 
GATSBY   (CONT'D) We're going back   to Louisville to be married. Then   we're going to live together in   our house; it's-- 
There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room. 
CLOSE ON: Nick. 
NICK (V.O.) He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on... 
DAISY Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore! 
Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom. 
TOM You two start on home... (TO GATSBY) In Mr. Gatsby's car. 
Daisy is alarmed now. 
TOM (CONT'D) Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over. 
Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her. 
GATSBY Daisy...! 
Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel. 
TOM Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick? 
NICK What? 
TOM Want any? 
NICK No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I'm thirty. 
Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink... 
TOM Happy birthday... 
Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought... 
NICK (V.O.) Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness... 
CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization. 
PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror. 
The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up. 
MICHAELIS Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job. 
Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry... 
WILSON You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! 
Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson. 
TOM (a soothing gruffness) Pull yourself together... 
Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into: 
INT. WILSON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely. 
TOM Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon. 
The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom. 
POLICEMAN What color's your car? 
TOM Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York. 
MICHAELIS Yeah, they just stopped... 
The policeman accepts, suspicious still... 
POLICEMAN Alright... Blue. 
In the relative calm of the office, Wilson's clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom. 
WILSON Who owns the yella' car...? 
TOM (a tiny pause) Fella named Gatsby; he's a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about... 
WILSON Maybe he was the one foolin' with Myrtle; maybe that's why he killed her...? 
TOM Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows... 
Wilson starts sobbing again. 
WILSON Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! 
He rests his head on Tom's shoulder... 
Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers... 
TOM Gatsby. Something outta be done about a fella like that. He'll pay... Oh, he'll pay... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TOM'S COUPÉ - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: Tom driving. He sobs... 
TOM The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car... 
Jordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, triumphantly accusing... 
TOM (CONT'D) You gonna defend him now, huh? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT 
The coupe drifts slowly up the drive. 
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT 
As they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the situation in a few brisk phrases. 
TOM I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... 
Tom opens the door. 
NICK No thanks. I'll wait outside. 
Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain. 
TOM What is the matter with you? 
Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick's arm. 
JORDAN Won't you come in, Nick? 
NICK No... thanks. 
JORDAN It's only half past nine... 
NICK No. I think I've had enough... Of everyone. 
CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... 
But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside... 
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT 
As Nick's feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows... 
Looking up from the bottom of the pool we see a crowd of staring faces and the pop of flashbulbs through water... 
NICK (V.O.) ...of police and photographers and tabloid reporters. (MORE) 
NICK (V.O.) (CONT'D) The headlines were a nightmare... They pinned everything on Gatsby. 
THROUGH THE WATER HEADLINES FADE IN: 
"BOOTLEGGER KILLS MISTRESS!" 
NICK (V.O.) The affair with Myrtle... 
"HIT AND RUN" 
NICK (V.O.) The hit and run... 
"GATSBY GUILTY OF MURDER!" 
NICK (V.O.) Everything. 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY 
ECU: Gatsby's ghostly face... 
NICK (V.O.) And there was nothing I could say except the one unutterable fact that none of it was true... 
PULL TO REVEAL: Gatsby, immaculately attired, is laid out in a silver coffin and crowded by a crush of policemen, photographers and reporters... 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - PORTICO - DAY 
TOP SHOT: Servants carry endless luggage through the hall, down the stairs, and out the front door... 
BRRIIING!!! A phone rings OFF-SCREEN. 
At the bottom of the stairs, DISCOVER: Daisy and Pammy. 
DAISY (explains to Pammy) Daddy's taking care of his two favorite girls... 
BRRIIING!!! 
PAMMY But where are we going? 
DAISY Just for a little trip. Just you, me, and daddy... 
BRRIIING!!! 
Tom appears beside Daisy. 
TOM (TENDERLY) We should go. 
BRRIIING!!! Finally, at the top of the stairs, Henri answers. 
HENRI Buchanan residence. 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 
DISCOVER: Nick sits atop the deco stairs, telephone in hand. 
Gatsby coffin is directly below... 
NICK May I speak to Mrs. Buchanan? It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin... 
HENRI (O.S.) Madame is not available. 
NICK Well, when you see her, will you tell her, the funeral's tomorrow? 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - PORTICO - CONTINUOUS 
Henri looks down to Tom, who shoots a "we're not here" look. 
HENRI I'm sorry, but... They have gone away. 
NICK (O.S.) Gone away...? Do you know when they'll be back. 
HENRI No. 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 
NICK Please, I know she would want to be there. If you could just get a message to her-- 
HENRI (O.S.) I have no further information monsieur. Au revoir. 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - PORTICO - CONTINUOUS 
CLICK. Henri abruptly hangs up. 
NICK (O.S.) Hello...? Hello!? 
The Buchanan family exits... 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As Nick slowly, bitterly hangs up the telephone... 
NICK (V.O.) They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and people and then retreated back into their money and their vast carelessness... 
He looks to the throng of press swarming like vultures around Gatsby's casket. Seized by fury, he snaps and screams as he advances down the stairs! 
NICK GET OUT! ALL OF YOU OUT! GET OUT...!!! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT 
Time has passed. Nick sits on the steps slouched against the rail. He looks down to Gatsby's still face, sad, alone...

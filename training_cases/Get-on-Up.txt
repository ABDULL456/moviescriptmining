EXT. ROAD. AUGUSTA. 1988. 
A hot muggy Georgia morning. A pickup truck comes around a corner and moves towards us. Inside, music plays on the radio. We can't quite see who's driving. 
2   INT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/AUGUSTA STREETS. MOMENTS LATER         2 
The driver heads down the road. He beats his hand on the steering wheel to the rhythm of the music. The driver turns up the music. As the rhythm speeds, so does the truck. 
3   INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME                                    3 
A WOMAN, 40, sits on toilet within a stall using the bathroom. She's smoking a cigarette. 
4   EXT. PARKING LOT. MOMENTS LATER.                             4 
Cars parked in rows. The pickup pulls into the lot and screech-stops. 
INT. ADJACENT OFFICE. INSURANCE SEMINAR. DAY. 
About 30 people are attending a seminar. Behind a SEMINAR PRESENTER, The truck can be seen outside a window, stereo thumping. 
SEMINAR PRESENTER Which brings us on to Dental Insurance. Generally speaking, when you receive care from a participating PDP dentist, your out- of-pocket expenses will typically be lower than if your were to accept care from a dentist outside the group. The law deems it illegal for dentists to charge any more than the network approves... But listen, in my three and a half years of experience in this business people mainly care about keeping their premiums low. So, each of you must be prepared to sell the network to your clients and always cater to their specific condition. 
Annoyed, the presenter turns momentarily to the truck. 
INT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK / PARKING LOT 
A fifty-five year, out of shape black man in mirror shades and a shell-suit. He's breathing heavily. Patting the dashboard, as the song ends. The man sits there a moment and exits. 
JAMES BROWN hitches up his pants, and walks across the lot. 
INT. NONDESCRIPT OFFICE 
There's no one around. He's jumpy. His movements odd. Twitchy. 
JAMES (To himself) Where's everybody? 
Around a corner he comes face to face with a cleaner, MAVIS, who is wearing headphones as she vacuums. 
Mavis screams and removes her headphones. 
MAVIS Mr. Brown. You scared me! 
JAMES Mavis. Where's everybody at? I got a meetin' this mornin'. 
MAVIS It's Sunday, Mr. Brown. 
JAMES No, it's Tuesday, Mavis. 
James is caught flat-footed. SOMEWHERE OFF a toilet flushes. 
He rounds the corner. No-one. Opens the bathroom door. Looks inside. Sniffs. Slams it and storms off down the corridor passing a sign outside his office that reads: GET ON UP. 
INT./EXT. ADJACENT OFFICE/ PARKING LOT. DAY. 
As the INSURANCE SEMINAR presenter continues, the woman who was on the toilet takes her seat. 
SEMINAR PRESENTER Now, understand that not all people have the same type of needs. When it comes to an insurance plan everyone is different. (MORE) 
SEMINAR PRESENTER (CONT'D) You can't possibly sell the same monthly premium to just anyone who strolls through your door. If you learn one lesson this weekend, let it be this: We must accommodate the specific condition of the client. Bottom line! Their needs are- 
The adjoining door flies opens as James enters, pissed. 
JAMES OK Stop. Sir. Stop. Who been in there? 
SEMINAR PRESENTER Excuse me? 
JAMES I own this building, someone has been in there used my commode. Now who was it? 
SEMINAR PRESENTER Sorry. We're actually renting this part of the building today, and we're in the middle of a seminar. 
JAMES I don't care if you're in the middle of a heart attack son. Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was? 
INSURANCE SALESMAN It is. It's fuckin' him. 
BACK AT THE FRONT someone sniggers. 
James spins round. SILENCE. Someone sniggers behind him. James spins back round and approaches the salesman. 
JAMES Something funny? 
INSURANCE SALESMAN No, sir. 
JAMES Then why you cats laughing? 
INSURANCE SALESMAN I wasn't laughing. It wasn't me. 
James stares at the man. Turns on his heel. 
He storms out of the building and across the lot to his pickup truck 
THE PAYBACK starts: insanely tight, deep funk. 
A police car pulls up next to him, the officer aiming a weapon and flagging the car down. James sees him and flinches. 
JAMES Don't hurt me. Don't stop me. Don't stop me. 
He rams the cop car. It retreats. 
EXT. I-20. DAY 
Three prowlers and a highway patrol RV form a road block. A high engine note pierces the air. The police take up firing positions. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK. DAY 
James sees the roadblock ahead. 
JAMES Don't stop me. Don't stop me. 
He smashes through road block. The windscreen is blown out with gunfire showering James with glass. 
He glances in the mirror as wind whips around the truck: 
Up ahead another police car sits in the middle of the road. A policeman steps out from the car firing his pistol at the pickup truck. 
James makes a hard right down a dirt road. 
INT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK. GRAVEL PITTS, DAY 
James's front tires are blown out. James struggles to control the skidding vehicle. 
JAMES C'mon. C'mon. 
EXT. GRAVEL PITTS, DAY 
The pickup truck rolls to a stop. Five various police cars from different jurisdictions enter the Pitts from five different entrances and take up positions blocking exit routes. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK. DAY. 
James sits staring straight ahead. Breathing hard. A loud hailer off screen: "EXIT THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD." James opens the door scattering glass onto the ground. 
Around the perimeter armed police tense. Safety's off. Keeping James in their sights. A young officer sweats nervously. 
James stands next to the bullet riddled wreckage of his pickup, hands above his head. He leans back and sings to the sky. 
JAMES "I Don't Feel Noways Tired". 
EXT. AUGUSTA COUNTRY CLUB.   NIGHT.   1942   JAMES 9 YRS 
A wide, opulent looking club has taken residence in a huge antebellum home with wrap around porches. 
A crowd of Deep Southern white folk, in cocktail attire, fill both levels of the porches and spill out onto the lawn surrounding a BOXING RING. 
A GROUP OF SIX BLACK MUSICIANS FORM A DIXIELAND BAND. Without inspiration they play methodically to the all white crowd. 
A FAT, SWEATING ANNOUNCER, walks into the ring, grasps a dangling mic. 
ANNOUNCER Aaannd now folks, before the main event, the Augusta Country club is proud to present to y'all it's Annual Charity ex-travagaaanza..! (Drum-roll) Ladies and gentlemen..The Battle... Royale! 
Music. HALF A DOZEN BLACK BOYS enter the ring. Hyped. A glove is pulled onto one hand. The other tied behind their backs. They are blind-folded. 
A WHITE MAN with a BUCKET OF WHITE PAINT daubs a number onto each boy's chest. 
DING! DING! The boys stagger out, blindly swinging. The crowd roars, bangs the tables as they stumble, lurch, in the baying din. 
The smallest of the boys stands stiff. He struggles to throw much less land a punch. The number "One" is painted on his chest. 
A much bigger boy, "Number Six" punches "One" in the gut. "One" goes down but then slowly rises. 
The dixieland band watches the exploitation with both horror and intrigue as they can't help but wonder who will be left standing. 
The band's sound begins to change. It becomes as energized as the match before them. They sink into the rhythm, and the effect is one of heightened energy. 
The drummer begins to pull the beat and the bass player instantly follows suit finding the new pocket. The drummer and bass player share a glance. 
This inspired pocket soars across the lawn and into the ears of boy "Number One". 
We are now transported into the mind of "Number One". Complete silence except for the sound of the band. Then one by one all other instruments fade away leaving only the drum and bass. 
James turns to the band and lowers his blindfold from over one eye. He catches eyes with the drummer and bass player. The drummer nods at James and smiles. 
James nods back and closes his eye. The sound morphs again as "Number One" begins to arrange the music in his head to his own liking. 
James opens his one eye and sees only the drummer and bass player on the stage. They are now playing what we and James are hearing in his head. 
James covers his eye again with the blindfold and forms a slight smile. His stance becomes more relaxed. His body begins to swing and morph like rubber. 
He throws a punch. IT LANDS. 
ALL AT ONCE "Number One" dances forward, dips, swings and sweetly CONNECTS to "Number Four". As the vanquished head hits the canvas, the victor, "Number One", bloodied, panting in the waves of laughter and summer heat, stands alone. 
As the boys hit the deck and are deemed "out" they are pulled off the mat and carried to the bed of a parked truck. 
"Three" goes down. Then "Two" and "Five". A ringside punter THUMPS the canvas with a fistful of dollars, berating him. People screaming with laughter. Only "One" and "Six" remain. Panicky, jerky, they stalk one another. Listening. 
"Number One" connects with lighting speed. "Six" removes his blindfold, jumps off the ring and runs across the lawn disappearing into the nearby woods. 
"Number One" stands victorious. The crowd goes wild. "Number One" absorbs the admiration as he slowly pushes up the blindfold and looks toward the bandstand. 
All the band members have returned to the stand as in reality they always were. They clap wildly as the beat and rhythm of this budding continues in his head. 
THE EIGHT YEAR OLD JAMES BROWN LOOKS RIGHT AT US. A level gaze. That million dollar smile, teeth coated with blood. 
The Infantrymen laugh and slap hands. As they walk toward stage... 
NEWS JOURNALIST (To Cameraman) We can't use that. 
INT. PLANE. IN THE COCKPIT. 
PILOT                          SOLDIER I'm losing her. We're going     Oh mother of Christ! down. 
The wounded beast judders in low over the canopy and starts sinking into it when the jungle suddenly clears. 
EXT. TAN SON NHUT AIRFIELD 9TH DIV INFANTRY CAMP OUTSIDE NOM PEI. JUNE 1968. SAME TIME 
The damaged plane breaks out over the field with both engines smoking. Barely regaining control, the pilots make a very hard landing. 
MUSIC: "There Was A Time" begins. 
Army personnel race toward the plane. Next to the runway an old hanger is teeming with soldiers. 
EXT. AIRFIELD. MOMENTS LATER 
Biblically pissed, James and Bobby walk from the flaming plane alongside CORPORAL DOOLEY. 
Behind them, in deep shock, Maceo and the rest of the band, clutching instruments. 
CORPORAL DOOLEY Welcome to Bear Cat, Mr. Brown. Corporal Dooley. USO Liaison officer. Can I first say I'm a big, big fan of your mus- 
JAMES You in charge when Bob Hope was over Corporal? 
CORPORAL DOOLEY (proudly) I was. 
JAMES (to Bobby) Mr. Byrd, You think Bob Hope's plane got shot down? 
BOBBY No sir, Mr. Brown. 
As they approach the hanger filled with troops, a chant begins inside. 
TROOPS James Brown! James Brown!   James Brown! 
CORPORAL DOOLEY (Tightly) Sorry about the plane trouble- 
JAMES Plane trouble? They tried to kill James Brown today. You wanna go down in history as the man who killed the funk? 
James and crew near the rear stage entrance of the hanger. 
CORPORAL DOOLEY. About the show, if you could just keep it to 25, 30 min- 
JAMES. (Interrupting) Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
BOBBY (under his breath) Oh no. 
JAMES Corporal, let me tell you the first thing about James Brown. The first thing is James Brown don't tell no man his business. He won't tell you how to take Pnom Ridge or how you screwed up the Tet offensive. I don't tell you how to fight your war Corporal. So don't tell me when, where or for how long I can be funky. 
25   INT. HANGAR. CONTINUOUS.                                        25 
HUNDREDS OF HOT, STEAMING TROOPS ROAR, like a thousand space rockets taking off at once. It's awesome, shaking the stage. 
TROOPS James Brown! James Brown!    James Brown! 
James and Bobby enter the hanger. We walk with them and strut up six steps and onto the stage. 
Bobby stands back and watches as James grabs the mic and looks out over the sea of faces. 
JAMES Sorry we're late.    Are you cats ready? 
The troops roar even louder. 
James turns straight to camera, flashes his smile and talks directly to us. 
JAMES (CONT'D) (quietly) Are you cats ready? 
EXT. A PINE WOOD. 1941. DAY.    JAMES 8 YRS 
A cold fog hangs in the fading sunlit trees. 
Eight year old James stands alone in a forest clearing. He looks all around him. 
JAMES Momma? 
He scans the trees. He's alone. 
SUDDENLY in the trees he glimpses someone. A woman. 30. Red dress. She giggles as she scampers from behind one tree to another. She peeps round. He beams. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Momma! 
He chases her. She's laughing. 
SUSIE You can't catch me! 
Each time he loses her she peers from behind a tree he squeals in delight but she disappears. He is suddenly alone. 
JAMES (Scared) Momma? 
She jumps out from behind a tree and scoops him up. 
SUSIE I gotcha! 
He squeals and laughs in her arms. 
EXT. WOODED PATH. DAY. 1941 
James stares at Ben in the mirror. 
JAMES Gertrude! 
Gertrude walks in. 
GERTRUDE Yes, Mr. Brown. 
JAMES I said I didn't want to be disturbed. (holds out his hand) That'll be twenty dollars. 
Gertrude walks over and hands James the same twenty spot Ben gave her. Ben winks at Gertrude as she exits. 
BEN BART James, I just spoke to the producers. They've requested the Rolling Stones close the show. 
James looks confused. 
JAMES Huh? 
BEN BART Rolling Stones, James. You'll go on right before them. It'll be you, then the Rolling Stones top of the bill. 
JAMES The Rolling Stones, huh? 
James to Bobby. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Then why we here, Bobby? 
BOBBY We here to play, James. 
BEN BART You're here because they want you here, James. You're James Brown! I want you here. Because this isn't the chitlin' circuit man. We're done with that shit. This is an audience full of white faces and you're gonna make them love you. You're just not closing the show. 
His eyes focus. 
BEN BART (CONT'D) James. Now don't start. Let it go. 
BOBBY This don't matter, James. 
THE DOOR FLIES OPEN. JAMES BROWN STRUTS DOWN THE CORRIDOR AS BEN BART FOLLOWS. 
JAMES The Rolling Stones ain't even had a hit record here. 
They pass several dressing rooms along the way. 
JAMES (CONT'D) They ain't even ever played in America. Have they? 
James passes a dressing room where a group is rehearsing. 
BEN BART They're just kids. In a year from now we won't even know who they are. It's business, James. 
JAMES And it's my business to hear what they got to say about this. 
He passes another dressing room with a group of guys harmonizing. 
James stops, glances at the VERY WHITE CALIFORNIA GROUP and then to Ben. 
BEN BART James, don't... 
James is off again. He rounds the corner walks straight up to the Stones dressing room. On the door it says THE ROLLING STONES. 
A guy on the door stands but knows he can't stop James Brown who walks straight in. Ben stops at the door and watches. 
JAMES BROWN Fellas, how ya doin'. Mr. Jagger. Mr. Richard. Hear you boys are closing the show. Did you know that? 
MICK JAGGER Uh..That's what they're saying. Yeah. They just told us. 
Mick looks over to Keith and the rest of the Rolling Stones. 
JAMES BROWN Uh-hmm. Well, I was told I'm closing the show. That's why I flew out here. 
Mick leads James to a couch. They sit. 
MICK JAGGER Listen man. We're filming a movie here today. This isn't live. 
JAMES I know that. 
MICK JAGGER What I mean is, the order in which we play makes no difference. They're going to edit and arrange the show any way they want later. 
James raises and shakes Mick's hands. James shakes a couple of the other guys hands. 
JAMES BROWN Y'all have a great show, fellas. 
We march out with James. He turns to Ben. 
JAMES I'll be on stage in five. They better be ready. And the white people. 
BEN BART Yes Sir, Mr. Brown. 
JAMES struts to the side of the stage. On a television backstage we see a live feed of: 
ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: THE SUPREMES FINISHING THEIR PERFORMANCE. 
James waits in the wings. On the other side of the stage, the Rolling Stones watch. James flashes his trademark smile. They all wave back. 
Archival Footage: 
JAN AND DEAN approach the microphone and introduce the flames. 
ZAP -a white follow spot burns into James as he stands head bowed. Check jacket, waistcoat, black pipes and mirror boots. 
He throws his head back, steps forward and the groove starts. The screams rise to a deafening pitch- 
James, 19 years old, sits on a bare wooden chair. James' aunt, HONEY, 40, is in attendance. Next to her sit two young black women dressed very sexy. 
WARDEN So you want to be a singer? 
JAMES Oh no Sir. Truth is I ain't really into all that so much. Not no more. 
Five white adults sit behind a long table, studying him. 
WARDEN But the other boys, they call you Music-box. 
JAMES It's just a old nickname is all. I'm looking for something stable. Steady. I want to be a Mechanic. 
WARDEN So first a singer and now a Mechanic? 
JAMES Yes Sir. There's a fella I know back in Augusta, he owns a garage, he said he could find me a job if- 
WARDEN You can't go back to Augusta. In the event of parole, the Court in Augusta ruled you not be allowed to set foot in Richmond County til the full term of your sentence. 
James is silent. Aunt Honey locks eyes with the Warden and smiles. 
WARDEN (CONT'D) Do you know anyone outside Augusta who could act as your parole sponsor? Any family? Associates? Is there anywhere else you could go? 
Aunt Honey and the girls raise their skirts up there legs ever so slightly with subtle sexual gestures. 
The Warden gives Aunt Honey and the girls a disapproving stare. 
STAMP! A red stamp hammers down - REFUSED. 
INT. HALL. ALTO. DAY.   JAMES 19 YRS 
A BAND, The Starlighters "entertains" the inmates. A tall black kid in a white tux, flanked by four other boys. 
BOBBY BYRD We the Gospel Starlighters, from right here in Toccoa. Three Four.. 
The vocal group rip into a juiced up "Mary Don't You Weep". And its good. James watches intently. The music plays over... 
James begins to sing along and dance. Two rows back, a huge, badass looking kid is staring. James turns and stares straight back. 
The big kid walks up to James. 
BIG KID You eyeballin' me, Music-Box? 
The big kid punches James in the gut. James struggles to his feet and punches the BIG KID and fights back fearlessly. 
All hell breaks loose. Two rough factions break out and the melee spreads. James picks up a chair and throws it at the big kid. He ducks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INFIRMARY, ALTO. LATER THAT DAY 
Bobby sits in a chair outside the infirmary.   He holds a cold press to his nose. 
James, bruised and torn but apparently victorious is led by a warden into the infirmary to cheers from his friends. He's seated next to Bobby and cuffed to the chair. 
JAMES What happened to you? 
BOBBY Someone threw something. 
JAMES Gee, that's too bad. 
They sit there. James shrugs. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Walk in the jungle sometimes you get bit by a snake. 
BOBBY (Deadpan) I'll try an' remember that. 
They sit there. 
JAMES Say. What's that song you done? 
BOBBY We only done half of it. "Mary Don't You Weep" is an old gospel, man. You ain't heard that before? Everybody be doin' it. 
JAMES BROWN I ain't heard nothing since my radio got busted. That's a cool song bro'. You sung it great. That sounded real sweet. 
BOBBY BYRD Crowd sure went crazy. (James smiles. Then:) You like music? 
JAMES Only thing keeps me sane in here. 
BOBBY How long you in for? 
JAMES Five to thirteen years. 
Bobby moves his chair an inch or two away. 
BOBBY What did you do? 
JAMES Robbed a suit. 
A nurse leads Bobby inside the exam room. 
BOBBY They give you five to thirteen for... (Shakes his head) That's time man. 
James turns to the doorway and continues talking to Bobby as the nurse tends to his nose. 
JAMES Tell me about it. 
BOBBY You get parole? 
JAMES Board say I need a permanent family address and a job. But see I don't know no folks here. 
JAMES (CONT'D) A house smells good. I'm happy I stole that suit. And I thank you for having me here. 
GRANDPA Boy, pass them beans before you get your bullshit all over them. 
MRS. BYRD (Changing subject) James is going to sing with us in church this Sunday Sarah. 
SARAH BYRD Really. Well maybe we could work up a little harmony together. 
Sarah turns to James and gives a tiny wink. James stops chewing. 
52A   INT. BYRD HOUSE. NEXT MORNING.                             52A 
Bobby Byrd sleeps in his bed. James sleeps in a cot that has been brought into Bobby's room. 
Grandpa Byrd enters the room holding a suit.    He approaches the sleeping James. 
GRANDPA BYRD Jailbird! 
Startled, James and Bobby rise up from their pillows. 
GRANDPA BYRD (CONT'D) (to James) This out to fit ya. 
Grandpa Byrd throws the suit on top of James and exits. James smiles at his new suit. 
INT. BYRD HOUSE. NEXT MORNING. 
Bobby comes in with NAFLOYD and BABY ROY who are all dressed for church 
BOBBY There's coffee in the kitchen, Nafloyd. Make yourselves at home. (Calls) James! 
Bobby vaults upstairs. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) James. Come meet the band. 
Opens a door. INSIDE James has Sarah pressed up against the wall. They are having vigorous sex. James' pants are around his ankles. Sarah's church dress is pushed up her body. 
Sarah has her hand over James' mouth trying to keep him quiet. 
Bobby throws it into reverse, shutting the door. Did he just see that? A full gamut of emotions cross his face. 
Mrs. Byrd starts up the stairs. 
MRS. BYRD Sarah! I ain't tellin' you again. Get down here. 
Bobby panics.   He crosses and meets his mother at the top of the stairs. 
BOBBY She's coming, Momma. She's coming. 
MRS. BYRD Sarah! 
BOBBY Go fix Nafloyd and the boys some coffee. We got guests, Momma. 
Mrs Byrd nods and heads down the stairs. 
MRS. BYRD Nafloyd?! Where you boys at? 
INT. ST. STEPHENS CHURCH. DAY. 
A congregation watches as BOBBY, NAFLOYD, BABY ROY, SARAH AND JAMES sing righteous gospel. "Steal Away To Jesus". 
Above their heads a HOME-MADE SHEET-BANNER: "The Gospel Starlighters" 
Bobby looks to Sarah and James with a searing gaze. Sarah innocent, James really giving it up. 
James steps out front. His voice soars sweetly over the congregation. Bobby's gaze softens. 
MRS. BYRD and GRANDPA watch on. Mrs. Byrd leans forward and catches Bobby's eye. Gives a small nod of approval. Bobby's smile is...more equivocal. 
FLASHBACK: INT. SHACK. BARNWELL. DAY. 1942 JAMES 9 YRS 
James is asleep in his bed. Alone. It's been a year after his momma left. 
Suddenly, Joe approaches and throws a burlap sack at James. 
JOE BROWN Pack up. We leaving. 
James wakes and sits up in bed. Joe is clean shaven and wears his nicest shirt and neck tie. 
JOE BROWN (CONT'D) Hurry up. 
James waits a beat to make sure his father is gone. 
James gets out of bed and crawls deep underneath. He backs out holding the dead man's pair of shoes and places them in the burlap sack. 
57   EXT. AUNT HONEY'S HOUSE. LATER THAT DAY.                         57 
Joe and James walk down Twigg street.      Joe pulls his donkey along with them. 
JOE BROWN You miss your momma, boy? 
James nods. 
JOE BROWN (CONT'D) We gone fix that. 
James flashes a hopeful smile. 
EXT. TWIGG STREET, THE TERRY. DAY. 1942    JAMES 9 YRS 
Red dirt street. Shacks. Joe and James walk around to the back of "AUNT HONEY'S" house. The donkey has been tied to Aunt Honey's fence. 
LITTLE RICHARD We'll be back in ten to flip you again! Whoooo! Yeah! 
Bobby scans the crowd. 
BOBBY BYRD (Frustrated) Look at these people James. Man! I'm ready. You know'm saying? When it gone be us up there? 
James hasn't moved. He's still staring at the stage. 
JAMES BROWN Now. 
BOBBY BYRD What? 
James turns to Bobby. 
JAMES BROWN There's a piano. And a stage. And right now. (Looks at it) Ain't no one on it. 
NAFLOYD What you talking about? We can't go up there. 
JAMES BROWN Why not? Like you said, Nafloyd, "We just playin' around with "Caldonia". So let's go play around. 
Bobby nods, and James strides towards the stage and gets up. The others look at each other: HOLY SHIT! and scramble after him. James gestures to them to pick up instruments. 
JAMES BROWN (CONT'D) Ladies `n Gentlemen. Hope you're enjoying the show. 
Nafloyd speaks into his mic. 
NAYFLOYD We're the Star- 
James quickly interrupts. 
JAMES We're the Famous Flames. 
Nafloyd looks at Bobby. 
NAFLOYDS Flames? 
BABY ROY Famous? 
James hollers. The Flames hit their queue, bang on, and they TEAR INTO Caldonia. James loosens with every bar. Unhooks the mic. Throws a move. As he hits the hook again the audience is drawn to his energy like a magnet. 
BACKSTAGE DOOR - Leaning against a wall backstage, Little Richard looks up from his pocket mirror. Frowns. 
LITTLE RICHARD What is that? 
IN THE WINGS - the club manager watches on unsure what to do. 
ON STAGE - James and Bobby, hollering into the same mic are ripping the place up. 
IN THE WINGS - Little Richard appears at his side, fuming. 
LITTLE RICHARD (CONT'D) Get those bitches off my stage! 
Power to the stage is cut off. The performance is over but the crowd go batshit. NAFLOYD, BABY ROY are shaking. 
NAFLOYD We the Flames. 
BOBBY looks at JAMES. A new, knowing look. They bow as one, turn, and walk offstage, CLEAN PAST a furious Little Richard. James returns his glare with an even straighter one. 
JAMES BROWN (Deadpan) Just keepin' it warm for ya. 
He walks past. 
LITTLE RICHARD Hey. What's your name? 
JAMES The Famous Flames. 
James looks back levelly. 
LITTLE RICHARD No. What's your name? 
They look at each other. Neither blinks. 
EXT. MALT SHOP. NIGHT. 
2AM. James sits alone at a table off to the side of the order window. 
Little Richard dressed as a chef comes out of the kitchen and drops two burgers in front of them. James and Richard, cigarette in a long holder, holds forth. 
LITTLE RICHARD I play a show in Lafayette last week twenty thirty girls pass clean out. Need oxygen. I'm killing `em James. They should lock me away. I cut loose it's like a spaceship land. Did I say I got a record out? They drop it five times a day on WIBB. Five times a day. (He looks at James) And I'm flippin' burgers. You know why? (MORE) 
LITTLE RICHARD (CONT'D) Cause WIBB antenna reach 60 mile. 60 mile. This country is 5000 miles top to toe and 7000 coast to coast. You catch the wind, get a hit, a real hit, every inch of that is yours. 
JAMES BROWN So how we catch the wind? 
Richard smiles. Stops the waitress. All charm. 
LITTLE RICHARD Sugar, may I borrow your pencil? 
He takes a napkin. Starts writing on it. All business. 
LITTLE RICHARD (CONT'D) You got a hundred bucks? 
JAMES BROWN No. 
LITTLE RICHARD Rob a liquor store. You take a hundred bucks to WIBB in Macon. Ask for Big Sauk. Say Richard sent you. You make an acetate. Ten copies. You send them to these people. 
He writes them down. James watches. 
JAMES BROWN It's that easy why don' you do it? 
JAMES Bobby. I can't make practice Thursday. I gotta get married. 
BOBBY (Whispers) What are you talkin' about? Who you marryin'? 
JAMES That chick I met after the Stone Mountain Show. Velma. 
A silence falls. 
BOBBY What about my sister? 
James flashes a devilish smile. 
JAMES Oh, I'll still harmonize with Sarah from time to time. 
BOBBY I ain't playin', James. How you gone do all this? 
JAMES Do all what? 
BOBBY Practice. The road. Makin' records. Startin' a family. 
JAMES I ain't startin' nothin', Bobby. Except what we doin'. 
James reaches under the bed and pulls out the acetate they just recorded. 
JAMES (CONT'D) That us. We in there Bobby. 
James holds the record close and studies it with Bobby. 
BOBBY That's all the money we got. And some we don't. 
JAMES But, it is beautiful. All those little grooves. That's us. It's been written. (MORE) 
JAMES (CONT'D) Now, men gone lay with women. That's nature. But a woman ain't never gone stop a real man from what he's supposed to do. That's God. Husband? Daddy? That gives a man purpose. Man gotta have purpose. But purpose don't stop me neither, Bobby. Ain't nothin' gone stop us. Nothin'. And that's God too. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHENETTE. 1955. DAY.   JAMES 22 YRS 
James Brown stares back at his infant son with the same wary look. 
JAMES You gone smile for me, Teddy Brown? 
He bounces him on his knee once. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Come on, boy. 
Twice. The kid smiles. James suddenly becomes moved. He leans over and kisses his son. 
VELMA We out of greens. You want me to go pick some up? 
Velma, a cute nineteen year old girl is fixing dinner. 
JAMES No baby. 
A car horn outside. He looks out the window. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Baby. I gotta go. 
VELMA But I got your supper. 
He hands her the baby, kisses her passionately. She melts. 
VELMA (CONT'D) Wake me up. 
James pretends to look shocked, covers Teddy's ears. 
EXT. JAMES AND VELMA'S KITCHENETTE 
James bounds off the porch towards the station wagon. 
Velma steps onto the porch with the baby. She suddenly looks very young. 
James turns to his family and pats his hand over his heart. 
JAMES (shouts out) I got you right in here, Teddy Brown. 
Velma raises Teddy's hand and waves it at James. 
James begins to serenade "Lost Someone" to his family... 
EXT. CRAPPY STATION WAGON. RURAL ROAD - SUNSET. 1955 
CLOSE ON: 
James continues to sing. Only now he's humming as if working out a new way into "Lost Someone". 
We widen to see The Flames, Baby Roy, Nafloyd, Bobby and James pushing an old crappy Chevy station wagon down the road. Nafloyd has the easy job of keeping the steering wheel straight. 
Nafloyd is clearly annoyed by James' humming. 
JAMES BROWN Nafloyd, you know in "Let's Make It" when it goes (he hums). If you go up there and hold it, like. (hums). It's gone be sweet. Make it like you got a harmonica stuck in your throat. 
Nafloyd looks back at Bobby Byrd. 
NAFLOYD SCOTT You know what? Why don't you sing it, James? 
JAMES BROWN What? I can't sing it. It's your song man. 
NAFLOYD SCOTT But I ain't singing it right James. I just ain't. (MORE) 
James winks before the waitress walks away. 
BOBBY I gone call the Two Spot. 
James expression instantly changes. 
JAMES Oh no. 
BOBBY What? 
Over at the door, A white guy. Obviously a cop. He waves our waitress over. 
WHITE GUY Excuse me ma'am, I just came from a place called the Tuxedo Room. I'm looking for the boys who were supposed to be playing there tonight? 
JAMES (whispering) I ain't supposed to leave Bibb County without telling my parole officer. 
BOBBY Shit James! What we do? 
Bobby looks around and James has disappeared under the table. Bobby drops like a stone under the table as well. 
Bobby peers around the booth for a peek. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) He's coming this way. Oh shit. 
JAMES I can't go back to prison Bobby. 
The waitress sits the man down at a nearby table. 
WHITE GUY I've been driving across over two states looking for these boys. They have to be here in Macon. Tell ya what, I'll make it worth your while if you can tell me where they are. 
The man hands the waitress ten bucks and a business card. The woman shrugs as she reads the card. 
WAITRESS King Records? What did they do? 
WHITE GUY Everything right. 
Bobby and James look at each other. 
JAMES BROWN (pole-axed) King records? 
Bobby crawls out from under the table suddenly all business. 
BOBBY Evening, Sir. I'm Bobby Byrd this is my associate James Brown. 
James crawls out and stands before RALPH BASS. 
JAMES Hi. 
BOBBY I understand you're looking for the Famous Flames. 
LATER AT THE DINER - Bobby and James sit with Ralph Bass. The breakfast crowd has cleared out. 
RALPH BASS I'm Ralph Bass from Federal records in Cincinnati. An imprint of King Records. I heard your acetate. I want you to come to Cincinnati. I want you to make a record for King. 
Bobby looks back at him. Nods. 
BOBBY King records. As in King Records. The King records. 
The waitress arrives with a donut and a plate of steak and eggs. She places the steak and eggs in front of James and winks. 
RALPH BASS You sure put a lot into that cut. The main vocal. You got some soul right there. 
BOBBY Uh.. That's not me. That's uh. That's James. 
RALPH BASS That you singing? 
James looks BACK TO US. 
JAMES Yeah. That's me. 
EXT. FEDERAL/KING RECORDS, CINCINNATI. DAY.   1956 
James stands alone looking up at the towering building. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO. DAY. JAMES 23 
JAMES BROWN Please, Please, Please....! 
They put everything they've got into "Please, Please, Please". 
James leans into a chrome studio mic and sings: Please... please...please... He leans out and the Flames lean in to the same mic. "Please please don't go".. 
IN THE BOOTH -- 
Gene Redd mans the desk. Ralph stands nervously while SYD NATHAN, the impressively fat 60-year-old owner of King sits in jamjar spectacles and Bakelite Headphones, listening. 
JAMES Wait...wait a second here- 
Raggedly they all come to a halt. Nafloyd seems annoyed. 
NAFLOYD What we stop for? That was cookin'. 
Everyone looks pissed at James who seems agitated. Byrd's nervous they're wasting time. 
BOBBY It's OK sir we OK. We can just start right at the top. 
JAMES It ain't right. It's too slow.     We gotta pick up the pace fellas. 
JAMES I know what Mr. Bart is saying. I heard him. Loud and clear. 
He looks at them both. 
JAMES (CONT'D) I see where we goin'. Saw it this morning when your secretary called ask me to come here an hour early. Alone. I knew it six months ago. Hell, I knew it the day I was born. 
James looks back. He doesn't blink. He looks to us. 
JAMES (CONT'D) There's some things I'm gonna want. 
83A   INT. KING RECORDS. CONFERENCE ROOM. LATER THAT MORNING.    83A 
A receptionist shows the rest of the band in. The Flames join Ralph, Syd Nathan, Ben Bart, and James. 
BEN BART Come in Boys. Come in. 
There's no chairs. They stand. 
BEN BART (CONT'D) Boys, I have something to show you. 
He hands them each a record sleeve. They look down. 
BOBBY I don't understand. Is this some sort of mistake? 
NAFLOYD (Reads) His Famous Flames? 
The sleeve has clearly printed on it "James Brown and his Famous Flames." 
BABY ROY Sir, this ain't right. 
BEN BART We agree. See I believe it should say simply James Brown. The fact is Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need the Famous Flames. King records and Universal don't need the Famous Flames. But James has requested that the name remain in some form. Now if you want to stay, stay, but from now on you work for James Brown, on James Brown's records. Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole, you can go home. 
NAFLOYD (Stunned) James? 
James stares straight ahead. Nafloyd throws the record at the wall. Bobby stands there, stunned. 
Slowly, James looks at Bobby and then crosses to him. 
JAMES Bobby. It's just a name. Ain't nothing different between us. This for all us not just me. It's gone be good. 
Bobby stares back. Nafloyd steps up to James. 
NAFLOYD James Brown. I never liked you. Come on. Let's get outta here.. 
He turns and walks away with the band.    Bobby rises and follows out the door. 
PUSH IN 
On James. Bart sits down opposite him. 
BART So. Do you know what you want James? 
EXT. WOODS. DILAPIDATED CABIN. 1941. 
FLASHBACK - JAMES, aged eight, outside the shack in Barnwell, beating his stick against the shack. 
YOUNG JAMES (Incredulous) I know exactly what I want. 
INT. KING RECORDS. CINCINNATI. DAY.    1962   JAMES 29 YRS 
SYD NATHAN Forget it. King doesn't make live albums. They're too expensive. 
JAMES I think a live album- 
SYD NATHAN James, your audience is Negro. Negroes don't buy albums. They don't have the resources. Especially not for a bunch a songs they already got. 
James turns to Ben Bart. 
BEN BART James, Recording live is five, six times as expensive as the studio. And that's for some violin concerto at the Met. No one jumps up and shouts "Blow it fucker!" in the middle of The Magic Flute. 
JAMES But, Pop, you know my show. 
James turns to Syd. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Mr. Nathan, you ain't ever even seen the show. My show. 
SYD Don't need to. 
Syd rises and begins to dance. He attempts the "Mashed Potato". 
JAMES Mr. Nathan- 
JAMES (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
SYD The "Mashed Potato". 
JAMES That ain't the "Mashed Potato". 
SYD Exactly. 
SYD (CONT'D) I can't do the "Mashed Potato". That's your job. That's the show. But what I can do is the business. 
Syd goes back to his desk and sits. 
SYD NATHAN So I stick to what I know. You stick to what you know. And that's the showbusiness. 
INT. ELITE RESTAURANT. 1962. DAY. 
Ben Bart and James, in a booth. James silent, tense. 
SYD We got the level on his main mic way up to drown out the crowd. You gotta get him to hold back a little in the first number! 
CLOSE UP: Big two inch tape magnacorders turn on brushed aluminium spindles. Recording live. 
Ben Bart looks over at James at the curtain edge. A man possessed. 
BEN BART I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane. 
James looks at Bobby. Bobby nods. James nods back. The band vamp. 
JAMES Watch me. 
The curtain opens. BANG! James Brown & the New Revue are in perfect timing looking impeccable in their new sapphire blue suits. The crowd goes wild with excitement. 
Mr. Dynamite steps on stage-- and floats and dances across bare planks like they were polished ice. He reaches the mike. 
JAMES (CONT'D) You know I feel alright. (Yeah!) You know I feel alright children. (Yeah!) I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight. 
Les Buie whacks the guitar strings and the world ceases to spin. A rising 6/8 blues riff pulses up like adrenaline. 
As he sings the song, a shock wave blasts out from the stage of the theatre on 125th street and into the Universe. 
Bobby might as well be sitting on the moon.    He never misses a beat. 
CUT TO: 
James Brown and the New Revue are tearing up their second number, "Think." 
SYD NATHAN now sits in the audience surrounded by a SEA OF BLACK FACES. We gather that Syd has never really experienced "The Show". He smiles and nods to the beat. 
Just then a female seated behind him shouts as the horns kick in. 
FEMALE IN AUDIENCE Blow it fuckers!!! 
James stares into the darkness. He's already begun to sweat. The drums stop a six punch combination from the horns dead. He reaches for the mic without looking. Leans in and locks eyes with Syd. 
JAMES Think...Think...Think...About your bad self... 
James drops to his knees. The crowd goes wild. 
A few rows behind Syd, we find Susie Brown sitting in the audience. James' mother has come to the show. 
INT. APOLLO DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT. 
After. The cheers still ringing out. People packed into his dressing room. Champagne corks pop. Congratulations from all. 
JAMES Thank you. That's very kind of you. 
Bobby, at the door. Can't get to him. Turns to Gertrude. 
BOBBY Gertrude. Get everybody out. 
GERTRUDE What? 
ACROSS THE ROOM 
JAMES We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again. 
BOBBY Mr. Brown. Excuse me. Mr. Brown. (Then) ...James. 
James stops. Turns to face Bobby's grave expression.     Bobby whispers in James' ear. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) There's a woman here, Mr. Brown. She says she's your mother. 
James stops dead. COMPLETELY STILL. We push in. He doesn't blink. 
FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET. NIGHT.      1942. JAMES 9 YRS 
Little Junior walks Twigg street at night. Passing dives and joints. 
Suddenly he stops, across the street, he sees a woman coming out of a bar arm in arm with a BLACK SOLDIER. 
He follows her up the street. She's weaving and laughing with the drunk soldier. 
JAMES Momma? 
SUSIE and the soldier walk into a side yard where a party is in full swing. 
James approaches her from behind. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Momma it's me. It's me. 
She turns. Focuses blearily. 
SOLDIER You know this little nigger? 
For a moment it looks as if there is a flicker of recognition. Then swivels her head to look at the soldier. She shakes her head. 
SOLDIER (CONT'D) Beat it. 
YOUNG JAMES But Momma! 
The soldier picks up a rock a throws it. 
SOLDIER Get the fuck out of here. 
92    INT. AUNT HONEY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 1942                        92 
Aunt Honey and James lie in bed together.   James has been crying.

BACK AT THE FISH HUT, JAMES IS TALKING TO US AS HE ORDERS A PLATE OF FISH. 
JAMES Now because he's twenty he's got strong legs. And he knows everyone. 
EXT. THE STREETS. 1965. 
THE VARIOUS DEEJAYs -- riding around town on bikes, on skates, diving out of cars, pasting up posters everywhere. 
JAMES (V.O.) He know the guy in the barber shop knows the guy at the pool hall, the guy at the garage. 
98   INSIDE JAMES PAYS FOR A LARGE PLATE OF FISH.                 98 
JAMES (to us) That way we get our record played outside Payola, we get our show promoted better, harder, cheaper, and we keep the gate. 
99   EXT. FISH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                 99 
James exits the fish house and sits down at a rickety card table with Bart. 
JAMES (to Bart) And the best part is, you can put it all through the books. Item. Promoter. (He turns to Bart) What'd you think Pop? 
BART Its beautiful Jimmy. I can't do it. 
Bart picks up a piece of fish and eats it. 
JAMES Why not? 
BART Universal Attractions promotes many acts. I can't piss off the 60 or 70 promoters in this country to skim a little extra on the James Brown Show. 
JAMES It's not a little. If the show sells, and it's sellin', we talking thousands of dollars a night. Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars. 
BART And I'm out of a job. Think you're forgetting I don't just work for James Brown. 
JAMES And there's my next point Pop. Why not? (Bart stops) (MORE) 
JAMES (CONT'D) I can do something for you, and you can do something for me, and it ain't buy me no Cadillac. Did you buy Wilson Pickett a Cadillac? Did you buy Jackie Wilson a Cadillac? You know which way this thing is going Pop. I got people around me who don't see it. 
Bart looks at him for some time as a black 1965 limousine pulls up to the fish house. 
James looks straight back to us. Smiles. Ben Bart rises and grabs a piece of fish. 
BEN BART (to James) I thank you for the fish. And I'm gonna need some benefits, boss. 
Bart crosses to the limo and leaves. 
BLACKOUT. SCREAMS. HORNS VAMPING. 
INT. THEATER. NIGHT.   1965   JAMES 32 
The whole band on stage looking sharp. Knocking the shit out of MAN'S WORLD. James falls to his knees 
James turns to backup singer, YVONNE and winks.    She winks back. 
James scans the front row and sees a very beautiful black woman, DEDE, dancing in the audience. 
James and Dede lock eyes.     The attraction immediate. 
Man's World continues over the next three scenes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECURE ROOM 
Ben Bart counts bundles of cash. He shuts a case full of money. Hands it to 300lb MINDER. An ASSISTANT tries to handcuff it to his wrist. It won't close. 
BART Po-lice have the same problem. 
Bart looks at the three hundred pound minder. Tacitly decides it's probably safe. 
EXT. STREET IN CINCINNATI. 1965. DAY. 
Two shiny cars pull up to the bank. The 300lb MINDER, and a couple of his fellas, head into the bank each carrying several suitcases full of money. 
INT. BANK. DAY. 
They form a queue as the good folk of Cincinnati stare agog. 
The carriers hand over BUNDLES AND BUNDLES OF CASH. 
BEHIND THE COUNTER The manager spots how many suitcases they have.

James is concluding his show with Please, Please, Please.     He is at the tail end of his cape routine. The cape is brilliant blue with rhinestones. 
He glances at Dede one last time from under the cape. 
INT. BACKSTAGE. POST SHOW. NIGHT. 1965 
James walks down the corridor backstage. Stops. Sniffs. Opens an equipment room door. NEW BAND MEMBER is inside smoking reefer. 
JAMES Impetigo? 
DEDE It's a skin infection. 
VELMA All that mess round his mouth. That's impetigo. It's highly infectious. 
Velma turns to Dede. 
VELMA (CONT'D) I'm just sayin' Mrs. Brown, I wouldn't go too near Teddy. Not unless you wanna catch impetigo. 
DEDE Thank you, Velma. I'll consider myself warned. 
VELMA Warned? Oh, that's a whole other conversation. Welcome to the family. 
Dede and Velma smile at each other. 
James looks at the two women then to Teddy.   He pulls Teddy in close. James turns to his other kids. 
JAMES Listen up. Which one of you cats want to fly to Reno on daddy's airplane? 
The kids all say "me!... me!" The kids, Bobby and Dede walk up the steps onto the plane as Velma gets in her car. 
James lingers. 
JAMES (CONT'D) (to Velma) You need anything? 
VELMA I'll let you know. I'm putting a big list together right now. 
Velma smiles and cranks her car.

INT. PRIVATE AIRPORT TERMINAL. LATER THAT DAY. JAMES 
James is giving a press conference to a group of journalists. 
Bobby, Teddy and Dede stand next to James. 
INTERVIEWER Welcome to Reno, Mr. Brown. What exactly do you call your style of music? 
JAMES BROWN I call it James Brown music. What I mean is, it's so far ahead of it's time that they ain't got a name for it yet. Take another record, any record from your stack at home. I don't care if it's from Motown or Stax or whatever...and put it on your box. None of them are gonna sound like mine. Not even my own old records. Just like the title says, it's a "new bag". See the funk is in the bass. The bass never changes. It's a groove, lady. Soon as you hear that groove, I know I got you. 
INTERVIEWER And what exactly is the groove? 
JAMES BROWN The groove is something you feel. The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It don't move. It's like a heartbeat. It's inside you, driving everything. Hard. Flat. A groove. 
INTERVIEWER But how exactly do you define it? 
JAMES BROWN I just did. (Then) See Miss. See there's some things, they're just too big to fit in a magazine. But we all feel it. Even little Teddy here know it when he feel it. 
James groans "Um booga chooca. Um". Teddy is lit up; thrilled. He sings. 
TEDDY "Um Booga Chooca" 
JAMES BROWN See. Right there. We all feel it together. And that's the groove. Understand? 
INTERVIEWER (Checks her questions) So what's your favorite food? 
James catches Dede's eye. She and James share a knowing look with Bobby. Bobby takes the mic as James walks away to a side room where Ben Bart is waiting. 
CUT TO: 
110   INT. AIRPORT MEETING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                   110 
BART, James study at a map. BOBBY sits across the aisle. 
BART Then we got a day between Raleigh, Carolina and Columbia two days after. 
JAMES Day off? 
BART Sure. Regroup. Rest the horses. 
JAMES We ain't payin' the horses to rest `em. Besides, we got a day off in two weeks in New Orleans. The boys can get their wives, girlfriends along, kick back. What's between Raleigh and Columbia? Spartanburg? 
BACK THE PRESS CONFERENCE: 
BOBBY BYRD Well see, James started out in Augusta. Then his family moved to Toccoa. That's where we met.

BOBBY BYRD Well there was five of us to start with. Nafloyd Scott, Baby Roy Scott, Sylvester Keels.. 
JOURNALIST And they left...

JAMES (interrupting) Bobby? What's the name of the theater in Spartanburg... 
BOBBY Uh.. The Viceroy. The.. 
JAMES The Regal! 
BOBBY Yeah. That's it. The Regal. 
JAMES (to Bart) On Howard Street and main. Hold about 750 people. Guy named Bennett used to own it. Yeah, Spartanburg. Yeah, we'll play there and I can bring in my masseuse from Anderson. 
James disappears again. 
Bobby turns his head to a hotel balcony. Vicki grabs Bobby's face and turns it back toward her. 
VICKI ANDERSON (CONT'D) Quit lookin' for James Brown and keep your eyes on me, Bobby Byrd. 
She sexily rises and goes and sits on a lounger. 
Bobby watches her all the way. She catches his eye. Looks at him, raises an eyebrow like "what you looking at?" He feigns innocence, turns, and smiles. 
116   EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - SAME TIME                              116 
James discreetly watches from behind a blind on his balcony high above.

Pee Wee, in jams, walks with a new band member, FRED WESLEY, who is still wearing a suit. 
PEE WEE Fella's this is Fred. I thought we'd show him how things work? 
Pee Wee pulls out a cheap wig from his pocket and puts it on. 
Everyone around the pool begins to laugh as Pee Wee begins demonstrating how things work to Wesley. Pee Wee is full on imitating James Brown 
PEE WEE ELLIS So when I do this.. (Turns head, stamps foot) Means you give it some punch. See. When I dip like this. (Dips hip and slides) 
BOBBY Means less sharp. Bring it down. 
Fred nods. 
PEE WEE ELLIS When I do this. (Juts chin back and forth) 
MACEO Mean I give it some heat. 
PEE WEE ELLIS Right. Now when I do this. (Stamps foot and moves elbow.) And you stab.. 
ALL On the one. 
PEE WEE ELLIS See? And when I pop his head like this, it mean. 
ALL Take it to the bridge. 
MACEO What about when he do this..? 
Maceo crunches his shoulder blades together. 
PEE WEE ELLIS I ain't ready to tell you that one yet. I'm in control Mr. Parker. Got it. Don't ask about that again. 
Pee Wee flashes his hand at Maceo. 
PEE WEE That'll be ten thousand dollars. 
The band loses their shit at this one.    Laughs all around. 
An hotel employee walks out with a note and hands it to Pee Wee. Pee Wee reads. Pee Wee removes the wig. 
PEE WEE (CONT'D) He's called a rehearsal. 
BOBBY When? 
PEE WEE Now.    We gotta go get dressed. 
MACEO You're kidding. Tell me you kidding.

The band, all in their suits, with their instruments. All glaring. One more pissed off than the next. Vicki stands in the corner. 
James is in the middle of an extended anecdote.

JAMES That's right. That it. I got these Chinese knees. (MORE) 
JAMES (CONT'D) That's how come I can dance the way I do. Anyway. One. Two. Three. Four. Hit it. 
The band starts up. During the introduction to COLD SWEAT, MACEO comes in late on the Sax. Everything stops. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Stop. Maceo. (Laughs) What you doing man? You coming in maybe a little too late. What's the matter son. You lost your feeling? 
MACEO (Flatly) No Sir. I ain't lost no feeling. 
SILENCE. James tunes into the vibe for the first time. SOMETHING's wrong. 
JAMES (Innocently) Something wrong, Maceo? (SILENCE. Directly) Is something wrong, Maceo? 
BOBBY BYRD James- 
James rounds on Bobby. 
JAMES You got something to say Mr. Byrd? (Silence. Smiling) Because a man got something to say he should say it. You got something to say?

YVONNE Why won't you say it? I said it. Why won't you say it back? 
JAMES Baby, I gotta get to my show. I can't be playin' around right now 
YVONNE I love you. 
Yvonne rests the cold glass on James' stomach.   He squirms. 
JAMES You know I don't drink. 
Yvonne pours a little champagne onto James' stomach.   She then begins licking it with her tongue. 
YVONNE Say it, Mr. Brown. Say you love me. 
In a flash James rolls over and pins Yvonne down on her back. She screams with delight. 
He whispers in her ear. 
JAMES Happy now? 
She kisses him. 
YVONNE I'm pregnant. 
James stares back at her without expression.

James walks into the rear of the packed house. 
GIRLS AND GUYS SCREAMING, DANCING. JAMES IS INVISIBLE TO THEM. 
From the rear of the house, James watches himself and the band performing on stage. He and his band are IN MID-GROOVE. A BEAUTIFUL BLACK DANCER DANCES ON A RISER BEHIND THE BAND. 
Vicki Anderson, sings backup. 
JAMES (CONT'D) That record come across. I mean it hit hard!!! Uhn!

FLASHBACK - Corridor in 1962. The Night of Live At The Apollo. 
MUSIC: Wonder When You're Coming Home plays over: 
A woman in a flower print dress and a cheap hat sits on a bench with a coat over her arm. A young Bobby comes out of the dressing room. She stands. 
INT. APOLLO DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT. 
BOOM! A flashbulb goes off. 
James sits next to his mother, on a couch, SMILING Happily, having the moment documented. She is smiling too. Bobby and other guests in the room watch the photographers. 
The photographer is ushered out of the room by Bobby Byrd. 
JAMES Bobby? Get everybody out of here and wait outside. 
Bobby ushers the guests outside. 
James sits opposite his mother. She is very, very uncomfortable but trying to appear relaxed. 
SUSIE I was on the Subway last week, and the two kids next to me was arguing who was the best, James Brown or Little Willy John. And this one boy, he was saying "James Brown the best" "There ain't no one better than James Brown", he got so mad I thought he was gonna whup this other boy. And then- 
James holds up his hand. She falls silent. 
JAMES Why tonight? (She stops, her face falls.) Why you come here? 
She starts to flap. 
SUSIE Well. Sugar, I live over in Brooklyn... and you my baby and you here playin' the Apollo. 
JAMES I don't want you to feel proud. I ain't your sugar. I ain't your baby. Not then. Not now. And I don't want you to tell anyone you my momma, because you and me know that ain't true. 
SUSIE Your daddy beat me. Beat you. I stayed because I loved you. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife. Nothin' about being a mother. I did the best I could. I did that. (MORE) 
SUSIE (CONT'D) I left because I loved you. I ain't had nothing to make no other choice. I was shamed. I was. 
He holds up his hand. 
JAMES See I thought about this. I know it weren't personal and that's why this ain't neither. It turned out fine. I didn't need you. I looked after James Brown. Made sure he was OK. No-one else. No-one help me. 
She starts to cry. 
SUSIE I never wanted to be a momma. But I carried you, boy. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife or being a momma. But I carried you and I loved you when you were in me. I chose you. I chose you. 
JAMES Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. 
He stiffly offers her a handkerchief. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Clean yourself up. That's it. 
James softens. 
JAMES (CONT'D) I'm James Brown. And James Brown don't need nothing. Don't need no- body. 
Susie looks back a James. She doesn't move. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Why are you really here? What do you want? 
She shakes her head, searching his face. James looks back unmoved. James reaches in is pocket and pulls out some money. He hands it to her. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Here. That's a hundred dollars. I'm sorry but I'm gonna ask you to leave now. 
He sits perfectly still as she gets up. She walks to the door and turns to James. 
SUSIE You're so beautiful. You're so pretty. 
Susie exits into the party outside and shuts the door. 
143   EXT. CABIN - BARNWELL S.C. 1941.   JAMES 8 YRS              143 
We return to the day that Susie left. We stay on her face as she leaves her family behind. Tears stream down her cheek. 
James tries to chase after his mother but Joe restrains him. 
Joe pulls a pistol from his belt. He fires. 
Bark explodes from a tree a few feet from where Susie is walking. 
Susie flinches but never turns. 
INT. CORRIDOR. 
Bobby waits. The door opens, and Susie comes out, tears in her eyes. She looks wildly into Bobby's face who has clearly heard everything. She runs off down the corridor. 
Bobby looks through the open door. Devastated, James sits staring at the floor. He looks up at Bobby. 
JAMES Tell Pop to make sure she's taken care of. Whatever she needs. 
As Bobby nods, James gets up, walks over to the door, and slowly closes it. 
145   INT. JAMES BROWN'S HOME. 1988. 18 YEARS LATER.              145 JAMES 55 YRS 
CLOSE ON - Numerous framed pictures of Teddy span all ages of his life now fill the top of James' dresser. 
We widen to find James Brown sitting very alone in his bedroom staring at the pictures of his son. 
He wears a bathrobe.   His hair is up in rollers. He's twitchy and sweating. 
He raises a glass pipe to his mouth, lites the PCP within and inhales it. 
JAMES Well I ain't gone tell. 
They laugh a little. When they stop, there's a long lull. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Well I was just passing. Playing a show tonight at the Omni. 
BOBBY Right. 
JAMES Say. Maybe you and Vicki could come along. We got a great new horn section. Tight. We getting there. 
BOBBY We got plans tonight. Vicki got family coming over. 
JAMES Well you think about it. See what Vicki say. 
Bobby laughs. Rumbled. 
BOBBY Yeah. She still in charge. 
They both chuckle at this. A nod of understanding. But then: 
BOBBY (CONT'D) You look well.. Man. I ain't seen you since- 
JAMES Teddy's funeral. 
Bobby pauses, grows uncomfortable. Bobby throws his cigarette to the ground and stomps it out. 
BOBBY Right. Teddy's funeral. Damn. You look well. You shoulda called- 
JAMES You know, Bobby, they still don't know what happened to Teddy and that boy. Those boys weren't drinkin' or doin' drugs. 
BOBBY I know, James. 
JAMES No sir. Nothin' like that. He was a good boy. The car just hit that bridge head on. We ain't ever gone know how or why. They say he didn't feel a thing. 
Bobby nods. 
BOBBY That's good, James. 
JAMES But we brought him back to Augusta didn't we? Got him home then sent him on to the Lord. 
BOBBY We did, Mr. Brown.    We did. 
James stands there, fixedly. The Pool cleaner comes from around the truck, breaks the tension. 
POOL CLEANER OK. Mr. Byrd. I fixed your problem. I'll be back in the Spring to open her up. 
BOBBY I'm much obliged. Do I have to- 
POOL CLEANER No no. We'll send the bill on. Well that's that. Good day Gentlemen. 
He gets in his truck and pulls away leaving Bobby and James standing in an awkward silence. 
JAMES Look at that. We got white folk cleaning our pool. Come a long way huh, Mr. Byrd? 
BOBBY Yeah. We come a long way. 
Suddenly this is awkward. For both of them. Bobby defuses it: 
JAMES You still makin' the steps, Mr. Byrd? 
BOBBY Here and there. 
JAMES You hurtin' a little in the hips? 
BOBBY A little. You? 
JAMES Not me. I just get stronger ever day. Gettin' better every day. 
James pulls out two concert tickets from his jacket and hands them to Bobby. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Maybe you and Vicki got some friends who could come tonight. Good seats, too. 
James turns sharply and walks back to the Limo. He sings to himself. 
JAMES (CONT'D) (Sings) Oh, Mary Don't You Weep... 
Bobby listens. And remembers. 
JAMES (CONT'D) (Sings) Tell Martha Not to Moan. 
He stops and turns to Bobby. 
JAMES (CONT'D) What's the next line? 
Bobby looks at James. 
BOBBY I can't seem to recall. Was a long time ago. 
James nods.   After a moment Bobby nods. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) See you around Mr. Brown. 
Bobby turns.   James watches as he walks back to his house. 
JAMES See you around Mr. Byrd. 
James walks towards his Limo. 
SFX: Audience noise, cheering, whistles, clapping. Louder. Louder.

REVISED DRAFT 
October 14, 1997 
"... the magic is all around you. All the time.  Everywhere. In every thing. The trick... is to see it." 
IN BLACK... 
... the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat of BOOGIE-WOOGIE.  Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up. 
THEN... 
... in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling g-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard: 
"GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!" 
Then another... and another, each one dropping through frame, a gentle rain. 
In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and- footprints in the wet cement. 
Another postcard: 
"I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!" 
In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at the Brown Derby.  Or Ciro's.  Or the Coconut Grove... 
More postcards.  Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones that you and I know today.  These are palaces.  Temples. Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian.  The Carthay Circle.  The Paramount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.  The ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded jackets and guided you to your seat.  The popcorn was hot and fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil. 
CUT TO: 
THE PILE OF POSTCARDS 
a wild jumble.  Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top of the pile.  It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's most famous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN.  We PUSH INTO THE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE... 
... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer, until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and behind it until we're looking down at... 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT 
SUPER TITLE: 1951 
A gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town, a swath of garishly bright concrete called 
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Of course, it's not like the postcards say it is.  This is what it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and this is my town. 
Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the street to 
GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Born and raised here, thank you very much.  Sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else.  But everyone loves the movies, so Hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload.  To them, Grauman's Chinese Theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet. To me, it's the theater that's playing "The African Queen." 
And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THE AFRICAN QUEEN."  Still the same shot, buses disgorge TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The MEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on their way to 
THE THEATER ENTRANCE, 
where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their tickets. 
DOORMAN Newsreel's just starting, folks. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) That's me and my girlfriend.  Her name is Sandra Sinclair, and this is her town, too -- she's from Cleveland.  She came out here to be an actress, and that's just what she's doing.  The first picture I ever wrote, a little potboiler called "Sand Pirates of the Sahara."  Okay, it ain't "Citizen Kane," but you gotta start somewhere. 
MOVING INTO THE LOBBY 
an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting and golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect USHERS and we move into 
THE DARKENED THEATER. 
As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the same shot -- we see the screen... 
A NEWSREEL. 
As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE: 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Bringing the news of the world to you! 
Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee Hearing Room, a title blares "HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!" 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were called to testify before the House Committee of Un-American Activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded Red Menace in Hollywood. 
We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared Congress to come after them.  Well, come after them they did!  And after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper! 
Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led to jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER And so, it's off to jail, the charge: Contempt of Congress!  This should give you fellas something to write about now!  A new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: Get the reds out of Hollywood! 
In the audience, one man YELLS "Lock up the commie bastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh.  As the newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we WHEEL AROUND AND... 
ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR. 
PETE (frustrated) What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one? 
LEO They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know. 
PETE Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes! 
LEO Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. 
PETE I was decorated. 
LEO I know.  A Purple Heart. 
PETE Exactly. 
LEO You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk. 
PETE At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career! 
LEO You can't testify. 
PETE Why not? 
Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket, offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself. 
LEO Don't take this personally, kid. If it were up to me, I'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible.  What can I say?  I like you. 
Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own.  Puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder. 
LEO They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. 
PETE (under his breath) Yeah, well, that's enough. 
LEO Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um... 
PETE "Ashes To Ashes?" 
LEO That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen. 
PETE So, it is a blacklist. 
LEO (defensive) Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist. (calm) Now, are you gonna play ball? 
PETE (sullenly) Yes. (then, pissed) Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair! 
Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke. 
LEO (hand on Pete's shoulder) Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about. Fair ain't the point. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Prominent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" poster.  Pete reaches up and takes it down.  He leans it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden swivel chair.  He swivels around to see 
A STUDIO SECURITY GUARD 
standing by the door.  He's watching Pete's every move. 
Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's belongings.  Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk drawer.  He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the desk.  He looks at the cover of the first one: 
"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" By Peter Appleton A United Pictures Production February 19, 1951 
Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the second one: 
"ASHES TO ASHES" By Peter Appleton 
He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box, which contains somewhat more personal items.  A ragged gold pillow with tassels.  Legal pads of notes.  An old tin-toy fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.  He turns it around in his hands. 
PETE (musing) Huh.  Red... 
Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door. 
SANDRA (O.S.) Pete?  Pete...? 
Sandra appears in the doorway.  She's in costume -- a Louis XIV courtier.  She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and embraces him. 
SANDRA Oh, Pete... 
They kiss.  The Guard watches their every move. 
SANDRA What happened? 
PETE What exactly did you hear? 
SANDRA That you got let go. 
PETE I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in? 
SANDRA He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why? 
PETE Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching. 
SANDRA You mean, he was... let go, too? 
PETE (sotto, an appeal) They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help. 
During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling away from Pete. 
PETE A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be!  Right? 
PETE Oops. 
He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and down the deserted boulevard. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT 
The full moon is low over the ocean.  Pete's car is parked at the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away.  The ferris wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight.  Pete is asleep in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his face, snoring. 
The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake. 
PETE Huh?  Whatsa... 
Instantly, he grabs his head. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I had no idea how I got to Santa Monica, but it certainly was a good idea.  I don't think I could've faced the headache I had alone in my apartment.  At least I had the ocean air. 
Pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing.  He gets out his cigarettes and lights up.  He takes a puff and glances at his watch. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Three forty-five.  I had only been there for a couple of hours at most.  Truth be told, I was still fairly drunk. 
He starts the car and heads for the highway. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I'd head north until the sun came up or I ran out of gas, whichever came first. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Pete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop.  Waves crash to the shore below the roadway. 
INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT 
Pete is finally relaxed.  He takes off his hat and jams it down in the back seat.  He takes a deep breath -- with the wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at peace.  He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the fuel gauge. 
INSERT - FUEL GAUGE 
Pinning on "empty." 
PETE Shit. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Guess which came first. 
He scans the road ahead -- nothing.  Glances to his right. 
PETE'S POV 
The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance. 
Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that will take him toward the lights.  He passes a hand-painted sign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI." 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Pete's car rolls up and stops.  There's a light on the sign and another in the station's window, but the place is deserted. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I should've known better than to think that a service station in the sticks would be open at this hour, but it wasn't like I had a lot of choices. 
Pete looks ahead toward the town.  Its few lights twinkle in the distance. 
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) What the hell.  At least there'd be a diner opening in a couple of hours.  I'd get some pie and coffee, and then I could worry about the gas. 
Pete pulls out onto the road. 
EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT 
Pete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted roadside sign which reads: 
SLOW! NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL USE CAUTION! 
INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT 
Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading "LAWSON WASH," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge. 
Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge... 
HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
... his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless possum... 
Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the edge... 
EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT 
... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and into the rapidly-moving water below! 
EXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
The water is flowing very quickly, and the current is intense.  Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat (thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the windshield. 
But... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle.  Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface. 
EXT.  THE WASH - NIGHT 
Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air.  His fight isn't over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream. He swims with all his might toward the far bank. 
EXT.  FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT 
A typical small-town greasy spoon -- with one faded star prominent in the window. 
CLOSER 
On MABEL LANIER, a sweet-faced woman in her 30s.  She stares vacantly into space, her reverie broken by a customer needing a coffee refill. 
STANTON All told, this little town gave sixty-two of its finest to the war. Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone. More'n its share, I should say. Got us a letter from President Truman.  City council commissioned a war memorial.  Been sittin' in the basement of city hall these six years.  Town never had the heart to put it up.  Place just hasn't been the same since the war. 
STANTON AND PETE 
Pete looks longingly toward the diner.  Stanton takes note. 
STANTON You hungry, son? 
PETE Yes.  Very. 
STANTON Got any money? 
Pete rummages in his pants pockets, and comes up with three quarters. 
STANTON Six bits.  More'n enough to buy some breakfast.  C'mon. 
And they head across the street. 
CUT TO: 
A PLATE WITH TWO PIECES OF APPLE PIE 
A fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices. 
WIDER 
INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY 
Pete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth, pausing only to wash it down with gulps of coffee. 
MABEL 
stands nearby, watching in amazement as her pie is consumed in record time. 
Pete notices that Stanton and Mabel -- and the other PATRONS, for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy.  He stops in his tracks, and starts chewing leisurely.  He smiles at Mabel. 
PETE (mouth full) Pie's... good. 
MABEL (wryly) Like you could tell. (to Stanton) Where'd you find him? 
STANTON Down by the wash. 
MABEL We gotta put a rail on that thing before someone else gets killed. (to Pete) Three people have died there, Mister.  You're lucky to be alive. 
PETE (draining the coffee cup) Thanks.  More coffee? 
Mabel obliges.  As she pours the coffee, she looks at Pete. 
MABEL You know, you look familiar.  You ever been in here before? 
Pete shakes his head. 
STANTON He don't remember who he is, Mabel. Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon as he gets in. 
MABEL (distractedly) Doc should be in for his coffee and bear claw any minute... (to Pete) You sure you never been in here? 
Pete looks up at Mabel and smiles winningly. 
PETE I'd remember this pie. 
Mabel, thoroughly charmed, smiles back at Pete. 
MABEL (patting his hand) I'll just get you another piece. 
EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - DAY 
A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner.  There's a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man who has little to smile about because he has little to care about.  After a couple of steps, he's met up by DOC BEN LARDNER, a vigorous man in his 50s.  He comes up behind Harry and claps him on the back. 
LARDNER 'Mornin' Harry.  Fine day, isn't it? 
HARRY Morning, Doc.  Yes, yes it looks just fine. 
LARDNER Plenty to do today? 
HARRY (vaguely) Oh, yes, plenty.  Plenty. 
They're at the door of the diner.  Doc opens it for Harry. 
LARDNER After you. 
INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY 
Lardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup of coffee and bags him a bear claw. 
LARDNER Mornin' Mabel, Stan. 
MABEL Mornin' Doc.  Got some new business for you today. 
Lardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the bump on his head. 
LARDNER Hello, son.  How'd that happen? 
STANTON He don't know.  And he don't know his name, neither.  Found him down by the wash. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 
Lardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his bear claw.  Pete is standing, nosing around the office -- diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks.  He zeros in on one photo in particular. 
ON THE PHOTO 
one of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.  They've been fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch than Lardner. 
LARDNER (into phone) Stanton found him by the wash.  Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is.  We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him.  You bet.  He'll be here. 
Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures. 
LARDNER That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does. 
PETE She's very pretty. 
LARDNER Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are... 
Lardner stares at him.  Pete takes note, turns toward him. 
LARDNER ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me. 
PETE Wish I could say the same thing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY 
The Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECIL ELDRIDGE, 45, gets out.  As he gets a few steps from the door, Harry Trumbo jumps out from around the side of the building and stops him. 
HARRY (excited) Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there... 
ELDRIDGE (startled) Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office? 
HARRY Listen to me!  The young man in there... 
Eldridge keeps moving to the door. 
ELDRIDGE (interrupting) Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and I'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just... 
Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the shoulders. 
HARRY Cecil, listen to me! 
The sheriff stops. 
HARRY (breathless) It's Luke. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 
Sheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete.  He's staring at him intently.  Silence. 
ELDRIDGE No wallet, huh? 
LARDNER No identification at all. (beat) What're you thinkin', Cecil? 
ELDRIDGE What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which. (to Pete) Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right? 
PETE Yes. 
ELDRIDGE You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge? 
PETE No.  But... 
ELDRIDGE But what? 
PETE Well, this place sorta reminds me of something. 
ELDRIDGE What's that? 
PETE "It's a Wonderful Life." 
ELDRIDGE The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh? 
PETE "It's a Wonderful Life?" 
ELDRIDGE Or the Bijou.  Either one. 
PETE I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it. 
The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door. 
ELDRIDGE Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory. 
LARDNER By all means. 
Eldridge opens the door. 
ELDRIDGE (to someone offscreen) Harry, why don't you come on in here. 
Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head of snow-white hair.  He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and slowly turns to face Pete.  He looks closer... and closer. Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe. 
PETE 
looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face... 
HARRY Nine and-a-half years ago. 
LUKE Nine and-a-half years... 
ELDRIDGE Comin' up on the Bijou, gents. 
EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAY 
Eldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops. 
ELDRIDGE Here we are. 
HARRY Well, son, you're home! 
Luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open... 
HIS POV - THE BIJOU. 
The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building styles.  It's as though the architect took random parts of a Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly built the result. 
As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was "The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message 
" HE B J U" 
was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet. 
And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " HE B J U" sign becomes apparent.  Train tracks run right behind the building on an elevated trestle.  As we watch, a TRAIN ROARS BY.  Everything shakes.  It's not an earthquake, it's a trainquake.  The "J" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers. 
LUKE 
stares at the monstrosity.  His face is ashen.  His heart has sunk to somewhere below his knees. 
The Bijou. 
Harry jumps out of the car excitedly. 
HARRY Thanks for the lift, Cecil. 
ELDRIDGE Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke. 
LUKE (faint smile) Thanks. 
Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out.  Harry grabs his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket. 
HARRY Wait'll you see the inside! 
LUKE (deadpan) Can't wait. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY 
The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by the exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in shards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable combination of questionable taste and neglect. 
Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is -- probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater -- 
A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER. 
Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and scatter it in a hundred directions. 
TILT DOWN TO REVEAL 
Luke and Harry standing below.  Luke is lost in a gulf somewhere between surprise and disgust. 
HARRY We've been closed for a while. 
LUKE (smiling wanly) Ah. 
Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one open. 
INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY 
The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved itself up against the row behind or in front. 
THE SCREEN 
is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin, framed by ragged red velveteen drapery. 
In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old upright piano. 
Luke walks a few steps down the aisle.  He picks a seat on the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.  As he does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and backstage.  Harry comes over and sits behind him. 
LUKE (turning to Harry) Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed? 
HARRY Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight. 
LUKE Why? 
HARRY (deep breath) Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. 
LUKE Didn't you have any help? 
HARRY Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too. (brightening) But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. (rises, grabs Luke's arm) C'mon, I'll show you where we live. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY 
The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a contrast to the rest of the theater.  It's neat as a pin, and fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains, allowing the sun to flood the room. 
ADELE (extreme concern) Oh my god... who died? 
CUT TO: 
A GLASS OF WATER 
on a kitchen table.  Offscreen, we HEAR A HICCUP.  Then another.  Adele's hand reaches into frame. 
WIDER 
INT.  LARDNER KITCHEN - EVENING 
Lardner stands over Adele, who is seated at the table, holding the glass of water. 
LARDNER Drink slowly. 
She raises the glass to her lips. 
LARDNER From the other side of the glass. 
It's a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water, but Adele accomplishes it with aplomb.  She waits for a moment -- then hiccups again. 
ADELE I think (hic!) it's worse (hic!) now. 
LARDNER That always used to work. 
ADELE Yeah, well it's not everyday you get (hic!) news like this.  You're sure he's (hic!) okay?  Other than the (hic!) bump on the head? 
LARDNER (hedging) Well... 
ADELE (hic!) Dad... (hic!) 
Lardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand. 
LARDNER He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone... 
ADELE ... including me.  Right?  (hic!) 
LARDNER I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst. 
ADELE You mean, (hic!) me? 
LARDNER It's possible. 
Off Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - EVENING 
Luke and Harry, walking along, make a turn onto Commerce Street, heading for Mabel's.  It's still light out, and a soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk. 
HARRY I take breakfast and supper at Mabel's every day except Sunday. Have for years, since Lily died. If it weren't for Mabel, I'd probably starve to death. 
ERNIE COLE, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots Harry and Luke. 
ERNIE Harry!  Hold on a second! 
Ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands before Luke, staring.  Luke shoots a glance at Harry, who taps Ernie on the shoulder. 
HARRY It's really him, Ernie. 
ERNIE (agape) Well, I'll be... 
He sticks his hand out and Luke takes it.  Ernie pumps it enthusiastically. 
ERNIE By god, Luke, if it isn't good to see you again. 
LUKE (uncertain) Uh, thanks.  Good to see you again, too, uh... 
HARRY Ernie. 
LUKE ... Ernie. 
ERNIE (still at a lose) Well, I'll be... 
HARRY We were just gonna get some supper. Would you like to join us? 
ERNIE Would I ever! 
The three walk toward the diner, but before they get two steps, they hear: 
WOMAN'S VOICE Is that Luke Trumbo? 
They turn to see a stout woman, KATIE RUTHERFORD, 40s, rushing toward them.  She rushes right into a very surprised Luke's arms and hugs him tightly. 
KATIE Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you back! 
HARRY Katie, would you like to join us for dinner?  The more, the merrier. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MABEL'S DINER - NIGHT 
The diner is packed.  In addition to Ernie and Katie, MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN occupy every seat and table, and many more are standing, even hanging out the door. 
At the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at the counter.  Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, while Luke is working on a steak.  A young man seated at the opposite side of the counter is speaking.  He's CARL LEFFERT, 30s. 
CARL (eagerly) Hey, Luke, remember the time you and me, we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head? 
Adele and Luke stroll down the street side by side.  She looks at him for a long moment. 
LUKE What. 
ADELE No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time. 
LUKE Me too. 
ADELE You look... different. 
LUKE I do? 
ADELE Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight. 
LUKE I did?  Huh! 
Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it.  From behind them, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND.  Adele turns... 
ADELE'S POV 
Keeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner is following them.  Adele turns and addresses the crowd. 
ADELE (to the group) You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere. 
LUKE Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome. 
Harry comes over. 
LUKE I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up. 
HARRY You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. 
LUKE You bet. 
HARRY Goodnight, son. (tips his hat) 'Night, Delly. 
And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the pair goodnight.  Luke and Adele watch them disperse. 
LUKE There.  We're alone. 
They turn and start walking. 
ADELE Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed? 
LUKE Well... where can we go? 
Adele brightens. 
ADELE I know a place.  Come on! 
She grabs his hand and they run toward the town square. 
EXT.  LAWSON CITY HALL - NIGHT 
Adele and Luke stand by the front steps. 
LUKE City hall? 
ADELE You must not remember anything. Come on. 
She grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building. 
EXT.  SIDE OF CITY HALL - NIGHT 
Adele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the ground.  She looks around.  Certain the coast is clear, she pounds on the window in three "special" places, and it pops up and open.  She looks at Luke. 
ADELE You first. 
LUKE Why me? 
ADELE Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down. 
AS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE 
CUT TO: 
A LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT. 
Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF A KNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave.  We slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue... 
INT.  CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 
ADELE (O.S.) When we were kids, my Dad was mayor, and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time. 
ON ADELE AND LUKE 
looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the window.  The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet. 
ADELE Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here. 
LUKE (looks at the door) How'd they get it inside? 
ADELE Through the door.  It comes apart. 
She moves to the memorial.  Squinting, she examines its base. 
ADELE Your name's on here.  See? 
Luke comes over. 
The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door at the end of a hallway.  Luke, following the cat, comes around the same corner and looks at 
THE DOOR. 
Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as the sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way to Tipperary." 
Luke moves to the door and knocks. 
LUKE Um, Old Tim?  Sorry, it's late. It's Luke.  Can I come in? 
The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open, revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat, stroking its fur. 
OLD TIM Found me. 
LUKE Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me. 
Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow him. 
INT.  OLD TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT 
The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot, which is perfectly made, military-style. 
OLD TIM Not used to visitors. (gesturing) Sit. 
Old Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to the "kitchen" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny icebox. 
Luke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing him.  Silence.  Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau. 
ON THE PHOTO 
It's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform. 
The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke.  He rubs against his legs, purring.  Luke leans down to pet him. 
LUKE So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name? 
OLD TIM Cat. 
LUKE Cat.  That's simple.  I like it. (pets Cat) Hi, Cat. 
OLD TIM (sudden change-of-subject) We thought you was dead, you know. (another new thought) It's okay that I live here? 
LUKE Of course. 
Pause, then suddenly. 
OLD TIM Do you think I'll get me a new u-u uniform? 
Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks more than a couple of words. 
LUKE I'll do everything I can. 
Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached. 
OLD TIM T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war. 
LUKE Yeah... me too. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY 
It's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment.  The "SAND PIRATES" poster leans up against a chair.  Pete's two boxes of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top. 
There's an insistent KNOCK at the door. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?  You in there?  This is the Super, I have the master key and I'm coming in! 
We HEAR the key in the lock and the door swings open, revealing the building SUPER, 50s.  Behind him is Leo Kubelsky.  They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air. 
LEO You smell gas? 
SUPER Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here. 
LEO Jesus. 
SUPER Hey, it's the best way to tell. 
Leo moves to the boxes and rummages through them.  He picks up the empty bottle, examines it. 
SUPER You think he's drunk somewhere? 
LEO (under his breath) Wouldn't blame him if he was. 
SUPER Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'? 
LEO (holding out his folding money) What's his rent? 
SUPER Thirty a month. 
Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill. 
LEO Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone. 
SUPER (examining the bill) Huh? 
LEO Take a hike.  Am-scray. 
SUPER Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave. 
A TV SCREEN 
It's tiny, with rounded corners, black-and-white, and a hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow. 
WIDER 
INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Show of Shows."  He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit ears, steps back -- and is successful.  SID CAESAR And IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch, and Lardner fairly roars with laughter. 
He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so, the reception goes haywire.  He returns to the spot in front of the TV, and the picture is perfect again. 
The DOORBELL RINGS.  He's torn -- if he moves, the picture will break up.  The doorbell RINGS again, and we HEAR Adele's voice from upstairs: 
ADELE (O.S.) Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down. 
LARDNER Honey, I... I can't... it's the... 
There's a KNOCK at the door. 
LARDNER (giving in) Oh, hell... 
He moves from his spot.  The reception goes bad, and he marches to the door. 
He opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly out-of-date coat and tie. 
LARDNER Evening, Luke. 
LUKE Evening, Doctor Lardner. 
Lardner freezes, staring at Luke. 
LUKE What's wrong? 
LARDNER (shaken from his reverie) Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it... 
LUKE Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big. 
Adele comes down the stairs.  Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke. 
ADELE Oh... 
Awkward pause.  Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous. 
LUKE I shouldn't have worn the suit. 
Adele comes down the stairs. 
ADELE No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before... 
LUKE Oh... 
ADELE ... and It's just... well, deja vu. 
LARDNER That's it.  Deja vu. 
Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other. Lardner breaks it. 
LARDNER You kids off to the dance? 
LUKE Aren't you coming? 
LARDNER No, I'm not much of a dancer. 
ADELE (chidingly) Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working. 
LARDNER I had it, a minute ago... 
He glances at the TV set.  The picture is suddenly crystal clear. 
LARDNER ... ooooh, It's back. (encouraging them toward the door) Well, you kids have fun now... 
Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living room. 
S-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV carefully all the while.  The reception is staying perfect. Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.  He stifles his urge, and heads for his chair.  Gingerly, he sits.  Still perfect. 
Satisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up. The picture goes completely haywire again. 
LARDNER Aw, crap. 
EXT.  STREET - NIGHT 
Adele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm. 
ADELE This is strange.  Do you feel it? 
LUKE What? 
ADELE We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday. 
LUKE Oh. 
Pause. 
ADELE You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening... 
LUKE (interrupting) It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly. 
ADELE (shocked) Nine hundred... 
CUT TO: 
THE SAME - LATER 
Adele and Luke are slow dancing to "Thanks for the Memory." 
LUKE How do you tell those two apart, anyway? 
ADELE Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one. 
LUKE That's... pretty frightening. 
They laugh and dance a bit more. 
ADELE Your dancing's very good. 
LUKE Thanks. 
ADELE It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step. 
LUKE Guess I must've learned. 
Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on her face.  The band finishes the song, and everyone enthusiastically APPLAUDS.  Spencer bows shyly, blushing slightly.  He nods to the band, and they bow before he motions for the crowd's attention. 
SPENCER (nervously) Thanks, folks.  Gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before? 
The crowd yells "No!," "You guys sound great!," etc. 
SPENCER Well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of Luke.  I mean, it's because of Luke coming back that we're here tonight -- but I'm talking about this. 
He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees Luke. 
SPENCER (to Luke) When you didn't come back, I learned how to play this so I could remember you.  And now that you're back, well, I'll never forget you. (to the crowd) Luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us. 
The crowd APPLAUDS warmly. 
SPENCER Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole! 
The crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser.  He turns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums. 
ERNIE Pretty proud of your boy, Avery? 
Avery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six times to register his reaction. 
ON THE KICK DRUM -- "WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF." 
ERNIE Looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause I think Spencer's got a big career ahead of him. 
APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle.  As soon as he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent. 
ERNIE You know folks, here in Lawson, we gave a lot for our country.  A lot. And we never complained and we never faltered.  And we never forgot. 
Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion.  He clears his throat and continues. 
ERNIE We never forgot.  And so when one of our own came back to us, I gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle.  Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again.  I think I speak for everyone here when I say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive.  But Luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too.  God bless you, son. 
The crowd APPLAUDS.  Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles. Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject. 
ERNIE All right, enough a'that.  This is a celebration, so let's have us a good time -- but not too good a time, 'cause I see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a.m. council meeting tomorrow morning, and I expect y'all to be there! All right, take it away, Spencer! 
And Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE SAME - LATER 
Luke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger, standing at the periphery.  Old Tim stands a few feet back. 
LUKE Why don't you two get out there and dance? 
HARRY Oh, no, I... 
Mrs. Terwilliger blushes. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed. 
LUKE When was that? 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Nineteen-oh-nine. 
Harry touches Luke's arm. 
HARRY Son, we're gonna go.  You two kids have a lovely time. 
Goodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves.  Alex McKenna comes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder. 
ALEX Delly, can I have a dance? 
ADELE Sure. 
Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a little "help me!" look.  Luke smiles back and watches the dancing crowd.  After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow tie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his hand. 
FITTS Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town. 
LUKE (shakes his hand) Good to meet you.  Again. 
FITTS Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back. 
LUKE Thanks. 
WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION 
To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old Tim.  Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and nose with a handkerchief.  He doesn't notice 
LUKE 
who looks up towards the projection booth. 
CUT TO: 
A BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT, 
filling the frame.  We're looking directly into the beam of light radiating from the projector. 
PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the booth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the projector. 
WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's face fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's unfolding on the screen for the very first time. 
The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES, signaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the window. 
INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT 
Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the projector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have. 
Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades them up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly. 
He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up reel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he senses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to see 
LUKE, 
standing there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say something -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's interrupted a very private ritual. 
Harry senses this.  Clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles warmly. 
HARRY Beautiful, wasn't it? 
LUKE (softly) Yes. 
HARRY Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact... 
LUKE Dad, I... 
HARRY (a tiny laugh) Ha! 
LUKE ... what? 
HARRY You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad." 
Father and son look at each other for a long moment -- searching each other's eyes.  Harry smiles a sort-of half- smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the rewind bench.  Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end of the film onto an empty reel.  Slowly, he begins to turn the crank, rewinding the film. 
He stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not there. 
ANGLE - PROJECTION BOOTH DOOR 
Luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the projection booth. 
ONE LUKE 
As he closes his eyes... 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
ON HARRY 
In bed, sound asleep, snoring.  A HAND reaches into frame and shakes him awake. 
LUKE'S VOICE Harry.  Dad, wake up.  Wake up. 
Harry opens his eyes and looks up. 
INT.  HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
HARRY (bleary) Luke... what time is it? 
LUKE Six-thirty. (smiles) I thought we'd get an early start. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CITY COUNCIL MEETING ROOM - DAY 
A meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor Cole presiding.  Of the dozen council MEMBERS, we also recognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts.  VERA DWIGHT, the council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading the minutes of the last meeting. 
VERA Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and Red Curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure. Motion carried, nine to two, one abstention. 
As Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry, Old Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on the unoccupied benches. 
ERNIE Thanks, Vera. 
Ernie notices Luke and the trio. 
ERNIE Well, the chair notes the presence this morning of Luke and Harry Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou staff.  Frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings.  G'moring, folks. 
LUKE & THE TRIO Good morning. 
ERNIE I'm just guessing, but I bet it's not a sudden interest in Lawson politics that brings you all here. 
Luke stands. 
Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool box nearby.  He's just straightened out the "J" and he steps back... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "THE BIJOU." 
But not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. Once again, the sign reads, " HE B J U."  Luke winces. 
EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY 
Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it takes shape in a prominent place in the square... 
INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to a corner of the muslin.  It snaps into place, and voila -- new screen!  Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge, standing below, applaud enthusiastically. 
INT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY 
As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful. 
As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before long, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. Transported. 
After a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows. 
LUKE That was beautiful. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER I taught you that. 
LUKE I can play the piano? 
MRS. TERWILLIGER (all fluttery) Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say. 
She sits at the piano. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Sit.  Play with me. 
LUKE No, I... 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Some of it might come back to you. 
Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.  As she begins to play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER That's good... that's good... 
But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just plunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie woogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Really, Luke!  That's no way to treat Mr. Chopin! 
She stands and moves away.  Luke keeps playing, grinning madly -- he's loving it!  After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top half to Luke's bass line. 
OLD TIM 
is tapping his foot to the beat.  He turns to Adele and says: 
OLD TIM I taught him that. 
Off Adele cracking up. 
THE MONTAGE CONTINUES... 
EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY 
Luke and all the letters up again.  He steps back, checks his watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train goes by.  This time, however, only the "J" tips over at a jaunty angle.  Luke smiles. 
INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY 
Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter, devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed potatoes and gravy.  Luke's and Adele's hair is practically white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are stained with paint specks. 
At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably with Bob Leffert.  She smiles at him warmly, then turns to refill Harry's coffee cup.  Harry thanks her, then turns back to the newspaper he's reading. 
INSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN 
Prominent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying headline: 
BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH Hollywood Writer Feared Dead Were Red Agents Involved? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - NIGHT 
Luke's standing near the sign.  He yells to Adele, down below on the ground.  She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a switch panel behind the candy counter.  He throws the switch... 
... and the sign lights up beautifully!  Then, they all feel the rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle and shake, no letters fall.  A CHEER goes up from Adele, Harry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.  Delighted, Luke takes a formal bow.  The boogie-woogie ends as we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY 
ON THE MEMORIAL 
Complete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the square. 
WIDER 
It's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out. Mayor Ernie Cole is at the podium.  He finishes his remarks, then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost lives of his sons.  He holds them up, high above his head. 
ON THE CROWD 
One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly held aloft by their loved ones. 
Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform... 
LUKE'S POV 
As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the theater and crosses to the candy counter.  The door stays open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch a bit of the picture. 
INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
ON THE SCREEN - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" 
The second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's programmer.  It's nighttime in the desert.  A huge full moon hangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids. GREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is engaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain. 
Pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door. 
GREGORY (ONSCREEN) You don't think you can win this, do you? 
Khalid lunges and draws Gregory's blood. 
LUKE (ala "Khalid") "Ha!  I'd say I was winning!" 
KHALID (ONSCREEN) Ha!  I'd say I was winning! 
Luke's look is "How did I know he was gonna say that?" 
Onscreen, an EVIL HENCHMAN is sneaking up behind Gregory. 
LUKE "Gregory!  Look out!" 
WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN) Gregory!  Look out! 
Pete did it again. 
Onscreen, Gregory turns and kills the Henchman, then quickly dispatches Khalid.  He stands over the body, catches his breath and says: 
GREGORY (ONSCREEN) It's all right, Rebecca. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN) Is he dead? 
GREGORY (ONSCREEN) Yes, Rebecca.  He's dead. 
REBECCA, a beautiful American woman, comes into view and takes our attention because she's being played by Sandra Sinclair, Pete Appleton's ex-girlfriend... 
ON LUKE 
His mouth is gaping open.  He stares at the screen. 
LUKE (a whisper) Sandra...? 
Luke stands.  Confused, he stumbles backward, moving into the lobby as the Man goes back into the auditorium with his popcorn and the door closes. 
INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT 
Luke is staring at the closed auditorium doors.  Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger take note of his odd behavior. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Luke?  Dear, are you all right? 
Without answering, Luke turns and runs to the poster case. 
ON THE POSTER - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" 
Forget the cheesy B-movie artwork.  As Luke looks at the poster, it's clear that he's remembering something.  He looks at the picture of Sandra -- then scans down to the credits block at the bottom of the poster.  His eyes lock upon

LUKE My god... my god... no... 
Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing down on him... 
... because he remembers... 
INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT 
The warning bell DINGS! twice, but the changeover projector's carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying. 
HARRY (pleading) Oh, baby, make your daddy happy... 
Harry's trying to keep the projector going, as the previous reel is about to end.  Given no other choice, he finally gives the changeover projector a good swift kick. 
It hums to life.  A perfect changeover.  Harry pets the projector. 
HARRY You're a good girl.  No matter what I say. 
As he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left arm.  Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a chair, and sits heavily. 
He tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a hacking, choking COUGH.  He tries to stand, but drops to his knees, clutching his left arm harder than before. 
HARRY (in pain) Oh, Jesus... 
Harry falls to the floor, and as he does 
THE FILM 
breaks in the projector gate... flap!  flap!  flap!... 
INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT 
Luke is still staring at the poster, lost in thought. Offscreen, we HEAR the audience WHISTLING AND HOOTING in reaction to the broken film. 
Mrs. Terwilliger has been calling Luke's name, but he doesn't come out of his stupor until Old Tim comes up behind him and spins him around... 
OLD TIM Mr. Luke! 
Luke stares wide-eyed at the old man. 
Luke looks at Harry's face for a moment.  Then as the tears well up, he leans over and ever-so-gently places a kiss on Harry's forehead. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  LAWSON CEMETERY - DAY 
It's a beautiful, bright, sunny day.  Luke and Adele stand at the front of the large group of mourners.  REVEREND COLEMAN, 50s, conducts the service. 
COLEMAN We commit to the earth the mortal remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo, safe in the knowledge that his immortal soul is at peace and at last reunited with his beloved Lillian in the bosom of the Lord. Let us pray. 
Everyone bows their heads. 
COLEMAN "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures..." 
Luke looks up at the sky, then steps forward and lays a single rose on Harry's casket.  Then, as everyone surreptitiously watches, he turns and walks away from the gravesite, toward the cemetery entrance. 
Adele watches Luke depart... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
... and she's not alone.  Agents Saunders and Brett are watching everything from their car, which is parked nearby. As Luke walks away, Saunders snaps his photo with a long-lens camera... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE BASE OF THE WAR MEMORIAL, 
and Luke's name inscribed there. 
EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DUSK 
Luke stands in front of the memorial, head bowed.  After a moment, he sits, leaning against the memorial. 
ON LUKE 
Lost in thought, he buries his face in his hands. 
ADELE'S VOICE (O.S.) Mind if I join you? 
Luke looks up, squinting.  Adele stands above him, backlit by the golden light of the sundown. 
LUKE Sure. 
She sits next to him.  Tentatively, she touches his shoulder. He leans into her, and she enfolds her arm in his. 
Pause. 
LUKE Your father said... that I would start to remember things. 
Suddenly, Adele feels as though she's walking on eggshells. 
ADELE (slowly) What... do you remember? 
LUKE Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now. 
ADELE I see... 
LUKE Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke. 
She closes her eyes.  All her suspicions are suddenly confirmed. 
ADELE (adrift) Oh... 
Her tears start, and she moves to hug Luke -- but instead, she starts hitting him, flailing, beating on his chest.  He hugs her tightly, and she completely lets go. 
ADELE (crying) Oh, god, I knew!  I knew!  I knew from the start!  I wanted you to be Luke!  I wanted you to be alive! You're so much like him, you have no idea.  No wonder everyone else accepted you!  You don't know what you -- what Luke meant to this town, suddenly being alive!  You don't know what this town lost! You just don't know... 
She pulls away, stands, and looks him in the eye.  Luke rises. 
ADELE (sobbing uncontrollably) I knew you weren't Luke!  And I tried not to fall in love with you! And... I don't even know your name! Oh, god... 
Luke moves toward her.  She backs away. 
LUKE I fell in love with you, too, Delly.  Only now I don't know how I feel, about you or about anything. I only think I know how Luke would feel. 
She's still sobbing.  He moves to her, takes her in his arms. 
LUKE Delly, shhhhhh... 
ADELE (pulling away) No... I can't... I have to... I can't... 
She runs off, crying...

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY 
ON SHERIFF ELDRIDGE, 
making short work of a steak and eggs.  As he powers down his meal, Agents Saunders and Brett, distinctly out-of-place in their dark suits and hats, enter the diner.  They take note of Eldridge, and come over. 
SAUNDERS Are you the sheriff? 
ELDRIDGE And I got the uniform to prove it. 
SAUNDERS I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders, this is Special Agent Steven Brett, FBI.  May we have a word with you? 
They flash identification, which Eldridge notes. 
ELDRIDGE (gesturing) Please, sit. 
After a moment, he HEARS footsteps coming up the ladder to the roof. 
PETE Who's that? 
ADELE'S VOICE It's me. 
Adele climbs onto the roof, comes over and sits down next to Pete. 
ADELE Hi. 
PETE Hi. 
Pause. 
ADELE I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you. 
PETE Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me. 
He turns to her. 
PETE This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he? 
ADELE (wistful smile) Oh, yes.  Yes, he was. 
PETE Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much. 
ADELE (changing the subject) You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. (she takes it for a spin) Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name. 
PETE Thanks, I like it.  I think. 
Pause. 
PETE Delly, I want to do the right thing. 
Pete can't believe he just said that -- but he did. 
ADELE I believe you. 
PETE The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them. 
ADELE But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist? 
PETE Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... (bitterly) You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?" 
ADELE Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side. 
Beat. 
PETE What about you, Delly? 
ADELE I am, too. 
Pete smiles and puts his arms around her. 
PETE You'll stand by me? 
ADELE Whatever happens. 
They kiss, and we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  RORY'S GAS STATION - MORNING 
There's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road, obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away.  It's deadly quiet as gas station owner RORY, late 60s, pulls up and parks his Model A truck.  He gets out, and an big old German Shepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed. 
Rory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the lock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank and sniffing the air expectantly. 
RORY Whatsit, girl? 
He stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE.  Lottie starts BARKING.  The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER.  Rory's getting worried.  He looks at 
THE FOG BANK. 
It's starting to GLOW from within.  Lottie's barking gets LOUDER and angrier.  Suddenly, a large black car punches out of the fog bank and tears down the road.  It's followed by another, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and trucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town. 
Rory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly past the station. 
RORY Shhhhh.  I know, Lottie.  This time, I thought it was the Martians for sure. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - DAY 
The place is bedlam, overflowing with REPORTERS, NEWSREEL CAMERA CREWS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, you name it. 
A RADIO CREW is broadcasting in front of Mabel's Diner.  The REPORTER is on-the-air, hugging his microphone, speaking above the din.  Mabel stands next to him, his hand on her shoulder.  Bob Leffert stands nearby, grim. 
REPORTER I'm here with Mabel Lanier, the owner of the diner here on Commerce Street where Appleton often took meals.  Mrs. Lanier, tell me, what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time? 
MABEL Well, its kinds hard to believe, 'cause Luke -- I mean Peter -- is such a... I mean, since he's been back, I've never seen the town so happy and all.  It's like he gave us some... I don't know... some hope, I guess. 
REPORTER What she's referring to folks, is yet another bizarre twist in this story.  Not only is Appleton alive, but he's been suffering from amnesia and living here in Lawson, where, due to a startling resemblance, everyone in town for the last three months has taken him for one of Lawson's dead war heroes, Albert Trumbo... 
MABEL (a catch in her voice) Luke.  We always called him Luke. 
Mabel glances at Bob, who lowers his head. 
CUT TO: 
OLD TIM They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back. 
PETE The customers?  I don't know... 
OLD TIM They will.  They w-w-will. 
Pete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye. 
PETE Tim, I have to tell you something. 
OLD TIM Oh. 
PETE It's about me. 
OLD TIM Oh. 
Pause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words. 
PETE I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident. 
OLD TIM Oh... 
PETE My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton. 
Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete. 
Pause. 
OLD TIM Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that? 
PETE (taken aback) I thought you... 
OLD TIM I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here. 
He leans down to Pete. 
OLD TIM You hafta give us back the B-B- Bijou. 
Old Tim straightens up, nods at Pete.  Then, silently, he picks up Cat and exits.

EXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - DAY 
Pete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward the waiting train. 
ADELE You've got everything? 
PETE Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact. 
ADELE You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that. 
PETE I wish you were coming with me. 
ADELE And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger? 
PETE Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers... 
They both smile as the train's HORN blows. 
CONDUCTOR Board! 
Pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger compartment. 
ADELE Did you bring along something to read? 
PETE Damn... 
Adele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of her purse and hands it to Pete. 
ADELE I didn't think so.  Here.  This is mine, you can borrow it. 
INSERT - THE BOOK 
Well-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear: 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ANNOTATED EDITION 
Pete looks at the book, then at Adele. 
ADELE Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning. 
PETE (clearly touched) Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this. 
ADELE Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while. 
PETE Okay.  What's the second thing? 
She thinks for a moment.  She needs the right words. 
ADELE I'll be here... if you come back. 
The train pulls out.  Adele and Pete exchange waves as we

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM (LOS ANGELES) - DAY 
The House Committee on Un-American Activities has effectively taken over the Grand Ballroom of this magnificent hotel, and the joint is packed to the rafters.  Members of the AUDIENCE crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the witnesses will be entering.

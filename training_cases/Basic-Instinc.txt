INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT 
It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling. On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil." 
Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face. He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him... 
JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them. 
She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms above his head. 
She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains towards her. 
The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it... gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his navel.  The SONG plays. 
He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white. 
She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high... 
Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the steel flashes... his throat is white... 
He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses... 
It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and up... and... 
EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING 
Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere. The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives get out of the car, walk into the house. 
NICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher. 
INT. THE BROWNSTONE 
There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a Picasso on the wall.  They check it out. 
GUS Who was this fuckin' guy? 
NICK Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz. 
GUS I never heard of him. 
NICK (grins) Before your time, pop. (a beat) Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now. 
GUS Not now he don't. 
Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the bedroom. 
INT. THE BEDROOM 
They walk in, stare -- it's messy. 
It's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is working the bed. 
LT. WALKER (to Nick and Gus) You guys know Captain Talcott? 
They nod. 
GUS What's the Chief's office doin' here. 
CAPT. TALCOTT Observing. 
LT. WALKER (to the Coroner's Guy) What do you think, Doc? 
THE CORONER'S GUY The skin blanches when I press it -- this kind of color is about right for six or eight hours. 
LT. WALKER Nobody say anything.  The maid came in an hour ago and found him. She's not a live-in. 
GUS Maybe the maid did it. 
LT. WALKER She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds. 
THE CORONER'S GUY (deadpan) There are no bruises on his body. 
GUS (grins) It ain't the maid. 
LT. WALKER He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him. 
NICK (looks at body) What was it? 
THE WOMAN Is he dead? 
NICK (after a beat) Why do you think he's dead? 
THE WOMAN You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you? 
GUS Were you with him last night? 
THE WOMAN You're looking for Catherine, not me. 
NICK Who are you? 
THE WOMAN I'm Roxy. (a beat) I'm her -- friend. 
She looks at them a beat. 
ROXY She's out at the beach house at Stinson.  Seadrift.  1402. 
NICK Thanks. 
They start to head out. 
ROXY You're wasting your time. Catherine didn't kill him. 
A beat, they look at her, and go... 
EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY 
Foggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean. Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, one white. 
They get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her -- 
NICK Ms. Tramell? 
She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away. 
CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about her. 
NICK I'm De... 
CATHERINE (evenly) I know who you are. 
She doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water. 
CATHERINE How did he die? 
GUS He was murdered. 
CATHERINE Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How? 
Nick glances at Gus. 
NICK With an ice pick. 
She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other. 
NICK How long were you dating him? 
CATHERINE I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him. 
They glance at each other again. 
GUS What are you -- a pro? 
Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again. 
CATHERINE No.  I'm an amateur. 
She looks away. 
NICK How long were you having sex with him? 
CATHERINE About a year and a half. 
NICK Were you with him last night? 
CATHERINE Yes. 
NICK Did you leave the club with him? 
CATHERINE Yes. 
NICK Did you go home with him? 
NICK It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here? 
BETH (after a beat; smiles) Yes. 
NICK Thank you. 
And he starts heading out. 
BETH (behind him) I still miss you, Nick. 
He doesn't even turn, pretends he didn't hear. 
INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU 
He walks in.  Gus Moran gets up from his desk as soon as he sees him. 
GUS Talcott's in there.  They're waiting. 
They start heading for Lt. Walker's office. 
GUS How'd it go, son? 
NICK She misses me. 
GUS (grins) Hallelujah. 
INT. LT. WALKER'S OFFICE 
He and Gus sit there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews and Captain Talcott. 
HARRIGAN Sixteen stab wounds to the chest and neck.  No usable prints, no forcible entry, nothing missing. No prints on the ice pick, either -- it's available at any Safeway. The scarf is Hermes, expensive -- they sell about 20,000 a year worldwide. 
ANDREWS The powder was cocaine, high- quality, high-content.  He inhaled it; there were minute quantities on his lips and penis.  Mr. Boz leaves five million dollars, no insurance, no direct survivors. He liked his coke, he liked his girls, and he liked rock and roll. 
NICK He liked the mayor, too, right? 
Talcott gives him a look. 
GUS What about his girlfriend? 
TALCOTT Is she relevant here?  I didn't know she was a suspect. 
LT. WALKER She's a suspect. 
TALCOTT On what basis? 
LT. WALKER (looks a notes) Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million. 
It hangs there. 
NICK Are you kidding me? 
LT. WALKER (continues) Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased -- 
ANDREWS Bobby Vasquez? 
LT. WALKER Bobby Vasquez, former middleweight contender, killed in the ring Atlantic City, 1984. 
NICK (smiles) I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads. 
LT. WALKER You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about? 
They just stare at him. 
LT. WALKER It's about a retired rock and roll star who is murdered by his girlfriend. 
It hangs there a long beat. 
INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
His apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide open spaces.  There is a lot of chrome. 
He sits on the couch, reading a book.  It is a paperback. 
We see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams.  He puts the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials. 
NICK Page 67, pop.  Do you know how she does the boyfriend?  With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk scarf. 
INT. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Nick, Gus, Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott -- and Beth Gardner.  With them is an older, white-haired man, DR. ANDREW LAMOTT.  There are copies of "Love Hurts" around the table. 
LT. WALKER Dr. Gardner? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 
LT. WALKER You describe a white silk scarf in your book. 
CATHERINE I've always had a fondness for white silk scarves. (she smiles) I have a very vivid imagination. 
NICK But you said you liked men to use their hands. 
CATHERINE No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. (she smiles) I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow. 
They have their eyes on each other. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 
CORRIGAN Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell? 
CATHERINE I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid. 
She smiles. 
TALCOTT We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell. 
LT. WALKER Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook. 
NICK Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him. 
CATHERINE Yes it does, doesn't it? 
She holds his eyes a second, then -- 
CATHERINE The answer is no.  I didn't kill him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 
GUS Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell? 
CATHERINE Sometimes. 
HARRIGAN Did you ever do drugs with Mr. Boz? 
CATHERINE Sure. 
GUS What kind of drugs? 
CATHERINE Cocaine. 
She looks directly at Nick. 
CATHERINE Have you ever fucked on cocaine? (she smiles) It's nice. 
He watches her. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 
NICK You like playing games, don't you? 
CATHERINE (smiles) I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun. 
They are holding each other's eyes. 
NICK How about boxing?  That's a game. Was that fun for you? 
They don't take their eyes off each other for a second. 
TALCOTT I think that's irrelevant to this inquiry. 
CATHERINE (to Nick) Yes it was.  Bobby died. 
NICK How did you feel when he died? 
CATHERINE I loved him.  I hurt. 
Their eyes are still on each other. 
NICK How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach. 
NICK Sure. 
CATHERINE (smiles) Thanks. 
And he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them. 
INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT 
It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He looks at her. 
CATHERINE (smiles) I'm tired. 
NICK It's got to be tiring to beat that machine. 
She looks at him and looks away.  A beat. 
CATHERINE If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all. 
NICK Why not? 
CATHERINE Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. (a beat) For my writing. 
He looks at her. 
CATHERINE (smiles) I love the rain, don't you? 
He says nothing, doesn't look at her. 
CATHERINE You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you? 
He looks at her now. 
NICK I passed. 
CATHERINE You see?  We're both innocent, Nick. 
He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He sees the white Ferrari in the driveway. 
NICK How do you know all this stuff about me? 
CATHERINE You know all about me. 
NICK I don't know anything that isn't police business. 
CATHERINE (after a beat) You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick? 
They look at each other a beat. 
CATHERINE (smiles) Thanks for the ride. 
And she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the door and is inside. 
INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT 
It is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett. 
He walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, goes to them, sits down. 
LT. WALKER What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride. 
NICK She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody. 
LT. WALKER And you volunteered. 
A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him. 
THE BARTENDER Perrier, Nick? 
NICK Double Black Jack rocks, Harry. 
GUS (with concern) What you doin', son? 
NICK It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? (to Lt. Walker) She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her. 
THE BARTENDER Here you go, Nick. 
He gets up, gets his drink -- 
NICK Thanks, Harry. 
He sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him. 
LT. WALKER You sure? 
NICK You want to get out of here? 
She looks at him a beat. 
BETH (smiles) Yes. 
At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave. 
GUS Maybe it's for old-time's sake. 
LT. WALKER (watches them go out) Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs. 
GUS (after a beat, smiles) He ain't that way.  He's got heart. 
LT. WALKER (smiles) Yeah.  I know. 
INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
He is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the wall. 
BETH Don't -- please, Nick -- 
We hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under her bra -- 
BETH Please don't -- don't -- 
He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move down to the floor. 
INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
It is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling. 
She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her. 
There is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- then -- 
BETH What was she like? 
NICK Who? 
BETH Catherine Tramell. 
NICK (after a beat) She said what you said she'd say. 
She sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder gently, then lies back down. 
BETH I met her at Berkeley. 
He looks at her. 
BETH We were in some of the same classes. 
NICK (after a beat) Why didn't you tell me? 
She looks at him. 
BETH I'm telling you. 
They look at each other a long beat. 
BETH (with difficulty) You've never been... like that... before. 
He says nothing, looks away from her. 
BETH Why? 
He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing. 
NICK You're the shrink. 
She keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her. 
BETH You weren't making love to me. 
A beat; he looks at her. 
NICK Who was I making love to? 
She looks at him a long beat. 
BETH You weren't making love. 
They look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up. 
A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn. He sees the outline of her body now. 
She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing. 
INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT 
He is alone, nobody else in the big room. 
He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has punched in 
HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY. 
He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen 
NOTHING CURRENT. 
A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these words 
RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965. 
We see him type in the words 
PRIOR ARREST RECORD. 
A long beat, and then it comes up 
HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO 
He stares at the screen a long beat. 
GUS (behind him) Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine? 
NICK (after a beat; lost in his thoughts) What are you doing here, Pop? 
GUS (grins) I came in here to jack off the damn machine. (a beat) One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor. 
Nick looks at him a beat. 
NICK Was she ever suspect? 
GUS No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her. 
Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere. 
NICK (slowly) Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins? 
GUS (grins) Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it. 
Nick just stares at him. 
EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY 
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car. He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex leotards. 
CATHERINE Hi. 
He looks at her a beat, then -- 
NICK Am I... disturbing you? 
CATHERINE No.  Come in. 
They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to go in. 
INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE 
She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns the Stones DOWN. 
On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him. 
We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW. She sees him glancing at the clips. 
CATHERINE I'm using you for my detective. In my book.  You don't mind, do you? 
She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless. 
CATHERINE Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one. 
NICK No, thanks. 
She goes to the bar. 
CATHERINE (smiles) That's right.  You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you? 
Roxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans and cowboy boots. 
CATHERINE (brightly) Hiya, hon.  You two have met, haven't you? 
Roxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of them looking at Nick. 
He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask. 
CATHERINE You're going to make a terrific character, Nick. 
He doesn't look at her; he's gone. 
INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY 
He comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A RECEPTIONIST sits there. 
RECEPTIONIST She's on the phone -- she'll be right with you, detective --He sweeps by her into Beth's inner office.  She hangs up when she sees the look on his face. 
NICK Who has access to my file? 
BETH What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you? 
NICK Who's got access to my goddamn file? 
She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him. 
BETH Nobody. 
He goes closer to her; she backs away. 
BETH It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall. 
NICK Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me. 
She says nothing, looks scared. 
NICK (suddenly) It's Internal Affairs, isn't it? 
BETH No, Nick, please -- 
NICK (loud, hard) Who? 
BETH (blurts it) Nilsen. 
INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY 
He storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office. 
INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE 
He closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs his chair away towards the wall. 
NILSEN What do you want, Curran? 
He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against the wall. 
NICK (out of control) You sold her the file, didn't you? 
NILSEN (scared) What are you talking about? 
NICK (out of control) What'd she pay you? 
He slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding Nilsen by the throat against the wall. 
ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy. 
He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He turns calmly and starts to walk out. 
NILSEN You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As of right now.  Pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation. 
EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK 
He gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran comes up to the window.  They look at each other a 
GUS What's goin' down, son? 
NICK Nothin' (a beat) I'll be okay, pop. 
They look at each other a long beat. 
GUS No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge. 
NICK (after a long beat) I got tired of being played with. 
Nick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him. 
LT. WALKER Give me your gun, Nick. 
A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men. 
NICK (to Walker) You think I -- 
GUS I don't son, but I got the minority opinion. 
INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt. 
Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in the room who was there with Catherine. 
NICK Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper. 
AN I.A. MAN Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone? 
NICK (after a beat) No. 
Beth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her. 
AN I.A. MAN We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr. Gardner. 
Nick gives her a look. 
BETH I'd like to sit-in if you don't mind. 
THE I.A. MAN I'd really rather -- 
TALCOTT I don't see anything wrong with Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective Curran doesn't object. 
Nick looks at her, shrugs. 
AN I.A. MAN Where were you tonight? 
NICK Home. Watching TV. 
AN I.A. MAN All night? 
NICK Yeah. 
AN I.A. MAN Were you drinking? 
He looks at Beth. 
NICK Yeah, I was drinking. 
AN I.A. MAN When did you start drinking again? 
NICK (after a beat) A couple days ago. 
BETH I saw Detective Curran at his apartment around ten o'clock.  He was sober and lucid.  I asked him in my capacity as his departmental therapist about his altercation with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed regret and displayed no hostility. 
AN I.A. MAN (to Beth) How long were you at his apartment? 
BETH About fifteen minutes.  I saw there was no reason for my concern and left. 
She and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a cigarette. 
AN I.A. MAN There's no smoking in this building. 
NICK (after a beat) What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking? 
It is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat. 
LT. WALKER I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him? 
NICK No. 
They look at him a beat. 
NICK Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that. 
AN I.A. MAN Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi. 
LT. WALKER Like writing a book about killing a guy gets you off the hook for killing him. 
AN I.A. MAN (to Walker) I don't understand.  What are you talking about?  What book? 
LT. WALKER (to Nick) Private joke. 
NICK You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it. (he smiles) She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it. 
Lt. Walker looks at him a long beat. 
LT. WALKER She's screwing with your head, Nick.  Pretty soon you're gonna look in the mirror and think you're seeing her. 
EXT. HIS APARTMENT 
It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes. 
He gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there. She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a beat. 
CATHERINE I heard about what happened.  What good's a shooter without his gun? 
She smiles. 
NICK (a beat) How exactly did you hear? 
CATHERINE (after a beat) I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends. 
NICK (after a beat) I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend. 
CATHERINE (smiles) I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me. 
NICK (after a beat) I like you. 
CATHERINE Do you? 
NICK (smiles) Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink? 
She looks at him a beat. 
CATHERINE I didn't think you'd ask me. 
He looks at her a beat. 
NICK (smiles) I'm not that easy to figure. 
They start walking inside.  She walks ahead of him.  He watches her.  She turns suddenly. 
CATHERINE You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring. 
NICK (after a beat) Don't get too cocky. 
CATHERINE Why not? 
NICK You can make a mistake. 
CATHERINE (smiles) Not me. 
And she turns, heads inside; he follows her. 
INT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY 
They walk in.  She looks at the bareness of the place. 
CATHERINE You should put some warmth into it.  You don't want it to reflect on your personality. 
She turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack Daniel's; there's not much left. 
NICK Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be. 
CATHERINE Fine. 
NICK Ice? 
CATHERINE (smiles) Please. 
There is a palpable tension between them. 
He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick. 
CATHERINE Let me do that.  You like to watch me doing it, don't you? 
She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a cigarette. 
CATHERINE Can I have a cigarette, please?  I told you you'd start smoking again. 
He watches her working on the ice. 
CATHERINE Light it for me, will you? 
He does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other. 
And she turns and she is gone. 
INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.  He is on his back, his eyes open.  He has his arm around her.  She is asleep. 
CATHERINE (murmurs) Nicky. 
He looks at her. 
INT. HER BEDROOM - MORNING 
He wakes up.  She is not there.  He looks around.  The white scarf is gone.  The coke on the side table is gone. 
In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach -- C." 
EXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY 
A cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water. A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her. 
Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of the house.  He doesn't see her. 
He walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose underneath. 
NICK (expressionless) 'Morning. 
She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat. 
NICK I think Roxy got jealous. 
She looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile. 
CATHERINE (after a beat) She's seen me fuck plenty of other guys. 
That wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, walks with her.  A long beat. 
NICK Maybe she saw something she didn't see before. 
CATHERINE She's seen everything before. 
She looks at him; he's smiling now. 
NICK She's never seen us before. 
He's serious.  She looks at him.  She smiles slowly. 
CATHERINE Did you think it was so special? 
NICK I told her it was the fuck of the century. 
He can't hide his smile anymore.  She says nothing, keeps walking. 
NICK (after a beat) What did you think? 
CATHERINE I thought it was a pretty good beginning. 
They look at each other.  They keep walking.  A long beat. 
NICK How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too? 
CATHERINE (after a beat) Do you want her to join us sometime? 
He looks at her: she's serious. 
NICK I didn't mean for me -- I meant for you. 
She looks at him. 
CATHERINE I'm not as judgmental about women as I am about men. 
They keep walking.  A long beat. 
NICK How's your shoulder? 
CATHERINE Fine.  How's your back? 
NICK It hurts. 
She stops, looks at him.  A long beat. 
CATHERINE We're alike, you know. 
A beat, he looks at her -- 
Nick pours him more coffee; Gus guzzles it. 
GUS (loud) How could you fuck her? 
It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes him, pours him more coffee.  He drinks it. 
GUS (quietly) You wanna die, son?  What is it -- those goddamn tourists -- you still feel so bad about that you're wigglin' your way into an icepi -- (suddenly louder) We got too many goddamn tourists comin' here anyway -- plenty more goddamn tourists where they goddamn came from. 
Some people here really give him the looks now.  Gus looks angrily away from them, drinks more coffee. 
NICK (after a beat; quietly) I'm not afraid of her. 
GUS (loud) Why the hell not? 
NICK I don't know.  I'm just not. 
GUS (loud) That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head. 
GUS (smiles; to Nick) It ain't your brain. 
They look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee. He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes. 
A long beat. 
GUS (quietly) I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin D for Dickhead Nilsen.  They found a safety deposit box with fifty- thousand dollars in it, taken out three months ago, used that one time. 
He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely. 
She looks away. 
NICK (after a long beat) It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago. 
GUS Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle. 
Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, he's completely preoccupied. 
INT. A CAR - NIGHT 
Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner. 
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage Cadillac. 
NICK You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you? 
GUS In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch. 
NICK Come on, I'll drive you in this thing. 
GUS You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car. 
And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes his head. 
INT. A CAR - NIGHT 
Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street. He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, parked behind the country and western bar. 
The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, full bore. 
EXT. THE ALLEY 
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out It is a black Ferrari. 
INT. HIS PORSCHE 
He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction the Ferrari turned. 
EXT. THE STREET 
The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming. 
INT. THE PORSCHE 
He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it turned, he turns wildly. 
EXT. THE STREET 
The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining ground behind it, making turns. 
INT. THE PORSCHE 
The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard. 
Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- stand there? 
He sits down, looks at them.  A beat, as they look at him, then -- 
DR. MCELWAINE (courtly) Nick -- when you recollect your childhood, are your recollections pleasing to you? 
Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief. 
NICK (calmly, directly) Number one I don't remember how often I used to jack off, but it was a lot.  Number two I didn't get pissed off at my dad -- even after I was old enough to know what he and mom were doing in the bedroom.  Number three I don't look in the toilet before I flush it.  Number four I don't wet the bed and haven't for some time. Number five You can go fuck yourselves because I'm out of here. 
INT. THE CORRIDOR 
He is walking away quickly.  Beth is with him, trying to keep up.  She is very angry. 
BETH What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you? 
NICK I don't need any help. 
BETH Yes you do.  Something's on with you. (a beat) You're sleeping with her, aren't you? 
A beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking. 
NICK What is this interest you've got in her? 
BETH My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates -- 
NICK I thought you hardly know her. 
BETH I know the type.  I'm a psychologist. 
He stops, looks at her. 
NICK (after a beat) That means you manipulate people too, doesn't it, Beth?  You're a practicing psychologist -- that means you're better at it than she is. 
She looks at him a long beat. 
BETH (quietly) I feel sorry for you, Nick. 
A beat, and she turns and walks away. 
EXT. ROAD TO STINSON HOUSE - DAY 
Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.  He is driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and twisting road. 
INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY 
Nick enters and shuts door.  Looking around, he does not see her. 
NICK Catherine! (after a beat) Catherine! 
Finally he sees her sitting by the window.  He walks over to her. 
CATHERINE (near tears) I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you. (a beat) I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she? 
NICK (a beat) Did you like her to watch? 
CATHERINE (a long beat) Do you think I told her to kill You? 
NICK (softly, with intensity) No. 
CATHERINE (after a beat, near tears) Everybody that I care about dies. 
She is about to break into uncontrolable sobbing.  Nick puts his arms around her. 
NICK (soothing) It's OK.  It's OK. 
CATHERINE (quietly, almost begging) Make love to me. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
They are seen rolling and turning around on each other. 
Their love making is sensual, sincere. 
Later in bed. 
NICK (calmly, but seriously) Do you think she killed Johnny Boz? 
CATHERINE (surprised, startled) For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me. 
NICK (a beat) Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too. 
CATHERINE (after a beat) No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited. (a beat) I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful. 
ANDREWS I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here. 
NICK It's not gonna take long, Sam. 
We see the computer screen.  The screen says LISA HENDERSON DMV LICENSE CHECK We wait and then we see the words 1983 RENEWAL -- ELIZABETH GARDNER, 147 QUEENSTON DRIVE, SALINAS, CAL. 
Nick stares at the screen. 
NICK Bring it up, will you, Sam? 
A beat, and then we see the license itself It is Beth Gardner on the photo.  Nick stares. 
ANDREWS Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it? 
NICK Bring 1976 up. 
A beat, and the license comes up.  We see a young Beth Gardner on the photo.  She has blonde hair. 
Nick stares. 
INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
She walks in.  The apartment is dark. 
NICK You shouldn't leave your door open. 
She is startled. 
BETH (after a beat) I didn't.  Something's wrong with my lock. 
A beat, she looks at him. 
BETH (cold) What do you want, Nick? 
NICK (quietly) Tell me about Catherine. 
She looks at him a long beat, then turns away -- 
BETH She told you, didn't she? 
NICK (after a beat) What did she tell me, Beth? 
BETH (after a long beat) I slept with her once in school. (a beat) I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time. (a beat) She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me. 
She looks at him, sees his look. 
BETH Isn't that what she told you? 
He looks at her a long beat. 
NICK She told me it was you.  You wore the same kind of clothes.  You dyed your hair blonde. 
A long beat as they look at each other. 
BETH I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too. 
NICK (after a beat) Did you know Noah Goldstein? 
BETH I had him in two classes. 
NICK You saw all the reports, Beth! 
Phil had you copied.  You never said anything! 
BETH (after a beat) What do I say -- Hey, listen, guys, I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect. (she turns away) I was embarrassed.  It's the only time I've been with a woman. 
She turns to him. 
BETH She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her. 
NICK She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson. 
BETH She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant? (she smiles) Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it. 
Nick looks at her a long beat. 
NICK Why did you change your name? 
BETH I got married. (a beat) He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long. 
He gets up.  He looks at her a long beat. 
BETH Nick -- Do you really think I... that I could kill someone... I never even met Johnny Boz.  What about Nilsen?  What possible motive would I have to kill him? 
Gus thinks about it. 
GUS She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is. 
NICK She's a writer -- it's part of what she does. 
GUS (irate) Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. (a beat) There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened. 
NICK I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened. 
GUS (after a beat, quietly) You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man. 
INT. THE STAIRWAY - HIS APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT 
He has his key out to open his door.  He hears MUSIC inside. 
A beat, and he opens the door. 
INT. HIS APARTMENT 
It is dark.  We hear a Rolling Stones SONG.  He sees Catherine standing by a window, watching him.  She wears black jeans and the black motorcycle jacket. 
They look at each other a long beat. 
NICK How'd you get in here? 
CATHERINE I decided to give you one more chance. (a beat) I missed you. 
NICK You didn't not see me long enough to miss me. 
CATHERINE Did you miss me? 
NICK No. 
CATHERINE Come over here and tell me no. 
He walks up close to her. 
NICK No. 
She unzips her motorcycle jacket slowly.  She wears nothing underneath it. 
NICK That's below the belt. 
She reaches for him. 
CATHERINE Not yet it isn't. 
She pulls him close. 
CATHERINE But we're getting there. 
INT. HIS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
They sit in the window seat, naked.  His back is against the wall.  She sits against him.  He has his legs around her. They don't look at each other.  She is smoking. 
NICK I have to do some research tomorrow. 
CATHERINE I'm very good at research.  I'll help you. 
NICK No thanks. 
CATHERINE What are you researching? 
NICK I'm writing a book. 
CATHERINE (smiles) Really.  What are you writing about. 
NICK A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl. 
CATHERINE (smiles) What happens to them? 
NICK (after a beat) They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after. 
CATHERINE (after a beat) It won't sell. 
NICK Why not? 
CATHERINE (after a beat) Somebody has to die. 
NICK Why? 
CATHERINE Somebody always does. 
CATHERINE (quietly) Goodbye, Nick. 
He stares at her.  A long beat. 
CATHERINE I finished my book. (a beat) Didn't you hear me?* (a beat) Your character's dead. (a beat) Goodbye. 
He stares at her.  He can't believe what she is saying. 
CATHERINE What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers. 
NICK (after a beat) What is this -- some kind of... Joke? (a beat; he almost smiles) Are we playing games again? 
CATHERINE (after a beat) The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter. 
He stares at her. 
A VOICE INSIDE Catherine? 
Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there. 
Catherine still has her eyes on him. 
CATHERINE Right there. 
A beat, and then she turns to go inside.  Hazel Dobkins smiles slowly at him. 
EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK 
He sits in his Porsche, staring ahead.  He is parked next to Gus' Cadillac.  Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car. 
GUS (excited) Catherine Tramell's roommate her freshman year.  I got a call from her.  I've been calling people who were in her dorm all day.  She must've heard I was trying to talk to her.  She says she knows all about Catherine and Lisa Henderson. She's over in Oakland.  You wanna come with me? 
Nick just stares ahead. 
GUS You look like you seen a ghost, son? 
Nick looks at him. 
INT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Gus drives. 
GUS (excited) Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an office on Van Ness.  Guess who he shares office space with?  Dr. Elizabeth Gardner. 
Nick doesn't even respond.  Gus looks at him. 
GUS What in hell's the matter with you? 
Nick doesn't say anything, stares ahead. 
EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING - OAKLAND - NIGHT 
Gus gets out with Nick.  It is an old building. 
GUS Where the hell you goin'? 
NICK (after a beat) I'm going with you. 
GUS She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long. 
A beat, and Nick gets back in the car. 
INT. THE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 
Gus is on the first floor.  There is no one around.  He hits the elevator button.  A beat, and it comes.  He steps in. 
INT. THE ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
He hits the button for the fourth floor. 
The elevator rises a floor, stops.  The door opens.  There is no one there.  Then it starts going up again.  It rises to the third floor.  It stops.  The door opens.  There is no one there. Then it starts to rise again. 
EXT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Nick sits there, staring ahead. 
NICK (suddenly, screaming) Gus! 
INT. THE ELEVATOR 
As it goes up.  It stops.  The door starts to open.  As it does -- a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the elevator. It happens very fast.  We see blonde hair around the face. 
But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, the hood up.  There is an icepick in the figure's hand.  The figure explodes into Gus.  The icepick goes into his neck. 
LT. WALKER (quietly) Jesus. 
INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Nick with Lt. Walker.  Nick looks like a zombie.  Andrews comes up to them.  He has a gun in his hands. 
ANDREWS Thirty-eight caliber revolver. 
Bottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom. 
LT. WALKER Have  ballistics check it for Nilsen. 
Harrigan comes out. 
HARRIGAN Lieutenant, you'd better come in here. 
Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him. 
There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is open. 
Walker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine. 
Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy. 
He hands the photos to Nick. 
Nick stares at them. 
LT. WALKER I guess that's it. 
INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT 
Nick sits, his feet up.  He looks like a zombie.  With him are Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott.  We see other plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on phones.  A long beat. 
LT. WALKER She must've heard you on the stairway and dumped the stuff. 
Nick says nothing, stares off. 
A DETECTIVE comes over to them. 
DETECTIVE There was no suite 405 in that building.  Catherine Tramell's roommate in her freshman year is dead.  She died of leukemia two years ago. 
An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them. 
INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN Our files on Dr. Gardner show nothing about a police report in Berkeley -- nothing related to Salinas, either. 
A long beat -- the phone RINGS.  Andrews picks it up, listens. 
ANDREWS Thanks. 
He hangs up. 
ANDREWS Ballistics says the .38 we found in her apartment matches Nilsen. No registration.  They're checking with Salinas.  The icepick is the same brand and model as the Boz weapon. 
A long beat -- Nick just stares. 
Harrigan comes up to them. 
HARRIGAN We checked the tape machines at Dr.  Gardner's apartment and at her office -- both here and the one on Van Ness.  No message from Gus on any of 'em.  The one at her apartment was broken. (a beat) Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner and Boz meeting at a Christmas party at his house a year ago. 
A long beat. 
LT. WALKER (after a long beat, sadly) You just can't tell about people, can you.  Even the ones you think you know inside-out. 
He and Nick look at each other a beat. 
CAPTAIN TALCOTT Congratulations, Curran. 
Nick looks at him, expressionless. 
EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy. 
He starts heading inside. 
INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps. 
INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT 
He opens his door with his key.

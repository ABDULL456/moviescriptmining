1 EXT. MANHATTAN. BROADWAY. UPPER 70S. DAY. 1 
From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the curb. She steps off the curb toward us -- A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to and fro through the frame. 
CREDITS BEGIN OVER: 
2 EXT. ANOTHER CORNER. DAY. 2 
The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the mid-day work crowd crosses the street. 
3 EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS. DAY. 3 
MONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers, mid-day, all kinds, going all different ways, all over the city. CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags, walking among the crowds. 
4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4 
An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School, one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids. The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers. 
MR AARON Abrams... Allende... One after the other the students get up to collect their tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to their chairs. On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly, somewhat bad-temperedly. 
MR AARON (CONT'D) Bernstein... Cohen... At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk. LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face as she reaches out her hand -- 
4 CONTINUED: 4 
LISA Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1" 
5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. LATER. 5 
AFTER CLASS -- The last students go out as Mr Aaron gestures for Lisa to take a seat. 
MR AARON Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about your test for a minute. 
LISA 
(SITTING) Sure. 
MR AARON Now...I know you had a little help... 
LISA Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean. 
MR AARON I'm just saying I know you had a little help. 
LISA A lot of people did. 
MR AARON Be that as it may -- 
LISA I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life... 
MR AARON Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily true. Haven't you ever developed an interest in something you didn't initially think you were going to develop an interest in? 
LISA Um, no, not really. 
Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up. 
5 CONTINUED: 5 
LISA (CONT'D) Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big difference-between using a book and like, I don't know, using somebody else's mind who's like, really good at math? It's not like this person did the whole test for me. 
MR AARON Oh no? 
LISA No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back. 
MR AARON Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you did all of it. OK? 
LISA You are so fair. 
6 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY. 6 
TRACKING LISA from behind as she walks through the halls past her fellow students. She walks through a door -- 
7 EXT. ALLEY. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 7 
-- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby. 
BECKY What did he say to you? 
LISA Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs. 
LISA (CONT'D) He is so appealing. A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE. 
KIRSTEN OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole. 
KURT What'd he do, call on you? 
KIRSTEN Fuck you., Kurt. 
7 CONTINUED: 7 
LESLIE Kirsten is really upset. 
KURT I'm sorry. 
KIRSTEN 
(TO LESLIE) Let me have one of those, will you? Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her. 
BECKY Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked. 
KIRSTEN I don't. -I'm just really angry. (to Leslie) Check out what he. said to me last week. She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa watches them. 
LESLIE Are you serious? Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to some other girls seated on the steps. 
MONICA .I just don't think you can really know a guy until you've slept with him. Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know. 
8 INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 8 
The class is taught by two teachers; MR KLEIN, 50s, and MR LEWIS, 30s. On the blackboard are scrawled the words "STRIKERS" "PINKERTONS" and "PREZ. McKINLEY." 
KLEIN .So the President of the United States, William B. McKinley, authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike, and they went out there and shot them down! Just like they did in Virginia, just like they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did not care! They did not care! 
LEWIS (low, rumbling) And that's basically it-That's basically all there is to say. 
KLEIN All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky. 
8 CONTINUED: 8 
BECKY Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a good President of the United States? There is some laughter from the students. 
KLEIN I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good question. What do you think? You. Lionel. What do you think? Did we ever have a good President? 
LIONEL Um...I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt. 
- LEWIS Lisa? 
LISA Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of -- whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair. 
ANTHONY Lisa has raised a salient point. There are some laughs from the class. 
9 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 9 
School is letting out. LISA walks away from the building. A short energetic kid named DARREN falls in step with her. 
DARREN Hey, how'd you do? 
LISA 
(RESUMES EATING) It is gross. She eats. He watches her. 
CURTIS Do you want to play a game? 
LISA No. 
CURTIS Please! 
LISA I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging me. 
CURTIS Can I have some pizza? She gives him a piece of pizza. He sits. They eat together. 
11A INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 11A 
Curtis is practicing the piano. 
12 INT. LISA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. 12 
Lisa, on her cell phone, rummages in her mother's bureau. During the following she finds a small supply of cash and steals forty dollars. 
LISA (On the phone) What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: Darren wants me to go to the movies with him. You want to come? I guess around eight? 
13 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 13 
POV LISA: slowly passing by Broadway clothing store windows. No cowboy hats. She walks down Broadway window shopping, enjoying herself. 
14 EXT. ANTIQUE CLOTHING STORE. DAY. 14 
Through the window, we see Lisa talk to the pretty, mid-20s SALESGIRL with an embroidered cowboy hat. 
14A TIME PERMITTING 14A 
15 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 15 
As Lisa slowly passes-by and looks in various store windows. She stops and looks at some shoes. REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW, behind her, a city BUS pulls up to a bus stop and wheezes as the doors open. 
16 EXT/INT STREET/BUS. SIMULTANEOUS. 16 The BUS DRIVER is wearing a cowboy hat. He is in his 30s and kind of good-looking. Past the disembarking passengers we see Lisa's back as she scans the shoe store. ON LISA -- She turns around and sees the Bus Driver. She sees his cowboy hat and just as the doors shut -- 
LISA 
(TO DRIVER) Hey! The bus lurches away. Lisa takes off after it. IN THE BUS -- CLOSE on the Bus Driver, oblivious to Lisa, who we can see out the door and window, falling behind. ON THE STREET -- The bus falls behind a slow-moving car and Lisa catches up. IN THE BUS -- Lisa appears at the bus doors, waving and calling out. The Bus Driver sees her, smiles and waves back. ON THE STREET -- Lisa is running alongside the bus. 
LISA (CONT'D) Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat? IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at her with good-natured flirtatiousness. ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW. THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the light. THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas. He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it. The LIGHT turns RED. Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his head in a farewell salute as.-- LISA sees the bus pass under the RED LIGHT -- 
Goldenrod Revised 10/23/05 - Page 12 
16 CONTINUED: 16 An Upper-West Side WOMAN, 40s or 50s (Later identified as MONICA PATTERSON) holding some grocery bags steps off the curb between two cars to cross Broadway. 
VERY FAST: THE BUS DRIVER turns his head to look straight forward. POV BUS DRIVER -- Monica is directly in front of him. POV MONICA -- The bus roars up at her. THE BUS DRIVER slams on the BRAKES. POV LISA -- Monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled tumbling underneath. LISA SCREAMS. Pedestrians all over turn around. MONICA is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble. Everything stops. TRACKING LISA fast as she runs across the street toward the accident. As she gets closer she sees Monica's leg sticking out from under the bus. Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak. She is making choking sounds. Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where to put her hands. Other people start converging. IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the door and rushes out. WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through till we find LISA kneeling next to the disoriented MONICA, holding her hand. They are both covered in blood. Several other people are shouting and talking all at once. 
1ST MAN Somebody call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Everyone calm down! 
KID I'm calling one right now...! The Kid is already dialing his cell phone. Other people are doing the same. 
2ND MAN Get an ambulance!

35 INT. HUMANITIES CLASS. DAY. 35 
Lisa sits in class dully. The class is reading paperbacks of King Lear. The teacher, JOHN, is a rather high-strung slightly harsh enthusiast with glasses and a beard. 
JOHN Matthew, if you would read France... And Anthony, you read Burgundy... 
ANTHONY (With mock relish) Ah. Burgundy. 
JOHN And I guess I'm gonna hog the part of Lear again... 
36 INT. HUMANITIES CLASS. MOMENT LATER. 36

When I saw that DARREN dog I says that's the ugliest Something obviously is... dog I ever saw. She says good! Nobody'll steal him. LISA Everything's just fucked NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 up... Who's gonna steal him? 
DARREN NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Like what? Who's gonna steal him? 
LISA NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Just everything. That's what I said. 
DARREN NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 But what specifically is What's the name of it? fucked up? NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 LISA (very low) It's called a bull terrier. Nothing.

NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 No, what's the name of the dog? 
NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Barnaby. The two ladies keep on talking. 
LISA (Very low, eyes down) So...I've been thinking about your suggestion... 
DARREN Uh huh...? 
LISA I guess I_don't think it's a very good idea. 
DARREN Why not? 
LISA I guess I don't feel that way about you. 
DARREN But those kinds of feelings can develop. I definitely feel like there's a connection there. 
LISA 
(VERY LOW) I know there is. 
DARREN I just think you're scared. I'think you're scared of your own feelings. I think you've been hurt in the past by other guys and I think what it would feel like to have a real feeling is really terrifying to you. 
She wipes her eyes because tears are running down her cheeks 
DARREN (CONT'D) What's the matter? (Pause) What's the matter? 
She won't look at him. O.C. AUDIENCE APPLAUSE takes us to:

RAMON My family are from Colombia... My.father worked in the diplomatic service... 
2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 28 
38 CONTINUED: 38 
JOAN Really. Wow. 
RAMON I grew up five years in Panama, four years in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After I finish university, I moved back to Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French, they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking Spanish, they think I'm french. 
JOAN And what do you do, Ramon? 
RAMON I have a company: We design computer software to help companies in South American countries.that use an incompatible software, so the computers can't talk to each other. It's a big problem in Central and South America, where there is not usually so much coordination in computer communications. So right now there's a big opportunity for us, because for the big software companies it's still in the backwoods. That's changing already, but in the last ten years we have done extremely well. It's the next ten years we're going to see what happens. 
JOAN Uh huh? God... 
A39 INT. BAR/RESTAURANT. LATER. A39 
Joan and Ramon are leaving the restaurant: 
RAMON Can I give you a lift?

RAMON May I have your telephone number?

LISA Mom...? 
JOAN 
(STARTLED) Just a second! 
LISA (opening the door) Can I come in? 
JOAN Just one second, honey. Hold on! (covering herself up) Come in. Lisa comes in and sits on the edge of the bed. 
LIONEL Yeah, I just want to ask like, why is OK to drop bombs on men, but it's not OK to drop bombs on women and children? Isn't that just reverse sexism? 
KLEIN I don't know. That's an interesting point. I agree it's a bullshit term. 
LISA This is totally stupid. 
KLEIN (Looking for hands) Uhhhhhh...Monica! 
MONICA Yeah, I think this whole class should apologize to Angie, because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture -- 
ANGIE Thank you! 
2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 33 
44 CONTINUED: (4) 44 
MONICA -- and everybody started screaming at her like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan! 
LISA They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to throw acid in women's faces! 
MONICA ANGIE Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs -- Afghanies? The Iraqis? Then why don't you drop bombs on the Ku Klux Klan? LISA Because they're white? Yes! No! The Taliban! Do you wish they were LIONEL still there? There's six people with their hands raised before ANTHONY you, Lisa! The correct term is Afghans. 
MONICA 
(TO LISA) But I'm not even saying I disagree with you! I'm only saying I think it's pathetic the way people in this class treated Angie just for saying something they don't agree with. 
KLEIN Because that's censorship, right? Right? 
MONICA LISA Yeah! (a joke:) Right on! It's not censorship...! This class is not the ANGIE government! Thank you... ! 
ANTHONY That's not technically LEWIS true. It's censorship. 
LISA Oh my God, no it's not!

_ KARL OK. Well. I would actually seriously recommend you go over to, uh, to Claremont Stables and see about getting some lessons. 
LISA No, I was actually really thinking about doing that... 
KARL So how's everything going? How's school? 
LISA School's OK. I'm kind of fucking up in geometry... 
KARL 
OK...? 
LISA But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious... 
KARL Yeah. Math was never my strong suit either. 
LISA Well, I am definitely following in your footsteps in that regard-How are you? 
KARL I'm fine. I'm good. Things are picking up a little bit, which is good. How's the boyfriend situation? 
LISA Oh the same. They're all kind of the same. 
50 CONTINUED: (2) 50 
KARL Uh huh? Well, next time you come out here I'll try to hook you up with some more interesting people than you seem to be meeting at the moment. 
LISA Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the California type. 
KARL Well -- I don't either, per se. It 
somewhat depends on who it is, obviously... 
LISA Hard to argue with. I think I'll stop generalizing,now...! 
KARL OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe. I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give my love to Curtis, and say hello to your Mom.

60 CONTINUED: 60 
LISA Hey... You know I really love you, right? 
DARREN Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.

MR AARON What's going on, Lisa? 
64 INT. GEOMETRY CLASS - A FEW MINUTES LATER. DAY. 64 
Lisa and Mr Aaron sit at his desk. 
64 CONTINUED: 64 
LISA .Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place. 
MR AARON What does your being rich have to do with anything? 
LISA You know what I mean. 
- MR AARON No, I don't. 
LISA Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver. 
MR AARON OK...But I still don't see what any of that has to do with what you do or don't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed. 
LISA Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door. 
MR AARON Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes. 
LIONEL I just thought you'd want to know there's like a lot of people out here and it's getting kind of hard to breathe. 
MR AARON You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door. 
MR AARON (CONT'D) All right: I have to let those guys in. I don't want to leave you hanging...If you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup of coffee after school...

JOAN Does this-make me look fat? 
LISA Um, a little. 
JOAN Well, there's nothing I can do about it. 
LISA Where are you going? 
JOAN The opera...! 
LISA Why are you going to the opera? 
JOAN It turns out he's a really big opera fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime. 
LISA Uh, no thanks. 
JOAN Why not? I bet you'd like it. 
LISA I don't like that kind of singing. 
JOAN But you like classical music. 
LISA Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing. 
66 CONTINUED: 66 
JOAN LISA But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that interesting. 
JOAN Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute. 
LISA OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it. 
JOAN What is the matter with you? 
LISA Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera! 
JOAN Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is "No thanks!" 
LISA I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times! 
JOAN OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon. 
LISA Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think. 
JOAN Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that? 
LISA I guess you would. Withdrawn. 
66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 
JOAN Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you? 
LISA Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here! 
PAUL That's pretty much what I figured...(Pause) So, do you want to come over here? Should I come over there...? 
LISA Well, my Mom just went out for the evening...Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home. 
PAUL All right. (Pause) Do you want to give me your address? 
LISA (blushing almost to death) It's 252 West 85th Street...

Darren lies on his bed, depressed. He dials the phone. 
LISA (on the phone) Hello? 
DARREN Hey. What are you up to? 
LISA Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper. 
DARREN Really? That's impressive. 
LISA Not really. 
DARREN I've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before. 
LISA Well, I don't want to fail Humanities. 
DARREN You're not gonna fail Humanities. 
LISA No, probably not. 
DARREN So what did you do tonight? 
LISA Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like talking right now. Pause. 
DARREN 
OK. 
LISA 
OK? 
DARREN Yeah. I'll talk to you later. 
LISA 
OK.

71 INT. HALL. NIGHT. 71 
Lisa, dressed up a little and wearing some makeup, opens the door for Paul. He's not dressed up at all. He's smoking. 
PAUL Hey. 
LISA Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in. 
PAUL I think I-just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator. 
LISA Oh really? What did they say? 
PAUL She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator. 
LISA That's original... TRACKING them as they come into the living room... 
LISA (CONT'D) So this is the living room. 
PAUL Very livable. 
LISA We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way. 
PAUL Have you? 
LISA Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich. 
PAUL This book is a very cool book. 
LISA Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now. 
71 CONTINUED: 71 
PAUL It's pretty hard to put down once you get started. - 
LISA Do you want anything to drink? 
PAUL I'd take a beer. 
72 INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 72 
Lisa has two beers out and is looking through drawers. 
LISA OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. - 
PAUL Here, lemme have them. He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter. He makes two marks in the counter doing this. 
LISA Thanks. 
PAUL Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry. 
LISA Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it. 
PAUL Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?" 
LISA How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny. 
PAUL It's just a gift. She laughs nervously. They drink beer. 
LISA So...do you want to see my room? 
PAUL Sure. 
73 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 73 
They come into her room. She closes the door. 
73 CONTINUED: 73 
LISA This is my room. Ta da. 
PAUL Very nice. She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed. 
LISA And these are my stuffed animals. 
PAUL Always important to meet the stuffed animals. 
LISA These are some drawings I did...Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, right? 
PAUL I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing. 
LISA 
(FEELING AROUND) Yeah. It definitely did. 
PAUL Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds are overwhelmingly that it's OK. O.C. the doorbell rings. 
LISA That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS. 
LISA (CONT'D) Hi, Curtis. 
CURTIS Hi. We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette. 
PAUL Hey. 
LISA Hey. (sits down) Can I have a drag? (takes a drag of his cigarette) Thanks. 
(MORE) 
75 CONTINUED: (3) 75 
LISA (CONT'D) (gives it back to him) I'm actually kind of mad at you... 
PAUL Why? (Pause) Why? (Pause) Because we didn't use birth control? 
LISA I guess so. 
PAUL It was at the ready... 
LISA Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day. 
PAUL 
Didn't you ever hear of the "Morning After 
The Guy Came Too Fast Pill?" 
LISA Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill? 
PAUL Well...that's the Canadian name. 
LISA Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine...Or not...! 
PAUL Try to listen to me. Right about now is when you're traditionally supposed to freak out. So why don't you just not? You're not gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS -- 
LISA How do you know? Have you been tested? 
PAUL No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it, because of my demographic. And the odds are you're probably not gonna have to have an abortion either. And since this was your first time, it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one. 
LISA I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions. (Pause) Anyway...Thank you for deflowering me. 
75 CONTINUED: (4) 75 
PAUL You're welcome. 
LISA Did it freak you out that I said I love you? 
PAUL No...It didn't freak me out. 
LISA You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me. 
PAUL I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you. 
LISA You should probably go now... 
76 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 76

Joan and Ramon walk arm in arm away from Lincoln Center. 
JOAN Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting! 
RAMON ' Good! We should go again! 
JOAN But how about those people yelling "Bravi!" and "Brava!" 
RAMON How do you mean? 
JOAN It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!" Why can't they just say "Bravo?" 
RAMON Well, it's the plural. 
JOAN I know -- 
RAMON It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble. 
JOAN No, I know, I know it's correct, it just -- don't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people? 
RAMON Pretentious? 
JOAN I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it...But you know how you can really be enjoying something -- but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye -- because you know people are watching you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at all? 
RAMON Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company. 
81 CONTINUED: 81 
JOAN Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean. 
RAMON You use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer. 
JOAN Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank you. 
RAMON We'll have to go again. 
JOAN It was so glamorous...!

Lisa is on the phone. 
LISA Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz? 
ABIGAIL This is Abigail. 
LISA Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I... 
ABIGAIL Yes? Hello? 
LISA Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson? 
ABIGAIL 
OK...? 
LISA I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died... 
ABIGAIL 
OK...? 
LISA Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time... 
86 CONTINUED: 86 
ABIGAIL Yes? What can I do for you? 
LISA OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because -- 
ABIGAIL 
(ON "ASSUME")) No. As far as I know they're doing something or other next week. But -- 
LISA I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter? 
ABIGAIL LISA No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive -- She -- I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago. 
LISA Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was 
IT -- 
ABIGAIL She had leukemia. 
LISA Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa? 
ABIGAIL Yes...? 
LISA OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought -- 
ABIGAIL Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number? 
LISA Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to -- 
ABIGAIL 
(ON "IF") Well they really shouldn't be giving out my number. (blurts out) This is harassment! 
86 CONTINUED: (2) 86 
LISA 
(SHOCKED) I'm sorry! -I'm not trying to harass 
YOU -- 
ABIGAIL I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me. 
LISA I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to 
CONTACT -- 
ABIGAIL Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop. 
LISA Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen? 
ABIGAIL Yes, all right. 
87 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT/COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 87 
EMILY MORRISON, 40s, is on the phone in her Upper West Side apartment. She's on the phone with Lisa. 
EMILY I guess it would be all right ...It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine... 
LISA Oh so was she a lawyer? 
EMILY Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had -- several careers. 
87 CONTINUED: 87 
LISA Were you really good friends with her? 
EMILY Yes I was. 
88 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 88 
Joan is reading audition sides. Lisa passes through, dressed somberly. 
JOAN Where you going, sweetie? 
LISA I'm going to that woman's funeral. 
JOAN Are you sure you don't want me to come? 
LISA Why? I don't even know her. 
JOAN I would be coming for you. 
89 INT. EMILY'S CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT. DAY. 89 
EMILY opens the door for LISA. In the b.g. about thirty people are gathered. A mix of Upper West Siders, social workers, and Monica's multi-ethnic clients. 
EMILY Hi. Are you Lisa? 
LISA Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come. 
EMILY Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink? 
LISA Oh -- Um -- no thanks. 
EMILY We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres. 
LISA Oh - that's quite all right, thank you. 
90 INT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM. DAY. 90 
Everyone is seated on Emily's chairs and borrowed chairs. 
90 CONTINUED: 90 
EMILY Well-thank you all for coming. 
WOMAN MOURNER Thank you for doing this, Emily. 
THE MOURNERS Yes, thank you, Emily. 
EMILY As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica. (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly. 
EMILY (CONT'D) I don't want to tell anyone what to think, or how to feel. And I don't want to kid myself about the stupid, meaningless way she died, because it would really make her throw up. But I don't want it to become the summation of her life. Because it's not. When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can you stand it?" And she said. "First of all I can't. But I don't want to take away the twelve years she did have, and turn them all into leukemia. Because they weren't." So despite the fact that she got -- ripped off, I do think it's important to remember that Monica got a lot out of life. She was the most fully developed person I personally have ever known. She was also impossible to get along with, but that's another story. Everybody laughs. 
DAVID But what are you saying? A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong?

96 CONTINUED: (3) 96 
JOHN No, I'm not saying that. But I would like to move on -- 
DAVID I think he is saying that, because he's comparing human consciousness to flies, and he's saying that we can't see the truth around us because our consciousness is undeveloped. 
JOHN No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like to move on. David laughs derisively.

LISA OK. How are you? 
KARL Not too bad. Pretty good. I'm sitting here listening to some music. Having a glass of delicious beer. 
LISA That sounds pleasant. 
KARL Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How's the boyfriend situation? 
LISA Well...there's this one guy I sort of had something going with. But he kind of has a girlfriend, so...

LISA Don't forget mature. 
KARL Well -- I'm hoping you're not too mature. 
LISA No...Don't worry. 
KARL OK good. That was a good answer,. 
LISA Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- standing relationship... 
KARL OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You do absolutely nothing. And one of two things will happen. Either he's gonna start doing back flips to get your attention, or you're gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesn't do back flips he's not gonna get your attention. OK? 
LISA Well, I think he already knows I like him. 
KARL Uh huh? OK... 
LISA .I think I might have spilled the beans on that one a little -- 
KARL That's OK. Because now, if now you stop acknowledging him, you just suddenly give him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless he's just not interested. In which case, you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is tough. 
LISA Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him. 
KARL Yeah. Lemme know what happens. 
LISA 
98 CONTINUED: (3) 98 
KARL OK. Well, everything's OK here...A little 
SLOW -- 
LISA Actually, Dad? I definitely want to hear how things are with you in a minute, but I actually have something kind of serious I want to ask you about ...I'm kind of soliciting people I respect-for their views on this...

LISA . so do you think I should go back to the police, or what? 
KARL OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you told me. Second of all, I think you should let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be. 
LISA You mean to protect myself before I go back? 
KARL There's nothing wrong with knowing what you're getting into. I'm gonna call my friend Lorne, I want to see what he says. ANNETTE, Karl's, girlfriend, 40, lets herself into the house. 
ANNETTE LISA Hey...! Actually, Dad? Please don't call anybody. KARL Seriously. I appreciate Hi babe. your taking charge and everything, but -- ANNETTE Hello? Did you get my message? 
KARL Um -- I got a message. 
100 CONTINUED: 100 
ANNETTE About the flowers? For my mother? 
KARL I don't know. Yes. Hold on. (To LISA) I'm sorry, Annette just walked in. 
LISA That's OK. 
ANNETTE Who are you talking to? 
KARL I'm -- It's -- could I just -- 
LISA Anyway, I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself, if you see what I mean. Because I don't think I have so far. 
KARL Uh huh? 
ANNETTE LISA Who is that? Not that I'm trying to make this woman's KARL horrible death into my own Uh Huh? It's Lisa. personal moral gymnasium... to quote George Bernard ANNETTE Shaw. Good. Will you please ask her 
KARL I'm sorry, Lisa. Hold on one second. 
LISA 
OK. 
KARL 
(TO ANNETTE) Yes. 
ANNETTE Will you please ask her if there's anything we don't know about that she won't eat? For the trip? Because I have to tell the ranch, because they do all the meals ahead of time 
KARL Yes: I will: We're just in the middle of something. 
100 CONTINUED: (2) 100 
ANNETTE Karl, I was supposed to call them last week. You said you were gonna call her and you didn't. So then I called her, and she never called me back. So what do you want me to do? 
KARL OK, you know what? I want to talk about this, not right now. 
ANNETTE -- and if there's anything she can't eat and they put it in the hampers, she's not gonna have anything to eat. The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she couldn't eat anything on the menu. 
KARL I'm going to ask her. I will. We're right in the middle of something. 
ANNETTE OK. Tell her I said hi. 
LISA Yes! I'm upset about the accident! I'm very 
upset about the accident! I was covered in blood! I've never been covered in blood before, and I wanted to talk to you about it for a minute! Why is that so strange!? 
MRS MARETTI Gerry... why don't we all go inside and sit 
down? 
LISA 
(ON "WHY") Could I please talk to you alone? 
MRS MARETTI. OK, what is goin' on here? 
MARETTI Nothin's goin' on here. So whyn't you calm down? Look: Go ahead inside. Let me find out what this is. Meantime whyn't you make sure those kids aren't killin' each other, all right?

MARETTI Yes? What? Speak! 
LISA Well... you probably already know, obviously, that I told-the police on the police report that I thought the whole, thing was an accident... 
MARETTI Uh huh. Right. Because it was an accident. 
LISA Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on purpose. 
MARETTI On purpose...? 
LISA But it wasn't like... 
MARETTI What. (Pause) Speak. Talk! What! 
LISA Well ...I mean ...We were looking at each other... 
MARETTI Who was looking at each other...? You and me? 
LISA Well ...Yeah ...I mean. . .not like... romantically or anything... 
MARETTI Romantically...! 
LISA OK, scratch that. 'Cause that's not even... relevant...

MARETTI (CONT'D) I've got my kids inside: You're an attractive young lady, you show up at the house -- Please! Get to the point or go home. Because I don't care enough, frankly, to stand around here tryin' to figure out what you're doin' here! (Pause) What! What! What! What! 
LISA All right! Well...the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat -- 
MARETTI Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes. I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes. What. 
LISA If you could just let me...! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one... and you were kind of waving back...And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it -- 
MARETTI No Criminality, that's right. 
LISA -- I guess partly because of what I told them. And I know I was distracting you, but -- I did see the bus go through the red light. And that's when it hit that woman. 
MARETTI OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over here. 
LISA Only nobody said that to them. And I just wanted to like, acknowledge with you that that's what happened. 
MARETTI OK. First of all, I don't really know what you mean by wavin' at you...What were you, tryin' to catch the bus...? 
LISA No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your -- 
Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 86A 
112 CONTINUED: (6) 112 
MARETTI Maybe I was wavin' at you like, wavin' to say, you know, "Step away from the bus," if the bus was in motion, I would've waved you away for your-own safety, but that's all that would be. 
Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 87 
112 CONTINUED: (7) 112 
LISA You don't remember looking at me and waving at me? Mrs. Maretti comes out again. 
MARETTI No. Not really. No. 
LISA Well ...I think we both remember something different. 
MRS MARETTI Your brother's on the phone. 
MARETTI Tell him I'll call him back. Mrs Maretti goes back inside. 
LISA I'm not trying to get you in trouble. 
MARETTI I know you're not, because you couldn't get me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no criminality found...the report is, uh, final. And that's it. 
LISA So you're just gonna leave it? 
MARETTI I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that it was. If something else would have happened, I'd take it to whatever that was. It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But there's only a certain speed the brakes can react. That's a physical limitation of the machine. I don't know what else to tell you. It was a shock. It's shock. But that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot bring her back. 
LISA I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened. 
MARETTI But you already talked to them! 
Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 88

JOAN (CONT'D) You want to fire me, go ahead and fire me. Only don't tiptoe around me like.some-kind of deranged ballerina every time I see you in the fucking hall! Now: Do you have anything to say to me, Eliot? 
VICTOR Um -- you're not fired...? This gets a pretty big laugh from the audience. 
JOAN Oh. (Abashed, friendly) What are you guys talking about? Another big laugh. IN THE AUDIENCE -- LISA, CURTIS and RAMON sit together, dressed up for opening night. Ramon nudges Lisa. 
RAMON She's good, eh?

Lisa is on the computer. Joan is standing behind her. 
JOAN Did you find it? 
LISA Just a minute! 
JOAN Can we just forget it? If they were any good somebody would have called me last night. 
LISA No we can't forget it, because I can't take this anymore. What do you care what they say about you anyway? 
JOAN I don't. It's just a lousy feeling. Can't you understand that? If they wrote mean things about you in the newspaper you wouldn't like it. Even if you didn't agree with it, or base your self-esteem on it. Why can't you understand that? 
LISA I do understand it, because we have this conversation every time! You're great in the play, you're a great actress, everybody thinks you're great, everything about you is great, you're really really pretty -- 
JOAN Oh shut up. 
LISA So let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves, OK? 
JOAN Fine. Lisa finds The New York Times review online. 
LISA 
OK: 
JOAN Did you find it?

JOAN Is it bad? 
LISA Let me read it. (she reads) OK, it's really good. 
JOAN It is? 
LISA Oh my God. Listen to this: 
JOAN Don't read it to me. 
LISA ".. .but it is the frankly extraordinary Joan Kaplan who transforms the savage wit of David Holmes' acid comedy-drama into something approaching sheer luminosity..." 
JOAN Get out. 
LISA "But don't be misled by her feather-light touch and expert comic timing. With the canny (Has trouble enunciating:) bray... 
JOAN Bravura? 
LISA Yes. "-- of an actor at the JOAN Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft...? us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking, maddening and magical." 
JOAN (CONT'D) Shut up! 
LISA OK. This is the best review I've ever read. 
JOAN Just for me, or for everyone?

LISA 
(READING) No, he likes the play, he likes the cast, but the main thrust of it is basically what a genius you are, and how your time has come.

JOAN Fuck him, what does he know? (A la Noel Coward) Maddening and magical, eh? If only I knew what that meant. 
LISA Oh my God you're a huge star. 
JOAN Oh my God! 
LISA Can I make coffee now? 
JOAN Yes. Thank you honey. Lisa heads for the kitchen as the PHONE RINGS.

116 INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY. 116 
John is reading from a paperback poetry anthology. On the blackboard it says "19TH CENTURY POETS -- GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS -- 1844-1889." SLOW PUSH IN on Lisa.

Lisa and her coed class watch BONNIE, the young, tall 
beautiful, no-makeup gymnastics teacher. 
BONNIE OK, so we're just gonna start with a_couple of simple stretches. 
She stretches. Lisa notices the boys looking at Bonnie. 
121 EXT. CENTRAL PARK. DAY. 121 
Lisa and Becky are smoking pot on a rock or bench. 
LISA (holding in smoke) .Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint. 
BECKY We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my God it's John...! It's John! They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher, who approaches them and stops. Pause. 
LISA Hi John. 
BECKY Hi John. (Pause) Want some? They giggle. 
121 CONTINUED: 121 
JOHN Come on, guys. You can't be smokin' a j. on your way to a school soccer game! Now come on! 
LISA Sorry. 
BECKY We're really sorry. John glares at them, then turns and walks away. 
LISA 
(STAGE WHISPER) OK: How about how he's like, "Smokin' a j." Like, "You can't be smokin' a j." They all burst out laughing. CU on the angry embarrassed back of John's reddening grown-up neck as he keeps walking away. 
122 EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- WEST OF THE GREAT LAWN. DAY. 122 
Lisa walks through the park, somewhat stoned, enjoying the sunshine. She sees MR AARON approaching on a bike. He bikes up to her and stops. 
LISA Hi, Mr Aaron...! 
MR AARON How are you, Lisa? 
LISA I'm pretty damn good. How are you? 
MR AARON I'm all right, I'm all right-Tell me something. Whatever happened with that situation? 
LISA Oh...â¢I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime...(squinting at him in the sunshine) Hey, what kind of a bike is that? 
MR AARON Um, a Trek. 
LISA I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle? 
122 CONTINUED: 122 
MR AARON As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no... 
LISA But you must have ridden a lot of horses. 
MR AARON What makes you say so? 
LISA Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that? 
MR AARON Someplace like what? 
- LISA You know: Not New York. 
MR AARON I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me overwhelm you with superfluous details. 
LISA God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews? 
MR AARON Is that a real question, or a Lisa question? 
LISA What's a Lisa question? 
MR AARON A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer...? 
LISA About half and half. 
MR AARON In that case -- 
LISA Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second? 
MR AARON All right. 
LISA Thanks. 
122 CONTINUED: (2) 122 Aaron gets off the bike. She climbs on. The seat is too high for her. 
MR AARON You want me to adjust the seat? 
LISA No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward him, wobbling badly. 
LISA (CONT'D) I like your bicycle...! Can I have it? 
MR AARON No! She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches her hard by the arms to stop her. 
MR AARON (CONT'D) OK. Off. 
LISA Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me. 
MR AARON Lisa...! 
LISA I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close. 
MR AARON I can't even be having this conversation with you. 
LISA Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here. 
MR AARON You're absolutely right. Goodbye. He gets on the bike. 
LISA It's not my fault if I revere you as a god! 
122 CONTINUED: (3) 122 He laughs or smiles briefly in spite of himself. 
LISA (CONT'D) Oh my God. I made you laugh. I am so happy right now. 
MR AARON I'll see you in class. We pull away with him as she watches him go.

Dave walks Lisa and Emily into his office. 
DAVE So after I talked to you guys I called this P.I. I know and I asked him to -- 
Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 118 
134 CONTINUED: 134 
EMILY You called a what? A what? 
DAVE Private Investigator -- to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver -- 
LISA Really? 
DAVE EMILY Yeah: So he -- Dave! 
DAVE Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have their own police? The MTA police? They have their own uniforms... 
EMILY Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? 
DAVE EMILY And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we give a fuck about the MTA police and their uniforms?! 
DAVE -- so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy's file. And it turns out he's had two previous accidents -- less than two years apart -- one of them on the job, one in his own car -- 
EMILY What? 
DAVE -- where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts -- 
EMILY Are you fucking kidding me? 
LISA Why does this not shock me? 
DAVE Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union -- 
Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 119 
134 CONTINUED: (2) 134 
EMILY (i.e., "I get it.") O-Kay...l 
DAVE And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault. 
LISA This is making me sick. 
DAVE I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we have a case. 
LISA We do? 
DAVE What it means, in fact, is that we have a very good case, because we can sue for what's called "Negligent Retention." Which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody. 
EMILY And you can prove that? 
DAVE Sure, because we can subpoena their Personnel records, which we already know contain damaging information, because my investigator got a look at them beforehand. Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did it anyway. 
LISA 
YOU'RE AWESOMEL 
EMILY And that means... 
DAVE That means we're in great shape and I think we should go in there and sue their fuckin' asses off. 
EMILY But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right? 
Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 120 
134 CONTINUED: (3) 134 
DAVE No no. Oh no. 
LISA Why not? 
DAVE EMILY I'm not a personal injury It's not his area. litigator. I don't know enough about it. I would lose. 
EMILY But you could recommend someone? 
DAVE Sure. I know a guy who's very good. His name is Russel Deutsch. He's not a sleazebag. Very experienced. Let me give you his number... 
EMILY Dave, thank you so much. 
LISA Really. My God. 
DAVE But you gotta get that crazy cousin on board because she's gonna be your beneficiary. 
EMILY She's not gonna want to come to New York, I can tell you that right now. 
DAVE If you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars. She's gonna come to New York. 
135 EXT. MIDTOWN -- 6TH AVENUE. DAY. 135 
Lisa and Emily walk up the busy avenue. 
LISA What's with Monica and her cousin? 
EMILY Oh, Monica's father left some money to Abigail's kids and he made Monica the executor of the estate, because he didn't want Abigail and her idiot husband to get their hands on the money before the kids were grown up. 
(MORE) 
Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 121 
135 CONTINUED: 135 
EMILY (CONT'D) For which Abigail rewarded her by badgering her about it on the phone for fifteen years: Always trying to borrow money against the estate, accusing her of making lousy investments with it, nasty phone calls, nasty letters, every month for fifteen years until Abigail's daughter turned twenty-one and got married. Then Monica goes to the wedding, in fucking Arizona, and Abigail literally won't speak to her. She's a dream. 
LISA So that's who we're getting the money for? 
EMILY It's not who we're getting it for, it's who we're getting it from. 
136 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 136 
Emily and Lisa sit with RUSSEL DEUTSCH, 50s. His law office is slightly smaller and less nice than Dave's. 
DEUTSCH First thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the MTA. They get .twenty days to respond, and when they do we can make our Discovery requests: Accident reports, personnel records, et cetera. But you gotta realize it's gonna take some time. The law says you have to get a court date within a year. Usually it takes about six. Depending. 
LISA Six years! 
DEUTSCH Depending, yes. 
EMILY Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend who writes for the Metro section of the Times... 
DEUTSCH Yes: Now this, if it could really happen, this changes everything in our favor. If they think there's gonna be adverse publicity, especially in The New York Times, they're gonna want to settle right away, soon as possible, and as quietly as 
141 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 141 
Abigail sits with Deutsch. 
DEUTSCH How would you describe the relationship overall? Did you talk on the phone a lot? Were there a lot of visits -- 
ABIGAIL I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least. Sometimes more than that...I would call her, she would call me... 
DEUTSCH And what were the nature of these conversations? 
ABIGAIL. Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my kids... 
DEUTSCH And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing? 
ABIGAIL Oh, I would say so, yes. 
DEUTSCH Would you have any phone records? Or -- 
ABIGAIL I have all my phone bills, if that's what you mean. I didn't record the actual conversations... 
141 CONTINUED: 141 
DEUTSCH No no -- 
ABIGAIL 
(PRODUCES BILLS) You'll see we talked on the phone quite frequently. 
DEUTSCH OK, that's terrific. I see you came prepared...1 
ABIGAIL Well, I wanted to bring everything. 
DEUTSCH Now when they take your deposition you're gonna say the same thing you just told me. Talk about the relationship... 
ABIGAIL Uh huh? 
DEUTSCH Kind of advice she used to give you... 
ABIGAIL 
OK...? 
142 INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY. 142 
Emily, Lisa and Abigail sit over their lunch. Abigail is drinking a white wine. 
ABIGAIL Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer? 
EMILY He was recommended by a friend. 
ABIGAIL I'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of -- 
EMILY My friend's heard of him. He says he's very good.. 
ABIGAIL I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky... 
2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128 
142 CONTINUED: 142 
EMILY He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky. He was recommended by my friend. But even if we switched lawyers we'd still have to pay him. But it all comes out of the settlement, so it's really up to you. 
ABIGAIL No, if you all think he's good... 
EMILY I don't know whether he is or not. My friend thinks he is. 
ABIGAIL All right. Now Lisa, what is your involvement in all this? What's your angle? 
LISA I just wanted to...I was just there. 
143 INT. EMILY'S DINING ROOM. DAY. 143 
Emily comes into the dining room with a cup of coffee. Lisa is standing over the table looking at some of Monica's photos and belongings which are spread out all over the table. Emily starts putting the pictures away in their envelopes. 
LISA Oh my God, is that you? 
EMILY 
That's me. 
LISA 
And that's you and Monica obviously. Oh my 
God. Is that her daughter? 
EMILY 
Uh huh. 
LISA God... So how old was she when she died? 
EMILY 
Twelve. 
LISA God. I can't even imagine. 
EMILY Neither could we. 
Emily sits down and starts sorting through pictures to put 
them in the box. Lisa sits down too. 
2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128aA

143 CONTINUED: (2) 143 Emily looks up. 
EMILY No. I didn't. 
LISA 
Yeah. I think she was confused... like, I 
think she thought I was her daughter for a minute. And then she was asking me to call her, like to tell her what happened: You know, like she didn't remember she was dead. 
EMILY What do you mean? What did she say? 
LISA She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No, that's my name." Because it took me a minute -- I didn't realize we had the same name... Emily does not respond. 
LISA (CONT'D) But I couldn't tell if what I was saying 
was registering with her. Emily does not respond. 
LISA (CONT'D) But then when I found out her daughter was dead, ever since then I keep having this really strong feeling that some way, for those last five minutes I kind of was her daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the reason I was there: Like in some weird way, this obviously amazing woman got to see her daughter again for a few minutes, right before she died. 
EMILY 
(VERY DRY) I see. And is she still inhabiting your body? Or did she go right back to the spirit world after it was over? 
LISA I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all. 
EMILY 
I don't give a fuck what you believe in.

Joan is serving Lisa and Curtis dinner. 
JOAN Lisa? Do you think Emily would like to come see the play? I thought you could both come and them maybe we could go out afterwards. 
LISA All right. Let me ask her. 
JOAN Dig in everybody... They start eating. 
LISA I was thinking about spending next year with Dad. 
JOAN 
(SHOCKED) Oh? 
LISA Yeah. You're all worried about my grades. They have really good public schools in Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived with him, you wouldn't have to worry about my scholarship. 
JOAN Have you talked to him about this? 
LISA We've had some general discussions. 
JOAN 
(TO CURTIS) Do you want to go too? 
CURTIS 
(SURPRISED) Me? 
JOAN Yeah. Do you want to move to LA too? 
CURTIS No. 
JOAN Well, just let me know if you do.

LISA Why are you about to start crying? 
JOAN Because it's your intention to make me start crying! 
LISA No it's not -- 
- JOAN You want to move to LA. Move to LA. 
LISA But why can't this even be mentioned without you taking it personally? I'm just introducing a possibility! 
JOAN 
OH! Joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go. She comes back and upsets more things on the table. 
JOAN Here's a possibility that you can make your own fucking dinner! Here's a possibility LISA that you can do whatever you Jesus Christ! want to do, because I don't What is with you? even care anymore, you heartless little fuckin' bitch!

145 INT. HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 145 
On the blackboard Klein finishes writing: SHOULD TEENAGERS 
RULE THE WORLD? YES OR NO? 
KLEIN OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your drum away. Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers. 
KIRSTEN I think that teenagers should definitely rule the world, because teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet, and they're idealists and they care. And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive, which they are, many of them. But they still haven't had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game. So yes, I would vote yes. 
KLEIN All right: Lisa? 
LISA I would tend to agree with all of that, except I do think that teenagers don't always necessarily think things through very carefully, and they don't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time. I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves.-- 
LEWIS Such as what? 
LISA Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know: the Hitler Youth? 
KLEIN OK... Hitler Youth. 
LISA Or what about all these teenage suicide bombers? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming you don't think suicide bombing is a good thing, wouldn't you say that's an example of being idealistic without using your critical faculties?

LISA (CONT'D) And maybe running the risk of having your youthful enthusiasm be co-opted by adults for purposes of their own that you might not even ultimately agree with? Angie's hand shoots up. So do several others. 
LEWIS OK, Angie? 
ANGIE Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again either, because I realize I'm completely outnumbered -- 
ANTHONY Not unlike the Palestinians themselves. 
ANGIE That's not really funny, Anthony. ANGIE (to LISA) KLEIN -- and I'm not even going to Segal: Cut the comedy. comment on the fact that you just compared a 19-year-old ANTHONY Palestinian to a member of I thought it was funny... the Hitler Youth, which I personally find so offensive LISA I don't even know where to â¢That's right! Because start -- Oh, it's not because they both like to kill they've been occupied and Jews. humiliated and bombed out of their homes for the last KLEIN fifty years? Hey! Hey! Lisa! Hey! 
LEWIS LISA Come on, guys... Yes! That's partly why they like it! There's ANGIE still a million Pale- If anyone's acting like stinians who don't blow Nazis it's the Israeli up children on busses government! because they're so "frustrated!" 
LEWIS OK, OK! Monica? 
MONICA Well, I don't know if this is good or bad, but speaking of ideology, it's interesting that the suicide bombers -- just for example -- care enough about what they believe in to sacrifice their lives for it. 
WHEREAS 
2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 138 
145 CONTINUED: (2) 145 
ANGIE Yes. Yes! 
LISA I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in. I actually think that's really noble. It's a little different when you're willing to sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I personally don't think that's such a big ideological achievement! 
ANGIE Um, even if there's no other way to get you out of my country? 
LEWIS LISA Raise your hands! They haven't tried any other ways! It's not ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have! They're is their last resort! trying it right now! It's their first resort! Because it's easy and they like it! 
ANGIE (CONT'D) Oh they like it? They're just bad people and they like it? 
Some kind of fund? For the kids? 
DEUTSCH I don't understand what you mean by a fund... 
ROB ABIGAIL (to ABIGAIL) Mr. Deutsch? Do you mean What does he mean, "besides some kind of trust fund, the damages?" a fund that would be set up by the bus company for EMILY our kids? For tax purposes? What fuckin' fund? 
LISA These people are retarded. 
ABIGAIL Because I have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with Monica and our children, and it was not a pleasant experience. We just want a clean, straight damages is fine. A regular payment. We'll pay the taxes on it. At least we'll have something in our hand... 
DEUSTCH I don't really know what kind of fund you're talking about...

ABIGAIL Oh yes. Absolutely. If you think he's at 
FAULT -- 
ROB Just as long as they don't think they can buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy. You see what I mean? 
DEUTSCH Absolutely. 
ROB What we're most concerned about here is the amount. 
EMILY Yes, we're getting that, Rob. 
ROB But you see what I mean? 
DEUTSCH Yes -- Rob? Yes I do. 
ROB I just want to go on record as saying I think this whole meeting is premature. 
ABIGAIL Absolutely. We're not lawyers -- 
DEUTSCH Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something clear. One conversation does not commit you to anything.

Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 152A 
157 CONTINUED: (5) 157 
DEUTSCH (CONT'D) And I'm not gonna agree to anything without consulting you. But I'm working for you. 
(MORE) 
157 CONTINUED: (6) 157 
DEUTSCH (CONT'D) So if you're telling me not to take the meeting I'm not gonna take the meeting. 
ABIGAIL - ROB No. We're not saying that. No no no -- Go for it. 
158 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 158 
Lisa has just told Joan the news. Joan is on the sofa. 
JOAN Lisa, I'm really proud of you! 
LISA Thank you. 
JOAN Really, really proud...! 
LISA Thank you. Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up. 
LISA (CONT'D) Are you upset about something...? 
JOAN No. This house is really beginning to get to me. And I'm a little confused what to do about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What do you think? 
LISA Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think about it some more. Because it would probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him. 
JOAN I know I'm supposed to understand what you're doing right now, but if there's some kind of hidden message here I'm not getting it. 
LISA No shit. You're on your own, Mom. 
JOAN Thanks a lot. 
LISA You're welcome. The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up. 
158 CONTINUED: 158 
JOAN 
(INTO PHONE) Hello? -Yes . WHAT DO YOU MEAN?? 
LISA What's the matter? 
JOAN 
(LISTENING) Yes? . Yes? (To LISA) Ramon had a heart attack. 
LISA What? Is he gonna be -- 
JOAN uiet! CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead of dissolving, Joan listens, straightens up and calms down as the person on the phone talks. 
159 EXT. RIVERSIDE CHAPEL. DAY. 159 
Mourners are going inside the funeral parlor. 
160 INT. FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY. 160 
Joan and Lisa look around the room. 
LISA OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but isn't this a Jewish funeral home? 
JOAN I guess they do both. They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence. 
RODRIGO Excuse me. Joan? 
JOAN Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm so sorry. She impulsively embraces him. 
JOAN (CONT'D) Rodrigo, this is my -- 
160 CONTINUED: 160 
RODRIGO I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked about you all the time. 
JOAN He did? 
RODRIGO Yes. The night he met you, he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it, he was so excited. I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother died. 
JOAN Really? 
RODRIGO I don't know if this is appropriate... 
JOAN No it's OK...! 
RODRIGO .but he went out a lot. Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you, because for the first time since he lost my mother, he finally met a woman he could really connect with. 
ROB 
Mr Deutsch...? 
DEUTSCH 
Now, I know there was a concern after our 
last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit -- 
ROB That's OK -- 
ABIGAIL We're only -- 
EMILY Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to 
what Russel has to say, and then talk about it once he's told us the whole story and given us his recommendation... 
ROB Yes. Sorry. Fire away. 
DEUTSCH I was gonna say I know there was a concern 
after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit -- 
ROB That's OK -- 
ABIGAIL We were just -- 
EMILY Would you let him talk please?! 
DEUTSCH It's OK. 
ABIGAIL We're sorry. 
DEUTSCH I want to tell you I think it's a very good offer. 
(MORE) 
167 CONTINUED: (2) 167 
DEUTSCH (CONT'D) I think they're very anxious to settle, but I also do think that at this moment they're under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear, and I don't believe they're gonna come up any higher -- 
ABIGAIL Hey. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars... 
ROB OK, now let me just -- 
ABIGAIL 
.that's nothin' to sneeze at. 
ROB ABIGAIL I just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can the thought -- you all hear me? 
DEUTSCH, EMILY, LISA Yes! 
ABIGAIL Yeow! Was that everybody? OK: 
LISA What about -- 
ABIGAIL -- Emily? What do you think? 
EMILY I think it sounds like we should do it. But I'd like to discuss some of the -- 
ABIGAIL 
(ON "BUT") Hey, if that's the vote... 
ROB Unless you think there's something to be gained from holding out for more. 
DEUTSCH I think it would be a big mistake. 
ABIGAIL Robbie, what do you think? 
ROB Sold! 
ABIGAIL Sold! 
167 CONTINUED: (3) 167 
DEUTSCH OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that 
the bus company will absolutely not discuss the removal of the driver. 
LISA & EMILY What? 
LISA What do you mean? 
ROB The driver? 
LISA EMILY Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they forget it. won't discuss the removal of the driver? 
DEUTSCH Please. Ladies. Let me ROB finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello! 
ABIGAIL It's just a blast in our ears. 
EMILY 
(TO LISA) Let him finish. 
LISA Finish what? Forget it! 
DEUTSCH 
(TO EMILY) Thank you. I want you to understand, Lisa, I pressed them very very hard on this, but they will not discuss disciplining of a company employee as part of the settlement because it could be seen as an admission of guilt on the part of the MTA -- 
LISA What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean? 
DEUTSCH Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt. It simply does not carry the same stigma. On top of that you may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right 
NOW: 
167 CONTINUED: (4) 167 
LISA Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell them to forget it.' 
DEUTSCH I know that's your reaction... 
LISA It's the only reason we're here. 
ROB Can I jump in here? Russel? 
DEUTSCH 
(TO LISA) .but it's really not your decision. 
ROB ABIGAIL Hello? Are you still with us? Please! 
LISA It's Emily's decision. 
EMILY No. 
DEUTSCH No. 
ROB Hello? 
LISA It's not? 
ABIGAIL They're not listening, Robbie. 
DEUTSCH It's Abigail's decision because she's the next of kin. 
LISA But she didn't even know about it!

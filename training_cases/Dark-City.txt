DARK CITY

REVISED DRAFT November 29th, 1992 
DARKNESS 
A LOW RUMBLE increases in volume. 
FADE UP: 
A BLACK-GLOVED HAND wraps around a bulky electrical lever, thrusts FORWARD. 
SNAP!  -  Electricity arcs through darkness. 
O.S. sound of MACHINERY turning ON. 
TITLES OVER 
MONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting  -  various.  Second hands turn  - TICKING gets louder. 
INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT 
SHADOWS DANCE.  A bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing: clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor... 
SLEEPING EYES in and out of darkness.  The eyes open. Confusion. 
WIDEN ANGLE ON JONATHAN WHITE  -  a man in his early thirties, dark featured. 
He sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub of long cold water. His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever. 
He looks down into the murky water around him.  A feint movement beneath the surface, something swimming  -  A SMALL DARK SHAPE.  Startled, he leaps from the bath. 
ANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  The man's hand reaches up, stops the light-bulb mid swing. 
He steps to a circular window.  The glass is cracked, covered in grime.  He wipes it, this only smears the dirt. 
It's dark out there. 
EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT 
ANGLE ON WHITE  -  from outside the window, through blurry glass. 
A RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.  The window is a SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower. 
BACK IN THE BATHROOM 
White shivers, cold.  He stares down at the puddle he drips on the floor.  He looks at his feet and legs, covered with numerous SMALL BITES.  He dries the bloody wounds with a towel. 
He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on. Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with HOLES in both soles.  In his trouser pocket he finds a key  - a room number on a plastic tag. 
He hears splashing in the bath-tub.  He steps over, looks into the murky water.  Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about. 
He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the water. 
Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the shadows.  He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand inches from the doorknob.  He leans down. 
TIGHT ON HIS EYE 
Blinking through the key-hole. 
P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM  -  NIGHT 
WHITE pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room. 
No sign of life.  Cheap decorations.  He walks around cautiously.  Turns lights on.  Then reconsiders.  Turns them off again.  Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror. 
ANGLE ON OPEN BATHROOM DOOR  -  the fish has jumped from the tub again and is flapping on the floor. 
White steps back into the bathroom.  He picks up the fish again, doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket. 
BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM 
He searches through things.  A grey overcoat in the closet.  He goes through the pockets, finds a WALLET.  No I.D., just a laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town. 
ANGLE ON A REVOLVER on the bed-side table.  He picks it up, his grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the trigger and... 
BANG! 
The gun goes off.  A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room, bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself in the wall. 
Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off again.  He examines it carefully now.  Opens the chamber. 
TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Five bullets left. 
He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the inside pocket of the coat. 
He moves to the bed.  A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug.  A fragment of a woman's face, her left eye.  He lifts the fragment up.  There's handwriting on the back, part of a note: 
...MEANS THE MOST TO ME.  LOVE YOU FOREVER.  -  E... 
INT.  CHINESE CAFE 
He walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six tables.  Empty.  Dirty.  He sits and waits. 
A CLOCK ticks on the wall  -  midnight.  White coughs, for attention. 
A NOISE from a doorway.  A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging one foot as it walks.  A SMALL ASIAN WOMAN appears and limps to his table.  She speaks very quickly IN CHINESE.  He does not understand. 
She points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one.  At the bottom.  In small print.  "NOODLES". 
WHITE (nods) The noodles.  Iíll have some noodles. 
The old woman rips a YELLOW TICKET from a pad, gives it to White.  A number on it.  She points her crooked finger again at a SPEAKER BOX above a small serving window in the wall.  A greenish fluoro pulses from the room within. 
WOMAN We call. 
She leaves again. 
White looks about the empty room.  Insects are zapped on an illuminated DEVICE hanging on the wall.  An old air-conditioner RATTLES noisily. 
NOISES from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby cries.  Then SILENCE. 
White removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the table. 
He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.  Leans forward, hands trembling.  Without realising, he holds the paper OVER A CANDLE burning on the table.  The paper CATCHES FIRE, is engulfed.  He drops the flaming page on the table.  Now the table-cloth starts to burn. 
White is frantic.  On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of water, and dumps this on the flames.  It kills the fire but leaves a black hole in the table-cloth.  The paper is ash. 
He moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the smoke away. 
INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT 
BUMSTEAD is moving quickly.  He suddenly trips and falls to the floor.  He curses under his breath, then looks up. 
HIS P.O.V. 
A door  -  THOMPSON:  DETECTIVE/INSPECTOR on the frosted glass. Bumstead stands, pushes into the office. 
INSIDE 
A total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags.  Bumstead shakes his head. 
BUMSTEAD A real shame... 
He starts to look around. 
TIGHT ON FILING CABINET  -  a drawer is pulled open. Thompsonís files are also a mess.  Bumstead continues to shake his head.  He reaches for a file.  A loud SNAP! 
BUMSTEAD (screams) YAAAAAAAAAH! 
He recoils.  A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers.  He pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing. 
INT.  CHINESE CAFE 
White is still waiting for his food. 
He leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed.  He uses a napkin to wipe at the pus. 
AERIAL PERSPECTIVE OF A FLY  -  circling the room, looking down on White. 
ON THE FLY  -  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on another table.  The creature is some kind of SURVEILLANCE DEVICE  -  half insect/half machine.  Itís spying on him.  MOVE IN TIGHT as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head.  It shits on the food behind it. 
White is oblivious to this.  Heís finished examining his leg, is sitting quietly.  He yawns.  His head nods forward briefly. 
A NOISE.  White looks up. 
A TRAP-DOOR has opened in the ceiling.  Two feet in black leather shoes descend from the hole.  A sea breeze blows through the room.  The SOUND OF SURF, SEAGULLS CRYING. 
ON Whiteís nose twitching.  He can smell the ocean. 
The WALLPAPER COMES ALIVE  -  like a seething tangle of worms. 
One by one, THREE MEN in black coats lower into the room, floating on air.  They pull out knifes, step forward. 
ON WHITE rigid with terror. 
ON THE MEN  -  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the gloom, they too resemble the MAN who confronted White earlier. They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads. Ready to attack.  They lean over him, pause dramatically. 
MAN 1 Donít fall asleep. (chuckles softly) Might never wake, yes. 
This Man turns to the others.  They all smile, then turn back to White. 
MEN (in unison) Fifty-six. 
ANOTHER VOICE has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder. Repeating: 
VOICE Fifty-six...  Fifty-six... 
ANGLE  -  a chair falls to the floor. 
White leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented.  Just a DREAM  -  he had dozed. 
WIDEN ANGLE  -  The place is still empty.  White glances to the serving window.  A DISH waits for him, framed in the glowing fluoro square.  He gets it.  A bowl of soupy liquid with noodles.  He sits down. 
He is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead of a spoon.  Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the kitchen. 
White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole in the wall and looks through. 
HIS P.O.V. 
A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow. 
White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itís Fredrick  -  just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He doesnít scream this time, just gags on blood running from his mouth. 
Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteís neck, traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard floor, makes a mess. 
INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing noise. 
BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength. The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run away but glances at the floor. 
The fish is flapping about  -  still alive. 
EXT.  STREET 
White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance: LIBRARY. 
INT.  POLICE STATION 
A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood blast away violently. 
BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship. 
A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled. 
ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman. 
BUMSTEAD Dammit! 
MISS CRENSHAW Sorry, sir. 
BUMSTEAD Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you? 
MISS CRENSHAW Patricia Crenshaw. 
She puts out her hand. 
MISS CRENSHAW Iím your new assistant. 
BUMSTEAD I didnít requisition a secretary. 
MISS CRENSHAW The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand. 
BUMSTEAD (uncertain) Oh. 
He takes her hand tentatively.  They shake. 
MISS CRENSHAW Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man. 
BUMSTEAD Good. 
MISS CRENSHAW You wonít regret this, sir. 
BUMSTEAD Fine. 
Bumstead moves off. 
INT.  LIBRARY 
White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned, then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor. 
He walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still. 
WHITE Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing? 
The librarian looks up from her book. 
LIBRARIAN Which would you like first? 
WHITE Okay.  Newspapers. 
She takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads. She studies White. 
LIBRARIAN Are you alright? 
He looks around  -  restrained panic. 
WHITE (looks at the woman) Sure.  Iím fine. 
LIBRARIAN (nods) Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the hall.  Third floor.  Turn left. Section C-7.  Row 35, near the toilets. 
She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away. 
LIBRARIAN Donít mention it... 
She blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES LOUDLY. 
INT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR 
White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with old volumes.  Comes to number 7. 
He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34 but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc. 
MISS CRENSHAW Why, yes. 
BUMSTEAD Well be more careful, please. 
An embarrassed beat, then: 
RI-I-I-ING! 
Bumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first. 
CRENSHAW Inspector Bumsteadís office... Yes...  Yes... 
She cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead. 
MISS CRENSHAW Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said he would see you now. 
INT.  POLICE STATION HALL-WAY 
TRACKING SHOT towards a door:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR on the frosted glass.  A hand reaches INTO FRAME, knocks twice. 
STROMBOLI O.S. Enter! 
INSIDE 
Bumstead steps into the office  -  finds STROMBOLI wandering about the room, distracted, searching for something... 
STROMBOLI What is it? 
He pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his desk, sorts through it. 
BUMSTEAD A formality.  I need to speak with Thompson.  Officially I need your written permission. 
Stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now. 
STROMBOLI Why do you want to speak to him? 
BUMSTEAD A hunch.  He might be able to... 
STROMBOLI (from under desk) Bumstead, donít be so paranoid. Leave him alone  -  heís a sad case. 
BUMSTEAD Itís extremely important to my investigation... 
STROMBOLI Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else? 
BUMSTEAD Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me... 
STROMBOLI O.S. (pokes head above desk) Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in cases right now  -  canít spare anyone. 
Stromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind pictures hanging off the walls.  A big sign suspended above his desk says, SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME  -  his motto. 
BUMSTEAD Lost something? 
STROMBOLI What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead... 
The door clicks shut.  Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has gone. 
EXT.  PLAZA  -  NIGHT 
White walks under stone archways. 
Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:   DRUGS OPEN 24 HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:   SHAVE & HAIRCUT $5.00. 
INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT 
White walks between bare, dusty shelves.  Only one shelf carries products  -  BOX AFTER BOX OF "LUMP-O".  He moves up to a small counter.  A man with thick glasses, dressed like a BARBER, is seated there. 
WHITE I need something to keep me awake. 
BARBER Looks like you need a haircut to me. 
WHITE Thanks.  Just some pills. 
BARBER Only two bucks.  Shave as well... 
WHITE (annoyed now) Your sign says you sell drugs  - well, Iím here to buy some.  Okay? 
BARBER Relax.  Sure! 
He waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules. 
BARBER Tell you what  -  let me cut yer hair, give ya watcha need half price. Canít argue at that! 
WHITE (evenly) I donít want a haircut. 
LATER 
CAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall  -  REVEALS WHITE in a barber chair.  The BARBER gleefully works on WHITEís hair.  A thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain, smiles, playing a violin.  Heís passionate but bad. 
BARBER (talks fast) Cut hair when I was in the navy, yíknow  -  havenít lost the touch. Bet youíre happy ëbout that.  Huh! 
WHITE Sell maps? 
BARBER What of? 
WHITE The city.  I need to get to the ocean. 
White ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the congregation.  He motions to them to keep quiet.  He runs into the legs of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN the priest pointed out.  She is startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles. 
PRIEST (continues sermon) Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to hide in our hearts.  Have you not evil within you now? 
White sees a nearby CONFESSION BOX.  Staying low, he runs, almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts inside.  The girl watches him. 
A GAUNT-FACED WOMAN stands.  Hysterical.  She looks at the priest. 
GAUNT WOMAN He took my little boy!  Iíll rip out his eyes! 
INSIDE  -  White breaths relief. 
HIS P.O.V.  -  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him is a crucified insect.  A voice surprises him.  Another PRIEST, OLDER. 
OLDER PRIEST You have sinned? 
WHITE NO.  Ah... 
White watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate wooden grill in front of his face. 
PRIEST I am listening. 
WHITE (lying) Thereís a...  woman.  I don't know but I think I, ahh... 
PRIEST You fornicated? 
The Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards White, but keep walking. 
WHITE No.  I, ah... 
PRIEST You seem restless. 
The Mystery Men seem to have gone.  White takes out the gun, keeping it hidden from the priest.  Opens the chamber. 
TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Only ONE BULLET left. 
WHITE Someoneís after me. 
PRIEST Then we must call the police. 
WHITE No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary. 
The silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward. 
PRIEST I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed? 
WHITE Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you. 
The priest suddenly stares incredulously at White.  His eyes widen in horror. 
PRIEST Youíre the murderer? (starts to yell) Yes!  That must be it!  Donít kill me! 
White lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other over his mouth.  The old man stares at him, trembling uncontrollably. 
WHITE Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly. (holds up gun) Understand? 
The priest nods stupidly.  White pushes him out of the confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his back.  Together they head for the doors.  Still no sign of the Mystery Men. 
PRIEST Donít kill me! 
WHITE Shut up! 
PRIEST Please... 
White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently. 
WHITE (not so quietly) Iím not going to kill you, okay! 
Faces turn. 
The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand.  While White is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away. 
PRIEST (shouting/pointing) CRIMINAL! 
People start to scream and run.  The GAUNT WOMAN points at White. 
GAUNT WOMAN (screams insanely) Itís him!  Rip out his eyes! 
Frightened, White holds the gun out.  Everyone panics, scatters.  People run for the exit.  Religious statues topple and smash.  The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor, trampled by the crowd. 
Amidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room, see White, head towards him.  He turns and runs. 
A STAIRCASE 
White climbs narrow stairs rapidly. 
INT.  BELL TOWER 
White stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street through a series of arched windows.  A low, raftered room, three huge black BELLS. 
Suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to swing, build momentum. 
CLANG!  CLA-A-A-ANG!  A cacophony of noise. 
White puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the stairs. 
Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby cop. 
BUMSTEAD I want prints over here... 
Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadís head in it.  He struggles.  The cop and the photographer run over to help. 
EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT 
MOVE IN ON a doorway.  Above it a small illuminated red sign: 
DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D. 
REVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE 
He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnít have anymore. 
INT.  WAITING ROOM 
A white room, bare.  Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents. A NURSE is typing behind her desk. 
A THUMPING fills the room.  The nurse stands, removes her shoe and hits a pipe running along the wall several times.  The noise stops. 
The front door creaks open and White enters.  She watches him step into the room. 
WHITE I want to see the doctor.  It's important. 
NURSE What time was your appointment? 
WHITE (angry) Look!  Tell him I'm here.  Now. 
He's leaning across her desk threateningly. 
NURSE (scared/standing) Yes, certainly...  Who should I say? 
WHITE No idea.  Just get him... 
Suddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of papers, steps out.  He freezes, stares at White.  The papers fall from his hands to the floor. 
INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT 
A group of DARK SILHOUETTES file into a concrete room. 
The MYSTERY MEN have gathered.  Like the Men who pursue White, they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near white skin. 
One MAN points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the peculiar foreign tongue. 
TIGHT ON THE DIAGRAM  -  a path through the city.  A circle marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral.  The Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent. 
MAN 1 It has failed. 
ANOTHER MAN stands at the rear of the room. 
MAN 2 This is becoming dangerous, yes! 
YET ANOTHER MAN starts to tremble violently, seized with some kind of convulsion.  He froths at the mouth and throws his head about.  A TALLER MAN standing beside him opens a silver box, removes a small WRITHING WORM.  He places this on the tip of the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down. 
MAN 3 Let's get this over with. 
ANOTHER MAN rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of the group. 
MAN 5 What about the dance-steps!  This is my responsibility, we must resolve this issue, yes? 
THE MEN turn to face him.  He is out of line.  He becomes irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself short, sits down. 
MAN 5 Sorry. 
MAN 3 The situation has changed. (pacing the room) This one is in possession of knowledge... 
MAN 1 (cuts in) ...to avoid influence, yes. 
MAN 4 A freak! 
MAN 1 Impossible! 
RUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention.  They all look to a round portal high on a wall.  The noise is louder. several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then the noise subsides.  The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important things. 
MAN 3 It gets interesting, yes. 
MAN 2 Stop this!  It has gone too far! Tell Mister Black! 
Man 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards. 
INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE 
THE CAMERA GLIDES down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign says, DOCTOR IS:  IN. 
INSIDE 
White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden desk.  THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars containing preserved specimens.  He stops, looks at White. 
SCHREBER You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done? 
WHITE You know something about me? 
SCHREBER Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? (smiles) Is there nothing you remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try. 
BUMSTEAD Hold it! 
Schreber and White FREEZE in mid-struggle, look at the inspector.  Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway. 
BUMSTEAD Police.  Nobody move. 
SCHREBER He tried to kill me! 
BUMSTEAD Shut up!  Everybody stay calm... 
Bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face, handcuffs him.  Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver, takes this.  Also takes his wallet.  He glances at the doctor, who hides the syringe behind his back. 
BUMSTEAD (to Doctor) You Schreber? 
Schreber nods blankly. 
Bumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels something. 
BUMSTEAD What's that? 
White says nothing.  The inspector opens the pocket and looks in. 
BUMSTEAD (disgusted) A fish, huh? 
EXT.  CITY STREETS  -  NIGHT 
An old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension bridge.  Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.  It's been raining.  Streets are empty. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
WHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.  Bumstead has appointed his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home. Hot thermos.  Note pad holder, complete with light.  Coat hanger.  Gun rack.  A system for everything. 
BUMSTEAD Dammit! (glances at his watch) I'm curious?  How many so far? 
He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear. 
WHITE (confused) What?  I... 
BUMSTEAD (counts on fingers) Let's see, there's the little guy with no arms or legs.  And the young boy? 
WHITE (disturbed) Young boy? 
CLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now. 
BUMSTEAD The six year old.  Sure, you remember. 
Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.  A SANDWICH, carefully wrapped and prepared.  After glancing at his watch again, he bites into it. 
BUMSTEAD (chewing) Y'know, the kid you left in the meat packing plant, cut into pieces. Packed into brown paper parcels, wrapped in twine, that kind of thing. 
No answer. 
BUMSTEAD You sure have demonstrated a great deal of...  imagination.  The baby was the best though.  Several cops lost their lunch over that one.  Head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech... 
WHITE (cuts in) Stop it.  You're making me sick... 
BUMSTEAD We count seven so far.  Anyone we missed? 
RADIO CRACKLE O.S.  -  A tinny voice cuts in. 
VOICE Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector... 
Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it. 
BUMSTEAD What is it, Crenshaw? 
CRENSHAW Just reminding you...  your eight pee em... 
BUMSTEAD Dammit. (looks at watch) Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch.  It needs fixing. 
CRENSHAW Yes sir. 
Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich. 
WHITE Where are we going? 
BUMSTEAD Shut-up. 
Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel. 
White is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him.  He leans down to scratch through his trousers. 
WHITE (quietly) Shit! 
BUMSTEAD Gesundheit! 
WHITE (looks up) I didn't sneeze. 
EXT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE  -  NIGHT 
The INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
WHITE What are we doing here? 
STROMBOLI John... 
He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White. A black and white police photo of a murder victim. 
STROMBOLI ...Murderer. 
Another photo goes down.  Another victim.  Another and another. Each more grisly than the last. 
STROMBOLI You'll sign a confession? 
White nods.  He's looks utterly lost. 
Bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near the only door, presses a button. 
BUMSTEAD (into speaker) Okay. 
TWO GUARDS immediately step through the door, GRAB White by his arms.  They carry him off. 
INT.  PRISON CELL 
White is woken by a UNIFORMED GUARD shining a light in his eyes. 
GUARD Visitor. 
INT.  VISITING ROOM 
White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier down the middle.  The guard tells him to sit and wait. 
The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  - DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened. 
WHITE  (to guard) Keep him away:  He's insane. 
The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly. 
SCHREBER Please, stay calm. 
WHITE  (to guard) This man wants to kill me. 
The guard remains indifferent. 
SCHREBER  (to guard) Just one of his many delusions  - it's nothing. (a whisper to White) Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't get another chance like this.  Listen to me. 
WHITE  (turns to Doctor) What do you want? 
SCHREBER You're innocent... (still a whisper) You didn't kill anyone. 
WHITE  (sarcastic) What am I doing in here then? 
SCHREBER Listen to what I have to say.  Decide for yourself. 
AN ADJOINING ROOM 
The dark silhouettes of BUMSTEAD and ANOTHER COP watch from behind a two-way mirror. 
BUMSTEAD What's he doing here? 
COP Says he is the man's doctor... (taps side of his head) You know... 
BUMSTEAD I know it's his doctor... (into intercom) I need the file on.. (reads clip-board) Daniel Paul Schreber M.D. 
MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S. Schreber.  Yes.  Isn't that his doctor? 
BUMSTEAD (evenly) Yes. (beat) And it's SCHREBER  -  with an 'h'. 
MISS CRENSHAW Yes.  An "h". 
The inspector looks up from the speaker. 
HIS P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE MIRROR, White seems to have calmed down. 
BACK IN THE VISITING ROOM 
SCHREBER The men in black  -  they're the killers. 
White stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass. 
WHITE You're a liar! 
SCHREBER No, it's the truth. 
WHITE So you're telling me the truth this time?  Is that it! 
The doctor removes a SMALL SYRINGE from his black bag, places it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the guard's view. 
SCHREBER If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer. 
WHITE Not that again... 
SCHREBER Everyone get's one  -  very much like this... (points to syringe) But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything... 
WHITE (cuts in) I'm not injecting anything into my brain. 
SCHREBER Anton  -  I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a lie from the beginning.  It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have.  You have been left  - blank. 
Schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him. 
BUMSTEAD This is highly irregular.  I have a right to know. 
MAN 1 We are from a mental asylum. 
He notices that this man's moustache is LOP-SIDED.  The other man wears spectacles WITH NO LENSES in the frames, clutches an un-lit pipe in his teeth. 
STROMBOLI Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help. 
BUMSTEAD I see... 
MAN 1 Yes, Inspector.  Has he been displaying any strange...  behaviour? 
BUMSTEAD He's been a little angel... 
STROMBOLI If you could show them to the holding cell now. 
SLOW MOVE IN on Bumstead's face. 
IN THE CORRIDOR 
Bumstead and the MYSTERY MEN walk towards the holding cell. Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he enters.  IT'S EMPTY. 
He fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -  BURSTS into the room.  White is gone.  But where?  Bumstead throws a look back TO THE FRONT DESK. 
MAN 1 Where is he? 
The cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee.  He looks at the inspector, sees the room is empty.  A nervous twitch knocks the cup from the cop's hands. 
TIGHT ON THE CUP  -  smashing on the floor. 
INT.  SUBWAY STATION  -  NIGHT 
Underground.  CONSTANT NOISE O.S. of trains arriving and departing but none are seen. 
CAMERA MOVES PAST broken tiles on a wall to REVEAL:  WHITE  - sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused, groggy from sleep.  He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully tries to free them from the cuffs. 
MOVE IN TIGHT ON WHITE 
He starts to cry.  He puts his head in his hands, his body spasms with each sob. 
SEVERAL ANGLES of the empty corridors of the subway.  White's crying is heard  -  echoic. 
BACK ON WHITE  -  A small feminine HAND touches his head. 
Startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be attacked. 
THE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN from the church looks down at him. 
INT.  POLICE STATION 
BUMSTEAD and the COP are getting grilled by STROMBOLI. 
BUMSTEAD Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed... 
STROMBOLI (shouts at cringing COP) How could you have been so stupid? 
COP I'm sorry, sir. 
STROMBOLI Alright, get out. 
Bumstead gets up and leaves. 
STROMBOLI You stay. 
The cop hustles out, shuts the door. 
STROMBOLI Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that. 
BUMSTEAD Yes, sir. 
He leaves. 
INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING 
White, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat, follows the JAPANESE WOMAN up a flight of dark stairs.  she keeps looking back at him, smiling but SAYS NOTHING. 
INT.  APARTMENT 
White and the woman step into a run-down apartment.  She points to a couch.  White looks uncomfortable.  She smiles again, then turns on the radio.  MUSIC. 
She steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone.  He gets up and starts to tune the radio.  A babble of fragments of voices and music, then:  A NEWS REPORT... 
NEWS READER O.S. ...earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended. 
White listens nervously. 
NEWS READER O.S. ...and now for a message from LUMP-O food products... 
Across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar.  He crosses to the doorway and looks in.  The woman stands naked against a deep red wall, her back turned.  She has an elaborate TATTOO on her back  -  looks like an INSECT.  She puts on a dressing gown and TURNS SUDDENLY. 
White steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the couch. 
She steps from the doorway holding a BAR OF SOAP in her hand. She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at him.  White looks down. 
His hands seem to have SHRUNK  -  they poke out of his sleeves like tiny children's limbs.  The cuffs effortlessly slip off. 
The CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks  -  to a window.  Behind the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who attacked White.  She is talking, though nothing can be heard, drying her eyes with a handkerchief. 
INSIDE 
The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs. 
WOMAN Please believe me.  It's me, John. Your WIFE.  I wouldn't lie to you. You told me I could come and see you -  now you want to just send me away again... 
White looks AT THE FLOOR. 
HIS P.O.V.  -  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement underneath. 
WHITE I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life... 
WIFE It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent. 
WHITE How do you know I'm innocent? 
WIFE Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then... 
WHITE I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them? 
WIFE They're dead, John. 
He stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city. 
WIFE You have an uncle.  You were very close. 
She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it to White. 
WIFE This is where he lives. I'm sure he would like to see you. 
WHITE (taking paper) Thanks. 
WIFE (looks at him for a beat) Don't you want me?   My body? Remember how my skin feels?  Touch it.  I... 
She notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious.  Sachiko silently stands and leaves the room.  The wife puts her face in her hands, overcome with tears. 
WHITE What's your name? 
WIFE  (looks up  -  still sobbing) Elizabeth. 
White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it matches. 
WHITE  (thoughtful) Yes... 
In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.  She MOVES OFF. 
ELIZABETH I want to help... 
WHITE Alright.  Here... 
He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman can see it. 
WHITE Know this place? 
She looks at the card. 
ELIZABETH  (stops crying) Of course.  Your home town  -  where you grew up... 
White stands abruptly, startling the woman.  He glares down at her intensely. 
WHITE How do I get there?  Tell me. 
WIFE That's easy.  You... 
She trails off into silence.  Her hand, about to point in a certain direction, freezes in mid-air. 
ELIZABETH ...strange, I forgot. 
White sits back down quietly. 
WHITE Yes.  Very strange. 
INT.  BATHROOM 
Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor. 
Underneath is a TRAP-DOOR.  Opening it, she climbs down a hole. 
UNDER THE FLOOR 
In the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX.  She cranks a small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open.  Music plays softly. 
She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box.  A WORM-LIKE apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her thigh.  She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes. 
INT.  TENEMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR 
LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  -  feet walk along a tattered rug, approach a door.  Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always. 
INT.  TENEMENT ROOM 
A KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket, sitting before a small t.v. set.  This is THOMPSON  -  the detective with mental problems.  He's unshaven, haunted. 
Clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy- hole. 
With this, she starts to cry again. 
Sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips. 
INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT 
TIGHT ON TWO MYSTERY MEN speaking in whispers.  The Men continue talking as THE CAMERA RISES, through several levels of concrete and machinery TO REVEAL: 
EXT.  ROOF-TOP  -  NIGHT 
OTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna device. 
BACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER 
The group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.  One addresses them all. 
MYSTERY MAN The line of junction between two edges! 
MEN  (unison) YES! 
MYSTERY MAN We have located him.  Now is the time, yes. 
A switch is thrown.  Electricity sparks to life.  A hum is in the air. 
MYSTERY MAN Let the tuning commence! 
The congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in a trance-like manner.  They chant, quietly at first, steadily building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to some inner beat. 
The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh. Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion -  the legends are an unknown language. 
ON THE ROOF 
The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS RISE UP FROM THE STREET. 
INT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER 
White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the window.  O.S. distant screams. 
He glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something about it looks WRONG. 
FLY'S P.O.V. 
A distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up. 
At exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows. 
HALL-WAY 
White moves quietly towards the bedroom door. 
HIS P.O.V. 
It is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach. 
ANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The women are oblivious. 
He moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself. The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and smash. He's FLOATING. 
White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down. 
He stares up at furniture and objects. 
THE BATHROOM 
White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's head. 
White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off. Pulls himself towards the tub. 
Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water. He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart somewhere in the building. 
He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling. 
HIS P.O.V. 
A blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at him. 
White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to stop the hand strangling him but can't. 
Suddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart, throwing internal organs through the room. 
White awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty. Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress. 
EXT.  BUILDING 
BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there with bile. 
INT.  APARTMENT 
A HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge. 
COP All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him. (indicates Sachiko's corpse) She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute. 
BUMSTEAD The other one? 
COP His wife. 
INT.  BUMSTEAD'S OFFICE 
BUMSTEAD enters.  He looks nervous.  His SECRETARY sits at her desk in an adjoining office, filing her nails. 
BUMSTEAD I need everything on the Jonathan White case. 
MISS CRENSHAW Yes, sir.  Everything? 
BUMSTEAD All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me. 
The inspector turns to face her, a little manic. She is staring at him. 
BUMSTEAD Please  -  I'm in a hurry. 
MISS CRENSHAW (evenly) Certainly. 
EXT.  POLICE STATION 
BUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car briskly. 
INT.  BATH-HOUSE 
Bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels and swimming outfits, waiting silently.  They sit lined by a wall, staring into space. 
Bumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam.  He walks beside a heated pool  -  naked people swim about weakly or sit on the edge washing themselves.  He steps up to A FULLY DRESSED MAN, sitting silently on a bench.  It is WHITE. 
A feint smile brushes across White's lips as he looks up at the inspector.  He looks away, like he's forgotten something. Stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down, scoops some water. 
Bumstead sees White has picked up the LITTLE SILVER FISH. 
BUMSTEAD Why give yourself up? 
WHITE I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something... (beat) I'm scared. 
BUMSTEAD That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that? 
WHITE I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there. 
BUMSTEAD  (not convinced) Uh-huh. (pauses) What are you scared of? 
WHITE People...  after me. 
BUMSTEAD Who? 
WHITE I don't know who they are. 
BUMSTEAD Why are they after you? 
WHITE Don't know that either. 
BUMSTEAD Don't know much, do you? 
INT.  LABORATORY  -  NIGHT 
Metal scraping. 
PIANO ACCORDION MUSIC wafts on a breeze, someone breathing. 
HIGH ANGLE  -  Down through an OPENING metal hatch.  A dim laboratory IS REVEALED  -  a maze of scientific instruments. Elongated shadows move about. 
MYSTERY MEN are hunched over something.  Behind them a diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain. 
MAN 1 bends across to a CONTROL PANEL, works a switch.  A small speaker in a metal box crackles to life.  SOUND OF DISTANT SURF.  A WOMAN'S VOICE: 
VOICE What is your name...  What is your name... 
Wires lead from the metal box to a HUMAN BRAIN within a metallic container.  Electricity arches across electrodes. 
More sounds from the speaker:  WATER BUBBLING.  HIGH HEELS WALK DOWN STAIRS.  BED-SPRINGS.  LOVERS MOAN PASSIONATELY. 
MAN 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their handiwork. 
A PUPPET-LIKE CREATURE is revealed.  Small  -  two and half feet tall.  The top of its head an open hatch containing the BRAIN.  Wires lead to this. 
TIGHT ON PUPPET'S EYES  -  They glance about the room. Its body is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces. 
MAN 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes. 
INSIDE ITS HEAD 
Gears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light.  The gears part slowly to reveal a small writhing INSECT screwed to a metal plate. 
MAN 2 shows the puppet PHOTOGRAPHS:  WHITE as he looks currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby. Photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a seaside pier sirtiling and waving.  Where he went to school.  A red push-bike he owned as a boy.  His first sweetheart.  Then a photo of a young woman smiling  -  his WIFE. 
MAN 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the puppet creature  -  MORE SOUNDS OF SURF... 
A FIGURE clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows. His pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane  -  a carved silver insect.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Man 3 steps up to him. 
MISTER BLACK You have duplicated the personality, yes. 
MAN 3 It is ready.  The Doctor was most helpful. 
Mister Black turns towards the OTHER MEN. 
MISTER BLACK I hear a clock in my head, and I like it! 
BUMSTEAD I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you.  It started with two little girls.  Twins.  Used to play with them when I was young.  Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why... 
He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint. 
BUMSTEAD They didn't have faces. 
WHITE What? 
BUMSTEAD That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. (looks back at White) That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject. 
He glances at White, then back to the road. 
BUMSTEAD Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me... 
Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then: 
BUMSTEAD Is there anything you haven't told me about this business?  Even the most insignificant thing? 
WHITE (thinking) No.  Nothing I can think of. Except... 
BUMSTEAD Go on. 
WHITE Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there. 
BUMSTEAD Why, that's ridiculous.  You just... 
He trails off.  Shakes his head slowly. 
BUMSTEAD We'll get to the bottom of this.  I mean it. 
INT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY 
The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the doctor before he can protest. 
BUMSTEAD I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin... 
SCHREBER I don't know what you're talking about. 
BUMSTEAD That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time... 
SCHREBER You are mistaken. 
WHITE What are you hiding? 
SCHREBER Nothing.  I don't know anything! 
BUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face. 
SCHREBER Please, they'll kill me... 
BUMSTEAD I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends. 
EXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT 
SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an alleyway. 
Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall. 
SCHREBER In there. 
BUMSTEAD Just like that? 
The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall. 
Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He waves the other men forward. 
White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it. 
A CORRIDOR 
Through the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button. Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open. 
They step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends. 
BUMSTEAD What is this place? 
SCHREBER You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself. 
When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK PASSAGEWAY. 
EXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT 
The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of mechanical obscenities. 
INT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD 
WHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has something written on it in a strange language. 
INSIDE IS A ROOM 
They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead turns to him. 
WHITE Look. 
White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook carries A FACE. 
The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him back. 
BUMSTEAD What the hell is that? 
At the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly. Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and disappears. 
BUMSTEAD Quick.  My car. 
Fortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.  The two men leap in, start it up.  Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the glare of the headlights. 
The puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins, lifting the puppet into the air.  The car passes beneath it at speed.  Screeches off into a street, races along between tall buildings. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
WHITE What now? 
BUMSTEAD This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be? 
White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him from his pocket. 
WHITE I'll go see an uncle of mine. (reading) Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double six  -  three... 
Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with the wheel, driving at breakneck speed. 
BUMSTEAD Good. (looks in rear mirror) Uh-oh... 
White turns and looks behind them. 
HIS P.O.V.  -  HEADLIGHTS gaining on them. 
ON THE PUPPET  -  sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving like crazy. 
BACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR 
White takes out his gun  -  AIMS at the rapidly approaching car. 
WHITE  (remembers) It's empty. 
BUMSTEAD Take mine. 
Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.  They swap. 
The puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards Bumstead's front tire.  A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end of the mechanical arm. 
PUPPET ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA- HA!! 
TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.  White fires.  Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows. 
THE BLADE cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat, metal SPARKS off the road. 
White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.  Bumstead fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans flying. 
The PUPPET'S car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side- street and disappears. 
BUMSTEAD  (looks behind him) Where did it go? 
WHITE  (looks back also) Don't know. 
Both look FORWARD AGAIN  -  to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.  Bumstead's car is going too fast.  Slams the brakes. 
TIGHT ON PUPPET  -  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car approaches like a bullet. 
INSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR 
BUMSTEAD Jump! 
Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad.  The two men LEAP. 
The car continues onwards. 
CRASH!  KA-BOOM! 
In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves up from different sides of the street.  Look at each other, turn and head in OPPOSITE directions. 
CAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal  -  a MECHANICAL CLAW starts to pull itself from the wreckage. 
EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT 
White steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.  A sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.  Dominating everything is a GREEN MAN with scales  -  a KING NEPTUNE-type. 
INSIDE 
White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue curtain.  In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.  The man wakes with a start. 
TICKET SELLER Yeah.  That's what I said! (looks at White  - rubs head) What..? 
WHITE I'm looking for this address. 
The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily. 
TICKET SELLER Upstairs.  Through there. 
He thumbs the blue curtain.  Curls up, shuts his eyes again. 
BEYOND THE CURTAIN 
WHITE Where does it lead? 
KARL It must be a closet or something. 
White pushes at the cabinet.  The old man helps.  They only manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy.  White decides to just climb over it.  He squeezes through, opens the door and climbs a set of dark stairs.  Uncle Karl watches. 
KARL Don't trip over.  It's dark up there. 
INT.  ATTIC  -  NIGHT 
TIGHT ON a light switch  -  it is flipped. 
AN ATTIC  -  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions. White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been eaten out by a swarm of ROACHES.  He drops it in disgust as the insects scurry over his hands. 
In a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great interest.  At the bottom of the box he finds a SMALL DOG-EARED DRAWING BOOK.  On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's writing  -  a title:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE. 
White sits down and flips through the book in the dim light. Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings. As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more disturbed.  He flips through faster and faster. 
HIS P.O.V. 
Pages flip past, stopping occasionally.  Glimpses of DIAGRAMS. The MYSTERY MEN and THEIR WORLD.  Cross-sections of the MYSTERY MEN, the cavity in their head with the INSECTS INSIDE clearly illustrated.  EVERYTHING. 
PUSH IN CLOSE on White.  He looks up, STUNNED. 
INT.  UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT 
White emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his chest, lost in thought.  He steps quietly into a hall-way  - notices the old man putting THE PHONE back on its cradle. 
KARL John, I didn't see you there. 
A NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.  A VENTILATION GRILL falls off a wall, revealing a hole.  EYES shine from the darkness. 
THE PUPPET leaps from the hole.  Its blades unfolding, spinning wildly before it hits the carpet.  It faces the two men. 
KARL What is that? 
WHITE (to Karl) Get back! 
KARL Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo! 
He wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off. 
WHITE No! 
The puppet goes for Uncle Karl.  A whirr of metal, BLOOD SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls.  Uncle Karl SCREAMS horribly. 
White grabs a chair  -  holds it above him.  The puppet turns from the dead man in the wheelchair.  White lets it have it. The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces. 
The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers.  White has a fire-poker now.  As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall. White runs out the door. 
IN THE CORRIDOR 
He leaps into a waiting elevator.  Pushes the top floor button. 
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT  -  The elevator moves upwards. 
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR 
White looks through the circular window in the door. 
HIS P.O.V.  -  Floor after floor SLIDES PAST  -  deserted.  He looks at the floor indicator.  TIGHT ON NUMBERS lighting up: 
Then the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark corridor.  The PUPPET is at the end.  It turns to face him, SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its mechanical voice box. 
White STABS the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors won't close.  The puppet is upon him.  He JUMPS, straight up. It goes under him, CRASHING INTO the back of the elevator. White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the compartment AS THE DOORS CLOSE. 
A MECHANICAL extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around the ankle. DRAGS him across floor.  THE PUPPET shrieks wildly again, as... 
ITS ARM  -  is JAMMED in the closing doors now.  Lift descends. The puppet squeals.  The arm SNAPS OFF. 
White stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle.  He can hear the elevator descending.  Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts returning to his floor.  White turns and runs again. 
The lift doors BURST OPEN  -  the ENRAGED CREATURE emerges and races after him. 
He tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end. Nowhere to go.  He can hear the puppet approaching along the corridor.  Suddenly he notice A GRILL on a wall ABOVE HIS HEAD. He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe.  Crawls frantically. 
He sees a LIGHT ahead.  An opening.  He kicks the grill off.  A sudden gust of wind. 
HIS P.O.V. 
The pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go except a hundred stories STRAIGHT DOWN.  He screams, almost falls.  Turns to start crawling back. 
Suddenly the end of the pipe fills with WHIRRING METAL BLADES. The puppet has followed him in and is advancing. 
No choice  -  he looks out the hole.  SEES A PIPE on the outside of the building, running vertically near the opening. It looks impossible but it's his only chance. 
He climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening, REACHES for the pipe.  The puppet is almost upon him.  He swings across, gets a HAND on the pipe.  He slips, DANGLES  - holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole. The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it. 
SUDDENLY he hears a MECHANICAL CLICKING  -  TURNS to see the puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand. A soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical giggle?  A circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves down onto White's HAND. 
TIGHT ON HIS EYES  -  sweat beads and runs down his forehead. 
TIGHT ON THE BLADE  -  as it cuts into flesh.  BLOOD spatters White's face as he grimaces with intense pain.  He can't hold on. 
HE FALLS, plummets through space.  Screaming. 
White paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten ladder.  He runs off into the shadows. 
BACK IN THE WATER 
The PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear propeller.  It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.  The prop retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a concrete surface.  It looks around  -  it knows White is there somewhere. 
PUPPET'S P.O.V. 
A trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.  It follows them, is led to a crane cabin. 
INSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN  -  is White, a lunatic grin on his face, at the controls. 
A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.  It looks up. 
PUPPET'S P.O.V. 
Follows the crane up into the air.  The crane is swinging around against the dark sky.  A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops above the puppet. 
ON WHITE 
WHITE Nice knowing you. 
TIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND  -  It pulls a lever. 
THE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall. 
THE PUPPET  -  Screams up at the plummeting container. 
WIDER 
The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature. 
Silence.  Dust floats in the air. 
EXT.  STREET 
BUMSTEAD's running.  He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it out alive... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROOF-TOP 
BUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood. 
He waits. 
A NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the roof. 
BUMSTEAD White? 
It's too big to be White.  The man steps from the shadows. 
STROMBOLI (walking forward) Hello, Bumstead. 
He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.  Bumstead lies bleeding, against the wall.  He points his own gun at the advancing man and pulls the trigger. 
CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK! 
BUMSTEAD Dammit. 
Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away, picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.  Without Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand. 
STROMBOLI Why do you always have to find things out the hard way!  Couldn't you just do your job, you idiot?  I told you, didn't I?  These people are not playing games, Bumstead.  They can do anything they want, don't you understand? 
BUMSTEAD (a hiss) You're one of them.  You bastard... 
STROMBOLI (laughing) In a way, we all are, inspector! You.  Me.  Everybody! 
Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.  He keeps laughing. 
STROMBOLI Time for that early retirement, Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch I'm afraid. 
BUMSTEAD (weakly) No...  Please... 
INSPECTOR'S P.O.V. 
THE EDGE looms up  -  a long drop to the street. 
EXT.  STREET 
White paces nervously through empty streets.  He stops, to get his bearings, then turns and runs into: 
A SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels. A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.  An inhuman moan. 
Terrorised, White pulls back. 
FIGURE Ahhh...  it hurts!... 
The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.  A streetlight reveals... 
DOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework covered in silver blades. 
WHITE What happened to you? 
SCHREBER I'm...  being...  punished. 
White is led into a pitch black room. 
INSIDE 
TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE  -  In the darkness  -  he looks across to the Mystery Man standing beside him. 
WHITE How did you know where to find me? 
MYSTERY MAN We knew you would turn up here eventually...  Been waiting for you, yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way... 
The Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward.  As soon as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and shuts the door, cutting off any existing light. 
A NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights start to come up all over the room. 
It's a normal, average-sized, living room.  All the furniture has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an arrangement resembling an IMPROVISED COURT of law.  In fact, White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box. 
The apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the kitchen) and a series of figures step through.  MYSTERY MEN. 
All the MEN take up specific positions around the room, without uttering a word, but don't sit.  One MYSTERY MAN opens a curtain beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small room, stand DOZENS OF PEOPLE, crammed shoulder to shoulder.  The people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of spectators. 
An eerie silence falls on the room. 
The kitchen door opens again.  White is shocked to see the VICTIMS WALK INTO the room and adopt positions in what is obviously the area for the jury. 
The DISEMBOWELED CORPSE OF A WOMAN steps out of the shadows, pushing a pram.  Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white sheet. 
Within the pram is the BABY clutching its own head, with spine attached, under its arm. 
Then the mutilated FREDRICK hops out, followed by the three brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of the YOUNG BOY. 
Finally, his WIFE and the JAPANESE WOMAN, still in passionate embrace, take their positions. 
Another door opens  -  a closet. Within stands the figure we have only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly MYSTERY MAN with the cane. MISTER BLACK slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the closet.  Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a toilet is heard flushing. 
He is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting his withered body on his cane.  Looks like he will play JUDGE. 
Everyone in the room now sits.  Mister Black looks at White. 
ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear, but cold. 
MISTER BLACK Welcome. 
White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook called:  ANSWERS. 
MISTER BLACK John White, you are to be tried for murder, yes.  You wish to confess to these crimes now? 
White is silent.  He leans over and scratches his legs through the fabric of his trousers.  They itch like crazy. 
Mister Black turns to the assembled people. 
MISTER BLACK Very well.  The testimony of the prosecutors.  Yes. 
TWO MYSTERY MEN stand and step across to a wooden easel.  MAN 1 stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc. drawn on stiff cardboard.  MAN 2 uses a pointer while he describes the evidence to support their case. 
MYSTERY MAN 2 We will show that John White is abnormal, a menace to society, a dangerous sick individual, and that the court should have no mercy in finding him guilty and punishable to the extreme for his crimes. 
MAN 1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the easel.  It shows White at the door of the JAPANESE WOMAN'S apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood. 
MYSTERY MAN 1 Exhibit A shows the accused leaving the scene of his most recent crime, yes.  A photo taken by a remote camera planted by one of our agents. 
White watches in stunned silence. 
A general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is made.  Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly. 
MYSTERY MAN 2 Exhibit B... 
MAN 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to MAN 2. 
MYSTERY MAN 2 Actual tape recording of accused committing aforementioned crime, yes. 
He turns a switch, the reels spin slowly.  A hush fills the room. 
VOICE 1 (sounds like JAPANESE WOMAN) No...  Please... 
A scream. 
VOICE 2 (sounds like White) Shut up! 
Another scream.  A ripping sound. 
VOICE 3 (sounds like his WIFE) John!  Don't... 
Another scream. 
White is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this any longer. 
WHITE (a squeak, almost inaudible) Stop it!  This is a lie... 
Mister Black turns to White.  The Men testifying stop the tape and look at him also. 
MISTER BLACK Something to say?  Ready to confess? 
The Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the victims and the spectators in the adjoining room. 
WHITE (back to a whisper) I didn't kill anyone.

WHITE CHRISTMAS 
"WHITE CHRISTMAS" 
by 
Melvin Frank, Norman Krasna and Norman Panama 
FULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS) 
This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre. 
In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen and artillery rumbles are heard.  The battered terrain shows the effects of battle. 
In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage. Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is nearby. 
MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA 
We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON. 
JEEP - MED. CLOSE 
As it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean and fresh from the Pentagon. 
He is staring off at the recreation area. 
GENERAL CARLTON (To Adjutant) What's this all about, Colonel? 
ADJUTANT (Turning) A little entertainment for the men, sir.  Tonight's Christmas Eve. 
GENERAL CARLTON These men are moving up tonight. They should be lined up for full inspection! 
The jeep has come to a halt. 
GENERAL WAVERLY (Eyeing him) You're absolutely right. (To Adjutant) There's no Christmas in the Army, Colonel. 
ADJUTANT Yes, sir. 
Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep. 
GENERAL WAVERLY (To Carlton) There's always a slip-up or two during a change in command.  The men get a little loose.  But I know I'm leaving them in good hands. 
GENERAL CARLTON (Stiffly) Thank you. (To Driver) Sergeant, take me to headquarters immediately!  We'll have those men turned out on the double! 
The Sergeant looks at General Waverly. 
GENERAL WAVERLY Goodbye, Sergeant.  Take the short cut. 
SERGEANT Yes, sir! 
The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him. 
TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT 
The Adjutant turns to him. 
ADJUTANT That's not the way to headquarters! 
GENERAL WAVERLY Joe, you know that, and I know that, but the new General doesn't know it. Or he won't for about an hour and a half. 
ADJUTANT That Sergeant'll be a private tomorrow! 
JUDY We're booked in Vermont. 
PHIL Vermont?  What's there? 
BETTY Snow.  We spent last Christmas in South Carolina, the year before in Hawaii.  They didn't seem like Christmases.  There ought to be snow. This one's going to be real white. 
BOB Well, it's the way you've been raised. If you saw a lot of snow when you were a kid you miss it more around Christmas. There's a lot of snow around St. Paul. 
JUDY Is that where you come from - St. Paul? 
It dawns on him, slowly.  He shows no emotion. 
BOB No.  You come from St. Paul. 
JUDY I come from Canton, Ohio. 
BOB (Just for the record he knows) I'd like to ask you something.  Were you ever in an oxygen tent? 
JUDY Oxygen tent?  Oh no! 
BOB Were you ever in a road company of "Student Prince?" 
BETTY No.  Why? 
Bob looks at Phil.  The rules are clear between them. 
Bob puts his hand out.  Phil takes it.  They shake. 
BOB Very good. 
PHIL Thank you. 
BOB What I admire are the details, the invention, the little lies all around the big one.  It takes talent. 
PHIL Oh, it's nothing. 
BOB Don't say that.  Don't belittle yourself.  Credit where credit is due.  You did it fine. 
BETTY Private conversation? 
BOB Little game we play. 
PHIL (To Judy) May I have this dance? 
JUDY I'd love to. 
PHIL (Helping her up) I'm not going to keep calling you Miss Stewart. 
JUDY The name is Judy. 
PHIL (To Bob) What a pretty name! 
BOB (They're off) Nicer than Dolores! 
BETTY I'm Betty. 
BOB I'm low man. Bob. (He takes her arm, indicating Phil and Judy) Follow that couple. 
BETTY Why? 
They move toward the dance floor. 
CLOSE SHOT - WINGS - RECORD PLAYER 
We identify that the music is coming from this spinning record player we have previously established. 
34-A. 
MED. SHOT - CAFE FLOOR 
Bob and Phil do the number. 
MED. SHOT - AUDIENCE 
They APPLAUD at end of number. 
MED. SHOT - INT. NOVELLO'S OFFICE 
We faintly HEAR the applause. 
LANDLORD They're clapping! It's over!  Arrest them! 
The Sheriff gets up. 
CUT TO: 
MED. SHOT - CAFE FLOOR 
The boys bow themselves off, and run toward their dressing room. 
MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR 
They hurry down the corridor, passing the office door. 
BOB Get out of these clothes! Toot sweet! 
PHIL Ma, unhook my bra! 
The office door opens behind them, which they do not see. The Sheriff steps out, followed by the Landlord and Novello. 
SHERIFF (Calm) Just a second, folks!  I'll handle this! (He walks to the dressing room door) 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM DOOR 
There is a plaque attached to the key in the lock.  The Sheriff smilingly turns the key in the lock.  He puts the key in his pocket. 
SHERIFF (Winking) You stay here.  Let them try to go through the window. 
The landlord is delighted. 
LANDLORD If they make a break for it, shoot 'em! 
WIPE TO: 
MED SHOT - EXT. CAFE - (NIGHT) - SHERIFF 
The Sheriff walks around the corner of the cafe, and a police car awaits, with cop at the wheel. 
SHERIFF Just a minute, Hank, couple of customers coming up. 
HANK Okay, boss. 
The Sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room. 
SHERIFF Take my friends where they want to go! 
HANK Yes, sir. 
SHERIFF Hurry up! 
BOB (Going out the window) Thanks, Pete. 
EXT. WINDOW - POLICE CAR 
Hank has thrown the door open. 
PHIL Do you think we can make it? 
HANK This thing goes over a hundred an hour!  Hold on! 
He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming, and tires grinding. 
MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM 
The Sheriff watches them go, pleased.  A pounding on the door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns.  He strides to the door, takes out his key and opens it. 
MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR 
The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the departing police car, the noise having distracted them from the door pounding.  The siren is still heard, retreating. The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet.  They turn to him, faces alight. 
SHERIFF They escaped!  We're pursuing 'em! 
LANDLORD Escaped! 
SHERIFF (Pointing) What do you mean smoking on theatrical premises! 
LANDLORD That's not mine!  I wasn't smoking! 
SHERIFF What's that burning?  A lollypop? (He grabs him by the shoulder, not too gently, and starts him out) Come on! 
He protests, 'What - !' 'But!'  Novello is openmouthed. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. STATION - (NIGHT) 
The train is already moving as the police car arrives. 
The girls are on the observation platform.  The police car screams to a stop.  The boys fly out, with bags, and just make the train, the girls pulling them aboard. 
JUDY (Seriously) You didn't steal the police car? 
PHIL No, no.  Friend of ours. 
They go toward the lounge car. 
MED. SHOT - INT. LOUNGE CAR - GROUP 
They all take seats in the lounge car, happy to have accomplished their escape. 
BOB Well, we'll be together as far as New York. 
BETTY Maybe it'll snow in New York for Christmas.  If it doesn't, we'll mail you a snowball from Vermont. 
JUDY I haven't been on ice skates in years. 
WIPE TO: 
MED. SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE 
The bus winds around another turn in the beautiful green surroundings and we pass a ski lift and a ski jumping platform. 
WIPE TO: 
MED. SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE 
Still another turn of the bus, and in the distance we see a LONG SHOT of the Columbia Inn. 
MED. SHOT - INT. COLUMBIA INN 
MARTHA, a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart, forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk. 
The door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, SUSAN, carrying the mail, walks toward her. 
SUSAN Mail, Martha. 
She puts the mail on the desk. 
MARTHA (As she shuffles through it) What's the weather forecast down at the Post Office? 
SUSAN Awful.  Fair and warmer. 
MARTHA If we don't get snow soon we can turn this hotel into a haunted house. We haven't had a guest for three weeks. 
SUSAN (As Martha keeps searching through the mail) What are you looking for? 
MARTHA (Not finding it) Your grandfather's written Washington asking if he can get back in active service.  I think he wants to fly jets. 
SUSAN I think he could do it. 
MARTHA He says older men have been called, and besides, he misses the food.  I tell you, Susan, he tried to make it a casual letter, with little jokes, but it came out just begging. 
Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator, shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow. 
His back is to CAMERA. 
SUSAN (Moved) Oh, Martha!  What are we going to do? 
MARTHA (Blowing her nose) I don't know.  Don't let on we know he's written.  He'll start in I'm only his housekeeper and that I found out through some chicanery or something. 
SUSAN (Soothing her) How did you find out? 
MARTHA Like any housekeeper --  I read the carbon paper. (She hands the mail to Susan) Bring him the mail. 
Susan starts out as CAMERA MOVES UP to window.  After a moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls. He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General Waverly.  He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.

FULL SHOT - EXT. INN - (DAY) 
The bus comes to a stop and our principals get out, Phil staying with the driver for the luggage.  The others enter the inn. 
MED. SHOT - INT. INN 
Martha at the desk, and her eyes widen in surprise. 
BETTY We're the Stewart sisters. 
JUDY Your floor show. 
MARTHA (To Waverly) Don't worry -- I've already told them we'd have to cancel. 
WAVERLY Why?  We have a floor, haven't we? 
MARTHA Last time I looked.  But who are they going to sing to? 
WAVERLY Even if it's only to you and me, it will be well worth it.  Besides, there will be six inches of snow tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow. 
BETTY (Happily) Is that the weather forecast? 
WAVERLY No.  But if there was one thing I learned in the army it was to be positive -- especially when you don't know what you're talking about. You'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm on K.P. 
Phil and Bob stiffen automatically. 
PHIL AND BOB Yes, sir! 
WAVERLY (To Betty and Judy) And you two charming ladies, I want you to know I'm looking forward to your show this evening.  Whatever your audience lacks in numbers, it will make up for in enthusiasm -- (He glares at Martha) or I'll know the reason why! 
He smiles at the girls, and exits, dignified. 
JUDY (Utterly charmed) Gee... no wonder we won the war! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DINING ROOM INN - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT - 
BETTY AND JUDY 
They are doing the number, SISTERS, on the floor.  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the scene.  There is a scant audience distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen in number.  Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil are sitting at one table. 
Martha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting as hostess.  Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and helping out at table. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL 
They are admiring the performance.  Phil indicates for Bob to look in this direction.  Bob does. 
REVERSE ANGLE - MED. SNOT 
The General is seating a table. 
MED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL 
Bob shakes his head, unhappy at this condition.  They look at each other. 
BOB I think well stay a little longer than we planned. 
MED. FULL SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY 
They finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically, but the few people in the audience don't make for much clatter.  One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest and clearest. 
MED. SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY 
He is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding.  He walks toward the boys, still applauding.  They applaud too.  The girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys. 
Martha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at her.  Then her enthusiasm is boundless. 
WAVERLY Excellent.  I enjoyed it very much. 
BOB Do you want me to cancel the troupe coming? 
PHIL (Getting off the desk) No, no.  Let's go through the gesture. If you had been on the Titanic when it went down, you wouldn't've been satisfied just to sink into the ocean. (Gesturing) You'd have done a swan dive into it. With me on your back! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FULL SHOT - COLUMBIA INN FLOOR - (DAY) 
The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying preparations for the show.  The little stage has been enlarged - the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall pushed back a little farther.  There is hammering and painting going on in various parts of the room.  Trunks have been unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks arrive.  Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness of the previous scene. 
THE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls standing nearby.  Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity. 
MARTHA I can't believe it!  You mean you brought the whole show up here? 
BOB When you hired the Stewart sisters you also hired a New York show.  It was in the small print. 
PHIL And you can't get out of it.  We've got lawyers. 
SUSAN I can't thank you enough, but I wonder if Gramp'll let you do it? 
PHIL Why not? 
MARTHA His pride.  When he decides he's going into bankruptcy he likes to go. 
BOB Now just a second.  We're not doing this for him! 
PHIL Oh no!  We're bringing the show down here to rehearse! 
BOB The company's been getting a little ragged.  We'd appreciate the use of the hall. 
PHIL Of course we don't expect it free! 
BOB We'll pay a little, but not much. - You see, the audience will be guinea- pigs -- and for us, that's quite an improvement. 
This has not fooled Susan.  She throws her arms around Bob and then Phil. 
SUSAN I don't know what to say! 
She cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and runs out.  There is a moment of silence. 
BOB I hope this is not an indication of advancing age, getting kissed out of gratitude. 
PHIL You didn't expect a girl that pretty to kiss you because she wanted to? 
BOB A body keeps hoping. 
Betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack. 
Bob is quite surprised. 
BETTY (Sincerely) That was the nicest thing I ever saw anybody do. 
BOB It was still gratitude. 
PHIL (To Judy) I'm his partner.  I'm entitled to half the credit. (Judy steps up to him and just pecks him on the cheek, then joins her sister in rehearsal) She's not as grateful as her sister. 
They look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading scenery, as the General arrives in his buggy. 
He steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing by. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
People break off what they were doing and begin to drift out. Bob and Phil have gone toward Betty and Judy. 
BOB Get a little rest before tonight's performance. 
PHIL (To Judy) I'll walk you over. 
BOB Phil! (He takes a sheet of music out of his inside pocket) Look this over, I want to try something. 
PHIL (To Judy) See you later. 
The girls go.  Phil goes toward the piano, Bob goes toward Martha, who is on the phone, accepting reservations. 
FULL SHOT - ROOM 
Bob takes Martha by the arm and seats her in the middle of the room as an audience of one.  Phil looks up from the piano, puzzled. The sunset is visible through the window and there is a mood of quiet. 
MARTHA Guinea pig? 
BOB (Nodding) That's the idea. Want you to hear a song I just wrote. 
MARTHA If it's a love song, don't get too close. 
BOB It isn't.  Just tell me how you think the Old Man would feel about this one. 
He leaves her and goes to the piano and they do WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A GENERAL, solely for Martha. 
Toward the end of the song -- 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY 
Unseen by the others he is standing by the door listening to the song. 
MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM 
The boys finish the number. Martha applauds and Bob bows. 
MARTHA (Very moved) I think it's just wonderful -- 
CLOSE SHOT - SUSAN - AT KITCHEN DOOR 
She is standing there, drying her eyes with her apron. 
SUSAN I think so, too. 
CLOSE SHOT - WAVERLY - AT THE DOOR 
WAVERLY I'm afraid I disagree. The song is funny, but there is one thing wrong with it. 
PHIL'S VOICE What's that, sir? 
WAVERLY It's true.  I'd rather you didn't. 
FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR 
Bob and Phil exchange a quick glance. 
BOB AND PHIL Yes, sir. 
The General turns and exits toward the lobby, THE CAMERA PANS with him, a lonely figure walking through the lobby, the CAMERA STOPPING on a poster advertising tonight's performance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
JUDY The way Phil dances, and he's funny. It's easy to see yourself married to him. 
BETTY (An effort) And Bob? 
JUDY He's different, deeper, and he's funny, too.  It'd be nice to be married to both of them. 
BETTY Good thing they're not a quartette. 
JUDY (Oblivious) If I was Catherine the Great, that's what I'd do.  Phil in the daytime, Bob at night. Or should it be the other way around? 
CLOSE SHOT - JUDY AND BETTY 
SHOOTING PAST Betty.  Is it possible our Betty has a suspicion of a tear? 
JUDY Phil'd be more fun in a night club, but eventually a girl wants a pipe and slipper fellow.  That's Bob, smoking a pipe and petting a cocker spaniel.  Still, Phil could learn to smoke a pipe.  Breaking a fellow in to suit you is something every girl should go through.  I hear it's half the fun.  Which one do you like better?  Betty? (No answer.) Betty? (Softer) Are you asleep? (No answer. Judy turns over and closes her eyes) 
Music has underscored this scene.  Betty is wide awake. 
She is looking toward the window.  As the curtains billow outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, putting out his pipe.  This is followed by an equally diffused figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, and joining Bob.  Bob takes her in his arms.  At this point we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter. This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of bed and puts on her robe. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. INN KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT) 
We PAN Betty to the refrigerator door, which she opens. 
BOB'S VOICE Tuna fish, on the lower shelf. 
Betty whirls around. 
MED. SHOT - BETTY AND BOB 
We see Bob is having a snack of his own. 
BETTY Oh! 
BOB What are you doing?  Sleep-walking? 
BETTY I couldn't sleep. 
BOB Little young for that, aren't you? 
He gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  His preoccupation with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must escape him. 
BOB What shall I make you? 
BETTY Anything'll do. 
BOB If you tell me what you want to dream about I'll know what to make you. 
BETTY (Amused) How's that? 
BOB Different foods make for different dreams.  I've got a whole theory about it.  It's called "The Wallace Way of Wishful Wooing."  You'll find it in the American Medical Journal under 'W'.  Ham and Swiss cheese, for instance, you get a cool, thin, blonde girl.  Turkey sandwich, you get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy though.  Now a liverwurst sandwich - (He shakes his head) you get both girls at once.  Bad night. 
BETTY What do you dream on tuna? 
BOB Darndest thing, I dream about me. 
BETTY (Evenly) Then I'll have a tuna sandwich. 
Bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said. 
Bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness indicates pregnancy. 
BOB You're kidding! 
SYLVIA We don't want anyone else to know. 
ALBERT Please don't mention it. (The orchestra starts to play ROCKABYE BABY.  Sylvia and Albert are startled) For heaven's sake! 
SYLVIA How did they know? 
The girls start crowding around. 
GIRLS (Ad libbing) You wouldn't tell us, would you?  We had to find out ourselves, etc. (Phil and Judy are among the group) 
MARTHA (Formally) There will be a celebration of the forthcoming event tonight after the show! (Everyone approves) 
MED. SHOT - BOB, PHIL AND ALBERT 
Phil puts his arm around Albert. 
PHIL Obviously you're going to call the boy after me! 
BOB After you?  I hired Sylvia!  The baby'll be named after me! 
PHIL I've been dancing with her!  That's more important!  The baby'll be named after me! 
BOB The hiring was more important!  After me! 
PHIL The dancing was more important! After me! 
ALBERT I'm her husband. (Small pause) The baby'll be named after me. 
BOB Well, we're going to need another dancer! 
PHIL How about Judy, she knows all the routines, she could pick it up in no time. 
They walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group now includes Betty. 
BOB On the other hand, it's all right if we lose a number, we're running too long now.  We have to cut somewhere. 
BETTY Wouldn't it be better if you cut my solo number?  I've never felt right in it anyway. (Indicating Phil) The show needs every bit of his dancing. 
BOB (Interpreting this as mere selflessness for love) Well - 
BETTY There you are - painless. 
She turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming emotional.  Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks is her devotion. 
MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BOB AND PHIL 
Bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty. He looks at Phil and shakes his head. 
BOB Greater love hath no woman than to give up a solo number.  Old Chinese saying. 
PHIL (All this is beyond him) What are you talking about? 
BOB Drink your coffee. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FULL SHOT - WAVERLY QUARTERS - (NIGHT) 
APPLAUSE follows the song.  Phil gets up. 
PHIL Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make an announcement. 
FULL SHOT - CROWD 
Everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement. 
PHIL It is my pleasure to identify the man who has been doing the chasing. I am him! - Or he! - Or it!  Anyway, Judy has caught me.  What I'm trying to say is, we're engaged. 
He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is going to marry her.  He hugs her amidst a general reaction of congratulations. 
MED. SHOT - BOB 
He is flabbergasted. 
MED. SHOT - GROUP 
Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators. 
Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm. 
BETTY I hope you realize that you're getting he most wonderful girl in the world. 
Bob sees her emotion through the speech.  Betty notices Judy upset, shaking off the people around her and running through the doorway to the kitchen. 
Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the orchestra goes into HER COMES THE BRIDE. 
MED. SHOT - INT. KITCHEN 
Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters. 
BETTY Darling, don't cry. 
JUDY (Turning to her) I didn't know he was going to make that announcement, I swear I didn't. 
Betty puts one arm around her. 
BETTY I know you didn't. 
JUDY He had no right to do that. 
BETTY You do love him, don't you? 
JUDY That doesn't matter. 
BETTY Nothing else matters. 
JUDY We're not going to break up our act. 
Phil enters the kitchen. 
PHIL I've been looking for you, Judy. 
BETTY Excuse me. 
She goes through the corridor toward the living room. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY 
In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry getting some drinks for the guests.  He is not seen by Betty who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few tears.  Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the corridor from the living room. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight. Betty wipes away a tear.  In the background we see the General in the buggy noticing this. 
MED. LONG SHOT - TRAIN IN DISTANCE 
Bob is in the foreground, the General in the background. Bob joins the General at the buggy.  From Waverly's expression we can see that he has decided on a plan of action. 
WAVERLY Must be interesting to be a woman. 
BOB The idea's never occurred to me, sir. 
WAVERLY Well, think about it. (Bob is thinking about it) Well? 
BOB Not interested! 
WAVERLY A man like you must be an expert on women. 
BOB It's a little immodest to say so, but I consider myself an authority on the fair sex,  I've made a study of the subject.  They're simple creatures. 
WAVERLY They couldn't fool you? 
BOB I'm single. 
WAVERLY 'Pride goeth before a fall.' 
BOB 'Who knows his own strength is twice armed.' 
WAVERLY It's always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field.  Tell me, why do you think Betty went to New York? 
BOB (Not willing to admit it) She has a job in The Carousel. 
WAVERLY Expert, you're wrong!  She went to New York because she's so in love with someone here she just couldn't stand it. 
BOB Phil. (A mixture of resentment and frustration) I'm darned if I can figure out why. 
WAVERLY I thought you were an expert on women. (To the horse) Come on, Delilah! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTMAS TREE ANGEL - DAY 
THE CAMERA PANS DOWN from the ceiling and we see that THE INN is being decorated for Christmas Eve. 
Everybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil and Judy rehearse.  The attitude is slightly cool on Judy's part, but it is lover's coolness. 
PHIL (Fitting the action) Good, Judy. (During the dancing) Now the same as the middle part. 
They make a nice couple, with his arm around her waist, dancing as one. 
REVERSE ANGLE - BOB 
He enters the room, and watches.  He looks intently at Phil. Phil and Judy dance closer to Bob. They see him. They continue dancing, talking as they do. 
PHIL Betty get off all right? 
BOB (Slightly belligerent) Certainly. 
JUDY Betty left something for you.  She said to give it to you after she left.  It's on the piano. 
Bob hears, nods, but keeps staring at Phil.  Phil becomes conscious of the staring. 
WAVERLY (Without looking up) They're cumulus clouds, at an elevation of seven thousand feet. 
BOB Yes, sir. (Still trying) Still, weather's a funny thing. It could snow - overnight. 
WAVERLY (He thinks a moment) I'll tell you something I haven't told my family.  I'm going back in the Army. 
BOB Really, sir? That's great news! 
WAVERLY Yes.  I miss the Army. 
BOB Where are you going to be sent, sir? 
WAVERLY Well, I'm not sure yet.  I've always been a combat officer, but I got an idea they're going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me.  They'd better not.  They just better not. (He's worked up now) I'm not ready for pitching horseshoes yet. (He smiles) Now nothing to the women folk about this! 
BOB No, sir. 
WAVERLY Let's mosey over to the post office, I'm expecting a letter any day. 
BOB (Remembering) Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. (He pulls the letter out of his pocket) That's what I came over to give you, it slipped my mind. 
The General takes the letter, he looks at it front and back. 
WAVERLY (Solemn) This is the one. (He opens it,  He squints.  He looks to Bob) My glasses are in my room.  I'd like to read it by myself, but I'm a little anxious. (He smiles at his own predicament) Read it, son.  Slowly. 
BOB (Reading) Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old - (He stops) 
WAVERLY (Pleased) Skip that word. 
BOB Yes, sir. (Continuing) It certainly was a surprise hearing from you.  Your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine. Of course you've got plenty of time to be amusing, sitting on that porch, rocking away, while we put in a full day's work.  You always were a lucky stiff, and I envy you.  A few years more, I was saying to Emmy the other evening, and I'm going to be able to take it easy like old Tom. 
WAVERLY (Just repeats) Old Tom. 
BOB Oh, well, some people have all the luck.  Everyone in the family is fine here.  Carol had the mumps, which is no joke at eleven years of age - 
WAVERLY The rest of the letter is about the family. (Bob looks at him, and then glances at the rest to see if it is so) He's telling me they have nothing for me, we're not fooling each other. (He holds has hand out) Thank you. (Bob gives him his letter.  There is a pause.  An attempt at being light) Say, it couldn't be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes.  Now could it? 
BOB (Trapped, unhappy for him) No sir. (His nerve up) Begging your pardon, sir, there's a lot to be said for leisure.  You're not used to it, you've always been active, but in time - 
He stops, seeing Waverly's expression.  Waverly winks at him. 
WAVERLY (Quietly) Never kid a kidder.  Go on back to the hotel. 
BOB Yes sir. 
Waverly gets up to join the horseshoe players after all. Bob watches this reflectively as we 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN: 
MED. SHOT - (DAY) - INT. HOTEL ROOM - BOB AND PHIL 
Bob is packing his valise, Phil helping him. 
PHIL Judy thinks my eyes are soulful.  Do you think my eyes are soulful? 
BOB One of them is. 
PHIL You have no poetry in you.  It's about time you went in for girls, too.  After all, you haven't many years left for that sort of thing. 
Bob, his back turned to Phil, comes across the sock Betty knitted for him; he hastily shoves it into the bottom of has bag. 
LEADER What? 
BETTY Play "Blue Skies" -- anything. 
LEADER Relax.  Just do it the way you sang it this afternoon -- you'll be great. 
He gives the downbeat, and Betty has no choice but to sing LOVE, YOU DIDN'T DO RIGHT BY ME.  She is assisted in the second chorus by a vocal group. 
CLUB - MED. SHOT 
as Bob watches her.  When she finishes the number, Betty steps down from the platform and joins Bob. 
BETTY (As Bob holds the chair) Well, surprise.  What brought you to the big city?  And don't say 'a train.' (Forced gaiety, hiding her tension) 
BOB I never heard you sing that well. That's a good number for you. 
BETTY (Her own significance) Some numbers suit you better than others.  What are you doing here? 
BOB Business, business.  Meeting a fellow here. 
BETTY Judy all right? 
BOB She's fine.  Couldn't be better. (Carefully) Playing footsie with Phil. 
BETTY That's nice. 
BOB I think they like each other. 
BETTY I do, too. 
BOB (Eyeing her) They're kind of suited, in a lot of ways. 
BETTY Some people are. 
BOB Thanks for the knitted sock. 
BETTY Don't mention it. 
BOB I thought it was for Phil. 
BETTY (Evenly) If the sock fits, wear it. 
BOB (Unsure of her meaning) It started out for Phil. 
BETTY It just started out as a sock. 
Every line of the sock exchange should have the meaning of the love implications. 
BOB You're a very odd girl. 
BETTY You're a very odd fellow. 
Bob is close to declaring himself, if he was only sure of his ground. 
BOB Two feet, one sock.  I must be. 
BETTY I'll get around to the other one, eventually. 
BOB You mean to do any knitting in the near future? 
BETTY The feeling comes and goes. 
PHIL Bob, just leave it to me!  He won't get near a set if I have to break a leg... Goodbye, Bob! 
He opens the door of the booth and hurries across the lobby toward Susan, who is at the desk, and BANGS on the bell, which is on the counter.  Martha comes running from the kitchen. 
PHIL (Excitedly) Now everybody pay close attention. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. TELEVISION STATION - (NIGHT) 
Ed is about to go on the air.  Bob is opposite him, out of camera range,  The technical crew are watching the hand of the dial approaching 60. 
ED I hope Phil has been able to keep the old man away from a television set. 
BOB He has.  In anything involving something crooked he's dependable. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. LOBBY COLUMBIA INN 
Seated around the television set are Waverly, Martha and Susan.  Martha and Susan look at their watches and each other, nervously.  Waverly also looks at his watch. 
WAVERLY Ed Harrison will be on in a half minute.  I like him.  I never miss him. 
The women are becoming very nervous.  Suddenly we HEAR off scene the most tremendous clatter dorm the stairway and Phil's shouting. 
PHIL Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
WAVERLY (Jumping up) What's that? 
He runs toward the stairs.  Martha and Susan breathe a sigh of relief and follow Waverly. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - STAIRS 
Waverly runs to the tangled Phil. 
PHIL My leg is broken!  Ow, ow! 
WAVERLY Take it easy, boy. (He starts feeling his leg) 
PHIL Ow! Ow! It's broken! 
WAVERLY No it isn't!  You may have a bad sprain, but no bones are busted! 
PHIL It's broken, sir.  I can feel it. 
WAVERLY Let me help you. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. TELEVISION STATION 
The technician indicates for Ed Harrison to start as the second hand hits straight up. 
ED I would like to address all former officers, enlisted men, Wacs and nurses who were under the command of General Tom Waverly -- 
MED. SHOT - INT. COLUMBIA INN OUTSIDE WAVERLY'S OFFICE 
Waverly and Martha are helping Phil through the door. 
PHIL Ow!  Ow! It's broken in two or three places! 
WAVERLY That's just the impression you have! I tell you it's only shock! 
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM into the office as they lay him out on the couch. 
SUSAN Just fine. 
BETTY They are bedded down in all the hotels. 
Martha blows her nose. 
MARTHA His old outfit... If I wasn't such a mean old biddy, I'd probably break right down and cry. (She cries) 
BOB There's nothing to cry about, is there? 
He looks to Susan and she begins to bawl. 
SUSAN (Through the crying) Thank you so much. 
Bob looks to Betty for support. 
BOB Can't you do something? 
BETTY They're just affected by the gesture. 
She can't hold it back either, and now the three women are crying. 
BOB That's fine. 
BETTY (Through her tears) Where are Judy and Phil? 
BOB Probably in their rooms, crying. 
They start out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MED. SHOT - EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
As Bob and Betty turn around the corner, they see Phil and Judy, locked in an embrace.  Bob has been in front, but he steps back quickly, not wanting to embarrass the lovers. 
BETTY Who is it?  General Waverly? 
BOB The lovers. 
BETTY (To Bob) We can't just stand here.  We have to get some sleep. 
She walks into sight, Bob following.  Phil and Judy break, embarrassed. 
JUDY We were rehearsing for the show tomorrow night. 
BETTY Is it going to be that kind of a show?  We'll be raided! 
JUDY What are you doing here?  What happened at The Carousel? 
BETTY I'm helping out here tomorrow. 
PHIL Hi, Bob. Everything's under control. (Fluster) I mean with the show. We've got a lot of new material.  You both are going to have to do a lot of rehearsing. (Flustered again) I mean the other kind of rehearsing - I mean - rehearsing  Well, good night, Judy. 
And he holds his hand out, and they shake hands, still flustered. 
JUDY Good night, Phil.  Good night, Bob. 
BETTY (To both) Good night. 
Flustered, the boys open the door to the girls' bungalow, thinking it is their own. 
MARTHA Very well.  I'll explain to Bob and Phil that you didn't care to come to the show tonight. 
WAVERLY I'll have you court-martialed! 
MARTHA You don't mind being ungrateful, you just don't like being told you are! 
SUSAN (Follows it up) If you think you don't owe them anything, you're not obliged to go. 
MARTHA They haven't done much for you. Hardly anything.  You do what you think is right! 
WAVERLY (Angrily) Martha, I'll make my own decisions! I got along very well in the army without you! 
MARTHA It took 15,000 men to take my place! 
She stalks out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FULL SHOT - INN FLOOR - (NIGHT) 
It is slowly filling up.  One of the guiding officials turns out to be the Sheriff we have previously seen. 
PETE (Seating a party) Right this way. 
MED. SHOT - INT. MAKESHIFT DRESSING ROOM - BOB AND PHIL 
They are getting into their old uniforms, which are slightly misfit. 
BOB (At the trousers) This thing's shrunk. 
PHIL (Looking at the bulge) Pants always shrink in closets. 
BOB I can't breathe in this.  What am I going to do? 
PHIL I know what I'm going to do. (Showing him) I'm going to take one big deep breath, and that's going to be it for the next three hours. 
Bob takes a deep breath and gets the top button buttoned. 
MED. SHOT - LOBBY STAIRWAY - (NIGHT) 
General Waverly comes down the stairs, cutting quite a figure in his uniform and decorations.  Martha and Susan, waiting for him at the bottom, look him over, admiringly. 
WAVERLY (Gruffly) Well, I couldn't come down in my bathrobe. 
FULL SHOT - INN FLOOR 
The spotlight prepared, pinpoints the General as he enters the room, and the music starts.  The audience rises and applauds.  He can't believe it.  He reaches his table, decorated with flowers, and recognizes he is the guest of honor.  From the lobby we hear the outfit SINGING the opening strains of THE OLD MAN. 
All eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to their respective tables as the song finishes. 
MED. SHOT - WAVERLY 
He is profoundly moved and walks to the stage.  The audience is seated.  Waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great affection.  The people begin to shout, "Speech!  Speech!" Martha and Susan sit. 
The crowd quiets, waiting for the speech. 
WAVERLY (He must have had a blood transfusion from a sergeant at some time) I am not satisfied with the conduct of this division!  Some of you men are under the impression that having been at Anzio entitles you not to wear neckties!  You are wrong! Neckties will be worn in this area! I have also noticed a deterioration in the quality of saluting!  This is to be improved!  I have also had complaints from the commanding officer of the rest area in Naples!  He informs me that the non-fraternization rule is constantly being broken by men of this division!  In fact, this division is outstanding in its violations of non-fraternization! You all know the rules!  The non- fraternization ban expressly declares you are not to talk to women! (A slightly different tone) Don't talk to them!  That is all! 
They howl and cheer.  He makes has way toward his own table, greeting old friends on the way. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

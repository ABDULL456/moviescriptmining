THE SURFER KING 
1       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                          1 
JAFFA, a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box. 
There are a few workers milling about, setting up the park for opening. He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker with Down's Syndrome. 
JAFFA Eddie! 
EDDIE (smiling, nodding) Jaffa. 
They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's. 
He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. 
He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it into the CD player. 
He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the CD player. 
His voice echoes through the park.         "Soak up the Sun" begins playing. 
JAFFA (smiling) Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be open in (checking his watch) twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes. 
GFX - OPENING CREDITS BEGIN 
2       EXT EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                    2 
BIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay. 
There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it. The GUARD is standing there with a garden hose 
Page 2 of 81 
holding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay. 
He is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long time. We look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke. 
BIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay. RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance. 
BIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks at RICHARD who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button. 
They both draw back as if something big should happen, but nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool. 
RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out. 
Nodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his clipboard. 
3       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   SURFS UP AREA                       3 
We see people working to open the park. The VAIL PRECISION LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. They perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles, and cross each other in a timed march to the music. 
4       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FUN HOUSE AREA                      4 
BIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a clipboard. He is talking to RICHARD. 
ALEX looks in his wallet, as do we.    It is empty. 
ROBBIE (nodding) I'm Robbie. Robbie Zirpollo. 
ALEX I'm Alex.     Where you workin'? 
ROBBIE I believe it's with the Grounds Crew? 
ALEX What's the matter, can't swim? 
ROBBIE (surprised) I can swim. Why? 
ALEX Well, you look old enough to be a guard. 
ROBBIE Almost 16.     I get my license in September. 
ALEX It's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. Most guys your age that can swim are guards. 
ROBBIE Well, I just moved here. I guess I missed guard tryouts. You're a guard then? 
ALEX Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just as well. The guards are mostly stuck up anyway. The rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun. 
ROBBIE Can't swim, huh? 
ALEX (smiling) Nope. 
ROBBIE (listening to speaker on post above) What is that? 
ALEX (mimicking his perception of surfers) Surf tunes, dude! 
Page 6 of 81 
(back to his own voice) You'll get used to it. You'll get to where you miss it. I had to buy two CD's just to get through the winter. 
They are now at the front of the line. A teenage girl MELISSA is sitting at the table with papers and a clipboard. 
ALEX (CONT'D) (gesturing) Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa, time clerk extraordinaire... 
MELISSA (shaking her head no) Oh, Alex. Am I going to have to put up with your crap for another entire summer? 
ALEX (looking upward toward the sky) Dear Melissa. There's nothing about our relationship that couldn't be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind Thunder Bay. 
MELISSA Yeah, well from what I hear, it would be a BRIEF few moments. 
ROBBIE (wincing) Ouch. 
ALEX (not missing a beat) My dear, you cut me to the quick. Check off my name and that of my amigo here, Mr. Robbie Zirpollo. 
MELISSA (handing them cards) Fill out these emergency cards, and turn them in when you pick up your uniforms.... (pointing) over there. And Alex? 
ALEX (to ROBBIE) She wants me. (turning back to MELISSA) Yeeees? 
MELISSA (finger pointing) This year, let's clock in only our OWN time card, shall we? 
ALEX 
Page 7 of 81 
(head shaking, to ROBBIE, walking together) Some people have no sense of humor. 
8       EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - OUTSIDE UNIFORM BUILDING         8 
ROBBIE and ALEX walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5 teens. At the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a clipboard list. 
WE SEE him on a pay phone behind the counter. 
AOKEE (to person on the line) David...how you do this to me? I have full staff with you. I save your spot. I was counting on you. (listens, nods) Yes, yes....but The Gap? What you think you do there? Are there girls in swimming suits? Have you forgotten? (listens, shaking head) Tips. Do you get tips? Cash money? (listens some more) 
ALEX walks up.   AOKEE waves to him.   He is obviously upset. 
AOKEE (CONT'D) (resigned) Well, come see us this summer, eh? You're a good kid...a good worker.     Yeah, you too. 
AOKEE hangs up the phone. 
ALEX Who....? 
AOKEE David. Seems to think there is future in retail. Now what I do? I'm one person short. Park opens tomorrow. 
AOKEE buries his head in his hands on the counter. 
ALEX (thinking) You know...I just met a guy that's old 
Page 10 of 81 
enough to work here, but he's stuck in grounds. 
AOKEE (perking up) Good guy? 
ALEX Seemed like our kind of people. 
AOKEE thinks for a moment. He glances up towards Surf's Up. It hits both he and ALEX at the same time... 
AOKEE We need to get him before he get his plunger! 
They take off running. 
10        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - TRAIL FROM AOKEE'S TO SURF'S10 UP 
AOKEE and ALEX are running together. They get about 50 feet before AOKEE, large man that he is, runs out of breath. ALEX, like a boxer in training, sort of runs in place, keeping loose, ready for AOKEE to catch his wind. Off they go again, get another 50 feet, and the same thing happens. 
AOKEE (out of breath) Alex...... (wheeze) ..you got to go ahead... (wheeze) ...stall 'til I get there. 
ALEX (nodding, running in place) OK. 
ALEX takes off, and AOKEE runs again.... 
11        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH          11 
WE SEE several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies. 
THE COLONEL is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a Water World golf shirt, with a green Water World baseball cap. He is wearing black horn-rim glasses, thick lenses, and carrying a clipboard. 
Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including ROBBIE, who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL. They are all younger than ROBBIE except one, EDDIE, whom we met at the beginning of the film. 
EDDIE is standing tall and straight, proud to be there.      He is nearest THE COLONEL 
Page 11 of 81 
THE COLONEL (looking up from clipboard) Well, it looks like we have a good staff here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be an excellent summer. Remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work WE do. If we do it well, the people come back. (walking up and down the line) We have a little tradition here on the grounds crew. Rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which I can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname. You will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records. 
THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork. 
THE COLONEL    (CONT'D) Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes. OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie! 
EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying. 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't faced. Listen to him. Learn from him. Watch what he does. This man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had. 
THE COLONEL (to himself) I never forget a grounds nickname.... 
AOKEE has finally made it now, but is, of course, out of breath again. 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) 
Page 14 of 81 
(concerned) Aokee, good God, man...are you OK? 
AOKEE gestures he is fine, and does a combination of charades and Hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks. 
AOKEE Colonel....terrible mistake... 
ALEX gets behind AOKEE, deciding he needs some help, feeding him words. 
ALEX (quietly behind AOKEE) Bureaucratic bumble... 
AOKEE Bureaucratic bumble.... 
ALEX Lost paperwork.... 
AOKEE Lost paperwork.... 
ALEX An error in the front office... 
AOKEE Error in front office.... 
ALEX Spiced applesauce.... 
AOKEE Spiced... 
AOKEE stops, turn and glares at ALEX, who merely smiles and shrugs. 
THE COLONEL Good God, man, what are you trying to say? 
ALEX comes around from behind AOKEE. 
ALEX It's Robbie sir. He was supposed to work at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up, he ended up here. 
THE COLONEL (looking at clipboard) Zirpollo? Well this is highly irregular... 
He is flipping though the papers, confused. 
ALEX (can't pass this up) 
Page 15 of 81 
Most annoying.... 
THE COLONEL Most annoying.... 
ALEX Never happened before.... 
THE COLONEL Never happened before.... 
ALEX Spaghetti marinara... 
THE COLONEL Spa....what? (exasperated) Well, if he was supposed to be assigned to you, we'll just have to let him go... 
ROBBIE has caught on and is quick to step out of line, and pick up his shirt to be ready to go. 
ROBBIE (to THE COLONEL) I was confused myself, sir. I had heard I was working for some Hawaiian guy. 
RICHARD (CONT'D) (almost quietly to the stunned crowd) Thank you. Have a great summer! 
There is stunned silence for a moment.    They're not sure how to react. 
ALEX 
Page 18 of 81 
(breaking the silence) Alright! Whoo whoo! 
ALEX, then everyone begins applauding. ROBBIE looks at ALEX quizzically, ALEX just shrugs. The meeting breaks up. 
13        INT - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK      13 
Everyone is hurrying around, getting ready for opening day. ROBBIE, wearing his new blue Hawaiian shirt, is cutting pineapple. AOKEE is busy hovering over everyone, and cooking chicken on the grill. ALEX walks in. 
ALEX (to ROBBIE) Hey, hey lookin' good. Blue is your color. Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh? 
AOKEE (unhappy, stressed) Alex! You are late. Come on, is opening day! 
ROBBIE finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to AOKEE, almost spilling it. 
AOKEE (CONT'D) (to ROBBIE and ALEX) You two start setting tables. 
ALEX takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and points to ROBBIE to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the dispensers. ROBBIE grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor. 
At that moment, AUDREY a girl in her teens who works at AOKEE'S and is stacking plastic cups on the counter, accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground. 
RAMON, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter. He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and pans. His head peers up from below the counter sheepishly. 
AOKEE turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly. 
AOKEE (CONT'D) (to ALEX, gesturing) Alex. Come here a minute. 
ALEX comes up close next to him at the grill so they can talk. 
AOKEE (CONT'D) (with intensity) Alex, look. We falling apart. I made you assistant manager this year. Go assistant manage. 
ALEX 
Page 19 of 81 
(agreeing) No problem. 
ALEX pops a CD out of the rack above the sound system, and puts it in the CD player, stopping the standard pastoral Hawaiian music that has been playing. 
He turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to SARAH, a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass skirt by the Velcro, removing it with a Velcro rip. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Sorry, Sarah, but I need to borrow this. 
SARAH (surprised) Hey! How did you know I wear shorts under that? 
ALEX (mock surprise, rolling his eyes) Oh, Puh-leeaase. 
ALEX walks back out to the dining area, everyone is still working. 
ALEX (CONT'D) (to all) Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? 
Everyone stops and looks at ALEX. 
ALEX (CONT'D) In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here. And what will they be looking for? (as if directing a choir) 
EVERYONE TOGETHER (except ROBBIE, who doesn't know any better) The best teriyaki east of the pacific!!! 
ROBBIE (incredulous) Busier? 
ALEX (laughing) Don't worry. You'll get used to it.      And tips were good, right? 
Page 22 of 81 
ROBBIE There's nothing like cash money in your pocket. What's that over there? 
They are coming up on THE WAVE area. 
ALEX Oh, you'll find this ride interesting. 
16        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - DAY - THE WAVE AREA                      16 
The walk up to THE WAVE attraction, where kids are surfing in a high-water pressure river/ sheet of water. Surf music plays loudly here, and kids are doing all kinds of tricks. Some riders are good, some are not, and fall quickly. 
We also see SKEETER and SNITCH, the tall skinny and short chubby grounds kids we met earlier. They are cleaning up around the exit area of THE WAVE. 
ALEX (as a rider falls) It's a lot harder than it looks. 
ROBBIE I can't imagine it's that difficult. (to himself) ...no rudder on the board... 
ALEX Now this is a place of many wonders.     See those guys in line over there? 
WE SEE some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other. 
ALEX (CONT'D) We call them "Wave Bums". They all have season passes, and do little more than ride the wave all day long. Some of them get pretty good. 
Alex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to be drifting up. 
ALEX (CONT'D) That's where they hang out when they're not riding the wave. Don't get too close to them. 
ROBBIE No? 
ALEX (sniffing) Contact high. 
ROBBIE nods, understanding. ALEX points back to THE WAVE. 
Page 23 of 81 
ALEX (CONT'D) And there, my friend, is another one of The Wave's features. 
WE SEE a pretty girl in line to ride. 
ALEX (CONT'D) We call them "Wave Babes". And there's a special secret to this ride. 
With that ALEX walks over to BOB, a guy in his late teens, wearing a Security Golf Shirt. He is standing and looking off in a different direction. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Hey, Bob....can I borrow your radio a minute? 
BOB Sure. 
He hands him the radio, and ALEX is back with ROBBIE. 
ALEX (into radio) Hey Frank, it's Alex. 
ALEX waves and FRANK, the guard watching THE WAVE waves back. 
FRANK VO (heard through the radio) Yo, Alex. 
ALEX (into radio) Listen you have a possible code 4. (to ROBBIE) Means a "hottie". 
ALEX (CONT'D) (to radio) She's up next. A free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit. 
DOUG And hey...tell that wienie Alex he still owes me twenty bucks! 
ROBBIE (looking back and waving as he walks away) Got it. 
18        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                   18 
ALEX and ROBBIE are walking to RIVER COUNTRY and walk past JAFFA in the CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK. 
Page 26 of 81 
JAFFA (calling out) Alex! 
They turn and walk over. 
ALEX Jama...I mean...Jaffa the Jamaican...what shakes, it mon? 
JAFFA Jus' the same old this's and that's, mon. 
ALEX Jaffa, meet Robbie Zirpollo. (to ROBBIE) Jaffa plays the tunes and talks the talk. 
The PHONE RINGS, and Jaffa turns to answer. 
JAFFA (into phone) What? No way. (hangs up phone, to ALEX & ROBBIE) Check it out... 
JAFFA smiles and picks up a radio. 
JAFFA (CONT'D) (into radio) Attention Lost River guards. We have a report that some huge fat bald guy has abandoned his swimsuit and is slidin' down Lost River with nothin' on but a smile. Be watchin' for a great white whale now. 
19        EXT - DAY - TOP OF LOST RIVER RIDE                             19 
WE SEE two female life guards, both with a surprised look on their faces. One has just reached into the water and picks it up to display a HUGE pair of swim trunks. Both girls make an Eeeew face. 
20        EXT - DAY - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                             20 
JAFFA (on PA system now, into mike) Attention please. Will Mr. John Big Bootay report to Lost River Splashdown. John Big-Bootay to Lost River Splashdown. 
ALEX (to ROBBIE) He's calling for security. 
ALEX wanders off a moment, looking at something going on in the distance. 
Page 27 of 81 
ROBBIE (to JAFFA) Wow. Jamaica. I thought I was far from home. 
JAFFA (dropping the accent a bit) I'll let you in on a little secret. Perception is everything...now, Jamal from Aurora, he's probably over with those guys... 
WE SEE SKEETER and SNITCH walking into the men's room, looking suspiciously around. 
JAFFA (CONT'D) (back to the accent) ...cleaning the rest rooms. But Jaffa from Jamaica, he's in customer service, wearin' the nice shirt and playing the music. Perception and atmosphere. You get it? 
ROBBIE smiles and nods, and waves goodbye to catch up with ALEX. 
21        INT - MOMENTS LATER - IN MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM              21 
SNITCH is filling up a water balloon, while SKEETER is tying a piece of fishing line to the hook on the inside of the stall door. SKEETER climbs up on top of the stall. 
SNITCH is tying off the water balloon and grabs the other end of the fishing line, and ties it to the fill end of the balloon. He shuts the stall door, tosses the balloon up to SKEETER, who places it strategically on the beam above the toilet. SKEETER then jumps down, and they head for the door. 
Eddie Enters. We see EDDIE cautiously checking out the restroom. He reaches up over the closed stall door and feels gingerly the fishing line. He smiles and shakes his head, and heads for the door. 
22        EXT -MOMENTS LATER - APPROACHING MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM      22 
EDDIE is now pushing his cart and making his way toward the MEN's RESTROOM. He stops to talk to two concessions girls and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck of cards, which he pulls from a place on his cart. We see him holding the cards so one girl can pick one. 
AMY Well, anyway, Big Mike's is where they are. 
ROBBIE Thanks. 
ALEX and ROBBIE walk off. 
AMY What a couple of losers. 
KATIE I don't know...I thought Robbie was kind of cute... 
AMY Listen, you're new, so let me tell you how things are. First those guys were wearing blue shorts. That means 
Page 30 of 81 
concessions. (uses her fingers to explain) The Water World social structure is organized on three levels. At the bottom are the Trash Rats. 
KATIE Trash rats? 
AMY Bottom feeders. Grounds kids. Babies. They clean the toilets and empty the trash. Most are only 14 years old. It's the only job younger kids can do here. Next up is concessions. They're our "middle class". We don't hang with them and they don't much hang with us. At the top of heap are the guards. You are a guard. Girl, if you want to go out with someone, stick with your own kind. 
KATIE (looking off at ROBBIE and ALEX walking away) Aw, that's just silly. I think he's cute. 
25        EXT -DAY   BOTTOM OF RIVER COUNTRY ON THE WAY TO BIG MIKE'S 25 
This in an area where riders splash down from riding a tube down the River Country slides. ROBBIE and ALEX are walking past the splashdown area. 
ROBBIE What did that girl Amy mean? 
ALEX About what? 
ROBBIE When she said, when are you going to tell him? 
ALEX I'll tell you over a hamburger at Big Mike's. 
ROBBIE and ALEX proceed to BIG MIKE's out of frame. 
SUDDENLY in the background we see a tube splashdown from a slide and the 7 year-old girl riding in it falls out. 
Realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning. A guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle. 
IN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle. They begin running, BAYWATCH style towards the scene. 
Page 31 of 81 
Two guards are running and carrying a backboard. They converge in another BAYWATCH style slow-mo shot and line up along the edge of the splashdown pool. 
One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl. 
At the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops.      WE SEE his face in close-up as he says. 
RESCUE GUARD (slow-motion, voice distorted, to the girl) Staaaannnd Uuuuuuuupppp! 
The drowning girl stops splashing wildly, and realizes she can indeed stand up. She looks at all the guards lined up, smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool. 
26        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S                               26 
ALEX is standing outside of BIG MIKE's.    ROBBIE is walking out of the restaurant. 
ROBBIE (Shaking his head) Aokee's not going to be happy. Nobody seems to know where these things are... 
ALEX (smiling) Yep. (now laughing) 
ROBBIE What? 
(shaking his head) You're not gonna believe it... 
AOKEE Listen. Some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card. Today I believe anything. 
ALEX I took Robbie to The Wave today. 
AOKEE (looking around) What? He drown? 
ALEX No. It turns out that he's from Oceanside. California. You know, where they always hold those surf competitions? 
AOKEE Yeah.   So? 
ALEX It turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition. As a Sophomore. 
AOKEE Robbie. (laughing in disbelief, dismissive, then serious) Robbie barely walk without help. 
ALEX I saw it myself.      You wouldn't believe it. 
We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.      AOKEE winces and gestures toward the kitchen. 
AOKEE I don' believe it.      Our Robbie? 
ALEX Our Robbie. 
AOKEE (thinking) If this true....this could be da year. 
ALEX That's what I was thinking. 
AOKEE Well, go get him. We need to make ready. He not just walk in and win this thing. 
ALEX You heard it. He's in the kitchen... 
Page 38 of 81 
ALEX goes into the back. AOKEE sits at a table. Robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron. 
AOKEE Robbie, sit down. Alex, make up a Volcano. This boy in training. 
ROBBIE (sitting down, worried) What did I spill now? 
WE HEAR the whine of a blender as ALEX is working on the Volcano Smoothie. 
AOKEE Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of surfer. This true? 
ROBBIE I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I spend my summers. 
AOKEE You know about Employee Olympics? 
ROBBIE Yeah.   Some kind of trophy. 
AOKEE Surfer King trophy. Very big.     Very nice. (looking down) Concessions never win. 
ALEX arrives with the Volcano Smoothie. He turns a chair around and sits. They will gang up on him. 
ROBBIE I dunno...seems kind of silly to me. 
ALEX It's a big deal. Every girl     wants to date you. Every guy wants to BE      you. Special privileges...we all     wear standard uniforms.   The Surfer King     gets to be creative. You ever see the      cowboy hat Cowboy wears? 
ROBBIE It shouldn't be that hard...how good could this Cowboy be? 
AOKEE He very good. His family go to Hawaii every year, two, three weeks. Good surfer. If you do this, you need to see Pipeman. 
ROBBIE 
ALEX There'll still be time for fun. Most of the work is setting up. Besides, we get paid, too. When was the last time you got paid to party? 
With that, ALEX punches in, as if to punctuate the line. 
36        EXT - NIGHT -   OUTSIDE AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK             36 
It is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere, Christmas lights in the fake palm trees, TIKI lights around AOKEE's, and lights lighting a stage where a band is playing, what else, surf music. 
Buffet tables line the area, and there is SMOOTHIE BAR set up. BIG MIKE himself is behind the bar making smoothies, while RICHARD is playing bass in the band. AOKEE is running around making sure all the buffet items are full. Everyone is wearing Leis, but the cheap plastic ones, except AOKEE and his staff, who have real ones flown in from Hawaii. 
AOKEE (pouring out four smoothies to ROBBIE and ALEX) OK. You work hard, and we fine now. Your time to party. Here they are. Special Love Smoothies. Be careful! 
ALEX (to ROBBIE) These never fail. 
ALEX picks up two Leis from a box behind the counter. He and Robbie walk over to AMY and KATIE who are standing over near the buffet. 
ALEX (CONT'D) (to ROBBIE, but if front of AMY and Katie) Now this will never do. 
ROBBIE (agreeing) I'm afraid you're right.     Something must 
Page 42 of 81 
be done. 
ALEX and ROBBIE set the smoothies on a nearby table. They remove the cheap plastic Leis the girls are wearing. Then they put on the real ones they carried over. ALEX steps back to admire his work. 
ALEX Oh, yes,    yes.... 
ROBBIE Perfect.    A work of art. 
The girls look at each other and smile. ALEX and ROBBIE grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls. AMY sips hers right away. 
AMY I don't remember anything like this on Aokee's menu. 
ROBBIE They're.. 
ALEX (interrupting) ..special smoothies. Fortunately, you know people on the inside. 
Onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above. Now JAFFA steps up to the mike. 
JAFFA We'd like thank Aokee and his crew for hosting this evening's Luau. 
Everyone applauds, AOKEE waves. Alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade. ROBBIE nods and smiles as the AMY and KATIE clap as well. 
JAFFA (CONT'D) We'd also like to bring Aokee up to sing one of his Hawaiian specialties. 
Again, everyone claps and cheers him on.    AOKEE goes on stage. 
ALEX You girls want to dance? 
KATIE (grabbing ROBBIE's hand and leading out to the dance floor) Sure. 
AMY shrugs yes and goes out with ALEX. 
AOKEE (onstage) 
Page 43 of 81 
Mahalo and Aloha. This song is sung on my island for all young people in love...or about to be. Is called E O'Mai, or, You Are Mine. 
AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, "E O'Mai".      Many couples are dancing; it is a slow song. 
ALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every once in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror. 
They pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night. 
37        EXT MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - NORTH EDGE OF THUNDER BAY          37 
ROBBIE is walking on the seawall that separates the bay from the sunning area, tightrope style. KATIE walks next to him. 
KATIE So...what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern California and move to Colorado? 
ROBBIE Not both my folks.   Just my Mom. 
KATIE Aha...trouble in paradise? 
ROBBIE Let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in Mexico. Mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said "Colorady is the place you outta be". 
KATIE It could be worse. 
ROBBIE Well, I must admit, I've met some very nice people. (looking down and smiling) In California, the attitude's a little different. Here, not everyone is out to prove something. Seem's like everyone just wants to have fun. 
KATIE I have a theory. Sometimes it snows here so hard, that it's a challenge just to get to work or to school. Everything shuts down for a day or so. If your car gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road. Most people here don't just look out for themselves. A lot of times, 
Page 46 of 81 
they're looking out for you, too. 
38        EXT. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK             38 
ALEX and AMY are inside the KIOSK.    ALEX is showing her how everything works. 
ALEX All these switches feed sound throughout the park. Which reminds me. 
He pulls out a CD and pops it into the CD Player and presses PLAY. He sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like a sword. 
ALEX (CONT'D) And this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun. 
He begins swishing it around, AMY is giggling. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Oops.   There....almost got you. 
AMY is dodging and laughing. ALEX closes in and seems like he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling her. AMY leans back laughing and WE SEE her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier. 
39        EXT. NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER GRAND PAVILION                       39 
They have reached   the area to the west of Thunder Bay. It is simply a concrete   pad that overlooks the party below. We hear "Paradise is   in Your Eyes" by Michael Peace, which begins with a lot   of jungle sound effects. 
KATIE (looking down at the party) You were right. This is nice. (reacting to the jungle noises) But not necessarily quieter. 
ROBBIE Just a sec. 
He walks away slightly and gets on the radio. 
ROBBIE (CONT'D) Hey, Alex. Give us break down here. Turn down the sound effects. 
40        EXT. NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                             40 
ALEX and AMY are kissing; she is up on the counter of the KIOSK. 
ALEX (interrupting, but to AMY) Uh oh. Sorry. Hold that thought. 
Page 47 of 81 
He grabs the radio. 
ALEX (CONT'D) (into the radio) I'm on it. 
47        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S - SURF MUSIC BED 47 
We are at the back door to Big Mike's. ALEX knocks, and the same kid as before, DAVE, pops his head out. ALEX appears to ask a question, DAVE goes back in as ALEX waits. DAVE comes out again and gestures, "no one knows". ALEX starts to leave, but turns back and asks something else. DAVE disappears and comes back with a burger. ALEX shrugs, and walks away unwrapping and eating the burger. 
48        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING           48 
ROBBIE sees a door marked, "EMPLOYEES ONLY". He looks down at his employee ID and shrugs and goes in. As he enters we see he is pushed out by some unknown force. Out the open door comes "Wally" the Water World mascot, who walks off. Robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up, shaking his head. He gets up and walks off. 
49        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING - SURF49 MUSIC BED 
Now it is ALEX who has separately come upon the same door, not knowing ROBBIE has already been there. He enters, and the door remains open. We hear girls screaming and he exits quickly, followed by a volley of thrown girl's underwear, swimsuits and towels. 
50        INT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY PUMPHOUSE - SURF50 MUSIC BED 
This room is creepy. It is full of loud pumps and large pipes. ROBBIE is making his way through a labyrinth of piping and gauges and the like. He peers and sees a head with a red scarf, but it moves out of view.  Surf music fades. 
There is a constant whine of the pumps. ROBBIE moves further in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench, with his back to him. He is working to tame a small leak. 
ROBBIE (quietly) Hello? 
No reaction. 
ROBBIE (CONT'D) (loudly this time) Hello? 
Page 50 of 81 
This startles and kind of angers PIPEMAN. 
PIPEMAN Hey.   You're not supposed to be in here. 
ROBBIE Yeah, sorry. Are you Pipeman? 
PIPEMAN (recovering from the startle) Not on purpose. I guess some people call me Pipeman. 'Spose it's better than Carl. 
ROBBIE So you're real name's Carl? 
PIPEMAN No. I just said Pipeman was a better name than Carl. 
ROBBIE Oh. Well, my name's Robbie.      I work at Aokee's. 
PIPEMAN Oh. OK.   What the hell you doin' down here? 
ROBBIE I need your help. 
PIPEMAN That scrubsink at Aokee's leakin' again? Gees, I knew we shoudda replaced... 
ROBBIE It's not the scrub sink. I need your help. I'm competing in the Employee Olympics. With your advanced surfing experience, Aokee thought you might be able to help me. 
PIPEMAN (to himself) Everybody wants to be the Surfer King. (to ROBBIE) What advanced surfing experience? 
ROBBIE Well, you know. "Pipeman"? Hawaii's North Shore? Surfing the pipeline? 
PIPEMAN Ohhh. Bad news, kid. I hate to disappoint you, but this is the reason they call me Pipeman. I'm the plumber around here. 
PIPEMAN holds up the large wrench. 
Page 51 of 81 
ROBBIE Oh, boy. See, I'm from California, and I can surf, I just don't know what to expect from the wave on Thunder Bay. I...I was just hoping you could help, I really am sorry for bothering you. 
ROBBIE begins walking out, dejected.    PIPEMAN looks at him, and feels sorry for him. 
PIPEMAN Wait a minute, kid. I do know a little about surfing. I also know a lot about the wave here. What exactly are you looking for from me? 
Hey, surfer boy! I got fifty bucks at three to one! Don't let me down, mon. 
ROBBIE (to JAFFA) Hey Jaffa. NO worries. (to ALEX, shocked) People are betting on me? 
ALEX Just a little friendly pool. No big deal. Helps make this more interesting. Concessions never had a chance before... 
ROBBIE I've seen this Cowboy practice. His style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good. I could lose you know. 
Two concessions girls are walking by them. 
CONCESSIONS GIRLS (together) Hi Robbie! 
ROBBIE How ya doin' (to Alex after they have gone by) See. How come everyone knows me by sight now? 
ALEX Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll survive it. The Employee Olympics are only a week away. What happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit. Then different teams compete in contests that test their Water World skills. The next morning it all ends with the surf contest. You ready? 
Another group of concession girls calls ROBBIE from one of the snack bars. He waves. 
ROBBIE I suppose. I've been working out a strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good day. It's risky... 
Just then they both nearly run headlong into TIFFANY. 
TIFFANY Well, hello Robbie. 
ROBBIE (surprised) You know me? 
Page 58 of 81 
TIFFANY Of course I know you. It's my father's park, I try get to know everyone. 
ALEX (interrupting, eager) I'm Alex! 
TIFFANY Yes, I'm sure you are. (ignoring ALEX, back to Robbie) It's been a while since I've been to Aokee's. Do you suppose if I come down in a little while you could make some of that special chicken, what is it? 
ROBBIE The best teriyaki east of the Pacific. 
TIFFANY Yes...and one those smoothies I hear so much about? 
ROBBIE (stunned) Well, sure. I'll be working all afternoon. 
TIFFANY It's a date then.    See you later! 
She walks off. ROBBIE just stands there. ALEX starts walking, then comes back. Finally ALEX pushes him on the shoulder. 
ALEX Come on, we gotta get back. 
ROBBIE (still shocked) Yes. Yes we do. 
56        INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK                          56 
AOKEE is wiping the counter alone.    HE turns toward the kitchen... 
AOKEE Alex! We need more large smoothie cups out here! 
AOKEE continues cleaning up. ALEX shows up with a load of cups, AOKEE takes them and starts placing then. 
AOKEE (CONT'D) (to ALEX) Look at that. 
WE SEE in a far corner of AOKEE's TIFFANY and ROBBIE in an 
Page 59 of 81 
animated, engaging conversation. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Present Arms! 
Page 61 of 81 
The brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company! 
MARCHERS Yes sir. 
LEAD MARCHER Order arms. 
They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) What do you do if it's wet and not yours? 
MARCHERS (in cadence) Don't touch it! Don't touch it! 
LEAD MARCHER How do you deal with a full can of trash? 
MARCHERS We empty!     We empty! 
LEAD MARCHER Sound off! 
MARCHERS Trash Rats! 
LEAD MARCHER Again! 
MARCHERS Trash Rats! 
LEAD MARCHER Sound off, Trash Rats. 
MARCHERS Trash rats! Trash Rats! 
They stop.     Their brooms are raised over their heads. 
LEAD MARCHER Company!     Brooms Ho! 
They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company!     Begin! 
He counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a BLUE MAN/STOMP like drum routine with the trash cans. 
Page 62 of 81 
Two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). These become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick. 
A competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches. 
Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish. 
They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them. They begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) (to the seated GROUNDS KIDS) What do you do when the table's a mess? 
GROUNDS KIDS (together) We wipe it! We wipe it! 
LEAD MARCHER What do you do when a toilet's stopped up? 
GROUNDS KIDS We plunge it! We plunge it! 
LEAD MARCHER Sound off! 
The guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by the grounds kid. The concessions kid is working hard and splashing a lot but not getting very far. 
As the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater racing turn and swims back toward the point where they started. Right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the same thing. 
As they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who still is splashing a lot but not going fast. After they pass him he stops, as he is tired out. 
Momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. The swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions kid never finishes. 
61        EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH SIDE            61 
There are three lines set up with several participants. It is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of drinks in paper cups, water. The colors indicate again concessions, guards and grounds. 
The race is already in full swing, with concessions in the lead. The last group of relayers are now getting their trays, and concessions is way ahead. 
Page 65 of 81 
Everyone is cheering their team on. The final pass is made to SARAH who works for AOKEE's. She takes the tray and moves gracefully to the final stop. There is a small table on which the drinks must be placed. 
She is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops. 
All concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on. 
She does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks, tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled. 
The JUDGES scribble furiously. 
62        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK               62 
Three picnic tables are set up in front of AOKEE's. WE dolly past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four. Behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and grounds kids. 
A JUDGE blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the lifeguard team. 
It is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this. They bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands dirty. 
We dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of the guard team. 
We dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield. 
A tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the trash can which the rain-suited grounds kid is holding at it's end. 
We dolly further left to see EDDIE in full army fatigues with safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super-soaker water gun in the history of man. 
The table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed. EDDIE holds up the business end of the Super-Soaker gun and blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old Western gunfighter. 
The JUDGES take notes. 
63        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL                      63 
The three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for the next challenge. One of each team is in full sweats, color coordinated by team. 
ALEX is the one in the sweats for concessions. Slowly the sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay 
Page 66 of 81 
down. 
The grounds kid is the littlest guy of all. 
A JUDGE blows a whistle and four members of each team run into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited teammate out of the water. They lie them down on a clear area and begin CPR. 
The guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin CPR. They are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained. 
We move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but inexperienced. One girl is using her hands to provide a seals over the mouth of her "victim" and another is clumsily pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while reading some kind of instruction card.. 
ROBBIE (hypnotised) K... 
She walks away. ROBBIE stands there a moment before waking up and leaving also. 
66        INT. EVENING - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                      66 
It is dark. We see ALEX and AOKEE cleaning up from the day's food service. ALEX Is wiping down the smoothie area, AOKEE is sweeping on the other side of the counter. 
ALEX (voice somewhat hushed) I'm telling you we need to talk him. Something's going on. 
AOKEE (shaking his head no) Robbie know the right thing to do.     He's a good boy. 
ALEX So how about this? He tells me I've got to cover for him if his mother calls. He told her he's spending the night at my house. 
AOKEE He say that? 
ALEX Yes. Tiffany's got something up her sleeve and Robbie's too messed up to 
Page 69 of 81 
notice. 
AOKEE (reflective) Spending the night at your house.      This very bad. Very bad. 
AOKEE (CONT'D) He should be done with the dishes by now. Tell him we want to talk. 
ALEX disappears back into the kitchen. AOKEE goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down. 
ALEX comes back and ROBBIE follows. 
ROBBIE Hey. I'm done with the pots and pans. It's almost nine. Can I take off now? 
AOKEE Robbie, please, sit. 
ROBBIE sits down.   So does ALEX.   Robbie looks at both and gets suspicious. 
ROBBIE Everything OK? 
AOKEE That's what we gonna ask you.    What you plan tonight? 
ROBBIE Well, Tiffany invited me to a little party up in the mountains. 
AOKEE Robbie, you athlete. Big day tomorrow. You need sleep, not party. 
ROBBIE It's no big deal.   I'll be fine. 
AOKEE Is big deal. Robbie. You good boy, smart, everybody like you, but.... 
ROBBIE But... 
AOKEE Face it. Only one reason Tiffany interested in you. She want to make you so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow. 
ROBBIE (disbelief) Aw, come on... 
Page 70 of 81 
ALEX Robbie. She's still going out with Cowboy. I saw them together at the movies two nights ago. 
ROBBIE Maybe she's just letting him down easy. 
ALEX Robbie...things...things are not always what they seem to be. 
ROBBIE Like what? 
AOKEE (to Alex) Have you seen him? 
ALEX Not yet. 
They are looking to the north towards the crowd, but ROBBIE appears behind them. 
ROBBIE (looking in the same direction) What you lookin' at? 
AOKEE We looking for you.        How you sleep? 
ROBBIE I slept fine. (pause as AOKEE and ALEX wait) I decided I'm not my father. I don't run out on the people I care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at me. 
AOKEE (relieved) We go then. 
ROBBIE picks up his board, and they begin walking toward the bleachers. ALEX stops and turns suddenly. 
ALEX She shook her ta-tas? No one said anything about shaking ta-tas. (reflectively) This puts a whole new light on things! 
He is in ROBBIE's way.        ROBBIE pushes him with his board. 
ROBBIE Get going! 
69        EXT. EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                  69 
ROBBIE, COWBOY and MELINDA from grounds, who we met earlier and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed once on vacation, are all standing in front of the JUDGES. 
One JUDGE explains the rules. 
Page 73 of 81 
HEAD JUDGE (looking down at clipboard) Alright, here's the deal. You get three tries; three heats. We judge each run and only your high score counts. If you fall you get no score for the run. Your score will be added to the total for your team, and the winner gets the Surfer King Trophy. Any questions? 
They all shake their head no. 
HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D) Then let's begin. Grounds is up first. 
MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the grounds score. 
We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed. 
COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row. The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now. 
ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner. 
MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5. 
COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens. 
The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen shows a 0. 
ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild, especially the concessions kids. 
Melinda begins her final run. She does better than the past two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand and thanks her for her efforts. 
Page 74 of 81 
COWBOY gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes no chances. 
He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. The guards applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8. 
ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 7. 
The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show "Grounds   98", "Concessions 102" and "Lifeguards 102".

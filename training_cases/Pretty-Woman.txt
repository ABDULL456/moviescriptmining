EXT. A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT 
The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house is extraordinary.  A small outdoor dinner party is in progress. 
A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests.  Playing cards and coins appear and disappear in his nimble hands. 
INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT 
EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down at the party.  Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around forty.  He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured by a night's sleep. 
EDWARD (a murmur) Left pocket. 
And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer.  More laughter and applause. 
The study is in keeping with the rest of the house.  Luxurious. Everything the best.  WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary, is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host.  VANCE is an investment banker.  His assistant JAKE, is a financial researcher.  The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS.  They are in dark suits and power ties.  On the table are stacks of documents and folders, the name "KROSS INDUSTRIES" is prominent on many of the folders. 
INVESTMENT BANKER 1 Our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage Harris Enterprises from investing in California. We think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. With the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk. 
VANCE Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this deal. 
STUCKEY (losing patience) This is a "no brainer".  There's no risk for you.  No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris. 
INVESTMENT BANKER 2 Not yet.  But ship building is a new endeavor for you... 
STUCKEY (cuts him off) Come on.  You know we're not going to go into ship building. Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us! 
INVESTMENT BANKER 3 Bill, be reasonable.  If you're really going to digest Kross Industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. Besides, I don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have. 
EDWARD It's unacceptable. 
Edward turns from the window.  He hasn't miss a thing.  All eyes are on him. 
EDWARD Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half.  I can secure the other half personally.  You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer. 
The bankers speechlessly stare at him. 
EDWARD The meeting is over, gentlemen. 
He turns away.  The bankers look at one another.  They rise. Silence as they exit.  When the door closes.  Stuckey explodes with laughter. 
STUCKEY Hah!  Did you see the look on their faces? 
VANCE You don't think we pushed too hard? 
STUCKEY NO way!  They'll come back.  They can't afford not to.  Edward, that bluff was beautiful. 
EDWARD Maybe I should have made it rhyme. 
The others stare at him, uncertain.  Stuckey laughs.  The others follow suit. 
EDWARD (looking at his watch) Well!  It's late.  We've been at this long enough. 
Stuckey rises.  Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door. 
EDWARD Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The magician's wonderful. 
Vance and Jake exit. 
EDWARD (calling after them) Watch your left pocket. 
A BUTLER has entered the room. 
BUTLER Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss Charles. 
STUCKEY Cynthia?  Is she coming out? 
EDWARD We're about to find out.  Go on. Take care of your guests. 
Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone. 
EDWARD (into phone) Where are you, Cynthia? (beat) I see. (pausing, getting angry) No, I don't expect you to be at my beck-and-call.  Are you coming or not? 
INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
Edward descends the long, curved stairway.  He has Vance in tow. 
EDWARD (all business) Prepare the filing papers.  Have them ready by the middle of the week.  I'll tell you when to submit them. 
The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate toward Edward. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT 
The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN, stops.  Edward gets out of the car.  He looks at the street signs.  He has no idea where he is.  He signs.  He gets back in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East. 
EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT 
A crumbling old apartment building.  Dark alley ways, deserted parking lot. 
The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building, looking very out of place on the street. 
PANNING UP  A building facade of lit windows and metal fire escape.  One window in particular.  A GIRL stands there in a short kimono, looking down.  And then she turns away. 
INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing. 
INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
VIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom mirror.  She is twenty years old and a prostitute.  Make-up applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed. She'd be innocently beautiful without it.  She is wearing tiny shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots.  She stares at herself, not really liking what she sees.  A moment.  She signs, turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Faded, peeling walls.  Thread bare, dirty carpet.  Vivian locks the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway. A door suddenly opens, startling her.  An unshaved, enormously pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig eyes. 
LANDLORD Vivian. 
Vivian turns some "tough" on him. 
VIVIAN Yeah, what? 
LANDLORD Rent.  You're late. 
VIVIAN Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash. 
LANDLORD Kit give me nothin'. 
VIVIAN (suddenly uncertain) You bullshittin' me? 
LANDLORD Of rent I do not bullshit. 
Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway. 
LANDLORD By the end of the week or you're otta here. (a beat) By the way, you look very nice tonight! 
INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN 
Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf.  She pulls off the top. It's empty.  She tosses the can away, starts for the door.  She opens it. 
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN.  They both glance up. 
Vivian quickly closes the door.  She doesn't want to deal with them. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk.  She hurried away. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT 
Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone. 
A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself. He wears an "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt. 
Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle in a doorway. 
A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little bags to various STREET-TYPES. 
A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie star.  Some go in. 
Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS. A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her.  A car passes.  The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest.  She ignores him.  The black prostitute approaches the car. 
PROSTITUTE Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date? 
The Driver looks her over.  The Black Prostitute gets in the car and it drives away. 
A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night coffee shop.  They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS as Vivian hurries by.  She ignores them and goes next door into a falafel stand.  Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside. 
INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT 
Behind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the shop. 
VIVIAN Chan, you seen Kit tonight? 
KIT I will.  I'm trying. (a beat) Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high? 
VIVIAN No, let's go to work.  Okay? 
KIT Okay. (then touches her hand) I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT 
Edward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd., finally out of the Hollywood Hills. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT 
Vivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars. Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop.  Kit is talking to another prostitute, RACHEL. 
KIT No no, honey.  You see these stars on the sidewalk.  Me and Vivian work from Don Ameche all the way up to Roy Rogers. This is our office.  We got seniority.  Get off our corner. 
RACHEL I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new. (points to Vivian) 
KIT But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty Hall or Debra Paget where you belong. 
Rachel walks off. 
VIVIAN (looks at passing cars) Looks slow tonight. 
KIT Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and -- 
VIVIAN Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it. 
They keep hustling. 
KIT I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home. 
VIVIAN (stares at her) That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on -- 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - ANGLE ON FERRARI - NIGHT 
KIT (O.S.) (suddenly) Hey, hey -- There's a rent. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - BACK TO SCENE - NIGHT 
VIVIAN He's not gonna want us. 
The Ferrari goes by and stops. 
EDWARD (calls out to Vivian) Excuse me. 
KIT (excited) Don't take less than a hundred. You look hot tonight.  And remember, don't mouth off.  They don't like that. 
VIVIAN Okay.  Go home.  But take it easy on that shit. 
Kit gives Vivian a quick hug. 
KIT You're the greatest.  I'll wait up for you. 
And then Kit is off, moving quickly away.  Vivian turns.  She stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents.  And then it's as if Vivian turns a switch.  She fluffs her mane of hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face. 
In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious and distracted.  Vivian leans over the passenger window. 
VIVIAN Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date? 
EDWARD What's that? 
VIVIAN You looking' for some company? 
EDWARD Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills? 
VIVIAN What? (dropping the come on) You gonna tell me you're lost? 
EDWARD Yes. 
VIVIAN Great.  What do I look like a tourguide? 
Edward takes a good look at her. 
EDWARD (a beat) No, you look like a hooker. 
VIVIAN Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk. 
EDWARD Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? 
VIVIAN Sure.  For five bucks. 
EDWARD That's ridiculous. 
VIVIAN (a moment) If you're making fun of me, I don't like it. 
EDWARD Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to. 
Vivian unconsciously bites her fingernails. 
EDWARD Ugly habit, biting your nails. 
VIVIAN You don't know habits, you think this is ugly. 
But she puts her hands in her lap.  She looks out the window. She's safe from Carlos. 
VIVIAN Okay, pull over.  Let me out. I've got to get back to work. 
Edward pulls the Ferrari to the curb and stops. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) Stay on this street and you'll hit Beverly Hills. 
EDWARD What do you charge for company, Vivian? 
VIVIAN Company would cost you... a hundred dollars. 
EDWARD For the whole night? 
VIVIAN For an hour. 
EDWARD You're joking. 
VIVIAN I never joke about money. 
EDWARD Neither do I. (a moment; amused) A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff. 
She reaches across the seat.  Her hand goes in his lap. 
VIVIAN No, but it's getting there. 
EDWARD Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night? 
VIVIAN You couldn't afford it. 
Vivian starts to get out of the car. 
EDWARD Try me. 
A moment.  Vivian's sexy smile comes on. 
VIVIAN Three hundred. 
EDWARD Fine. 
VIVIAN What's your name, lover. 
EDWARD Edward.  My name is Edward. 
VIVIAN Edward... you got it! 
Edward gets out of the car.  Vivian looks at him confused. 
EDWARD Get in.  This side. 
VIVIAN What? 
EDWARD You know how to drive a stick? 
Vivian moves around the car. 
VIVIAN Better believe it. 
EDWARD Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive. 
They get in the car. 
INT. FERRARI - NIGHT 
She starts the car, revs it. 
VIVIAN Here we go Edward. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT 
The Ferrari peels out, fishtails madly and SCREAMS up the street. 
EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT 
EDWARD Fair enough. 
He rises.  Takes out his wallet.  Standing over her, he drops THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap.  She picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed. She puts the money in her jacket.  She realizes Edward is standing over her as if waiting. 
She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants.  He abruptly turns away. 
EDWARD Let's talk some more first. 
VIVIAN Right. (brightly) So!  In town on business? 
EDWARD (taking off his jacket) Uh-huh. 
VIVIAN Let me guess, you're a... lawyer. 
EDWARD (loosening his tie) And why do you say that? 
VIVIAN (a small smile) I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look. 
Edward almost smiles.  He sits across from her again. 
EDWARD Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers. 
VIVIAN I've known a lot of everybody. 
A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door. 
EDWARD Champagne. 
He starts to sit up.  Vivian motions for him to stay put. 
VIVIAN Hey.  I might as well make myself useful. 
Edward sits back down.  Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door.  A WAITER comes into the room with a silver cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl. 
WAITER Where would you like it? 
VIVIAN Where would we like it? 
EDWARD Where would we like it?  Here'll be fine. 
The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of the living room.  He turns and heads back up the stairs and pauses near Vivian, staring.  Vivian stares back at him. 
VIVIAN What are you looking at? 
The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits.  Vivian closes the door behind him.  Vivian marches back down the stairs. 
EDWARD I think he wanted you to tip him. 
VIVIAN Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred. 
Edward crosses to the silver stand.  Vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) You have a wife?  Girlfriend? 
EDWARD I have both. 
Edward lifts the bottle out.  He deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop of champagne. 
VIVIAN Where are they?  Shopping together? 
EDWARD They should be.  They're both good at it. 
Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to Vivian. 
EDWARD (cont'd) My ex-wife lives in London in what used to be my home. My girlfriend is in New York moving out of my apartment even as we speak.  Cheers. 
He drinks, nods approvingly. 
EDWARD It's a very good year. 
VIVIAN Oooh, thank god. 
Edward laughs softly.  She sips it.  To her surprise, really likes it.  Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries. 
EDWARD Try a strawberry. 
VIVIAN Why? 
EDWARD Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne. 
VIVIAN Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club. 
EDWARD Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate. 
Edward hangs up.  He pours a glass of orange juice and takes a sip, thinking.  Something makes him turn.  Vivian, wearing a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the bedroom doorway. 
EDWARD Good morning. 
VIVIAN You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute. 
EDWARD No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast? 
She's hungry and the breakfast looks great. 
VIVIAN Only if you do. 
Edward sits.  Waits.  Vivian sits across from him.  Edward serves them breakfast. 
EDWARD Did you sleep well? 
VIVIAN Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was. 
EDWARD Occupational hazard? 
She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense, relaxes. 
VIVIAN Where'd you go? 
EDWARD I took the couch.  I had some work to do. (hesitating) About last night... 
VIVIAN Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself. 
EDWARD Mmm, I could tell. 
VIVIAN I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks. 
EDWARD I'd say you give a good dollar value. 
They share a small smile.  They eat. 
EDWARD Do you ever... enjoy it? 
VIVIAN I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm. 
EDWARD No?  Why's that? 
VIVIAN "Occupational hazard". 
A moment.  Edward chuckles.  Vivian grins. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) what do you do anyway? 
EDWARD I buy companies. 
VIVIAN No shit.  They expensive? 
He almost smiles.  She almost smiles back. 
EDWARD The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million. 
VIVIAN ... dollars? 
He nods.  This time Vivian is impressed. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) You are major league, baby.  Your mother must be very proud. 
Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction. 
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY 
The closet door is open.  Edward reaches for a tie.  In the closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes, etc.  She follows him in. 
VIVIAN So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm? 
EDWARD (fumbling with the tie) I sell them. 
VIVIAN What?  Why? 
She undoes his knot and starts over. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) At ease, let me do that.  Part of the all night services. 
EDWARD By breaking up a company's assets 
VIVIAN What are assets? 
EDWARD Vivian -- 
EDWARD Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500. 
VIVIAN But you want days too. 
EDWARD All right, two thousand. 
VIVIAN Three. 
EDWARD Done. 
VIVIAN Holy shit. 
And then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on the sexy smile. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) Sugar, you got it.  I will treat you like a prince.  Anything, anyway you want. 
EDWARD I'm not just talking about sex. 
VIVIAN Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay? 
EDWARD Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go. 
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING 
Edward comes out into the bedroom.  Vivian quickly follows. They move through the bedroom into the living room. 
EDWARD I'll be out most of the day. 
He reaches into his pocket for a money clip.  He peels off bills.  He hands the cash to Vivian. 
EDWARD I want you to go out and buy some decent clothes. 
Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money. 
EDWARD Nothing too flashy, not too sexy. Conservative.  Understand? 
INT. PENTHOUSE ENTRANCE WAY - DAY 
They're at the front door. 
VIVIAN Yeah, you want me to dress like your high class girlfriend. You're wasting your money though. All I'm gonna do is hang around the hotel.  As a matter of fact, I may never get out of that bathtub. 
Edward opens the door, he starts to exit.  He turns back. 
EDWARD Think again.  I'm taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight. 
The door closes in her face. 
INT. OUTSIDE THE PENTHOUSE DOOR - DAY 
VIVIAN (O.S.) (from inside) What?  Are you crazy? 
Edward smiles to himself. 
EDWARD Probably. 
INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY 
Vivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath.  The TV is on. She clicks the remote control in her hand. 
VIVIAN Three thousand... 
She lies back into the soapy water and disappears.  She suddenly pops back up, laughing. 
VIVIAN Three thousand! 
A thought occurs to her.  She reaches for the cordless phone. She dials.  She waits.  She is about to disconnect when the phone is answered. 
KIT (O.S.) 'Lo. 
VIVIAN Kit!  Where've you been? 
KIT (O.S.) I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay? 
VIVIAN Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything! (silence) Kit?  Hey, you there? 
KIT (O.S.) Why'd he want you? 
That hurts.  Perhaps because Vivian's been wondering the same thing. 
VIVIAN He... he just does. 
KIT (O.S.) I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back. (a beat) Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'? 
MR. THOMAS And who is that? 
VIVIAN I... Edward... 
Vivian's face is filled with confusion.  She doesn't know his name.  The elevator doors open behind them.  She spots the Operator. 
VIVIAN (blurting it out) He knows me. 
Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously.  The Operator looks back at them innocently.  With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas waves the Operator over. 
MR. THOMAS Do you know this young lady? 
The Operator nods. 
OPERATOR She's with Mr. Harris. 
MR. THOMAS (surprised) Mr. Harris? 
OPERATOR She apparently joined him last night. 
Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away. 
MR. THOMAS Why don't you come with me.  We'll chat for just a moment. 
He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off. 
INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY 
In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk. 
MR. THOMAS What's your name? 
VIVIAN Vivian. 
MR. THOMAS Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
Vivian says nothing. 
MR. THOMAS (cont'd) Mr. Harris, however, is a very special customer.  And we like to think of our special customers as friends.  As a customer, we would expect Mr. Harris to sign in any additional guests.  But as a friend, we're willing to overlook it, I'm assuming you're a... relative? 
Vivian finds herself nodding. 
MR. THOMAS (cont'd) I thought so.  You must be his...? 
VIVIAN Niece? 
MR. THOMAS Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. 
Vivian bites her lower lip, nods. 
MR. THOMAS (cont'd) Good.  We understand one another. (as a gentle afterthought:) I would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner. 
Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry. 
VIVIAN That's what I was trying to do. 
She can't help it, the tears come.  Vivian pulls out the money Edward gave her.  She drops it on the desk.  It's a moist- looking wad now. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) I was trying to get some other clothes... but... they wouldn't... they made me feel like shit... 
She can't go on.  Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money. He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her.  He sighs. He picks up the phone.  He dials. 
MR. THOMAS (into the phone) Women's clothing. (beat) Bridget, please. 
Vivian is staring at him. 
MR. THOMAS (cont'd) Bridget, hello, this is Barnard Thomas over at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.  Well, thank you, that's flattering.  I'd like to ask a favor of you.  I'm going to send someone over.  Her name is Vivian. She's a guest of ours.  A very special guest. 
He glances at Vivian.  With those simple words, he'd made her feel better. 
MR. THOMAS (cont'd) She's from out of town and she needs a little help in dressing. Perhaps you could help her out. Thank you very much.  She'll be right over. 
He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian. 
MR. THOMAS (cont'd) There you are.  If you have any other problems, come ask for me personally.  I'm Mr. Thomas. 
VIVIAN Barney. 
She smiles mischievously. 
EXT. FORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY 
A sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port. 
Bridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes.  She pulls out a dress. 
BRIDGET Your uncle will like this. 
VIVIAN He's not really my uncle. 
BRIDGET They never are, dear. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON 
Mr. Thomas is behind the desk.  He looks up.  Vivian is standing there, a happy look on her face.  She holds up a garment bag. 
VIVIAN I got a dress. 
MR. THOMAS (dryly) I rather hoped you'd be wearing it. 
VIVIAN I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see? 
MR. THOMAS That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely. 
VIVIAN They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney. 
Mr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity. 
MR. THOMAS You're very welcome, Miss Vivian. 
She smiles at him.  He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward the elevator.  The provocative way her hips move just naturally attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY.  And the white gloved ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile.  Mr. Thomas sighs. 
INT. PENTHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The phone is ringing Vivian enters.  She hurries to pick it up. 
VIVIAN Hello? 
The phone keeps ringing -- it has more than one line.  Vivian frantically punches buttons. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) Hello?  What?  Hello? 
INT. STUCKEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON - INTERCUT 
Edward is in a private office. 
EDWARD Never answer the phone.  Ever. 
VIVIAN Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time. 
EDWARD Did you buy some clothes? 
VIVIAN I got a dress, yeah. 
EDWARD Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate. 
VIVIAN It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch. (silence) I'm -- joking. 
EDWARD Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it? 
VIVIAN No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date. 
EDWARD This isn't a date. 
VIVIAN Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway? 
EDWARD The Rex. 
VIVIAN Any good? 
EDWARD I think you'll approve. 
VIVIAN ... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to. 
EDWARD Thank you very much. 
Vivian slowly sets the phone down.  The phone rings again. Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing button and picks it up. 
VIVIAN Hello? 
EDWARD I thought I told you not to answer the phone. 
VIVIAN Oooh! 
Edward hangs up.  He smiles to himself. 
Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous.  The doorbell RINGS.  Vivian looks up, startled.  She rises, moves to answer it. 
VIVIAN What if they serve soup? 
MR. THOMAS They will serve salad. 
VIVIAN But what if they serve soup? 
MR. THOMAS Then you use your soup spoon. 
VIVIAN (smiles) I like steak. 
MR. THOMAS (picking up the appropriate utensil) Then you would use your-- 
VIVIAN Steak spoon! (laughs) 
Mr. Thomas swallows his exasperation. 
WE PULL BACK from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner service. 
MR. THOMAS Miss Vivian -- 
VIVIAN Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands. 
MR. THOMAS Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead? 
VIVIAN Professionally? 
INT. SALON - LATE AFTERNOON 
Vivian sits in a salon chair.  The last customer, THANE, a young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her professionally. 
VIVIAN I have a friend who has a friend who does Cher's wigs. 
THANE I hate him already. (a beat) All set? 
VIVIAN Yeah... what a ya say we chop it all off and bleach the tips. 
THANE Darling?  Trust me. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING 
Edward enters and looks around the lobby.  No Vivian.  Annoyed. Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up.  He's about to dial when: 
MR. THOMAS Good evening, Mr. Harris. 
Edward looks at him blankly. 
MR. THOMAS Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel. 
EDWARD Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment -- 
MR. THOMAS I have a message for you from your "niece", sir. 
EDWARD My what? 
MR. THOMAS The young lady staying in your room? 
Edward's eyes narrow.  He hangs up the phone. 
EDWARD I think we both know she's not my niece. 
Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable. 
EDWARD (cont'd) Does this hotel have any problem with that? 
MR. THOMAS Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge. 
EDWARD Thank you. 
He starts towards the lounge. 
MR. THOMAS Very intriguing young woman, Miss Vivian. 
His tone stops Edward in his tracks. 
MR. THOMAS (cont'd) Have a good evening, sir. 
And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell transpired during the afternoon. 
INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Edward enters the lounge.  He looks around, not seeing Vivian. And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress at the piano bar.  Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian rises, moves elegantly towards him.  She smiles. 
VIVIAN You're late. 
VANCE Kross came out of his corner swinging.  He started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened. 
EDWARD (almost to himself) He's a tough old son of a bitch... 
Edward is watching Vivian.  She pulls the hem of her skirt up to mid thigh.  She looks hopefully over to Edward.  Edward shakes his head. 
VANCE It's up to ten and a quarter. 
EDWARD Offer nine and a half.  Bring them back down to earth. 
STUCKEY Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight? 
EDWARD Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away. 
STUCKEY Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry. 
There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes.  He watches as Vivian tries on a hat.  She preens for him.  He smiles. 
EDWARD (to Vance & Stuckey) Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise. 
STUCKEY (surprised) We're letting them slide? 
EDWARD I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now. 
STUCKEY But, Edward... 
EDWARD Do it. 
Edward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian.  She moves to him. 
EDWARD (looks at his watch) You're on your own now, Vivian. I've got to get to work.  Be sensible and you can keep everything.  Spend too much and it all goes back. 
Vivian hugs him again. 
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY 
Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive.  She looks lovely in the pink dress and new, white shoes.  A pretty, white hat is the final touch.  She carries a bag containing her old clothes.  She stops at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away. 
INT. TORIE STEELE BOUTIQUE - SHOPPING MONTAGE 
We SEES Vivian in each department within the store with different SALESPEOPLE.  She happily and confidently tries on a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc. 
1)  Vivian is in a dressing stall.  She tosses a dress out to a waiting SALESWOMAN. 
VIVIAN Not me! 
2)  A SALESWOMAN holds a long, purple evening gown. 
VIVIAN (imitating Bridget) Horrid! 
3)  Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps. Her attention is drawn to the SALESMEN'S exotic hand-painted tie. 
VIVIAN Where'd you get your tie? 
4)  Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over his outstretched arm.  Vivian picks out the brightest one and smiles. 
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY 
Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags.  She feels like she owns the block.  A well-dressed MAN passes by, smiling politely.  Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores him. 
Suddenly Vivian stops.  She's about to pass the shop she was thrown out of.  Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop. 
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY 
Vivian enters.  The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's courage leaves her. 
The saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER. 
SALESWOMAN (to the customer) Isn't this lovely?  I think it would look wonderful on you. 
Vivian musters her courage.  She takes a deep breath and starts forward. 
SALESWOMAN (to her customer) Would you like to try it on? 
VIVIAN 'Scume me. 
Both the saleswoman and her customer look up.  The saleswoman smiles pleasantly. 
SALESWOMAN Yes? 
VIVIAN Do you remember me? 
SALESWOMAN No, I'm sorry, I don't. 
DAVID Thunder's a horse.  Come on. 
EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON 
They approach the sweating mount.  David Kross caresses the horses muzzle. 
DAVID Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian. (a beat; and then:) You two been together long?  You and Edward? 
VIVIAN No. 
DAVID Hope to be? 
To Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside. 
VIVIAN It's... it's not like that. 
DAVID I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then. 
Vivian is suddenly silent.  She looks away. 
DAVID (cont'd) I'm sorry, am I being too forward? 
VIVIAN You don't know anything about me. 
DAVID I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch. 
But something holds Vivian back, a feeling. 
EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - IN THE CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON 
William Stuckey turns... stops... stares.  He sees Vivian and David Kross standing together.  He stares, his mind racing, and anxious, angry look on his face. 
EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON 
Stuckey has Edward off to the side.  He is talking to him in a low, earnest voice. 
STUCKEY Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet? 
EDWARD We just did. 
STUCKEY (grinning) Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this. 
EDWARD The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions. 
STUCKEY And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work? 
EDWARD Yes... 
STUCKEY Doing what? 
EDWARD Vivian's in sales. 
STUCKEY Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell? 
Edward's eyes narrow. 
EDWARD Why do you want to know? 
STUCKEY Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross. 
EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN 
Vivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of champagne.  She scans the crowd for Edward. 
EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON EDWARD AND STUCKEY 
EDWARD She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie. 
STUCKEY So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient. 
EDWARD You're being ridiculous. 
STUCKEY Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information? 
EDWARD Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard. 
EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN 
as she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER.  She turns.  She sees that it's Stuckey laughing.  Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with two glasses of champagne. 
EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON STUCKEY AND EDWARD 
STUCKEY I swear to God, you are the only millionaire I ever heard of who'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker! 
Vivian stands quietly for a moment.  And then she turns and walks into the bedroom. 
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of the bedroom.  As she does she starts crying.  With each item of clothing the tears come down harder.  Edward appears at the doorway.  His face is genuinely concerned. 
EDWARD Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you. 
VIVIAN I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off. 
EDWARD I really am sorry. 
Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms.  Sobbing, she stands limply. 
VIVIAN You hurt me. 
Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders. She touches his hand.  He sits on the bed.  He pulls her to him and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight. 
EDWARD I'll make it up to you. 
INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY 
Edward, carrying a briefcase, moves jauntily down a long hallway.  Stuckey trails after him. 
STUCKEY This is no time to disappear. We're in too far. 
EDWARD Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow. 
STUCKEY Promise me you'll read those contracts by then. 
EDWARD Goodbye, Bill. 
Stuckey stops.  He calls after Edward. 
STUCKEY Shit... By tomorrow, Edward! 
Edward hurries on. 
EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY 
Edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
Edward smiles, moving jauntily to the elevators.  Mr. Thomas at the front desk notices Edward's happy mood. 
MR. THOMAS Good afternoon, Mr. Harris. 
EDWARD Afternoon. 
Edward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display in the hotel jewelry store window.  He detours from the elevators and moves to the window for a closer look.  He thinks a moment and enters the jewelry store. 
INT. PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing an elegant red sequined evening dress.  She looks incredibly beautiful.  She sees the phone.  A thought occurs to her and going to it, she picks it up.  Waits. 
VIVIAN C'mon, Kit... 
No answer.  She hears someone at the door.  She hangs up. Edward enters.  He is carrying a small case.  He stops at the sight of Vivian. 
VIVIAN Do I look okay? 
EDWARD (a small smile) Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing. 
He holds up the small case. 
VIVIAN What's that? 
EDWARD I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however... 
Vivian's jaw drops.  Edward is holding a diamond and ruby necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he breathed too hard.  Edward behind Vivian, fastens the necklace around her neck. 
EDWARD This is made for a princess. I think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight.  There. Come look. 
He leads her to a mirror.  She stares at her reflection. 
VIVIAN Edward, I can't. 
EDWARD Shush.  Of course you can. 
VIVIAN What if I lose it? 
EDWARD You won't. 
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT 
Edward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through the elegant lobby. 
EDWARD Some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but I don't believe it.  You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time.  They either love it or hate it.  Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it. 
Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit fountain with several graceful statues in its center. Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and prosperous looking MEN.  It makes her nervous.  Without realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace. She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and steal it. 
EDWARD Viv?  I really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it. 
Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands. 
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 
A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their seats.  Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative glances from the MEN.  Her hands again rises nervously to her necklace. 
EDWARD They all think you look very beautiful, Vivian. 
Vivian gives him a grateful look.  Relaxing, she lowers her hand from the necklace.  With a flourish, he offers his arm.  She takes it.  They start forward. 
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT 
Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the stage. 
VIVIAN If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying? 
EDWARD I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words. 
VIVIAN But don't they have it in English? 
EDWARD Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it. 
The lights dim. 
VIVIAN (resigned) Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm glad you brought me. 
The orchestra begins to play.  Vivian's eyes focus intensely on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her. 
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT 
IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed. 
The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face.  Edward leans over to translate the tenor's aria. 
EDWARD What am I?  I am a poet.  Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams.  You have come to replace my vanished dreams.  I dwell now only in your eyes. 
The MUSIC ebbs and swells.  The sets and costumes change.  The story continues. 
Edward again leans close to Vivian. 
EDWARD And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful -- 
Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth.  Her eyes are fixed on the stage.  She doesn't need his help. 
The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is reaching its tragic climax.  Her lips tremble.  Her eyes fill with tears.  Edward glances at her.  He studies her a long moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face. Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand. 
As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it. 
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT 
As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined mascara.  She sighs, happy.  The WOMEN in the next box smile at her. 
OLDER WOMAN Did you enjoy the opera, dear? 
VIVIAN (tearfully) It was so beautiful I just about pissed my pants. 
Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he and the still misty Vivian exit. 
INT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATER 
Edward and Vivian sit side by side. 
EDWARD If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you. 
VIVIAN I more than liked it. 
EDWARD I know.  I'm glad. 
VIVIAN Did you? 
EDWARD Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you. 
Vivian looks at him a moment.  And then, leaning slowly forward she kisses him gently on the mouth.  He looks at her surprise. He puts his arms around her and kisses her back.  It is the first time they've kissed and they make it very special. 
EDWARD (cont'd) What is it? 
VIVIAN (not unkindly) What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town? 
EDWARD It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that? 
VIVIAN I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it... 
She is silent. 
EDWARD Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution. 
VIVIAN (shakes her head "no," then continues tying his tie) When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo." 
She finished his tie. 
EDWARD Vivian, life's not a fairy tale. 
VIVIAN (softly; to herself) I know. (a beat) Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid. (more) I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore. 
EDWARD I've never treated you like a whore. 
VIVIAN (not mean) You just did. 
The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room. 
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Edward enters the living room.  Vivian slowly enters behind him.  Edward opens the front door.  Mr. Kross slowly enters. He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask his surprise. 
KROSS Mr. Harris. 
EDWARD How are you, Mr. Kross. 
KROSS Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it. 
An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father. Stuckey brings up the rear.  Edward and David give one another perfunctory nod.  Stuckey smugly winks at Edward.  Edward closes the door and leads them all down the stairs. 
Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance.  He gently nods at Vivian. 
KROSS Young lady. 
VIVIAN Hello. (to David) Hi. 
DAVID Hello, Vivian. 
STUCKEY Let's not waste time here, shall we?  Mr. Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now listening. 
Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone.  He turns to Edward. 
KROSS Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer. 
EDWARD Expected... offer. 
KROSS Of course, yes.  After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid. 
EDWARD (a moment) You're making the right decision, sir. 
Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward.  He is surprised to see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face. Edward is silent.  Kross interprets his silence as second thoughts. 
KROSS I'll see you on one condition. I'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me... 
Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man. 
STUCKEY (quickly) They'll be taken care of.  Won't they, Edward? 
Kross ignores Stuckey.  He looks to Edward.  Edward slowly nods. 
KROSS I'll sign anything you want then. 
STUCKEY Today. 
Kross nods tiredly.  His voice is very soft. 
KROSS Today. 
Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom, obviously upset.  The men all watch her go.  Edward hesitates. He turns to Kross: 
EDWARD Excuse me, please? 
He heads to the bedroom. 
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY 
VIVIAN Kit... 
KIT Everybody keeps starin' at me. 
VIVIAN Yeah... I know what you mean. 
KIT What do you know?  You look good. All dressed up. (meaning it) You clean up real nice. (giggling) You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway. 
VIVIAN You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you? 
KIT Where do you fit? 
Vivian is silent, then. 
VIVIAN (suddenly) I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth. 
KIT Honey, you're not supposed to do that. 
VIVIAN I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real. 
KIT Oh, my god, you mean it was good? 
VIVIAN (miserably) It was great. 
KIT Dummy. 
VIVIAN He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money. 
KIT I pray for that. 
VIVIAN (nods) All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit? 
KIT Go for the bucks. 
VIVIAN I don't care about bucks. (a beat) I might love this guy. 
KIT Wow, are you in deep shit. (a sigh) You know he'll break your heart. 
Vivian is silent again. 
KIT (cont'd) I blame myself here.  First time I laid eyes on ya', I knew you were too complicated to be a whore. 
Vivian nods.  Her face is filled with confusion. 
INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Edward stands at the window looking out.  There is something about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of the story. 
Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm.  He begins laying them out on the conference table. 
JAKE Congratulations, sir. 
EDWARD What? 
JAKE Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won. 
Edward says nothing. 
JAKE Who are you going after next, sir? 
EDWARD Who indeed... 
He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter the room.  They surround a conference table.  Kross sits, the papers laid out in front of him.  Stuckey hands Kross a pen. A SECRETARY lays out finger food.  They wait for her to leave before they speak. 
STUCKEY If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about your company. 
DAVID Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate.  You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all. 
KROSS Could we at least wait till after the filing period? 
Stuckey glances to Edward for help.  Edward is silent; indeed it's as if something is twisting inside of him.  Stuckey plunges ahead. 
STUCKEY Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth.  The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid.  The more we know, the higher our bid can be. 
KROSS It's in my best interest to cooperate, David. 
DAVID If he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh? 
David stares at him. 
STUCKEY That's unfair! 
DAVID You bed it is. (to Edward) You're everything he said you were. (to his father) Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don't expect me to watch it. 
There is a bar set up.  Stuckey sets his briefcase down.  He crosses to the bar. 
STUCKEY (cont'd) Mind if I have a drink? 
VIVIAN No. 
He pours liquor in a glass.  He fires it down.  It seems to calm him a bit. 
STUCKEY Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why? (pours another drink) What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities. 
VIVIAN I think it's great. 
Stuckey glares at Vivian. 
STUCKEY I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal. 
VIVIAN (mocking) Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business. 
He looks at her a moment. 
STUCKEY But what do I know, maybe you're worth it.  Come on, show me. Let's see your act. 
He grabs her wrist. 
VIVIAN Get out! 
STUCKEY Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are you a fifty dollar whore? 
He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top of him. 
VIVIAN Are you crazy? 
She bites his hand.  Stuckey slaps her.  Vivian starts flailing back.  But Stuckey is too strong.  Vivian staggers back at the force of another slap.  Stuckey slams her up against a wall and starts rubbing up against her. 
STUCKEY You got a mean streak in you, don't you. 
He tries to kiss her again. 
STUCKEY (cont'd) Is that what he likes about you? Huh?  Answer me! 
And suddenly a HAND lands on Stuckey's shoulder.  Stuckey turns his head, startled. 
INT. PENTHOUSE - REVERSE ANGLE - STUCKEY'S P.O.V. 
Edward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room. 
INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE 
Stuckey falls on the ground.  Edward rushes forward, berserk with rage, to hit Stuckey again.  His fist hits the top of Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull. 
Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom.  Again Stuckey tries to rise.  Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into the bar.  Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor.  Stuckey again tries to rise.  And collapses.  Edward rubs his fist.  They're not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting. 
STUCKEY You broke my nose. 
EDWARD I think I broke my hand. (a beat) You're fired. 
STUCKEY Edward, we've been together ten years. 
EDWARD And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole! 
STUCKEY All this because of that whore! 
EDWARD Yes. 
Edward pushes Stuckey out the door and throws his briefcase after him. 
STUCKEY Edward, think about what you're 
Edward slams the door in his face.  Edward stands there, reflecting on what he's done. 
EDWARD (to himself, almost proud) Well, I didn't plan that! 
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
Edward holds an icepack to Vivian's cheek. 
VIVIAN Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off! 
EDWARD Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore. 
VIVIAN Right. (softening) You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? (a beat) I heard what you did with Kross. 
EDWARD It was a business decision.

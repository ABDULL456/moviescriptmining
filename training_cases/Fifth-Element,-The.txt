FADE IN: 
1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY 
Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert. 
CREDITS  ROLL 
WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913 
OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes. 
2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY 
The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light into the temple. Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside the temple. 
3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY 
Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last mirror which shines light into the expansive room. 
PROFESSOR (deciphering) "..when the three planets are in eclipse.." 
His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers. 
PROFESSOR "..the black hole like a door is open... Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..." See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil ... make sure you get the snake! 
The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil, coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U. Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist. 
BILLY And when is this door opening snake act supposed to occur? 
The Professor's fingers touch the signs. 
PROFESSOR ..if this is the five..and this the thousand.. 
He calculates. 
PROFESSOR Every five thousand years.. 
BILLY (kidding) So I have some time.. 
He reaches for the pad. 
ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock. 
PRIEST I will take it to them my son. 
Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest. 
PRIEST Go with God.. be safe from Evil.. 
The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing him. As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor. 
ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching. 
PROFESSOR "..then arrange the elements of life against the Terror just so.." 
His fingers run on. 
PROFESSOR "..Water..fire..earth..air..four elements around the fifth.." 
His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by all the others. 
The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into the skin. 
ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails. 
PROFESSOR Aziz!  Light! 
The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up. 
PRIEST Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much.. 
PROFESSOR "..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.." 
PRIEST (V.O.) Amen.. 
The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup from the skin. 
PROFESSOR Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications. 
PRIEST Only too well... here you must be parched.. 
He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost to his lips when.. 
PROFESSOR I mean look.. it is like a battle plan.. 
In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin. 
PROFESSOR Here the Good.. Here the Evil.. 
Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake. 
13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY 
The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious stones in it, one by one. 
PRIEST (moved) Will the elements be gone now forever from this place? 
KOMMANDER When mankind comes to its senses. We will return. 
PRIEST Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries! 
KOMMANDER Time is of no importance, only life is important. 
The Priest nods and lowers his eyes. 
Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his eyes to focus.. 
A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the case and looks at the Priest. 
KOMMANDER When EVIL returns so shall we. 
PRIEST (head lowered) We will be ready, Lord. 
Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun. 
BILLY Stop. 
Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun. 
PRIEST No!!!  Don't!!! 
The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander. The WARRIORS are in a panic. 
CLERK Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!! 
The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast room fills up like an hourglass. 
KOMMANDER A mission is a mission, Savoia. You'll learn that. 
The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get through it.  His armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and the case through. 
KOMMANDER My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife.. 
The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs through the huge piles of sand. 
14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY 
The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner, frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings. 
15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY 
The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried. 
16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY 
The huge ship's main hatch closes. 
17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY 
The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping at the ship as it vanishes in the sky. 
18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS 
A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids. 
19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT 
The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos. 
WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER 
Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging to the Federal Army. 
20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM 
CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse. 
STAEDERT Don't you have anything?  Not even a temperature? 
CAPTAIN The thermo-analyzers have jammed. One of them reads over a million degrees, the other's at minus 5000... Never seen anything like it. 
TECHNICIAN It's taking shape. 
21	EXT.  SPACE 
In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened. Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color. 
CAPTAIN (in awe) What the hell can it be? 
TECHNICIAN Hook-up with the president in one minute, General. 
General Staedert remains calm. 
STAEDERT ...Send out a probe. 
22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN 
LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office. There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear. 
All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases. A black crust immediately covers it. 
29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
SCIENTIST (consulting new data) Its structure has just solidified on the surface, as if the object felt something.  If that's the case, we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence. 
CORNELIUS The most terrible intelligence imaginable, Mr. President. 
The President hesitates. 
CAPTAIN ...The ship is in combat formation. The missile is loaded, General. 
PRESIDENT (uneasy) Staedert?  Give me a minute... I have a doubt. 
STAEDERT (cold) I don't, Mr. President. 
30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP 
The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water. Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger. 
31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
Staedert looks worried. 
STAEDERT Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum shield protection. 
CAPTAIN Yes, Sir. 
The President is growing ever more worried. 
PRESIDENT Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it? 
STAEDERT I'm about to, Mr. President. 
32	EXT.  SPACESHIP 
A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all. And literally doubles in size. 
SCIENTIST The planet's diameter has greatly increased and it's moving toward the ship. 
PRESIDENT Staedert?  Get out of there immediately! I don't want an incident, do you hear me, Staedert? 
STAEDERT (worried) ...What do we have that's bigger than 240? 
CAPTAIN Nothing, General. 
PRESIDENT Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order! 
A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows Staedert's spaceship. 
STAEDERT (eyes wide) ... Good God! 
The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that.... 
33	INT.  APARTMENT 
... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built, unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there. The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone that is ringing. 
KORBEN (to the cat) I'm coming. 
He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the bed makes itself automatically. 
KORBEN (on the phone) Yeah? 
FINGER (V.O.) Hey bud! Finger here. 
He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection. 
KORBEN 
(to the cat) Hi sweetie! 
...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas 
FINGER (V.O.) I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training. 
KORBEN I was talking to the cat. 
FINGER (V.O.) Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing. 
...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day. 
KORBEN At least, the cat comes back. 
FINGER (V.O.) (ironical) You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there. 
KORBEN I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one. 
FINGER (V.O.) Don't exist bud. 
...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter. 
KORBEN I just found a picture of you. 
FINGER (V.O.) How do I look? 
KORBEN Like shit. 
Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of GEMINI croquettes. On the packet is an ad: WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE. 
The huge ship is badly hit and immediately swerves oft course. Panic aboard the MONDOSHAWAN ship. 
46	INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP 
CAPTAIN We've been hit! General alert!!! 
Blast after blast hits the defenseless ship. 
CAPTAIN We're losing control! We have to land fast! 
The huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet, taking hit after hit. 
CAPTAIN Send out a distress signal!!! Activate the emergency landing procedure! 
The huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed. 
FIRST OFFICER Impact in less than ten seconds! 
The red planet looms ever closer. 
CAPTAIN Time is of no importance... 
The ship crashes in a gigantic explosion. 
46A	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY 
A thermo nuclear explosion fills a T.V. screen..Which Korben's cat watches with interest. 
Korben is about to exit the apartment. 
KORBEN Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your mind. Bye sweetie.. 
In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face. 
MUGGER The cash man! 
KORBEN Been here long? 
MUGGER Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow! 
Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon. 
KORBEN Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model? 
MUGGER (off balance) Uh.. 
KORBEN You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded.. 
The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon. 
MUGGER It's not? 
KORBEN You gotta push the little yellow button... 
Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his advice. 
MUGGER Thanks.. 
KORBEN You're welcome.. 
And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun. 
KORBEN ..you know these things are VERY illegal.. you could get in a shit load of trouble.. I better hang onto it for you.. 
As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers to his feet and runs off. 
Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches a nuclear holocaust on T.V.,  uninterrupted. 
46B	INT.  KORBEN'S  GARAGE - DAY 
Korben enters his taxi.  A robotic voice greets him. 
VOICE Please enter your license.. 
Korben complies, and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash. 
VOICE Welcome on board Mr. Dallas.. 
KORBEN How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't. 
Korben hits a button.  The garage door starts to open. 
VOICE Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4... 
KORBEN I had the worst goddamn nightmare. 
VOICE You have nine points left on your license.. 
KORBEN Thanks for reminding me.. 
As the garage door lifts, the Megalopolis that is New York City in the 23rd century comes into view.  Startling in it's height, and breath. 
VOICE Have a nice day.. 
Korben lets the propulsion build. 
KORBEN Right.. 
He lets the gear slip.  The taxi rockets off into the City. 
MACTILBURGH (with a smile) I told you ... perfect! 
Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty. 
MUNRO ...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the archives before she wakes up. 
Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes everywhere looking for the case she was holding. 
GIRL (very angry) Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla. Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa! Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno! 
MUNRO (worried) What's she saying? 
MACTILBURGH (to his ASSISTANT) Activate the phonic detector. 
The girl kicks the window repeatedly. 
MACTILBURGH And give her a light sedative... and something to wear! 
The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly. Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with undisguised pleasure. 
MUNRO (to Mactilburgh) This thing solid? 
MACTILBURGH (smiling) An elephant couldn't crack it. 
The Girl finishes dressing. 
GIRL (angrily) Teno akta chataman assin-omekta! 
Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window. 
MUNRO (with a smile) You're gonna have to learn to communicate better than that angel if you want out. 
Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her. She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He sets off a general alarm. 
54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY 
The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it. 
CHIEF Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you go through the main ventilation! 
55	INT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORY 
The girl moves along unable to see what's ahead of her. She comes to a dead-end, a grill that leads outside.  She pushes it out and exits onto the ledge. 
56	EXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWN 
She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height. The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void. 
CHIEF (to his men) Go on follow her! 
The COPS stare into the gaping void. 
COP ...No way. 
The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens blaring. 
VOICE (O.S.) This in the police.  Your status is illegal. Please put up your hands and follow our instructions! 
The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives off. 
57	INT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHT 
COP (in the car.) Christ! She dove off! 
In a panic, the COP makes a wrong turn.  The girl falls for several seconds. She lands on the roof of a flying cab. 
58	INT.  CAB - NIGHT 
Korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact. 
VOICE (O.S.) You have just had an accident. Seven points have been temporarily removed... 
Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side. 
VOICE / KORBEN You have one point left on your license. Have a good day. 
Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up. There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown. 
GIRL Akina delutan, nou-shan. 
KORBEN (lost) ...'Scuse me? 
A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben. 
COP (over a loudspeaker) You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle.  We are going to arrest her. Please leave your hands on the wheel. Thank you for your cooperation. 
KORBEN (obeying) Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left on my license and I gotta get to the garage! 
The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in her eyes, she looks exhausted. Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around to find something to help her communicate with him. 
Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots to Korben a look of pure distress. 
GIRL (irresistible) Please... HELP... 
Korben can't resist her plea. 
KORBEN Don't put me in this position... I can't... I'm late as it is... 
But he cannot say no to her eyes. 
KORBEN Perfect... 
63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM 
David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of breath. 
CORNELIUS It's a miracle!!! 
DAVID (worried) What is? 
CORNELIUS (babbling crazily) I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part! 
He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in, disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending. 
64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT 
Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open. When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his chin. 
GIRL (angry) Eto Akta Gamat! 
KORBEN (embarrassed) I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured... 
The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled. 
KORBEN You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't have kissed you... especially since we haven't been introduced and... (he pulls out a business card) Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is Korben, Korben Dallas. Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open the door this time!. 
The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal. 
65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM 
Cornelius is lost in the closet. 
DAVID Father, will you please explain what's going on? 
CORNELIUS The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!! 
66	INT.  LIVING ROOM 
KORBEN ...What's your name? 
GIRL (after a moment) Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat. 
KORBEN (polite) Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter? 
GIRL ...Leeloo. 
Korben is falling in love. 
KORBEN That's... really cute... 
Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him. He bows before her. 
CORNELIUS Appipulai Leeloo Minai.. 
LEELOO Corn-i-Lius? 
CORNELIUS (bowing) At your service. 
LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh. Korben smiles. 
DAVID Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being? 
CORNELIUS Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves! 
David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out. 
KORBEN They all like this in your family, father? 
CORNELIUS She's an exception.. 
CORNELIUS Thank you so much for your help Mr...? 
KORBEN Dallas. Korben Dallas. 
Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben leaving. 
CORNELIUS Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over! 
KORBEN I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better? 
CORNELIUS She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip. 
KORBEN I know. I was there when she arrived. 
Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it. 
KORBEN Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat? 
CORNELIUS It means, "Never without my permission". 
KORBEN That's what I thought. 
Cornelius slams the door in his face. 
KORBEN ...Thanks. 
66A	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY 
Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR. 
Zorg turns to Cornelius. 
ZORG Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again 
CORNELIUS I remember you now..the so called art dealer. 
ZORG I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones? 
CORNELIUS ...Why on earth do the stones interest you? 
ZORG Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me... 
CORNELIUS Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you. 
ZORG Why?  What's wrong with me? 
CORNELIUS ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it. 
ZORG Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain... 
Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office. 
ZORG ...would you like a drink? 
CORNELIUS No thank you. 
ZORG Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass. 
Zorg pushes the glass with his finger. 
ZORG Here it is... peaceful... serene... but if it is... 
Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor. 
ZORG Destroyed... 
Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping out to clean up the mess. 
ZORG ...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life! 
CORNELIUS They are robots! 
A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry into it. 
ZORG Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction. I gave work to at least fifty people today. The engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong.  Children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life! 
Cornelius sits in silence. 
ZORG Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business! 
CORNELIUS Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another. 
ZORG Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years. 
Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink. Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts to panic. 
CORNELIUS (mocking) Where's the robot to pat your back? 
Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk. True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around the desk.  Zorg motions for help. 
CORNELIUS Can I give you a hand? 
Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in. 
ZORG You saved my life... So, I'm going to spare yours. (to the GUARDS) Throw him out! 
The GUARDS throw Cornelius out. 
CORNELIUS You are a monster, Zorg! 
ZORG (complimented) I know... 
The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office. 
ZORG ...Torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but I want those Stones. You have an hour. 
Right Arm salutes and hurries out of the office.

MOTHER (V.O.) Are you listening to me, you ingrate! 
KORBEN (resigned) Yes ma.. 
Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box. 
Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding. 
KORBEN (to the Thai) Go on... This is gonna take a while! 
The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window. 
KORBEN Other than that... You all right? 
MOTHER (V.O.) ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!! 
The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food. 
KORBEN (to the cat) I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about? 
MOTHER (V.O.) I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it? 
KORBEN All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly.. 
A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on. 
MOTHER (V.O.) You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two! 
KORBEN Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me. 
MOTHER (V.O.) They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead! 
He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.- 
KORBEN Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back. 
Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a Captain and a Major. MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache. Munro opens a file. 
MUNRO (clipped) Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance. 
KORBEN What mission? 
MUNRO To save the world. 
KORBEN Where have I heard this song before? 
MUNRO You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'? 
KORBEN (a little bewildered) Just one... why me? 
MUNRO Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission. 
Munro pulls out a long list of documents. 
MUNRO Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated. 
KORBEN And the third one? 
MUNRO You're the only one left alive... 
Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at. 
MUNRO Don't you open your messages? 
KORBEN I've had enough good news for today 
MUNRO (by rote) You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets. 
He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it. 
KORBEN You rigged the contest? 
Munro nods. 
MUNRO Major Iceborg will accompany you... as your wife... 
The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick. 
KORBEN (sarcastic) You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet? 
MUNRO Old tricks are the best tricks eh? 
KORBEN I'm not going. 
MUNRO Why not? 
KORBEN One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive. 
110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL 
Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the. number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell. 
110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT 
The doorbell rings. 
KORBEN ...Scuse me. 
Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo. Korben panics, overcome with happiness. 
The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He could pass for Korben. 
NEIGHBOR Fuck you!! 
113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT 
Korben still has his hands to the wall. 
KORBEN Wrong answer. 
SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle. 
114	INT.  HALL 
The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone. 
COP OK, we got the guy under wraps. 
115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE 
Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg. 
COP (O.S.) It was not easy, but we bagged him!. Thanks for the tip! 
RIGHT ARM (smiling) Glad to help. 
He hangs up. 
RIGHT ARM They just arrested the guy for Uranium smuggling. Everything's going as planned. 
He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's name. 
RIGHT ARM All I have to do now is to go to the airport and take his place.  I should be in Fhloston in less than four hours. 
Zorg sits there quietly for a moment. 
ZORG Don't come back without the Stones. 
116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT 
Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth chattering from the cold. 
KORBEN I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time. 
His eyes fall on an old blanket. 
KORBEN Here let me wrap you up. 
Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder. Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses. 
KORBEN ..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and you've ended up in my arms both times. 
Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far. She recovers, looking embarrassed too. 
LEELOO (nicely) Valo massa... Chacha hamas. 
KORBEN Uh..you're welcome. 
The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion. 
KORBEN Coffee!  That's what you need! A nice, hot cup of coffee! 
He pushes a button on the coffee machine. 
KORBEN With some honey!  You'll see, honey's great!... 
Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to quite understand everything that is going on. 
KORBEN A hot cup of coffee... with honey... 
He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon.. 
KORBEN (nervously) I've got this great honey somewhere. You know about honey?  There used to be these little animals who made it with antenna... 
..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero. 
KORBEN ..and these other animals who ate it.. one were bees the other were bears.. 
She looks back to the man fumbling for honey. 
KORBEN I forget which ate it and which made it but.. 
And she smiles. 
KORBEN Here it is! 
Korben holds up the jar of honey. 
KORBEN Taste this... 
Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth. 
KORBEN It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it? 
She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous. 
An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until it becomes quite a racket. 
KORBEN You hear that? 
David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes. 
Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back. 
KORBEN (friendly) Hey! I really thought I was going to miss my flight! (to David) Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on the conveyor belt? 
DAVID (freaking) Uh... yeah. 
KORBEN (smiling) Great! Now beat it! 
Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant. 
KORBEN Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the flight that I sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card. 
He looks at David's fake ID. 
KORBEN ...My cousin David... 
Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (looking at Leeloo's ID) Your wife? 
Korben grabs the ID and reads it. 
KORBEN Uh, yes... Newlyweds. (aside) You know how it is... Love at first sight. You meet, something goes tilt,. you get married, you hardly know each other. Right, darling? 
Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand. 
LEELOO (sharply) Dinoine chagantakat! 
KORBEN Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. (to Check-in Attendant) It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better. 
He winks at the stewardess. 
ANGLE ON: 
The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared. 
COP (to pig) 
Come on, snyffer, go root! 
The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack. Cornelius sits at a bar. 
CORNELIUS (to the bartender) I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty work. I know she was made to be strong but she's also so fragile... So human. You know what I mean? 
The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink. 
ANGLE ON: 
The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in attendant. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (surprised) Dallas... Korben... 
NEIGHBOR (in a different voice) Yes, that's me. 
The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on their faces, revealing two other faces: 
Mangalores. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (smiling) Just a minute, please. 
She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong. 
NEIGHBOR We'll be right back ... we're gonna check out the duty free... 
They spin around and hurry away. 
ANGLE ON: 
Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag. 
ROBOT The same? 
CORNELIUS Yeah... 
DAVID (V.O.) Make that two... 
Cornelius turns to David. 
CORNELIUS Where's Leeloo? 
DAVID On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one. 
CORNELIUS It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here! 
He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck. 
CORNELIUS Here's the key to the Temple.. Prepare for our arrival! 
Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot, and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are very nervous. A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them. 
NEIGHBOR (to the tawdry girl) Tell Aknot plan A flopped. Tell him to go to plan B. 
The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears. 
COP (into walkie-talkie) ...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7! 
ANGLE ON: 
He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down. Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from the wall, all aimed at him. 
VOICE (O.S.) This is not an exercise.  This is a police control. Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles... 
RIGHT ARM (slowing down) Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited... that's all... I'm calm now. 
125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY 
Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she is doing. 
LEELOO Apipoulai! 
KORBEN Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos... 
Leeloo smiles, as if complimented. 
KORBEN Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets... they're not mine... I mean they are, but not for vacation like everyone thinks... I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble... I'd love to be on vacation with you... but now.... now I've got to work... And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace. 
Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard. 
LEELOO Love... 
KORBEN Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is! 
Leeloo types in this new word. 
LEELOO (rather pleased) Peace... and love... 
She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign. Korben sighs and switches off the screen. 
KORBEN Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience.. 
LEELOO (quite happy) What is... Make Love? 
Korben just stares at her for a few minutes. 
KORBEN Know what? On that subject maybe you'd be better off asking the screen. 
He turns the computer back on. 
ANGLE ON: 
A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on top of each individual box. 
VOICE (O.S.) ...to make your flight as short and agreeable as possible, our flight attendants are switching on the timing sleeper which will regulate your sleep during the trip... 
ANGLE ON: 
LEELOO (switching off the screen) OK! Finished! 
KORBEN Finished what? 
LEELOO Learning language. 
KORBEN Which one? 
LEELOO All 900. 
Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not. 
KORBEN You learned 900 languages in five minutes?! 
LEELOO (pleased) Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine! 
KORBEN I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need. 
LEELOO Apipoussan! 
KORBEN Apipoussan? 
LEELOO Good! Do you know how we say "make love"? 
KORBEN (fumbling) Uh... 
LEELOO ...Hoppi-hoppa. 
Korben literally melts. 
KORBEN (to himself) Help... 
Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window. 
STEWARDESS Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas! 
The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately fall asleep. 
A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem. 
STEWARDESS 2 Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume your individual position. 
LOC RHOD (hugging her) I don't want an individual position, I want all positions! 
STEWARDESS 2 (resisting somewhat) We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod! 
LOC RHOD Now you're talking! 
126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE 
Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

ZORG 
- The engines at full blast. 
- The stewardess in close to screaming. 
PILOT Liftoff. 
- The copilot pushes a button. 
- So does Zorg. 
- The engines release their full power. 
- The stewardess screams in ecstasy. 
- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and everything else   within 60 feet. 
140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE 
The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up. 
COPILOT (relaxing) Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up.

Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her face and her hand in Korben's. 
143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT 
The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed. Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence. 
144	EXT.  SPACE 
The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops and it becomes gray and cold. 
145	INT.  SPACESHIP 
In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of the devices suddenly starts working. 
TECHNICIAN All right! We're finally getting something! 
146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired than ever. 
HEAD SCIENTIST The thing is sending out radio wavelengths! 
PRESIDENT What the hell does it want with radio waves? 
HEAD SCIENTIST ...Probably wants to make a call! 
The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment. 
147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE 
Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) Mr. Shadow on the line. 
Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to attention. 
ZORG Yes... Zorg here. 
The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the bowels of the universe. 
SHADOW Am I disturbing you? 
ZORG No... not at all.  Where are you? 
SHADOW'S breathing is awesome. 
SHADOW ...Not far, now. 
ZORG Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last! 
Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons. 
In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human, quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is. Zorg feels sick. 
SHADOW Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg? 
ZORG Got it. 
SHADOW How's our deal coming along? 
ZORG (ill at ease) Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled. 
Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time. 
SHADOW Money is of no importance... I want the Stones! 
Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her. Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben follows her, gaping at all the luxury. 
The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases. 
Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in that evening.  Dress: Formal attire. 
KORBEN For the concert it says formal attire... I didn't bring... 
The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row. 
HOSTESS (looking him over) Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after the concert to open it. 
She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door. 
Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity. Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of his reverie. 
KORBEN Hello? 
MOTHER (O.S.) You little sleaze bag! 
KORBEN ...Ma??? 
MOTHER (O.S.) Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!

CHIEF OF POLICE (to Cornelius) OK, let's hear it. 
CORNELIUS Where was I? 
CHIEF OF POLICE (bored) ...You open the door. There's a cabby with a girl in his arms. 
FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged. They hold up a THIRD COP. 
CHIEF OF POLICE What happened? A bomb go off in your face? 
BEAT-UP COP Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb... with green eyes. 
Cornelius perks up. 
CORNELIUS And the smile of an angel? 
They all turn to look at him. 
CORNELIUS (to Chief) May I speak to you alone. 
167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY 
Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of PORTERS carrying trunks. 
Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy. The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her. 
DIVA'S ASSISTANT Please forgive this little incident. She wants you to know that she senses great powers in you... in the service of a noble cause... She will give you what you have come to get, but she wants to sing first... One last time... 
The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up. 
DIVA'S ASSISTANT (nodding) Miss. 
Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better. 
168	EXT.  DIVA'S  SUITE 
Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

FOG ...make yourselves at home safely. If you need anything...give it a knock! 
169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT 
A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet. 
LOC RHOD (moving down the aisle) ...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king of laserball and the best paid player in the League. (shakes hands as he goes by) ...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar. "I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she recently confessed to me. She will no doubt prove to be as generous tonight as she always is. 
A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for staff. 
177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT 
The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops. 
AKANIT It's showtime!

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL 
Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown, stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien. And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is swept up in the TEARS. 
182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE 
Leeloo has tears in her eyes 
183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE 
The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS. 
MANAGER (ugly mood) Yeah!? 
VOICE (O.S.) Flowers for the Diva. 
MANAGER She's allergic to flowers!!! 
VOICE (O.S.) There's champagne as well... 
The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall. 
ANGLE ON: 
Cornelius watching from around the corner. 
CORNELIUS ...My God!

Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough for her to escape. 
189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE 
Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and gagged in.  He quickly unties him. 
CORNELIUS (in a panic) Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped. We must stop them!. I'm going to free you but you must promise to help me! 
The Chief of Police nods his agreement. 
190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE 
The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally finds a case engraved with the four elements. 
MANGALORE I have it. 
The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still. 
EMPEROR I'd say about thirty yards to the left. 
Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben a thumb's up. 
LOC RHOD ...And our man Korben has literally knocked out the opposition with an amazing 90 foot pitch. 
The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm in victory. 
FOG Thanks for your help. 
KORBEN Forget it. 
Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him.

KORBEN The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest. 
Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives. 
KORBEN Seven to the left. Five to the right. 
COP What's he doing? 
Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly. 
KORBEN Six to the left. One to the right. 
LOC RHOD He's on vacation. 
KORBEN (reloading) We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.

225	INT.  POLICE  STATION

Korben gently wipes Leeloo's forehead with a cloth.  She opens her eyes a little. 
KORBEN (gentle, loving) Apipoulai.. 
Leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish. 
LEELOO I'm so very sad. 
KORBEN Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say? 
LEELOO Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy... 
KORBEN I told you not to read all that crap! 
LEELOO Protect life... Until death. 
Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems so depressed.  Cornelius enters. 
CORNELIUS There's a General on the phone... His name's Mambo, I think. 
256	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
MUNRO Munro here. President Lindberg wants to talk to you.  Hold the line. 
The President clears his throat and takes the phone. 
PRESIDENT Major, first off, I want to thank you, in my name and in the name of the Federation... 
257	INT.  ZFX200 / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
PRESIDENT (O.S.) For the praiseworthy courage you have shown us! I'd like to congratulate General Munro for his choice. He found the ideal man for such a... 
KORBEN (to the point) So now what's the problem? 
The President drops into his armchair and sighs. 
PRESIDENT There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for the earth. And we have no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem. 
Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on board. 
KORBEN How much time before the collision? 
The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head. 
SCIENTIST If its speed remains constant... in an hour and 57 minutes. 
KORBEN (O.S.) I'll call you back in two hours. 
Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned. 
258	EXT.  SPACE 
The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded cosmos. 
259	INT.  CHAPEL 
David is asleep.  He is woken by the sound of... 
260	EXT.  DESERT - DAWN 
The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert. 
Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with him. Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the chapel. 
DAVID You're all safe. Thanks be to God! 
CORNELIUS Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose! 
The small group enters the chapel. 
261	INT.  CHAPEL 
Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross. 
KORBEN Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray later? 
Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off lowering the altar like a service elevator. 
The altar descends amid rocky walls. 
262	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
MUNRO They just landed in the desert. 
PRESIDENT (sweating) How much time is left? 
263	EXT.  SPACE 
Nothing happens. 
KORBEN Is that all? 
LOC RHOD Yeah... then I sighed... like this. 
Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more. Korben's got it. 
KORBEN The wind! The wind blows... 
Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile. 
KORBEN Quickly, everyone on a Stone! Water for water!  Fire for fire! Earth for earth! 
The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears. 
Loc Rhod has a problem. 
LOC RHOD (shaking) I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking last week! If we'd come a bit sooner... 
Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only one left. 
KORBEN Don't breathe. 
Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone. The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth beam, a red one, immediately forms. 
270	EXT.  SPACE 
A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles away. 
271	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
SCIENTIST Two more minutes. 
The President shuts his eyes.  His lids move in prayer. 
272	INT.  CHAPEL 
Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors crisscross. 
KORBEN It's up to you now, Angel! 
LEELOO I'm so tired... 
KORBEN You can sleep tomorrow... come on... 
LEELOO I want to sleep... forever... 
KORBEN Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it! 
Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar. Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams. An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise. 
CORNELIUS Come on Leeloo! Come on! 
The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor. 
273	EXT.  SPACE 
The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.  A hundred miles before impact. The African continent is visible.  No doubt about it:	The fireball is heading right for Egypt. 
274	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist's stopwatch. 
SCIENTIST It'll be entering the atmosphere in one minute. 
275	INT.  CHAPEL 
The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's.  A drop of liquid falls to the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams. 
KORBEN Leeloo! If you don't get on with the program we're all gonna die! And that's not on my agenda for today. 
Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck. 
LEELOO (weak) What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them! 
KORBEN You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things... 
LEELOO ...Like love... 
KORBEN Exactly. 
LEELOO But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own. 
276	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
The Scientist's stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds. 
277	INT.  CHAPEL 
LEELOO I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life. 
KORBEN Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight! 
LEELOO Why?... Why would you need me? 
KORBEN Because... 
CORNELIUS (to himself) Tell her, for God's sake!

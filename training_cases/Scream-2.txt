Scream 2 Screenplay by         Kevin Williamson 
FADE IN: 
EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 
An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front reads: 
"SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT 'STAB' Rated R" 
A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS - mostly college age. 
CLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart. 
MAUREEN I hate scary movies. 
PHIL It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand. 
MAUREEN If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie. 
PHIL We got free tickets. 
He pulls her close, snuggling with her. 
EXT. BOX OFFICE 
Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their tickets. 
They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation of a most familiar one. Phil takes one. 
MAUREEN What's that? 
USHER The studio sent them. 
INT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER 
The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS. Everyone is having fun. 
Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in terror. A very lively crowd. 
ON SCREEN 
Credits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo appears followed by... 
"A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM" 
IN THE THEATRE 
Maureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil has slipped it on. 
MAUREEN I don't think so. 
Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him. 
MAUREEN Take it off. 
PHIL But... 
MAUREEN Now. 
He obliges. 
ON SCREEN 
More credits. 
"BASED ON THE BOOK "THE WOODSBORO MURDERS" BY GALE WEATHERS" 
Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre. The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked. 
ON SCREEN 
The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere. Lights burn from within. 
Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the curtain. It's all very PSYCHO. 
MAUREEN Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot? 
PHIL Sssshhh. 
ON SCREEN 
The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone. 
GIRL Hello? 
VOICE Hello Sidney. 
A VOICE spits out of the phone. Deep and haunting. Sidney doesn't flinch. 
SIDNEY Yes? 
VOICE What's your favorite scary movie? 
SIDNEY Who is this? 
VOICE You tell me. 
Sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone. She takes a look at its display. 
SIDNEY Cory Gillis. 442-8730. 
Silence. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code 653M... 
CLICK! The phone goes dead. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Enjoy the movie. 
She hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie. 
HALLIE Time to change numbers again? 
SIDNEY Nah... I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes. 
Sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie channel surfs. Various morning news programs are on their small TV. Snippets are heard. 
REPORTER (from TV) "... The two victims, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens..." 
The channel switches. A YOUNG MAN is being interviewed. Attractive, sullen. Sad. 
YOUNG MAN (from TV) Please, I just wanna be left alone. 
His voice stops Sidney cold. She turns to the television. 
HALLIE He sure gives a lot of interviews for someone who wants to be left alone. 
Hallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as the TV goes off. Hallie turns, all smiles. 
HALLIE Get your ass in gear. You're late. Don't forget we've got rush at the Deltas tonight. Don't wear anything you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid? 
Sidney turns from the television. Momentarily lost. Recovery is immediate. 
SIDNEY I can't believe I let you talk me into going Greek. 
Sid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST FIGURE LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS but then stops herself. 
It's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to scare. Another prank. Sidney rips it down, turns to Hallie, throwing the costume at her. 
SIDNEY Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think? 
Sid is surprisingly cool. She exits out the door, leaving Hallie staring at the Ghost Mask in her hands. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DORMITORY - MORNING - LITTLE LATER 
Sid steps outside of her dorm. The morning sun shines down as Sid breathes in, taking in the day just as FIFTY NEWS REPORTERS NOB HER. 
REPORTER #2 Sidney, did you know the victims? 
REPORTER #1 Do you feel responsible for the murders? 
SIDNEY What murders? 
Microphones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged upon by journalists and TV cameras. She starts to panic. 
REPORTER #3 Do you think there will be more murders? 
Sidney is mortified. She pushes and shoves but there is no escape. The questions come at her like lightning. She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a REPORTER, a flashy woman - all hair and teeth, thick sunglasses, moves in her way. 
FLASHY REPORTER Did you kill them last night, Sid? Has it gotten to you? Have you finally snapped? 
Sidney's eyes flare. Her fist starts to clench when... 
BAM! Someone beats her to it. A fist flies out from the crowd, connecting with the flashy woman's face. She drops. Sid spins around to find... 
GALE WEATHERS 
Standing, tight-fisted. Their eyes meet. A quick moment. Sidney is happy to see her. 
Gale's CAMERAMAN can be seen behind her, in the van fussing with equipment. 
GALE (CONT'D) I need two minutes at six o'clock. I wanna do a piece on the slain kids - no sympathy shit - let's stick with the movie angle. I wanna pull a clip from an old film... 
Gale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers. 
GALE (CONT'D) Hey, what was the name of that movie? 
The guy looks up at her. It's RANDY. Two years older but still the charming jokester. 
RANDY HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA. 1980. Tom Hanks' first film. 
GALE (CONT'D) (into phone) HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find it. Don't worry, I've got it covered... I have a plan. Yeah, I'll get it. Give it a rest - I said I'll get it. Later. 
She hangs up, turning to Randy. 
GALE (CONT'D) Pressure's on. You ready for this? 
RANDY I'm there, man. No worries. I got ya covered. I'm so there. That's why I'm here - because I'm there. 
Randy holds up his camera - stoked. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SCHOOL OF FILM - LATER 
Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school building. Through open doorways, film equipment is glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film Department. 
She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room, a class is in progress. She slips in quietly. 
INT. CLASSROOM - SAME 
Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a point. 
SNOTTY GUY Sequels are too handicapped. By definition alone, they're inferior films. 
Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic, cool and rowdy. Arms enwrapped. 
MICKEY Bullshit generalization. Many sequels have surpassed their original. 
SNOTTY GUY Name one. 
MICKEY ALIENS Far better than the original. 
ANOTHER GUY Subjective. 
SOME GIRL Life's subjective. I much prefer Ridley Scott. 
The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making their point about ALIENS VS. ALIEN. 
HALLIE No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away from her - you bitch." 
SNOTTY GUY I'll give you that one. Name another. 
MICKEY T2. 
SOME GIRL You've got a hard-on for Cameron. 
SNOTTY GUY A bigger budget does not make a better movie. TERMINATOR one is historical. 
Someone screams out, "You Sarah Connor?" as the TEACHER, a young artsy type, speaks up. 
ARTSY TEACHER How about THE GODFATHER PART II? 
Ooooohhh. The whole room goes worship silent. All in agreement. 
SNOTTY GUY The almighty exception. Name another. 
A YOUNG MAN, handsome and smooth, jumps into the conversation. His name is Derek. 
DEREK EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story. Improved effects. 
From the back of the room, Sidney watches him. Fixated. 
HALLIE I liked JEDI. With the furry things. 
Everyone BOO'S. "Ewoks blow." 
MICKEY Lucas and his Romper Room stage. 
HALLIE I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20. 
SNOTTY GUY Case in point. The entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels. 
ARTSY TEACHER Really? And why do you think that is? 
Students and concerned faculty stand. Among them are Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey. Next to them stand JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very intelligent face. 
DEREK But what are they doing? He's talking but he's not saying anything. 
JOEL Sounds like they don't know anything. 
HALLIE Do you think they'll cancel Hell Week? 
MICKEY You're getting nailed - you're not getting out of it. 
From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls, LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance. 
JOEL Have they questioned you yet, Sid? 
SIDNEY This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry? 
HALLIE I have rehearsal. 
MICKEY I have to watch rehearsal. 
Hallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid. 
JOEL I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid? 
SIDNEY You're not allowed to ask that. 
JOEL I'll stop by the Deltas tonight. 
SIDNEY Thanks, Joel. 
Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls, Lois and Murphy saunter over. 
LOIS Hello, pledges. Enjoying yourselves? 
Instantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins begrudgingly. 
HALLIE Yes, sister Lois. Very much so. Thank you for asking. 
MURPHY Good. We need your help, pledges. Are you familiar with the Deltas TP fundraiser? 
The pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag and passes them out. 
LOIS (CONT'D) In our efforts to raise money for our favorite cause... 
MURPHY ... this week's TKE kegger... 
LOIS Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece. 
MURPHY We've set you each at a five dollar quota. 
MICKEY Come on, guys. Uncool. 
MURPHY Am I getting fraternity interference, Mickey? 
SIDNEY It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper. 
DEREK Sid, you don't have to. 
Sidney takes her toilet paper. 
SIDNEY No special treatment. I can do this. C'mon Hallie. 
She throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with this. She heads off with Hallie. Derek watches. 
DEREK How do you put up with this Greek shit? 
MICKEY Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie... 
ACROSS THE WAY Gale moves through the crowd as the press conference/rally continues. She runs dead smack into... 
DEWEY 
Their eyes meet. A long moment. The silence between them is revealing. 
GALE Hello, Dwight. 
DEWEY Miss Weathers. 
GALE I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... 
DEWEY I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me. 
He tips his hat curtly, then starts off. She stops him. 
GALE The name's Gale, remember'? 
Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton turns to Gale. His face pained. 
COTTON This was a mistake. I shouldn't be here. 
He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops filming. 
RANDY Can you say backfire? 
GALE Did you get it? 
RANDY Yeah, I got it. 
Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's in his voice. 
GALE You need to check your conscience at the door. We're not here to be loved. 
Randy's face reveals otherwise. 
AT THE PODIUM The sheriff continues. 
SHERIFF No, we don't anticipate another murder but we are taking every precaution possible... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SORORITY ROW - NIGHT 
A small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac. Large old homes populate it. Greek signs adorn the place. Welcome to Sorority Row. 
INT. SORORITY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A huge living room. Divided sensibly in several sections. Nicely done. Et is empty except for one girl who lies on the couch watching television. This is CICI, pretty with a lively energy about her. She channel surfs while talking on the phone. 
CICI (on phone) No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore. 
GIRL ON PHONE (from phone) Thought he was doing AA. 
CICI No, he quit - the whole God thing - he has issues. The previews for next week... 
BEEP! BEEP! Call waiting bleeps through. 
CICI (CONT'D) Hold up... someone's calling. (she clicks over) Chi Omega House. 
MAN'S VOICE Hello. 
A MAN'S VOICE. Deep and alluring. 
CICI Yes. 
MAN'S VOICE Who is this? 
CICI Cici. Who's this? 
MAN'S VOICE Someone who wants to talk to you. 
CICI Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on. 
She clicks back over. 
CICI (CONT'D) Teddy's on the other line. He sounds drunk. I'll call you back. 
GIRL ON PHONE That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. 
CICI I won't. 
GIRL ON PHONE Don't. Think Bailey. 
CICI Alright, alright... I'll call you back. 
She clicks back over. 
CICI (CONT'D) Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's up? 
MAN'S VOICE Who's Ted? 
Realizing, it's not Ted. 
CICI Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else. 
MAN'S VOICE That's okay. 
CICI Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here. 
MAN'S VOICE Where is everybody? 
CICI We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight. 
GIRL ON PHONE That's smart. 
Cici looks up and down the street. A YOUNG GUY walks along the sidewalk. 
CICI (calling out to him) Hey, you? HELLO? HELL0? 
The guy wears a headset, his head bobbing to the beat. He doesn't see her. Cici looks up the street to a sorority house down the block. Lights burn from within. People come and go. 
CICI (CONT'D) There's something going on at the Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down. 
Cici moves further down the porch steps. The phone begins to CRACK severely. 
GIRL ON PHONE (phone begins to go out) Don't do that. Hang up... call... (static) 
CICI What? I can't hear you... 
GIRL ON PHONE (major static) Hang up... call... 
CICI I'm losing you. 
GIRL ON PHONE ... campus security... send someone... check out... place... 
CICI Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back. 
Cici hangs up the phone. She hits the "TALK" button. Nothing but static. She tries again. She can't get a dial tone. She looks back to the front door. She hesitates quickly, debating, then she moves back up the porch steps. 
She tries the phone again. It still won't connect. She moves back to the front porch. It connects. Major static. She dials 511. 
VOICE (major static) Campus Security. 
CICI Hello, I'm calling from the Chi Omega... 
VOICE (too much static) I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hello? 
Cici eyes the open front door. She inches back to it. 
CICA (CONT'D) Can you hear me now? 
VOICE We... bad..connec... call back. 
The phone goes dead. 
CICI Shit. 
Cici redials. The same static. 
VOICE Hello? 
CICI I'm calling... 
VOICE I can't hear you. 
Cici peers through the front door, into the house. It's completely empty. Cici steps back inside the house. The connection becomes much clearer. 
CICI I'm calling from the Chi Omega house. Someone is harassing me. Hello? 
There's no one on the line. 
CICI (CONT'D) Shit! 
SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER. A HAND GRABS HER. 
Cici spins around, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER. 
GIRL'S VOICE Did the phone ring? 
Standing before her is DAWNIE, a young girl, sweet, pre- occupied. 
CICI Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here? 
DAWNIE I live here. 
CICI I thought you were going to the mixer? 
DAWNIE I had to change. Did anyone call? 
CICI Just some asshole trying to scare me. 
The front door remains wide open. The phone RINGS. Cici stares at it in her hand. She doesn't answer it. 
DAWNIE Are you okay? 
Cici nods, answering the phone. ROCK MUSIC BLARES from the receiver. 
CICI Hello? 
Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear into the macaroni with all their might. Gobbling it up, making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to Hallie, coaching her on. On Sid as she finishes her plate. 
A whistle BLOWS. 
MURPHY (CONT'D) Looks like we have a winner. 
Sid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her face. She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS. 
MURPHY (CONT'D) Sidney gets to skip the next round of Bulimia bingo. 
Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid. 
HALLIE You bitch. 
They crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He hurries over. 
SIDNEY Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge. 
DEREK I'm sorry honey. I got behind. 
ON HALLIE AND MICKEY 
Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face. 
MICKEY I don't want you to choke or anything but you're trailing. You need to pick the pace up. 
She swats him. 
ON SID AND DEREK 
Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round. 
SIDNEY (complete throw away) Any news? 
DEREK About what? 
SIDNEY The forbidden subject. 
He shakes his head. 
Suddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room. 
FRAT BOY Yo, guys, outside. Something's up at the Chi Omega. Police are everywhere. 
People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front door. Sidney looks to Derek. 
EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME 
Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into the yard as POLICE CARS WHIP BY. SIRENS BLARING. 
ANGLE ON STREET 
Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with police, ambulances, reporters... 
"Yo - let's check it out." "C'mon." The entire crowd takes off in droves down the street. All except for... 
SIDNEY AND DEREK 
They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes a circus. 
CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE 
She knows. 
INT. CHI OMEGA HOUSE - SAME 
Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is crawling. Dewey sifts around on his own, checking things out. 
IN THE KITCHEN 
Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered glass door. 
SHERIFF Lots of blood. But no body. 
CAPTAIN TYLER Have you checked the... 
SHERIFF Attic, garage, basement, nothing. 
CAPTAIN TYLER Take the neighborhood. 
The Sheriff turns to his men. 
SHERIFF Alright men, listen up... 
Dewey is all ears. 
CICI'S BODY 
Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms of... 
DEWEY 
She turns, SCREAMING. 
DEWEY It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. 
He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she holds on for dear life. 
EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - MORNING 
The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly comes to life. 
EXT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING 
The local campus security office has been converted into a media event. News trucks, cameras and REPORTERS stand guard outside while inside... 
INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING 
The place is packed. No longer just a campus security office. The place has been converted to the local police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS and SUITS swarm the place. 
In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night for all. 
CAPTAIN TYLER We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims. 
SHERIFF The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision. 
DEAN FISHER Christ! Just do something. I will not have a repeat of Gainesville. Not on my campus. . 
Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping forward. 
DEWEY Sidney Prescott, sir. 
They both turn to him. 
DEWEY (CONT'D) She's the connection. 
CAPTAIN TYLER We know that, son. 
DEWEY The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction. 
CAPTAIN TYLER We're aware of that. 
Sheriff Hartley steps forward. 
DEWEY The killer is obviously repeating Woodsboro. I can fill you in on what I know. 
Dewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain Tyler pulls Dewey aside. 
CAPTAIN TYLER Look, son. I know you've lived through this, but we got it under control. Why don't you have some coffee? 
Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by TWO UNIFORMS. Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The FBI and local police fawn over her. 
SHERIFF Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming in. 
GALE Of course, what can I do? 
Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the back, sending him off. 
CAPTAIN TYLER We were hoping you could help with the killer's profile. 
Dewey's face couldn't be more burned. 
INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING - MINUTES LATER 
A chalk board in front of them. Three names are written on it under the label "Victims" - "MAUREEN EVANS, PHIL STEVENS, CICI TAYLOR" 
Gale is at the chalk board 
GALE Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott. Sidney Prescott's mother. The first victim in the Woodsboro Murders. Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the first kid to be murdered. Ten to one - Cici is not the third victim's real name. 
SHERIFF It's Cassandra. 
GALE Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The third victim in Woodsboro. She was hung from a tree and gutted. 
The room goes quiet. Dewey watches from the back of the room. His eyes burning holes into Gale. 
CAPTAIN TYLER Jesus... 
GALE This is a complete copycat. Your killer is even going in sequence. 
Captain Tyler sits up. 
DEREK It's under control. 
He kisses her again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STUDENT UNION - LATER 
A huge one-stop for students. Comprised of several open floors, it looks like a mini-mall. A cafeteria, book store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place. 
Gale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie Salt heading her off. She tries to bolt but she's not fast enough. 
DEBBIE SALT Hi, Gale, any leads? 
GALE Tons and tons. 
DEBBIE SALT Where is Sidney's father? 
GALE Home - where he lives. 
DEBBIE SALT And are the police sure about that? 
GALE Why don't you ask them? 
DEBBIE SALT Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think? 
GALE No, I don't. 
DEBBIE SALT Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home. 
GALE Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me. 
Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The tabloid papers exploit what's going on. Crazy headlines about the murders dominate the newsrack. 
Gale is clearly bothered by this. Just then, a phone RINGS. She pulls it from her pocket. 
GALE (CONT'D) Hello? 
MAN'S VOICE Hello, Gale. 
It's the Killer. His voice is unmistakable. 
GALE Who is this? 
MAN'S VOICE I'll give you one guess. 
Gale knows immediately. She looks around for help. A CAMPUS COP is across the lobby. 
GALE Who are you? 
MAN'S VOICE That's not the way we play the game. 
GALE I don't play games. 
MAN'S VOICE What if your life depended on it? 
Gale gets testy with him. 
GALE What do you want? 
MAN'S VOICE You're pretty when you're angry. 
Gale stops cold. She looks around. The place is alive with people. He could be anywhere. 
GALE Where are you? 
MAN'S VOICE I'm everywhere. 
She continues moving to the Campus Cop. 
GALE Oh - a God complex 
MAN'S VOICE Stay away from the cop. 
A deadly warning. Gale stops. She plays it cool. She looks above her to the upper floor. STUDENTS hang over a balcony. 
GALE What do you want from me? 
MAN'S VOICE It's what you want from me. 
Silence. 
GALE What do you mean? 
MAN'S VOICE You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over. 
CAPTAIN TYLER If he calls again - find help. Don't engage him in conversation. I'm gonna put a man on you - to cover you. 
DEWEY I can do it, Captain. 
CAPTAIN TYLER Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off... 
GALE I'd prefer Dewey, Captain. 
Tyler doesn't argue. He's too crazed. Dewey avoids Gale's stare. 
DEWEY How's the name search going? 
CAPTAIN TYLER 37 usages of Himbry located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CINEPLEX MOVIE THEATRE - LITTLE LATER 
A movie is in progress. STAB. 
ON SCREEN 
A young girl, looking a lot like Tori Spelling, runs down a school corridor. She runs smack into a young, handsome boy. He could very well be Johnny Depp. 
TORI (in movie) Oh, God, Billy, you scared me. What are you doing here? 
JOHNNY (in movie) They let me go, Sid, I didn't do it. I'm innocent. 
IN THE THEATRE 
Sid and Randy sit in the small cineplex mall type theatre. Behind them sit Sid's trusting police guards. Sidney shifts in her seat. 
RANDY You okay, Sid? 
SIDNEY Yeah. 
ON SCREEN 
Tori Spelling and Johnny Depp continue their dramatic discussion. 
JOHNNY When my mom left my dad, I accepted it. That's just the way the cookie crumbles. Moms leave. 
TORI Yeah, but your mom left town. She's not dead. My mom's dead. Do you hear me? She's dead. Dead. And she's never coming back. Ever, Ever. 
IN THE THEATRE 
Sidney grows increasingly uneasy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STUDENT CAFETERIA - LATER 
Mickey, Joel, and Derek are crowded around a table in the Student Union Cafeteria. 
DEREK My documentary is due on Tuesday. 
MICKEY What's your subject? 
DEREK I WAS A SORORITY SLUT. 
JOEL You should of done it on Sidney. That would have been a cool. 
DEREK She wouldn't let me. 
MICKEY Not with Primetime Live and 20/20 coming at her. I'd save my shit too. 
Hallie comes waltzing up. 
DEREK Where's Sid? 
HALLIE Damned if I know. She ditched me. 
DEREK You weren't supposed to leave her alone. 
HALLIE I didn't say she was alone. That guy - from her home town showed up. They went off together. 
Hallie plops down, giving Mickey a big kiss. 
MICKEY I've been waiting for you, baby. 
JOEL Is that cool? Just to leave her like that? 
HALLIE She's got guards with her. 
DEREK What guy? 
JOHNNY Because she was sleeping with my dad. She's the reason my mom left. She was a whore just like you. 
IN THE THEATRE 
These words sting Sid. Randy notices her flinching. 
ON SCREEN 
TORI My mom was no whore. Don't you say that. 
JOHHNY Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore! 
Tori starts to cry. 
IN THE THEATRE 
Tears find their way down Sidney's cheeks. 
ON SCREEN 
Johnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing each other. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) It's the perfect alibi, Sidney. 
SIDEKICK Just like in the movies. 
IN THE THEATRE 
Sidney can't take it anymore. She gets up and races out of the theatre. 
INT. LOBBY - A SECOND LATER 
Sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. She moves into a curtained section where the water fountain is. She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the theatre. He exits outside looking for her. The cops are right behind him. 
VOICE Hello Sidney. 
Sidney spins around. Cotton Weary stands before her. shoulders slumped, his face pained. 
SIDNEY Cotton. 
COTTON Can we talk? 
SIDNEY I don't think that's a good idea. 
COTTON Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings. 
SIDNEY What do you want from me, Cotton? 
COTTON You could start with an apology. 
SIDNEY I did that. 
COTTON You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate. 
SIDNEY How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that? 
COTTON I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. 
A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads. 
SIDNEY Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist. 
More silence. 
COTTON I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help. 
SIDNEY Did it? 
COTTON It helped me realize one thing. 
SIDNEY What? 
COTTON You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother. 
And with that, Cotton flips on a dime. His face turns evil. Sidney races by him as he throws out his arm, stopping her just as... 
THE TWO POLICE GUARDS 
Appear, grabbing him from behind. They throw him against the wall, retaining him. Randy appears at Sid's side. 
RANDY You okay? 
Sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. They do a body search, pulling from his coat a large revolver. Cotton just smiles. 
CUT TO: 
COTTON Yeah, that's it. 
SHERIFF Why did you attack Sidney Prescott? 
COTTON There was no attack, we were talking. Very heatedly. Miss Prescott and I have a very complicated past. That's no crime. 
CAPTAIN TYLER And the gun? 
COTTON I have a permit. It's registered. I have a legal right to carry it. 
SHERIFF Why do you need a gun? 
COTTON Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is not reason enough to hold me here. I've been down this road before. And unless you're going to charge me with a crime I'd like to walk outta here. I have an interview at 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - OUTER OFFICE 
Gale sits at a table. Dewey approaches. He places a hand on her shoulder. They're both at a loss. 
GALE Where's Sidney'? 
DEWEY She's safe. 
Silence. 
DEWEY (CONT'D) How you doin? 
GALE Not good. How you doin? 
DEWEY Not good. 
Just then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their office. Cotton is escorted out behind them. Gale moves to him. 
DEWEY Can't we hold him? 
CAPTAIN TYLER No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move. 
DEWEY What now? 
ON COTTON 
He stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches. 
GALE What's going on, Cotton? 
COTTON You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive? 
GALE Did you do it? 
She looks him dead in the eyes. 
COTTON Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you? 
GALE You have a right to be angry. 
COTTON No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that. 
GALE Cotton, I've done nothing but help you. 
COTTON You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights? 
Just then, the OFFICER behind the counter brings him his gun in a plastic bag. Cotton takes it out and checks it over. Gale is surprised to see the gun. 
GALE Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far. 
COTTON Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes. 
Cotton pockets the gun and heads out. Gale rejoins Dewey and the others. 
CAPTAIN TYLER Night's coming. I think its time to beef up security on the Prescott girl. 
GALE Where is she? 
SHERIFF She was just escorted to her dorm room. 
DEWEY Is she safe there? 
CAPTAIN TYLER We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark. 
DEWEY That doesn't work, sir. 
GALE You're just isolating people. You're giving the killer a blank canvas. 
CUT TO: 
FRATERNITY JOCK Who do you love? 
MICKEY Hallie. 
FRATERNITY JOCK Did you say "My TKE brothers"? 
MICKEY No, I said Hallie. 
More food and slime come barreling at him. A drunk Lois and Murphy pull the police tape down from the previous night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him. The crowd goes crazy. 
INT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Hallie consoles Sidney. Dewey and Gale nearby. Sidney is a stone rock. It's frightening to watch her hold it together. 
SIDNEY I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not gonna break. 
HALLIE It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to. 
SIDNEY I'd really just like to be alone. 
DEWEY The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe. 
SIDNEY Dewey, there's no such place. 
DEWEY Humor me, Sid. 
Sidney starts packing an overnight bag. 
HALLIE Can I come with her? 
SIDNEY No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright. 
GALE Sid, I'll come with you. 
SIDNEY But who would operate your camera? 
A burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A KNOCK at the door. Dewey opens to find a Police guard standing with Joel. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) He's cool, Remy. 
Joel is ushered in. He says his hello's, moving to Hallie. Gale and Dewey move out into the hall with the guards. Sid continues to pack. Her face rigid. 
JOEL They got Mickey. He's being toasted at the Deltas. 
HALLIE I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over there. 
JOEL We're under quarantine. 
He points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway. 
HALLIE I'm the only one who can cut him down. 
SIDNEY It's not a good idea, Hallie. 
JOEL I'll go with her. 
HALLIE Be safe, girl. 
She gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she and Joel race out into the hallway as Dewey sticks his head in. 
DEWEY Sid, you should get going. 
He looks at Joel and Hallie. 
DEWEY (CONT'D) Where are you two headed? 
JOEL (instant cover) Hallie forgot her footage at the film dept. I'm gonna walk her over before it's gets too late 
DEWEY You really... 
HALLIE I gotta have it, Dewey. 
Gale steps in. 
GALE Hey, Dewey? 
HALLIE Seeya, Dewey. 
Hallie and Joel race outta there before any more objections. Dewey turns to Gale. 
GALE If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could? 
DEWEY Meaning? 
GALE He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek? 
POLICE GUARD #2 We're meeting another car that will transport you the rest of the way. 
POLICE GUARD #1 Safety precautions. 
SIDNEY I feel like Eddie Murphy. 
The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light. 
POLICE GUARD #1 We feel like Kevin Costner. 
Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but it's cut short. 
Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too late. The Ghost has the door open. 
A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is slit. 
IN THE BACK SEAT 
Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal. 
IN THE FRONT SEAT 
The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the car in drive and takes off down the road. 
Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic, and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use. 
EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME 
The car makes its way down the deserted street 
IN THE BACKSEAT 
Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape. Through the window, she sees approaching headlights. She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes by. 
Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each side of a thin, road. 
She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed. 
Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her. She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck is right up against it. 
Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the Ghost's head, ready to attack. 
Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate, into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for a moment. 
The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building. The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post that stands directly in the car's path. 
The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post, SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT, lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior. 
Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out. 
Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about, sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the car. It's flush against the building. 
Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it, pulling on it, bending it backwards... 
CREAK! 
Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the... 
FRONT SEAT 
Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move. 
The only way out is through the driver's door. 
After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement. Nothing. 
She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass through. 
She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching for the door knob. 
HONK! 
Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the car door open and starts to slide completely over the Ghost when she stops. 
She looks to the Ghost. 
CLOSE ON HER FACE 
As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away when... 
THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE 
SIDNEY I'll be right back. 
MICKEY Where you going? 
Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage. Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid settles on a shovel. 
Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him. 
SIDNEY Watch out. 
Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact. 
MICKEY Do it again. 
CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around peering into the night. 
MICKEY (CONT'D) What was that? 
SIDNEY Don't panic. 
Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening it. 
Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Watch out. 
Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid. 
Mickey looks up, just in time. 
MICKEY SIDNEYWATCHOUT! 
Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready. Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost, catching his mid-section, sending him flying. 
Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls, twists, squirms... anything to free himself. 
The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this. 
SIDNEY Hey. 
Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting across the yard, running smack into... 
THE GHOST MASKED KILLER 
But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but they counter, keeping her surrounded. 
Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife. She turns to the other. His knife is already poised. They close in on her, ready to strike. 
She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM! 
Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass. 
MICKEY Run, Sid... 
Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards the front of the yard. 
Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him. He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him. 
Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops... she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around just in time to see... 
Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're knives strike at the same time. One through the stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the ground. 
Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off running, along the side of the house, through a row of shrub that take her to... 
EXT. STREET - SAME 
Sid is back on the campus street, running down the middle of it. 
She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up. KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night. 
She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie. 
SIDNEY Hallie? 
But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATER 
Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She goes for it. 
Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL button. 
VOICE (from phone) What is your emergency please? 
DEREK Smile for the camera. 
Sidney remains silent. 
COTTON Sid, c'mon. 
Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either one of them. Derek watches her, amused. 
DEREK Go on, untie him. 
SIDNEY No. This is a set up. 
DEREK That's quick. 
COTTON Please, Sidney, he's going to kill us. 
Derek begins filming again. 
DEREK You must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about now. 
Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall where Hallie hangs. 
DEREK (CONT'D) Sidney, you can't keep your back to the audience like that. Could you cheat a little forward for me? 
COTTON Please, Sidney. 
DEREK You're really stumped, aren't you? You know there's two killers but you don't know who they are. I'm a given. The boyfriend. Way obvious. But now you're torn. Everyone else appears to be dead. Except for Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm? 
Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much alive. 
HALLIE Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The story of your life, Sid. 
Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself down from the wall with a big hunting knife. 
DEREK Need some help, honey. 
HALLIE I got it.. 
Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two. 
DEREK You should really see your face right now, Sid. It's doing some freaky shit. 
Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured. 
HALLIE Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive. 
DEREK Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life? 
Sidney stares them down. She's been here before. 
SIDNEY Why? 
DEREK Good question. You took the bait. 
HALLIE Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. 
DEREK I really don't like that comparison, honey. 
HALLIE (to Sid) He hates Oliver Stone. 
DEREK I find his work overwrought. 
Sid is waning. 
HALLIE C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've been planning this baby for a year. Humor us. 
Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to untie him. 
DEREK Nope. You had your chance. 
Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs off. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THEATRE SAME 
Gale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it. It's locked. 
GALE Shit. 
She moves down along the theatre to another door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THEATRE A MINUTE LATER 
THE CURTAIN DROPS 
Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the curtain separates them. 
ON STAGE 
Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her throat. 
HALLIE It's about time she showed up. 
IN THE AUDITORIUM 
Gale moves to the exit door and into the... 
INT. STAIR WELL SAME 
Gale eyes a door that's marked "STAGE DOOR". She opens it and steps in coming face to face with a... 
A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER 
Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find... 
DEBBIE SALT standing, lips pursed. 
DEBBIE SALT Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for you. 
Gale's face is a mass of confusion. 
INT. STAGE SAME 
Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her knees, next to Cotton. 
CLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND 
SIDNEY Okay, look, you guys - I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a question. What's going to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live. 
HALLIE Not this time. 
Hallie moves in on her. 
DEREK Yeah, we're trying to send a message to Hollywood. I'm really getting tired of all the happy endings. It's just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth. 
SIDNEY But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that. 
HALLIE Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious. 
SIDNEY You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos... 
VOICE (off camera) Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies don't create pyschos. 
Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He doesn't want to miss a second. 
DEBBIE SALT Don't you know that by now? It's about family. It all starts at home. It starts with the father... and the mother. 
Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately. 
SIDNEY Mrs. Loomis? 
Gale stops cold. 
GALE What? 
SIDNEY Oh my God. 
Gale turns to Debbie Salt. 
GALE Jesus. It can't be. 
HALLIE Told you we had a guest star. Didn't see that coming, did you? 
DEREK Everything's taken on a hyper- reality, hasn't it? 
GALE You're Billy's mother? 
DEBBIE SALT I couldn't believe you didn't recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book. 
GALE You're all in this together? 
DEREK We had to have financing. 
HALLIE Tuition's expensive. 
SIDNEY Why Mrs. Loomis? 
DEBBIE SALT Where should we start? Your mother ruined my marriage by sleeping with my husband. You ruined my family by killing my son. Gale aired it to the world. Should I go on... isn't that enough?

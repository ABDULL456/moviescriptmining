INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) 
The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering: 
THE GODFATHER 
While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America." Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion. 
BONASERA America has made my fortune. 
As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen. 
BONASERA I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family.  She found a boy friend, not an Italian.  She went to the movies with him, stayed out late. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.  She resisted; she kept her honor.  So they beat her like an animal.  When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain. 
He can barely speak; he is weeping now. 
BONASERA I went to the Police like a good American.  These two boys were arrested and brought to trial.  The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence.  Suspended sentence! They went free that very day.  I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me.  Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather. 
By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office in his home. 
The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside. 
DON CORLEONE Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends. 
BONASERA What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask! 
DON CORLEONE And what is that Bonasera? 
BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear. 
DON CORLEONE No.  You ask for too much. 
BONASERA I ask for Justice. 
DON CORLEONE The Court gave you justice. 
BONASERA An eye for an eye! 
DON CORLEONE But your daughter is still alive. 
BONASERA Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you. 
Both HAGEN and SONNY react. 
DON CORLEONE You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money. 
BONASERA America has been good to me... 
DON CORLEONE Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you... 
Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs. 
BONASERA Be my friend. 
DON CORLEONE Good.  From me you'll get Justice. 
BONASERA Godfather. 
DON CORLEONE Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return. 
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) 
A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine. 
DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies. 
The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied. 
DON CORLEONE Where's Michael? 
SONNY He'll be here Pop, it's still early. 
DON CORLEONE Then the picture will wait for him. 
Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns it.  Then he moves to his wife. 
SONNY Sandra, watch the kids.  They're running wild. 
SANDRA You watch yourself. 
HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows HAGEN. 
EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945) 
Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits, working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance. 
EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945) 
The DON's eyes peering through the blinds. 
EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) 
KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding, burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and the vitality. 
KAY I've never seen anything like it. 
MICHAEL I told you I had a lot of relatives. 
KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop. We see what she sees: 
Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine barrels. 
KAY (amused) Michael, what are those men doing? 
MICHAEL They're waiting to see my father. 
KAY They're talking to themselves. 
MICHAEL They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right. 
KAY Why do they bother him on a day like this? 
MICHAEL Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. 
EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945) 
CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples. She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest. CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold. 
Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin. 
CARLO (whispered) Cut it out, Connie. 
The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm, is fat with money. 
PAULIE (O.S.) What do you think?  Twenty grand? 
A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking eyes from the purse. 
PAULIE Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty, thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if this was somebody else's wedding! 
SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with some WOMEN. 
He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear. 
SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh. 
WOMAN Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra? 
SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter. Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais. SONNY and LUCY are gone. 
INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945) 
The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY surreptitiously steps out. 
She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing, motioning for her to come up. 
She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs. 
EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) 
KAY and MICHAEL. 
KAY (in a spooky low tone) Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a relative? 
She has picked out LUCA BRASI. 
MICHAEL No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him. 
KAY (Excited) Who is he? 
MICHAEL (Sizing her up) You really want to know? 
KAY Yes.  Tell me. 
MICHAEL You like spaghetti? 
KAY You know I love spaghetti. 
MICHAEL Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story. 
She starts to eat her spaghetti. 
She begins eating, looking at him eagerly. 
MICHAEL Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did. 
KAY Al Capone! 
MICHAEL My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off... 
KAY Michael... 
MICHAEL Then the legs at the knees... 
KAY Michael you're trying to scare me... 
MICHAEL Then the thighs where they joined the torso. 
DON CORLEONE My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat. 
At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER. 
JOHNNY I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather. 
DON CORLEONE Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you? 
JOHNNY I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up... 
He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to HAGEN. 
DON CORLEONE Tell Santino to come in with us. He should hear some things. 
They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY. 
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) 
HAGEN glances up the staircase. 
HAGEN Sonny? 
Then he goes up. 
INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945) 
SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy. 
LUCY Sonnyeeeeeeee. 
Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze in that position. 
HAGEN (O.S.) Sonny?  Sonny, you in there? 
INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945) 
Outside, HAGEN by the door. 
HAGEN The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem. 
SONNY (O.S.) Okay.  One minute. 
HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the door again.  TOM leaves. 
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) 
DON CORLEONE ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio. 
Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes. 
DON CORLEONE All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work. 
JOHNNY He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself. 
The DON is silent, stern. 
DON CORLEONE You take care of your family? 
JOHNNY Sure. 
He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can. 
DON CORLEONE You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want. 
JOHNNY It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot. 
DON CORLEONE I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. 
He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt. 
DON CORLEONE Now go back to the party and leave it to me. 
He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN. 
DON CORLEONE When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom? 
HAGEN They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important? 
DON CORLEONE No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom? 
HAGEN I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night. 
This saddens the DON.  He sighs. 
DON CORLEONE Genco will wait for me.  Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us. 
SONNY And Michael? 
DON CORLEONE All my sons. (to HAGEN) Tom, I want you to go to California tonight.  Make the arrangements. But don't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you. Understood? 
HAGEN Understood. 
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) 
Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses. 
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) 
Silence. 
HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat. 
FREDO (going) Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick, he's sick.  I don't mind getting the car. 
FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out his window. 
EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) 
FREDDIE crosses the street. 
INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945) 
OFFICE MANAGER Buon Watale, Don Corleone. 
The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the DON glances out his window. 
The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving. 
DON CORLEONE Merry Christmas. (handing the MANAGER an envelope) 
And he starts down the stairs. 
EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) 
The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open fruit stand near the corner. 
The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then turns back to the car. 
EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945) 
TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks, someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO. 
He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him. 
SOLLOZZO (quietly) Don't be frightened.  I just want to talk to you. 
A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open. 
SOLLOZZO (urgently) Get in; I want to talk to you. 
HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened. 
HAGEN I haven't got time. 
TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him. 
SOLLOZZO Get in the car.  If I wanted to kill you you'd be dead already. Trust me. 
HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the car drive off. 
EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945) 
RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk arm in arm. 
KAY Would you like me better if I were a nun? 
MICHAEL No. 
KAY Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman? 
They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do. MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question. 
KAY (a little voice) Michael? 
MICHAEL I'm thinking about it. 
KAY Michael... 
MICHAEL No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. 
She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave. 
The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED DOWN." 
MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY knows to remain silent. 
MICHAEL (desperately) They don't say if he's dead or alive. 
EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) 
DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness toward the parked car. 
DON CORLEONE Fredo, Fredo! 
The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots. 
Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car. 
The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit. 
The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off. 
Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are more GUNSHOTS. 
FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops the gun. 
The gun falls amid the rolling fruit. 
The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form. 
The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came. 
The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows.  But the street itself is now empty. 
SONNY A couple of our people will come to stay here.  Do whatever they say; I'm going over to the main house. If you want me, use Pop's special phone. 
The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it. 
SONNY Hello. 
SOLLOZZO (O.S.) Santino Corleone? 
SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY indicates that she be quiet. 
SONNY Yeah. 
SOLLOZZO (O.S.) We have Tom Hagen.  In about three hours he'll be released with our proposition.  Don't do anything until you've heard what he has to say.  You can only cause a lot of trouble.  What's done is done. (a pause) Don't lose that famous temper of yours. 
SONNY (quietly) I'll wait. 
EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945) 
FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house. 
INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945) 
SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls out. 
SONNY Ma?  Ma, where are you. 
The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm. 
SONNY Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's hurt...I don't know how bad. 
MAMA (quietly) Santino?  Have they killed him? 
SONNY (almost in tears) We don't know yet, Ma. 
MAMA I'll get dressed.  In case we can see him... 
She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his father's office. 
INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) 
He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk, and dials a number. 
SONNY Tessio...This is Santino Corleone. I want fifty reliable men out here. 
TESSIO (O.S.) I heard, Sonny...but what about Clemenza's regime? 
SONNY I don't want to use Clemenza's people right now.  Understood? 
He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger. We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer. 
SONNY Luca. 
INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945) 
The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits and ties sit around in the booths. 
HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him. 
SOLLOZZO I know you're not in the muscle end of the family--so I don't want you to be afraid.  I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me. 
HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully. 
SOLLOZZO Your boss is dead... 
HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes. SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully. 
SOLLOZZO (pushing the bottle) Have some more.  We got him outside his office, just before I picked you up.  You have to make the peace between me and Santino. 
HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man. 
SOLLOZZO Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it. 
HAGEN (pulling himself together) Sonny will come after you with everything he's got. 
SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently. 
SOLLOZZO That's going to be his first reaction.  You have to talk some sense into him.  The Tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people.  The other New York Families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war. 
He leans close to HAGEN. 
SOLLOZZO The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business. 
HAGEN Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi. 
SOLLOZZO I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids. 
HAGEN I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do. 
SOLLOZZO (lifting his hands in an expression of harmlessness) Good...then you can go... (he escorts him to the door) I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense. 
He opens the door; they step out together. 
EXT NITE: BUILDING 
HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit. 
But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out. He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to SOLLOZZO in private. 
Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in. 
SOLLOZZO The old man is still alive.  Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he's still alive. (he gives a fatalistic shrug) Bad luck for me, bad luck for you. 
HAGEN If I plead before the Supreme Court, I'll never do better than I did tonight with that Turk. 
EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945) 
The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night. 
INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) 
The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m. 
INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) 
SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted, in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks.  They can barely talk anymore. 
HAGEN Is the hospital covered? 
SONNY The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list. 
HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad. 
HAGEN Too much, too far, too personal. The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, and everything falls in line.  YOU don't have to go after the Tattaglias. 
CLEMENZA nods. 
HAGEN What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me. 
SONNY If Luca sold out we're in real trouble. 
HAGEN Has anyone been able to get in touch with him? 
SONNY No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up. 
HAGEN Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number. 
MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up. 
HAGEN Keep trying every fifteen minutes. (exhausted) 
SONNY Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies? 
HAGEN Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny. 
SONNY (angry) That's easy to say; it's not your father. 
HAGEN (quietly) I was as good a son to him as you or Mike. 
SONNY Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way. 
HAGEN We're all tired... 
SONNY OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day. 
There is a timid knock on the door. 
SONNY What is it? 
PAULIE GATTO looks in. 
CLEMENZA I tol' you to stay put, Paulie... 
PAULIE The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package... 
SONNY Tessio, see what it is. 
TESSIO gets up, leaves. 
PAULIE You want me to hang around? 
SONNY Yeah.  Hang around. 
PAULIE Outside? 
CLEMENZA Outside. 
PAULIE Sure. 
He closes the door. 
SONNY Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood? 
CLEMENZA Understood. 
SONNY Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news. 
HAGEN Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that. 
SONNY OK forget it, just stay on the phone. 
MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one answers. 
TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped inside. 
CLEMENZA A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. 
INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945) 
LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand. LUCA looks up at him. 
Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately. LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes bulge. 
ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's strength leaves him. 
CLEMENZA Maybe, or you gotta know now. 
PAULIE Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing. 
EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945) 
The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway. Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE. 
CLEMENZA Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a leak. 
The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him. 
He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car. 
PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered. 
CLEMENZA Leave the gun. 
LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off. 
---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- 
EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945) 
HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries with concealed weapons. 
MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard. 
He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard. 
A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This is where he was a child.  Then a shout. 
CLEMENZA (O.S.) Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone. 
CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL hurries into the house. 
INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945) 
CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot. He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the hook. 
CLEMENZA Some dame. 
MICHAEL picks it up. 
MICHAEL Hello.  Kay? 
KAY (O.S.) How is your father? 
MICHAEL He'll be OK. 
KAY (O.S.) (pause) I love you. 
He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the phone. 
KAY (O.S.) I LOVE YOU. 
MICHAEL Yeah Kay, I'm here. 
KAY (O.S.) Can you say it? 
MICHAEL Huh? 
KAY (O.S.) Tell me you love me. 
MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls up in a corner, and in a quarter voice: 
MICHAEL I can't... 
KAY (O.S.) Please say it. 
MICHAEL Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK? 
KAY (O.S.) OK. (click) 
CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all the button men stationed around the house. 
CLEMENZA How come you don't tell that nice girl you love her...here, learn something... you may have to feed fifty guys some day.  You start with olive oil...fry some garlic, see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat balls if you like...then you throw in the tomatoes, the tomato paste...some basil; and a little red wine...that's my trick. 
SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA. 
SONNY You take care of Paulie? 
CLEMENZA You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter. 
MICHAEL starts to leave. 
SONNY Where are you going? 
MICHAEL To the city. 
SONNY (to Clemenza; dipping bread into the sauce) Send some bodyguards. 
MICHAEL I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things. 
CLEMENZA Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian. 
SONNY OK, but be careful. 
EXT NITE: CAR 
MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front seat. 
EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945) 
ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning three steps of a front stoop. 
INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) 
TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a crossword puzzle. 
A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter. 
Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets. Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays. 
A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat. 
EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945) 
A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet alley. 
INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945) 
A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in a pool of blood on the tablecloth. 
INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) 
A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family War..." 
The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE has fallen asleep on his arms at the table. 
SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses. 
The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods appreciatively. 
MAN Nice Augie...nice. 
EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46) 
Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb. 
Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile. 
Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette. 
One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a door opening; they look up. 
The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks. 
SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes. 
He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car: 
DRIVER Pick up your sister? 
SONNY Yeah. 
The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars. 
INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46) 
He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again. 
CONNIE'S VOICE Who is it? 
SONNY It's me, Sonny. 
We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him. 
SONNY (tenderly) Connie, what is it? 
He turns her around in his arms. 
Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment. 
CONNIE (desperately) It was my fault!  I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me.  He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it. 
Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe. 
SONNY I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you. 
He starts to leave. 
CONNIE Oh Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't. 
He stops, and then laughs good naturedly. 
SONNY Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do? Make your kid a orphan before he's born. 
She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves. 
EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET 
CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St. "Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball. 
CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we recognize that it is SONNY. 
His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on the stoop and has CARLO by the throat. 
He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing, and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders. His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand. 
SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned. 
SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood. 
EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) 
The Corleone Mall. 
Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE DETECTIVES. 
It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE. All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday clothes, wait. 
EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946) 
One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway, preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a team of BUTTON MEN. 
Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with a rifle on his lap. 
INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946) 
Inside the Main CORLEONE House: 
Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN. 
All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA, THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN. 
INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946) 
The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but been converted into a hospital room, with complete and extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO should leave. 
They do, the door is closed. 
INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946) 
The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the Sunday dinner, and set the table. 
CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face. 
CONNIE What's the matter, Carlo? 
CARLO Shut up. 
INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946) 
All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is the spokesman for the family. 
HAGEN ...since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on most of our operations...on the other families too.  There's been a lot of bad blood. 
The OLD MAN glances at SONNY. 
SONNY Pop, they hit us and we hit them back. 
HAGEN We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up. 
The OLD MAN nods. 
SONNY Freddie's gonna go to Las Vegas...under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.  I want him to rest... 
FREDO I'm goin' to learn the casino business. 
The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for. 
HAGEN Michael... (he takes a breath) It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. 
The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and rage. 
HAGEN He's safe now...we're already working on ways to bring him back. 
The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone. 
INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946) 
HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is expansive and optimistic. 
SONNY We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you? 
HAGEN You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money. 
SONNY No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me. 
HAGEN Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation. 
SONNY Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have? (TOM starts to leave) Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore. 
INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946) 
The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table. 
EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) 
SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally by the gate. 
ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling. 
-----------------------------------------FADE OUT------- 
INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946) 
CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone. We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom. 
CONNIE Who is this? 
GIRL (O.S.) (giggle) I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just wanted to tell him I can't see him tonight; I have to go out of town. 
CONNIE's face turns red. 
---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- 
FADE IN: 
INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT 
The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone. 
HAGEN (O.S.) This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request. 
BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes. BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry. 
BONASERA Yes, I understand.  I'm listening. 
HAGEN (O.S.) You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him. 
Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright. 
BONASERA Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes. 
HAGEN (O.S.) Good.  He never doubted you. 
BONASERA The Don himself is coming to me tonight? 
HAGEN (O.S.) Yes. (click) 
BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room. 
Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes from him.  He lights a cigarette. 
BONASERA For the last year, they have been killing one another.  So now, what? Your Godfather comes to me...Why? (whispering, slyly) They've killed someone so important that they wish to make his body disappear. 
MRS. BONASERA (frightened) Amerigo! 
BONASERA They could make me an accomplice to their murder.  They could send me to jail! 
He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years. 
BONASERA And if the other families find out...they will make me their enemy. They could come here to our house. I curse the day I ever went to the Godfather. 
EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946) 
With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters. 
INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946) 
BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room, past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into the alley. 
He sits on a bench, and waits. 
EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946) 
The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley; we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral parlor. 
CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door. BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding. 
BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way the MEN should carry their sinister burden. 
INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946) 
They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming room. 
Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE. 
He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER. Then, after a long gaze: 
DON CORLEONE Well my friend, are you ready to do me this service? 
BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone. 
BONASERA What do you wish me to do? 
DON CORLEONE (staring at the table) I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is. 
He draws down the gray blanket. 
BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees: 
The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE. 
EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946) 
SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth. 
A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the car blocking him. 
The windows of his car are shot out. 
Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car. 
His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car. 
His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that he will survive it. 
Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER fire. 
His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground. 
A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and make off in the distance. 
SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they are too late. 
HAGEN When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean? 
DON CORLEONE Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told. 
HAGEN You mean Tattaglia. 
DON CORLEONE (shaking his head) Barzini. 
HAGEN (a revelation) He was the one behind Sollozzo? 
DON CORLEONE Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along. 
The black limousine speeds away from us in the night. 
------------------------------------------FADE OUT------ 
FADE IN: 
EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT 
A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left grotesque and misshapen. 
GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets. 
THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry knapsacks. 
The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, overlooking an impressive view of land and sea. 
EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD 
The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them. An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods respectfully. 
MICHAEL Don Tommassino. 
DON TOMMASSINO Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa. 
MICHAEL Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen. 
DON TOMMASSINO You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo. 
MICHAEL I know. 
DON TOMMASSINO Where are you going? 
MICHAEL Corleone. 
DON TOMMASSINO There is nothing there.  Not anymore. 
MICHAEL I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old. 
DON TOMMASSINO Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America. 
MICHAEL Don Tommassino...I should see this place. 
DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes. 
DON TOMMASSINO That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car. 
MICHAEL No...I would like to walk to Corleone. 
The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car. 
DON TOMMASSINO Be careful Michael, don't let them know your name. 
The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues on his journey. 
EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE 
The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit trees, in bloom and bursting with life. 
EXT DAY: VILLAGE 
They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns. 
The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main road "VOTA COMMUNISTA". 
EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD 
They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them. 
EXT DAY: FIELD 
Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men carrying billowing red banners. 
EXT DAY: GROVE 
They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees is a deep, tall field of wild flowers. 
The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese. 
MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief. 
FABRIZZIO You tell us about America. 
MICHAEL How do you know I come from America? 
FABRIZZIO We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot. 
MICHAEL Only the son of a Pezzonovanta. 
FABRIZZIO Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say? 
VITELLI (laughing with them...pouring more wine) I know about what you mean! 
FABRIZZIO This was a beauty.  Right, Calo? 
VITELLI (laughing) Beautiful all over, eh? 
FABRIZZIO And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth. 
VITELLI does not laugh quite so much. 
VITELLI Yes, we have beautiful girls here... but virtuous. 
VITELLI is no longer drinking with them. 
MICHAEL She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair.  She looks more Greek than Italian.  Do you know a beauty like that? 
As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl. 
VITELLI No. 
Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room. 
FABRIZZIO God in Heaven, I think I understand... 
He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he returns. 
FABRIZZIO Let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief. It's his daughter. 
They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move. 
CALO Come quickly. 
MICHAEL Innkeeper.  More wine! 
FABRIZZIO (whispered) The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up. 
MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority. 
MICHAEL Tell him to come to me. 
The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them. 
MICHAEL (quietly) I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter.  I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well.  Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her... 
CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed. 
VITELLI (shrugs) Who are you and what do you want from my daughter? 
MICHAEL I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country.  My name is Michael.  You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. In any case, I want to meet your daughter.  With your permission and under the supervision of your family.  With all decorum.  With all respect.  I am an honorable man. 
CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then asks: 
VITELLI Are you a friend of the friends? 
MICHAEL When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know. 
FABRIZZIO It's the real Thunderbolt, then. 
VITELLI (formally) Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village. 
MICHAEL Your daughter's name? 
VITELLI Appolonia. 
-------------------------------------FADE OUT----------- 
EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD 
MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their luparas on their shoulders. 
DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off, rocky and bouncing on the dirt road. 
The Sunday churchbells ring. 
--------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- 
EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE 
MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS. Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace. 
She looks at him. 
APPOLONIA Grazia. 
--------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- 
EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE 
Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's cafe. 
MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS, though they are all dressed differently. 
They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is talking and talking. 
MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet. She wears the gold necklace around her neck. 
--------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- 
EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME 
MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path, seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart. 
MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he sees MICHAEL. 
CALO Should I get your bag? 
MICHAEL No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia? 
CALO (smiling) She is sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas.  She'll be a real American woman before she gets to America. 
MICHAEL smiles. 
MICHAEL Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car. 
He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee. 
He looks out from the opening in the doorway. 
EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD 
There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child. 
CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat. 
Then MICHAEL seems disturbed. 
Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO disappear through the gate. 
MICHAEL (muttering to himself) Where the hell is he going? 
MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside. 
MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. 
APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is. 
APPOLONIA (calling out) I'll drive to you. 
He smiles affectionately. 
CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds out his hand. 
MICHAEL No.  No! 
His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, as she switched on the ignition. 
Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia. 
MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious. 
INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM 
MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead. 
MICHAEL Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily. 
--------------------------------------FADE OUT---------- 
FADE IN: 
EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951) 
Easter. 
A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter eggs. 
The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants. 
Suddenly, he stops and looks. 
MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase. 
Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in MICHAEL's direction. 
MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him. 
DON CORLEONE Be my son... 
INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY 
DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the building. 
DON CORLEONE This old building has seen its day. No way to do business...too small, too old. 
They enter the DON's glass-panelled office. 
DON CORLEONE Have you thought about a wife?  A family? 
MICHAEL (pained) No. 
DON CORLEONE I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know. 
MICHAEL I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when. 
DON CORLEONE Accept what's happened, Michael. 
MICHAEL I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me. 
DON CORLEONE No, I wanted other things for you. 
MICHAEL You wanted me to be your son. 
DON CORLEONE Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America. 
MICHAEL I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. 
MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY. 
MICHAEL Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started.  We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers.  We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. We hope your friends in the movies will do the same.  We count on you to convince them. 
JOHNNY Sure, I'll do anything for my Godfather.  You know that, Mike. 
There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL, who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters, followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast style. 
MOE Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want? 
MICHAEL Thanks. 
MOE The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good! (to his BODYGUARDS) Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house. 
MICHAEL Is my credit good enough to buy you out? 
MOE laughs. 
MOE Buy me out?... 
MICHAEL The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out. 
GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS. 
MOE (furious) The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out. 
MICHAEL Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better. 
MOE You think I scam? 
MICHAEL (the worst insult) You're unlucky. 
MOE You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out. 
MICHAEL You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price. 
MOE The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel! 
MICHAEL (quietly, deadly) Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public? 
FREDO (his face turns red) Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe didn't mean anything.  He flies off the handle sometimes; but me and him are good friends.  Right, Moe? 
MOE Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick asses to make this place run right. Freddie and I had a little argument and I had to straighten him out. 
MICHAEL You straightened my brother out? 
MOE Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink. 
MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal: 
MICHAEL I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price. 
MOE You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders. 
FREDO (frightened) Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him. 
MICHAEL The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me. 
Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door. MOE exits angrily. 
MICHAEL Freddie, you're my older brother. I love you.  But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again. 
EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955) 
KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it. 
She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who plays with a cardboard bird on a string. 
Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have learned to tell are bodyguards. 
MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO PORTERS carrying luggage. 
NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder. 
MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY. 
LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically, the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver; and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the other cars. 
And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other sedans. 
INT DAY: LIMO (1955) 
The little BOY looks out the window as they drive. 
MICHAEL I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall. 
KAY Oh Michael. 
MICHAEL We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets. 
KAY Don't you want dinner first? 
MICHAEL No, you eat...don't wait up for me. 
KAY Wake me up when you come to bed? 
The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding limousine window. 
EXT DAY: MALL (1955) 
HAGEN I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime? 
DON CORLEONE I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye. 
MICHAEL How did you find out? 
HAGEN Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth. (pause) Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly. 
MICHAEL Not so perfectly if you noticed. 
HAGEN Mike, why am I out? 
MICHAEL You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying. 
HAGEN OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones... 
DON CORLEONE Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen. 
HAGEN Maybe I can help. 
MICHAEL (coldly) You're out, Tom. 
TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM leaves. 
MICHAEL looks at NERI. 
MICHAEL I'm going to talk to my father. 
NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside. 
EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955) 
DON CORLEONE I see you have your Luca Brasi. 
MICHAEL I'll need him. 
DON CORLEONE There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man. 
They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting. MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over. 
DON CORLEONE Barzini will move against you first. 
MICHAEL How? 
DON CORLEONE He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety... 
He rises, and looks at Michael... 
DON CORLEONE ...and at that meeting you will be assassinated. 
The DON walks on further. 
DON CORLEONE Your wife and children...you're happy with them? 
MICHAEL Yes. 
DON CORLEONE Good. 
MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then: 
MICHAEL I've always respected you... 
A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL. 
DON CORLEONE And I...you. 
EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955) 
KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left them off. 
KAY How is your husband feeling? 
MAMA He's not the same since they shot him.  He lets Michael do all the work.  He just plays the fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, as if he was some peasant still.  But men are like that... 
She stops toward the Church. 
MAMA You come in, too. 
KAY shakes her head. 
MAMA The Priest ain't gonna bite you cause you're not Catholic. (whispered) He's in the back drinkin' his wine. 
KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church. They enter. 
INT DAY: CHURCH (1955) 
Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from the holy water. 
MAMA You can. 
Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar. 
MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some. 
MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles. 
She finishes, and bows her head. 
EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME 
Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks. An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous. Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King. 
FADE IN: 
INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955) 
ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently. Then the badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress. 
INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955) 
MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is beginning to take on a matronly look. 
INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955) 
In a Long Island motel. 
ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it, checks it, and puts it back together. 
EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955) 
PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates, takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then gets in, drives off. 
EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955) 
The Church. 
Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating. Not all of the participants have arrived yet. 
CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the infant; showing him off to interested people. 
EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955) 
NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight. 
EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955) 
LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising "ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY". 
INT DAY: CHURCH 
The Church. 
CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn. 
PRIEST (to MICHAEL) Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world? 
MICHAEL Yes, I promise. 
EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE. 
NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his nightstick. 
The DRIVER looks up in surprise. 
NERI points to the "No Parking" sign. 
The DRIVER turns his head away. 
NERI OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or you wanna move? 
DRIVER (obviously a hood) You better check with your precinct. 
NERI Move it! 
The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's jacket. 
NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then he crooks a finger at the DRIVER. 
NERI Let me see you license and registration. 
EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY 
LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up. It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he returns into the room. 
INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955) 
CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward. 
INT DAY: CHURCH 
The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils. 
PRIEST Ephetha...be opened...So you may perceive the fragrance of God's sweetness. 
EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955) 
The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center is arguing with NERI. 
Now the DRIVER looks up. 
WHAT HE SEES: 
TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving glass doors. 
NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of BARZINI within them. 
INT DAY: CHURCH 
In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him the infant. 
PRIEST Do you renounce Satan. 
MICHAEL I do renounce him. 
He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, and then he accepts it. 
TESSIO (after the pause) Tell Mike it was business...I always liked him. 
HAGEN He understands that. 
TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses. 
TESSIO (softly) Tom, can you get me off the hook? For old times' sake? 
HAGEN I can't. 
HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back. 
TESSIO is led into a waiting car. 
HAGEN looks away, and walks off. 
INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955) 
CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out. 
WHAT HE SEES: 
EXT DAY: MALL (1955) 
MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI, LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN. 
They move toward us. 
Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it. 
He wears a broad smile. 
CARLO Godfather! 
MICHAEL You have to answer for Santino. 
The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room. 
INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955) 
The door opens, and the grim party enters. 
MICHAEL You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone? 
CARLO (dignity) I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me! 
MICHAEL (quietly) Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did. 
CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified. 
MICHAEL (almost kindly) Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini? 
CARLO (sees his way out) Barzini. 
MICHAEL (softly) Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport. 
CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting; with a group of MEN around it. 
He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him. 
MICHAEL I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on. 
EXT DAY: MALL 
CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his things in the trunk. 
ONE opens the front door for him. 
SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who. 
CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man. 
It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially. 
The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet. 
The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color. 
His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield. 
Then the body goes slack. 
CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off. 
EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955) 
MICHAEL and his party.  They watch. 
Then he turns and walks off, and they follow. 
---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- 
FADE IN: 
INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955) 
MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving. 
They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights flash by.

SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY (TODD) YOU IDIOT!! 
TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL (KIMBERLY) MOM! 
TODD SHUT-UP! 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL (JEANIE) I NEED A TOWEL!! 
TOM JOYCE! 
KIMBERLY (whispers, sadistic) When you turn ten, your head's going to swell up real big like a watermelon and we're going to have to put you to sleep like they do with a dog. 
TODD MOM! 
TOM JOYCE!! 
JEANIE WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!! 
TOM Where's Mom? 
TODD Is my head going to swell up? 
TOM What?! 
JEANIE OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!! 
MOTHER (JOYCE) (screams) TOM! 
The house falls dead SILENT. We hear footsteps thundering through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP. 
TODD What's that? 
KIMBERLY Wait! Hold still! 
TODD What?! 
KIMBERLY You heads starting to swell up!! 
Todd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the hallway. A door open. 
TOM (breathless) What's the matter? 
JOYCE (worried) It's Ferris! 
TOM What's wrong? 
JOYCE (snaps) What's wrong? For Christ's sake! Look at him! 
2  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              2 
An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA. His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side. 
3  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                            3 
Ferris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties. Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed for work. 
TOM Ferris? 
JOYCE He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots. 
4  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              4 
His lifeless eyes blink. 
5  INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS                                         5 
Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead. 
TOM What's the matter, Ferris? 
JOYCE Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy. 
Tom takes one of Ferris' hands. 
TOM (discreetly) Should you call the doctor? 
JOYCE (whispers) He doesn't want me to. 
TOM Why don't you want Mom to call the doctor? 
Ferris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can manage is a choked gasp. 
TOM What? 
Ferris tries again. 
He turns from the window. 
FERRIS Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school. 
He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV broadcast. A NEW SONG begins. 
FERRIS Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right? 
He equalizes the sound a little. 
FERRIS This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count. 
He exits into the hallway. 
11  INT. BATHROOM                                                11 
Ferris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's debris. He turns on the shower water. 
FERRIS I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school? 
He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops up. 
FERRIS I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit. 
He steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the shower door we see Ferris' outline. 
FERRIS That I care about it was. 
12  INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.                                 12 
Inside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up. It's moulded into a fin with shampoo. 
FERRIS It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European. So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car. 
He turns the shower head around and uses it like a microphone. 
FERRIS (sings) WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT... 
13  INT. HALLWAY. LATER                                          13 
Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different color. 
FERRIS Not that I condone fascism. Or and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an "ism". He should believe in himself. John Lennon said it on his first solo album. "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus. 
He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it. 
FERRIS I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people. 
He passes CAMERA and goes into his room. 
FERRIS (OC) I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective... 
14  INT. BEDROOM                                                 14 
Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed. 
FERRIS My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam. So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?" (snaps his fingers) Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks. (pause) Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy. 
He opens his door. 
15  INT. CLOSET                                                  15 
The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts. 
FERRIS My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not. 
He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and puts it on. He drops the towel. 
16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16 
He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the top of the dresser. He picks it up. 
FERRIS In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue. 
He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he speaks. 
FERRIS His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him. I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station. His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her. It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her. (pause) My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail. I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here. I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped. But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point. I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing". ... Nothing was wrong. There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying. He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit? My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house. 
He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his speech as he disrobes. 
FERRIS Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost. It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station. 
17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17 
Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely different outfit. 
FERRIS One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act. 
18  INT. KITCHEN                                                 18 
Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the refrigerator. 
FERRIS That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food. I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out. 
He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice. 
FERRIS You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy. 
He crosses to the pantry. 
FERRIS You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun. 
He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos. 
FERRIS Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right. 
TEACHER'S VOICE Bueller? 
GIRL'S VOICE He's sick. (pause) My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty serious. 
TEACHER'S VOICE (weary) Thank you, Simone. 
GIRL'S VOICE (cheery) No problem whatsoever. 
TEACHER'S VOICE Drucker? 
BOY'S VOICE What? 
WOUND-OUT CAR ENGINES COME UP LOUD. 
28  CU. TV                                                       28 
THE ROAD WARRIOR is playing on video cassette. The big chase at the end. 
INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS 
He's sitting in the arm chair pretending it's Humongous' war wagon. He's wearing a hockey mash. He's steering. He reaches down and grabs an imaginary nitrous oxide valve. 
CU. TV 
Humongous reaches down and grabs a real nitrous oxide valve. He gives it a twist. 
CU. FERRIS 
He throws himself back against the chair. 
CU. TV 
The force of the rapid acceleration of his vehicle throws Humongous back in his seat. 
CU. FERRIS 
He bounces himself in the chair to simulate the bumpy high speed ride. 
CU. TV 
The was wagon hurtles down the road. 
CU. FERRIS 
He rears back in horror. 
CU. TV 
The war wagon is heading for a head-on collision with the tanker truck. 
CU. FERRIS 
Arms outstretched, head thrown back, braced for collision. 
CU. TV 
IMPACT! 
MOZART COMES UP. 
29  CU. FLOWERING TREE BRANCH                                    29 
Outside a bedroom window. A flowering crabtree branch. Petite pink flowers. WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDOW INTO THE ROOM. It's Jeanie's room. A pink and powder blue pig pen. Clothes everywhere, make-up, books, records. Ferris is sitting on her bed going through a purse. 
FERRIS This is really degrading. 
He comes up with a crumpled dollar bill. 
FERRIS Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest. 
He comes up with a five. 
FERRIS Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them. Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on. 
He holds up a twenty and snaps it. PINK FLOYD'S "MONEY" COMES UP. 
30  INT. LIVING ROOM                                             30 
The song plays as Ferris digs through the sofa cushions. 
CU. SOFA 
Ferris extracts a sticky quarter from a crevice. 
31  INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM                                        31 
Ferris is going through his father's pants pockets. Another crumpled bill surfaces. 
32  CU. WASHING MACHINE TOP                                      32 
A couple of stiff, hard, bleached singles that have gone through the wash lay on top of the washer. A hand scoops them up. 
33  CU. LUCITE ENCASED PROOF SET                                 33 
An obvious gift from a grandparent. A U.S. Mint proof set. A ten, a five and a single enclosed in a lucite frame. A screwdriver tip wedges between the two pieces of Lucite and pops them apart. A hand peels the bills off the backing. 
34  CU. KITCHEN DRAWER                                           34 
Hands ripping through the kitchen junk drawer. Locating a dollar bill. 
35  CU. COIN COLLECTION                                          35 
The familiar blue collector's album. One-by-one, the quarters are being popped out of their slots. 
36  CU. VACCUUM CLEANER                                          36 
Rooney turns to the monitor. He reads off the screen. 
ROONEY I have it right here in front of me. He's missed... 
He looks closer at the screen. 
52  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            52 
Ferris is at his Macintosh computer. He has his record up on the screen. 
FERRIS I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign? 
53  INT. JOYCE'S OFFICE                                          53 
She's still on the phone with Rooney. 
JOYCE I can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is, in fact, very ill. I debated whether or not I should even leave him. I can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off, but in Ferris' case, he's truly a very sick boy. 
54  INT. FERRIS' BEDROOM                                         54 
MUSIC BLASTS. SOLO GUITAR. 
CU. SPEAKER 
The grille cloth is throbbing. 
CU. LED METERS 
The meters on the amplifier are totally in the danger zone. 
CU. TV MONITOR 
We see Ferris in his room with a guitar around his neck. He's playing. 
CU. VIDEO CAMERA 
A home video camera is capturing Ferris on tape. 
55  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          55 
He's sitting on the edge of the bed buttoning his shirt. He sighs deeply and fall back on the bed. 
56  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         56 
Jeanie is at her locker during a passing period. A GIRLFRIEND comes up to her. 
GIRL I'm really sorry about your brother. 
JEANIE What're you sorry for? I have to live with the trouser snake. 
GIRL No, I mean I heard he's really sick. 
JEANIE Who said he's sick. 
GIRL A whole bunch of people. They said he's like on the verge of death. 
Jeanie stares incredulously at the girl. 
GIRL This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's really sweet isn't he? 
She smiles and exits. Jeanie cocks her head in bewilderment. She kicks her locker shut. 
57  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            57 
He's in bed on the phone. 
FERRIS A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily. (point to the phone) Freshman. (to the phone) Did you see Alien? When the guy had the creature in his stomach? It feels like that. 
58  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         58 
A FRESHMAN BOY is on the pay phone. A couple of his BUDDIES are standing at his side waiting anxiously for news. 
BOY Goddamn! Are you kidding? 
SECOND BOY What? 
BOY Did you see Alien? 
SECOND BOY No. 
BOY You never rented the video cassette? 
Second boy shakes his head, no. 
BOY Oh. He's really wasted. 
THIRD BOY (to the Second Boy) Who's he talking to? 
SECOND BOY Ferris Bueller. You know him? 
THIRD BOY (excited) Yeah. He's getting me out of summer school. 
BOY Anyway, I appreciate you letting us know how you're doing. We gotta split. (pause) Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on. 
SECOND BOY (to Third Boy) Shit. I hope he doesn't die. I can't handle summer school. 
The boy snatches a passing GIRL. 
BOY Did you see Alien? 
GIRL Yeah, why? 
He hands her the phone. 
GIRL Hello? (pause) Who? (pause) Hi, Ferris. How's your bod? (jaw drops) Oh, my God! You're dying? Is it serious? (pause) Shiit! Are you upset? 
CU. ROONEY'S FOOT 
It freezes in mid-tap. 
CU. ROONEY'S HAND 
The pencils falls from his fingers. 
CU. ROONEY'S FACE 
A mask of horror. He glances at the phone. 
CU. PHONE 
The second line light is flashing. 
CU. ROONEY 
He blinks, cocks his head, twitches. 
77  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            77 
He's zipping his pants, fastening his belt. The phone's cradled against his shoulder. He speaks in the same voice he used on his father. 
FERRIS Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need. 
78  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   78 
He's staring blankly ahead. 
FERRIS' VOICE Thank you, sir. 
He nods. 
CU. PHONE 
Rooney's finger gingerly presses the button on the waiting call. 
CU. ROONEY 
He winces as he returns to the first call. 
79  INT. FERRIS' HOUSE. KITCHEN                                  79 
Cameron's on the phone in the kitchen. He's doing a deep, phoney "father" voice. 
CAMERON You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake! A family member dies and you insult me. What's the matter with you, anyway? 
80  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   80 
He apologies profusely to Cameron. He's perspiring, trembling. 
ROONEY I don't know. I thought you were someone else. You have to know, sir, that I would never deliberately insult you. I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am. 
CAMERON'S VOICE Pardon my French but you're an asshole! 
Rooney nods enthusiastically. 
ROONEY Absolutely! I most certainly am. 
81  INT. KITCHEN                                                 81 
Cameron lays into Rooney. 
CAMERON This isn't over yet, buster. You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes. Do you read me? 
ROONEY'S VOICE Load and clear, Mr. Peterson. 
CAMERON Call me sir, goddamn it! 
ROONEY'S VOICE Sir. 
CAMERON That's better. 
Ferris strolls into the kitchen to catch the last of the conversation. Cameron covers the phone. 
CAMERON (to Ferris) I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What is Rooney guesses my voice! 
FERRIS Impossible. You're doing great. 
Cameron sighs and goes back to the phone. 
CAMERON (clears his throat) I don't have all day to bark at you so I'll make this short and sweet. 
Ferris gives Cameron an enthusiastic thumbs up. 
FERRIS (mouths) Great! 
Cameron smiles proudly. 
CAMERON I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes. By herself. I don's want anyone around... 
Ferris smacks Cameron. He's said the wrong thing. He covers the phone. 
CAMERON What'd I do? 
FERRIS Out in front my herself? It's too suspicious! He'll think something's up, moron. Cover it. 
Cameron panics. He holds the phone out to Ferris. 
CAMERON You do it! 
Ferris waves his arms angrily. 
FERRIS Talk! 
CAMERON He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has it tatooed on his wrist. 
FERRIS He doesn't trust you? 
CAMERON No. 
FERRIS Alright, look, this is real simple. He puts his arm around Cameron. 
FERRIS Whatever miles we put on it, we'll take off. 
CAMERON (suspicious) How? 
FERRIS (big, proud smile) We'll drive home backwards. 
Cameron shakes his head, no. 
CAMERON Forget it. I'm putting my foot down, Ferris. You'll have to think of something else... 
CU. FERRARI GRILLE 
Cameron's protests are drowned out by the distinctive roar of the twelve cylinders. 
CAMERON'S VOICE ...You're not talking me into this one. I have to live with the man. I'm sorry but... 
The roar of the engine is overtaken by the sound of a crowded school hallway. 
85  INT. SCHOOL. JEANIE                                          85 
She comes out of a classroom. She stops as Sloane and Rooney walk past. Sloane has her coat on and she's carrying her books. Jeanie watches her suspiciously. 
86  EXT. SCHOOL                                                  86 
The Ferrari is parked out in front. The top is down. 
87  INT. FERRARI                                                 87 
Ferris is driving. He's wearing a man's hat and sunglasses. Cameron's in the back. 
CAMERON Are you crazy?! Put the top back up! 
FERRIS This is perfect top-down weather. CAMERON What about Rooney? 
FERRIS Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught. 
CAMERON That makes no sense whatsoever. 
FERRIS The adult mind is a suspicious machine. (look around at Cameron) Stay down, man. 
Cameron squeezes himself lower. 
CAMERON Howcome it's my Dad's car and I'm taking all the risk and I have to ride back here? 
FERRIS I don't have an explanation. 
88  EXT. SCHOOL                                                  88 
Rooney and Sloane come out the door. 
ROONEY Once again let me say how deeply saddened I am by your loss. 
SLOANE Huh? 
ROONEY Were you close to your grandmother? 
SLOANE Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah. 
DEEP VOICE Oh, Sloane! Dear! 
Sloane looks across at the Ferrari. Rooney looks. 
THEIR POV 
Ferris is looking out across the roof of the Ferrari. He's careful to keep his nose and mouth below the roofline. 
FERRIS Hurry along now! 
EXT. SCHOOL 
Rooney's suspicious. Sloane smiles and bids Rooney a hasty farewell. 
SLOANE I guess that's my Dad. Thanks. See ya. 
She hurries to the car. Rooney watches her. Something does compute for him.

Sloane shrieks with delight. She leans across the console and gives Ferris a kiss. 
SLOANE This is so great! I can't believe it! Right in front of Rooney! 
She laughs and turns to Cameron. 
SLOANE Hi, Cameron. You comfortable? 
CAMERON Hi. No. 
SLOANE What a fabulous car! 
109  INT. HALLWAY                                                109

HELICOPTER SHOT moves in on the world's tallest building. As it passes we see three figures pressed against the windows. 
FERRIS (VO) This is the world's tallest building. From our vantage point here on the 103 floor, we are provided with a view of four states. 
CAMERON (VO) Do you think the car's alright? 
FERRIS (VO) Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and my personal favorite, Indiana.

Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are standing against the window. 
CAMERON I don't feel good, Ferris. Are we gonna stay long? 
FERRIS Take a step back... 
Ferris steps back. Sloane and Cameron follow suit. 
FERRIS Now, lean against the glass. Like this... 
He leans forward, putting all his weight on his forehead. 
FERRIS And look down. 
Sloane leans forward. Cameron follows, reluctantly. 
SLOANE Oh, shit! 
HER POV 
The street far, far below. A dizzying view. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK 
The three are leaning against the glass. 
SLOANE What if the glass gives? 
FERRIS Death. 
SLOANE Cool. 
CU. CAMERON 
He's looking down.

112  EXT. STREET LEVEL                                           112 
A middle-aged man, Cameron's father, HORACE FRYE, is standing on the street corner. He's lean, clean, tough and humorless. He's wearing a puzzled look on his face. 
CAMERON'S FATHER I think I see my car. 
HIS POV 
The Ferrari screams down the avenue and disappears down the underground ramp. 
113  INT. SEARS TOWER LOBBY                                      113 
Ferris and Sloane bound down the escalator. Cameron follows glumly. They dance past the giant Calder mobile. They're singing. 
FERRIS AND SLOANE I BEEN ALL 'ROUND THIS GREAT BIG WORLD AND I'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF GIRLS YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET BACK IN THE STATES BACK TO THE CUTEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA

Ferris and Sloane burst out the doors garnering the annoyed stares of the business people busily going in and out of the building. Cameron politely waits his turn to exit. Ferris and Sloane head down the street. Cameron follows.

Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are sitting in the gallery watching the proceedings. 
SLOANE Do you love me? 
FERRIS Do you love me? 
SLOANE I asked you first. 
FERRIS Yes. You? 
SLOANE Yes. 
FERRIS Would I trash a day of education to be with you if I didn't love you? 
SLOANE Yes. 
FERRIS Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I didn't love you? 
SLOANE Yes. 
SLOANE What? 
FERRIS Let's go feed Cameron. 
They stand up and head out. Ferris hangs back a moment. He cups his hands to his mouth. He yells at the top of his voice. 
FERRIS BUY! 
And he exits. Cool and casual. 
118  INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE.  TRADING FLOOR            118 
It explodes with activity in response to Ferris' shout. We HEAR A RADIO ANNOUNCER. 
ANNOUNCER Commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading... 
119  EXT. RESTAURANT                                             119

Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are standing in the restaurant. Ferris is looking at the maitre 'd's reservations book. 
HIS POV 
His fingers runs down to a party of three for 12:00. 
INT. RESTAURANT 
The maitre'd returns. 
MAITRE'D (to Ferris) May I help you? 
FERRIS Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of three for 12:00. 
The maitre'd looks at Ferris curiously. 
FERRIS Is there a problem? 
MAITRE'D You're Abe Frohman? 
FERRIS I'm Abe Frohman. 
MAITRE'D (chuckles) I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right now. If you have trouble finding the door... 
Sloane tugs Ferris' sleeve. He ignores her. 
FERRIS Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am? 
MAITRE'D Shall I call the police? 
CAMERON Let's go...Abe. 
FERRIS I'm not going anywhere. (to the Maitre'd) Call the police. Go ahead. Better yet... (grabs the phone) ...I'll call myself. 
Cameron chokes. Sloane grits her teeth. The maitre'd smiles smuggly. 
CU. PHONE 
Ferris punches out a number. A beat and the restaurant's second line lights up and the phone rings. 
INT. RESTAURANT 
The maitre'd motions for the phone so that he can answer the call. Ferris waves him off angrily. 
FERRIS You touch me and I yell "rat!" There's another phone around here. Find it. 
The maitre'd backs off. 
CAMERON Ferris, let's split, please? 
SLOANE Cameron's right. We're gonna get busted. 
FERRIS Not a chance in the world. 
He hands the phone to Sloane. 
FERRIS Ask for Abe Frohman. 
INT. RESTAURANT. LATER 
Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are seated in the restaurant. The maitre'd is hovering over Ferris. 
MAITRE'D I appreciate your understanding. 
FERRIS Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten. 
MAITRE'D Enjoy your luncheon. 
FERRIS Thank you. 
The maitre'd backs away. Ferris smiles. Sloane is impressed. Cameron is flushed with nerves. 
FERRIS Darling, you were wonderful. 
SLOANE Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher. 
FERRIS Cameron, dear friend? 
Cameron looks to Ferris. 
FERRIS And you thought we wouldn't have any fun. Shame on you. 
Ferris disappears behind his menu. 
124  INT. RESTAURANT                                             124 
Cameron and Sloane have been served their lunches. They're staring at the plates. 
CAMERON What is it? 
SLOANE I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested. 
CAMERON I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us. 
Ferris slides over to the table and drops into his seat. 
FERRIS What are you doing? 
Cameron looks at Ferris. 
CAMERON What is this shit? 
FERRIS You got me. I don't speak French. 
He puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate. 
FERRIS I think it's a land-based beefoid creature. 
He takes a bite. He savors the taste. 
FERRIS Splendid. 
CAMERON Really? 
FERRIS Superb. 
Cameron and Sloane try theirs. They chew tentatively. 
FERRIS Good? 
Sloane and Cameron shrug. It's not bad. A WAITER passes. Ferris stops him. 
FERRIS Yo, Clouseau! 
The waiter stops and looks at Ferris indignantly. 
FERRIS I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here? 
The waiter glances at the plates. 
WAITER Sweetbreads. 
FERRIS Uh, huh. And what might that be? 
WAITER Pancreas. 
FERRIS As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism? 
CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON 
They stop chewing. They're holding their sweetbreads in their mouths. 
CU. FERRIS 
He continues his questioning. 
FERRIS ...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans? 
CU. WAITER 
He nods broadly, knowing that he's spoiling the kids' meal. 
CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON 
They look at each other. 
CU. FERRIS 
He pats his mouth with his napkin. He looks to Cameron and Sloane. He raises a finger, holds it a beat and gives a cue. 
CU. WAITER 
He turns away as Sloane and Cameron spit out their food. 
CU. FERRIS 
He watches Sloane and Cameron then glances at the waiter. 
FERRIS Check, please! 
125  EXT. RESTAURANT                                             125 
Tom and his two GUESTS are standing at the curb, talking. A cab is waiting. The door's open. In the B.G. Ferris, Sloane and Cameron come out of the restaurant. They approach the cab. Tom's back it to Ferris. Ferris stops cold. 
FERRIS, SLOANE, CAMERON 
They turns on cue at Tom, now in the B.G., turns toward the restaurant. 
FERRIS 40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to. 
CAMERON We're gonna get nabbed, for sure. 
FERRIS No way, Cameron. Only the meek get nabbed. The bold survive. Let's go. 
He turns to the cab. Sloane and Cameron turn slowly. 
EXT. STREET. CAB 
Tom and his party are still jawing at curbside. Ferris, Sloane and Cameron slowly approach the cab. Behind the backs of the men, Ferris scoots Sloane into the cab. Cameron dashes in. The Ferris hops the cab. 
FERRIS One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits. It's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past. 
CAMERON It's human nature to like what you had better than what you have. 
SLOANE Agreed. 
A loud speaker on the boat identifies a point of interest. 
LOUDSPEAKER TO YOUR LEFT IT THE WORLD'S TALLEST BUILDING... 
The three look to the left. 
LOUDSPEAKER, FERRIS, SLOANE, CAMERON The Sears Tower. 
CAMERON You know, this is all very interesting but I'm starving. 
FERRIS An hour ago you wanted to yack. 
CAMERON I feel better now. 
FERRIS Lean over and grab a fish. 
Cameron looks over the side of the boat. An obtuse thought flashes through Sloane's brain. 
SLOANE What comes after a nuclear winter? 
FERRIS Nuclear spring. 
129  EXT. SCHOOL                                                 129 
Meanwhile... 
130  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DEAN'S OFFICE                      130 
Jeanie is having a small moral debate with herself. 
JEANIE It's reprehensible to squeal on your own flesh and blood...but it's for his own good. His cavalier attitude will get him into trouble later in life...and it'll continue to piss me off and I'll get so wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer and he'll ruin my life. Screw him. 
She slips into the Dean's outer office. 
131  INT. DEAN'S OUTER OFFICE                                    131 
Rooney's secretary is behind her desk. Jeanie walks in. The secretary looks up and greets her with a weary smile. 
SECRETARY Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering you now? 
Jeanie scowls at her. 
JEANIE Is Dean Rooney in? 
SECRETARY I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you? 
JEANIE (condescending) I seriously doubt it. When's he back? 
SECRETARY I don't know. He left the grounds on personal business. 
132  EXT. STREET. CU. CURB                                       132 
A car tire rolls into FRAME and stops. Slide across to the sidewalk. Rooney's dress shoe steps out onto the pavement. Move up to reveal Rooney standing at the door of his bile-green LeBaron. Rooney peels off his shades and looks around like he's Dirty Harry. In his mind he is Dirty Harry. 
CU. FIRE HYDRANT 
Rooney's dres shoe on the hydrant. He ties his lace and pulls up his sock. 
EXT. STREET 
Rooney straightens his tie and jacket and slips into a rowdy hot dog joint. 
133  INT. HOT DOG STAND                                          133 
It's jammed with construction workers, secretaries, suburban businessmen. It's loud and confusing. Rooney pushes his way in and scopes the crowd. 
HIS POV 
A young person is playing a video game in a far corner. 
CU. ROONEY 
He suspects it's Ferris. It look sort of like Ferris. He smiles and cuts into the crowd. 
CU. THE BACK OF THE VIDEO PLAYER'S HEAD 
MOVE IN on the player. 
ROONEY (OC) I've been waiting a long time for this. 
The player looks up. 
ROONEY (OC) Your ass is mine. 
The player turns around. It's a GIRL. 
CU. ROONEY 
The blood evacuates his face. He stares at the girl. 
CU. GIRL 
She stares at him. She picks up her Coke. She puts the straw to her lips and sucks. 
CU. ROONEY 
He's still staring. He can't think of anything to say. 
CU. GIRL 
SLOANE I'm not sure but I think I know who Ferris was. 
CAMERON Hannibal. 
SLOANE From the A-Team? 
CAMERON No. The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland. 
Sloane laughs at herself. They step out of the crowd and head down the street in the direction the parade's heading. 
SLOANE I think if he was anybody, he was Magellan. You know, the guy who went around the world. 
Cameron nods. 
SLOANE I could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission. 
CAMERON Yeah. As long as I've known him, everything works for him. There's nothing he can't handle. I can't handle anything. School, parents, the future. Ferris can do anything. 
EXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT 
Ferris is playing "TWIST AND SHOUT" on the accordian. The girls on the float are singing. 
FERRIS WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW! 
GIRLS SHAKE IT UP, BABY 
FERRIS TWIST AND SHOUT! 
GIRLS TWIST AND SHOUT! 
FERRIS COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON! COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT! 
GIRLS WORK IT ON OUT! 
EXT. STREET. SLOANE AND CAMERON 
They continue their conversation. 
SLOANE The future's worse for a boy, isn't it? 
Cameron doesn't understand what she means. 
SLOANE A girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her. 
CAMERON That's a pretty grim thought. 
SLOANE True, but it's an option. No options is worse. 
CAMERON I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
SLOANE College. 
CAMERON Yeah, but to do what? 
SLOANE What are you interested in? 
CAMERON Nothing. 
SLOANE Me either. 
They walk on for a few beats. We HEAR "TWIST AND SHOUT" GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER. The sons is taking over all the other tunes in the band. It's infecting the entire parade. 
CAMERON What do you think Ferris is gonna do? 
EXT. STATE STREET. MARCHING BAND 
They're playing TWIST AND SHOUT. 
EXT. STREET. MOUNTED POLICE OFFICER 
He's singing.

He singing along. 
NEWSPAPER SELLER TWIST A LITTLE CLOSER! 
EXT. STREET. CHOIR GROUP 
They're marching down the parade. They're singing in their angleic voices. 
CHOIR AND LET ME KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE! 
ROONEY I'm not leaving, Ferris. 
There's no response. Rooney rings the doorbell again. The pre-recorded litany starts over. 
FERRIS' VOICE Who is it? 
Rooney doesn't realize that he's listening to a recording. 
ROONEY Don't get smart with me Ferris! 
FERRIS' VOICE I'm sorry I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid that in my weakened condition... 
Rooney leans back from the door. He can't quite figure out what's going on. But's it's highly suspicious. 
143  INT. HOUSE. LIVING ROOM                                     143 
Rooney steps through the hedges and peeks in the windows. We HEAR FERRIS' VOICE inside. 
FERRIS' VOICE You may reach my parents at their places of business. 
144  INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN                                         144 
Rooney tries to peak in the kitchen window. 
FERRIS' VOICE I appreciate your conern for my well-being. It will be remembered long after... 
145  EXT. HOUSE. BACKDOOR                                        145 
A black rubber doggie door. The type that allows a dog to come and go as it pleases. Rooney is crouched down. He lifts the doggie door and peeks in the house. 
HIS POV 
Along the kitchen floor. Through the kitchen, into the dining room. We hear a LARGE DOG GROWL. 
CU. ROONEY 
He's peaking through the door. He hears the dog. His face freezes. 
FERRIS Have a nice day. 
EXT. HOUSE. DOGGIE DOOR 
A Rottweiler bursts through the doggie door in a fury of gnashing teeth and foam. 
146  CU. LARGE BREASTS                                           146 
Tassled pasties twirl like airplane propellers. 
CU. CAMERON, FERRIS AND SLOANE 
They're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted strip joint. Cameron's mouth is open in amazement. Sloane is embarrassed and revolted. 
CAMERON How does she do that? One goes one way, one goes the other. 
FERRIS She's probably schizophrenic. 
SLOANE Ferris, this is nauseating me. Really. I'm losing respect for you by the bucket. 
FERRIS You don't think it's amazing that we got in? 
SLOANE Who wants to get in? 
FERRIS Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake. I'm talking about a major achievement in false identification. 
SLOANE I'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands. 
FERRIS Point well taken. But consider why she does it. Why she does it and you don't. 
SLOANE I'm not a tramp. 
FERRIS Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend. A parent. A child... (to CAMERA) This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic. I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it. 
He flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis impression. A sappy, do-wop track FADES UP. The club lights go down. Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness. Ferris stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of blue light. 
FERRIS You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance. You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known. 
He climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight. 
FERRIS Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you. Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down... 
Elvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark ballad sign-off. 
ELVIS IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN? SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN? TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT? 
Ferris drops his head. Like the King would. 
147  EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET. CAMERON'S CAR                         147 
Cameron's father is looking at the car. He's studying it. It looks terribly familiar. He leans into the open car and reaches for the glovebox to see if the contents will confirm if it's his. He freezes. He looks up slowly. 
HIS POV 
The Attendant and the Rastaman are glowering at him. They're holding bags of fried chicken. 
ATTENDANT You looking for something in my car? 
CU. CAMERON'S FATHER 
He shakes his head, no. 
CAMERON'S FATHER No. 
148  EXT. FERRIS' TOWN. JEANIE                                   148 
Jeanie's standing at her car. She's staring incredulously into the distance. Her mouth's open. She's shaking her head slowly. 
EXT. BACKYARD. ROONEY 
He's standing outside the fence. He's missing a shoe. His suit pants are torn from the crotch to the knee. His suit coat pocket is torn off. His hair's messed and there're grass-stains on his knees and elbows. He's looking in at the dog. 
ROONEY That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you worthless mutt! 
HIS POV 
The Rottweiler leaps at CAMERA. 
152  EXT. CITY STREET                                            152 
Ferris is leading the way down Michigan Avenue. He's hustling through the crowd. He has Sloane by the hand. She's jogging to keep up. Cameron's a few steps behind. He keeps bumping into people. Ferris and Sloane make the turn at Wacker Driver and disappear into the Stone Container Building. Cameron follows, mumbling again. 
CAMERON Money...tits...please... 
153  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT                                           153 
A florist truck pulls up in front of the house. A DELIVERY MAN gets out iwth a huge floral arrangement. He heads up to the house. 
154  EXT. HOUSE. PORCH                                           154 
Rooney's sitting on the porch patting a bloody knee with his handkerchief. The delivery man hops up on the steps. Rooney looks up at him. He greets Rooney cheerily. 
DELIVERY MAN Howdy! 
He presses the doorbell. A beat and we hear Ferris' recording. 
FERRIS' VOICE Who is it? 
The Deliver Man presses the intercom. 
DELIVERY MAN Focus on Flowers. I have a delivery. 
FERRIS' VOICE I'm sorry but I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid... 
ROONEY                              FERRIS' VOICE It's a recording, asshole.        ...that in my weakened condition, I could take a DELIVERY MAN            nasty spill and subject What's your problem?              myself to further school absenses... ROONEY                        (pause) He's one of my students.          You can reach my parents at their places of DELIVERY MAN            business. Thank you for Little bugger's dying.            stopping by. I appreciate your concern for my well- ROONEY                  being. It will be What?                             remembered long after this illness has passed. 
DELIVERY MAN As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney. 
FERRIS' VOICE Have a nice day. 
DELIVERY MAN (to the intercom) Thank you. (continues) I don't know the details. But my boss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids. He's very popular. 
Rooney is flabbergasted. 
DELIVERY MAN Nobody's home here? 
ROONEY No. 
DELIVERY MAN You gonna be around for awhile? 
ROONEY I imagine so. 
DELIVERY MAN You wanna keep an eye on these? 
Rooney looks at the flowers. Then he looks at the Delivery Man. 
DELIVERY MAN (happy sigh) It really touches me that so many people are rallying behind this guy. I guess there's hope for the human race afterall. 
He hands the arrangement to Rooney. 
DELIVERY MAN Gotta run. 
He bounds off the porch and trots to the truck. Rooney looks incredulously at the arrangement. He opens the attached card. 
ROONEY (defeated) Oh, Christ... 
CU. CARD 
It's signed:

157  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                          157 
Jeanie's car pull in the driveway. We hear her car radio. 
D.J. His name is Ferris Mueller. 
FERRIS Bueller. Ferris Bueller. 
INT. CAR. JEANIE 
She goes into shock. Her eyes blink, her head cocks. 
D.J. Sorry about that. 
FERRIS It's cool. 
Jeanie draws back and punches out her radio. 
CU. CAR ANTENNA 
The impact of her blow to the radio shoots the antenna in the air. 
FERRIS' VOICE My input on the Star Wars defense plan was pretty substantial so I guess this is their way of rewarding me. I'm pretty flattered. 
EXT. CAR 
Joyce and her clients leave a show house and head toward the car. 
INT. CAR 
Boyd looks out the window as his parents and Joyce appear. 
D.J. VOICE Can you stay around and take a few phone calls? 
FERRIS' VOICE I'd really like to but I have a kidney operation in about an hour. 
EXT. CAR 
Joyce and her clients take one last look at the house. 
JOYCE If you're willing to commit a little time and a little money to this place, you can really have something to be proud of. Don't let the black living room throw you off. 
She opens the car door. 
INT. CAR 
The door opens. 
D.J. VOICE I wish you the best of luck. 
FERRIS' VOICE Thanks, Steve. 
D.J. VOICE A very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller. 
Joyce gets in. The clients get in the other side. A song starts. 
JOYCE (to the kid) Well, Boyd, how are you bearing up? 
The kid stares at her. 
JOYCE Did I tell you I have a son your age? 
BOYD Twice. 
JOYCE His name is Ferris. I think you'd like him. 
Boyd sits up in the seat at the mention of Ferris' name. 
BOYD Is he going up in the space shuttle in September? 
Joyce looks around at Boyd. She gives him a curious look. 
JOYCE Not that I know of. 
BOYD I knew he was bullshitting. 
MOTHER Watch your mouth. 
BOYD How do you watch your mouth? 
JOYCE Do you know my son? 
FATHER Don't pay any attention to him. He thinks it's cute to bait adults. 
BOYD I don't think it's cute. I think it's fun. 
Joyce give him a puzzled smile and starts the car. 
174  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                           174 
Jeanie's on the phone. She's in a panic. 
JEANIE This is not a phoeny phone call. There's an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in our kitchen. (pause) My name is Bueller. 
There's another pause. Jeanie's face drops. 
JEANIE It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but I'm in danger, okay? I'm very cute, I'm very alone and I'm very protective of my body. I'd rather not have it violated or killed. I need help! 
175  INT. KITCHEN                                                175 
Rooney's plugging his bloody nose with paper towel. The intercom goes on. 
JEANIE'S VOICE Excuse me. If whoever's in the house is still in the house, I'd like you to know that I have just called the police. If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get your ass out of my house real quick. 
Rooney stiffens with fear. 
JEANIE'S VOICE I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun. And a scorching case of herpes. 
176  EXT. STREET                                                 176 
Rooney's car is hooked to a tow truck. It's parked in front of a fire hydrant and the windshield is decorated with parking citations. In the distance SIRENS WAIL. 
177  EXT. PARKING LOT                                            177 
The three are waiting for the Ferrari. We HEAR TIRES SQUEALING, AN ENGINE REVING-OUT. Then the Ferrari pulls down the ramp and jams to a frightening stop. A BLACK GUY jumps out. Ferris hands him the parking stub. 
FERRIS Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp? 
BLACK GUY (matter-of-fact) About 60. 
FERRIS Stunning! 
He hands him a buck and opens the door and pulls the passenger seat forward for Cameron. 
FERRIS This is probably the last time you'll have to ride back here. Keep that in mind. 
Cameron gives him a look and squeezes in. 
JEANIE Thank...you... 
Her jaw goes slack. She blinks her eyes. 
HER POV 
The Delivery Man and a young ASSISTANT are standing at the door with floral arrangements. Spread all around them are more flowers. A sexy singing NURSE and a BALLOON MAN steps up on the porch. 
NURSE (sings) WE HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER WE HOPE YOU'RE FELLING FIT WE... 
The door slams shut. 
181  EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET                                    181 
Rooney's walking down the street. A school bus is crawling alongside him as kids hang out the windows. From inside we hear SHOUTING and seventeen different SONGS PLAYING ON BLASTERS. A top forty montage. 
KID Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing? 
Rooney doesn't respond. 
ANOTHER KID Did you get in a fight? 
Rooney keep walking. The bus doors open. The DRIVER calls out to him. 
DRIVER You want a lift? 
Rooney takes a few more steps. He stops. The bus stops. Rooney takes a deep breath. He climbs aboard the bus. 
182  INT. BUS                                                    182 
The bus is jammed with WONKS and WEINERETTES. The passengers are silent as they watch Rooney shuffle down the aisle and take an empty seat next to a skinny, myopic GIRL. 
CU. GIRL 
She looks at Rooney and smiles. She pushes her Coke bottle glasses up on her nose. 
CU. ROONEY 
He looks vacantly at her. 
CU. GIRL 
She holds her smile. 
GIRL I'll bet you never smelled a real school bus before. 
CU. ROONEY 
He stares at her. 
CU. GIRL 
She holds up a candy package. 
GIRL Gummi Bear? 
CU. ROONEY 
He stares at her. 
CU. GIRL 
She puts one in her mouth. 
GIRL They've been in pocket. They're real soft and warm. 
CU. BOY 
A rotund FRESHMAN BOY sitting across from Rooney is staring at him. 
CU. ROONEY 
He looks across to the kid. 
CU. BOY 
He leans forward. 
FRESHMAN BOY It's kind of like being in the belly of the beast isn't it? 
CU. ROONEY 
He turns him eyes to the front. The bus jerks forward and pulls away. 
183  EXT. BUS                                                    183 
It grinds through the gears as it heads down the quiet street. The BLASTERS go back on, the SHOUTING RESUMES. 
184  EXT. PARK                                                   184 
Cameron's laying on a picnic table. Sloane's sitting beside him on the table. She's stroking his hair. Ferris WALKS INTO THE FOREGROUND. He addresses CAMERA. 
FERRIS This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day. We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work. And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it. As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us. 
He begins to walk. We follow him. 
FERRIS Sloane's a bigger problem. She still has another year of high school. How do I deal with that? I was serious when I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't just teenage infatuation. That's what my parents call it. What do they call what they have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation. 
CU. CAMERON 
His eyes are closed. Sloane's stroking his hair. 
FERRIS (VO) Cameron's never been in love. At least no one's ever been in love with him. He's gonna marry the first girl he lays. And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance. She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work. 
CU. SLOANE 
EXT. BACKYARD 
Ferris sits Cameron on the edge of the Jacuzzi. 
FERRIS CAMERON! 
CU. CAMERON 
His eyes are closed. He's lifeless. 
CU. FERRIS 
His face is a mask of terror. He shakes Cameron. 
CU. SLOANE 
She's screaming. 
CU. CAMERON 
A smile spreads across his face. 
CU. FERRIS 
He sees the smile. He stops shaking Cameron. 
EXT. JACUZZI 
Ferris and Cameron are looking at each other. Sloane's still screaming. She realizes that Cameron's okay. She stops screaming. 
SLOANE What? 
FERRIS (Cameron) You asshole! 
Cameron's smiling. 
SLOANE What? 
Ferris starts to laugh. Cameron explodes with laughter. Sloane's bewildered. 
SLOANE What's so funny? 
186  INT. POLICE STATION. WAITING ROOM                           186 
Jeanie's sitting on a wooden bench with a WASTED TEENAGE BOY in a Triumph t-shirt, long hair, torn jeans, creepers, studs and chains. He's studying her. 
BOY Drugs? 
JEANIE No, thank you. I'm straight. 
BOY I meant, are you here for drugs? 
Jeanie stares at him. 
JEANIE Why are you here? 
BOY Drugs. 
JEANIE I don't know why I'm here. 
BOY Then why don't you go home? 
JEANIE Why don't you put your thumb up your butt? 
The boy stares at her. 
BOY You want to talk about your problem? 
JEANIE With you? Are you serious? 
BOY Yeah, I'm serious. 
JEANIE Blow yourself. 
Jeanie turns away. The boy crosses his legs. Jeanie looks back at him. 
JEANIE You really want to know what's wrong? 
The boy shrugs. 
JEANIE Alright. If you've got the time, I've got the troubles. In a nutshell, I hate my brother. How's that? 
BOY That's cool. Did you shoot him or something? 
JEANIE No, not yet. 
The boy nods. He understands the emotion. 
JEANIE I went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and I called the cops and they picked me up for making a phoney phone call. 
BOY What do you care if your brother ditches school? 
Jeanie stares at the boy. 
JEANIE Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go? 
BOY You could ditch. 
JEANIE I'd get caught. 
BOY So, you're pissed at him because he ditches and doesn't get caught? 
JEANIE Basically. 
The boy nods knowingly. 
He turns to CAMERA. 
FERRIS This is a big U-2 fan. 
CU. SLOANE 
She smiles proudly at Cameron. She applauds him. 
CU. CAMERON 
He's serious and determined. He has made up his mind and it appears that it won't be changed by anyone but himself. 
CU. TIRES 
It's spinning wildly. 
CU. MERCEDES BUMPER 
Cameron's foot rests on the bumper. A beat and it gives a mighty shove. 
CU. TIRE 
The spinning tires slam down on the cement. 
INT. GARAGE 
Cameron has kicked the Ferrari off the jack. It squeals out of the garage in a cloud of blue tire smoke. A $50,000 unmanned investment heading backwards down a driveway. 
CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS 
They're in shock. 
EXT. HOUSE 
The Ferrari shoots down the driveway. 
INT. GARAGE 
Cameron watches the car go. He's strangely placcid about the impending disaster. Ferris and Sloane are bewildered. 
THEIR POV 
The Ferrari travels down the driveway, across the street, over the curb into the wooded property opposite the house. 
CU. TREE 
The Ferrari's brief journey ends as it smacks a tree trunk. 
INT. GARAGE 
Ferris and Sloane exchange baffled looks. They look at Cameron. He's proud and bold. 
FERRIS What was that about? 
SLOANE This has to be a dream. 
FERRIS Cameron? One quick question. Why'd you do that? 
Cameron holds his proud posture for a beat. Then a look of bewilderment comes over his face. He shoots a look to Ferris. A puzzled look. 
FERRIS You trashed the car. 
Cameron looks across the street. 
SLOANE Why? 
CAMERON I took a stand. 
FERRIS No, Cameron. You wrecked a car. 
Cameron thinks for a moment. Then he regains his confidence. 
CAMERON It's okay. 
Ferris looks across the street at the car. 
FERRIS I have an idea. If you're interested. 
Cameron looks at him. He shakes his head. 
CAMERON I'm gonna handle it. 
FERRIS I think this could work. 
CAMERON No, thanks. I want to deal with it by myself. 
SLOANE What about your one word? 
CAMERON You already did it. If I need it again, I'll use it. 
He smiles. He raises am impish eyebrow. 
CAMERON It's cool. I'm loose. 
188  INT. POLICE STATION. OFFICE                                 188 
Joyce is talking with the juvenile officer. Outside the office, on the bench, we see Jeanie and the boy making out. 
JOYCE She's never been in trouble before. This is a shock to me. First, I don't know why she wasn't at school. Second, I don't know why she'd call you with this story about a rapist. 
OFFICER For whatever reasons she did it, I think she'd had a good scare. 
JOYCE I hope so. I appreciate your calling me. I can assure you that her father and I will have a long talk with her. 
The gathers her purse and jacket and stands.

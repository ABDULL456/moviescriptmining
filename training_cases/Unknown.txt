FADE IN: 
INT. PASSENGER JET - EARLY MORNING 
Sleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight. Most passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly. In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake, reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder. He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired. The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin. 
EXT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - EARLY MORNING 
Halo of lights. Giant talons, the airplane's LANDING GEAR appears through cloud. Tires hit slick asphalt. 
INT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME 
The couple. Dr. Martin Harris and Elizabeth Harris. WIDER: a German IMMIGRATION OFFICER glances up at MARTIN and LIZ. KA- CHUNK! KA-CHUNK! Stamps both passports, swipes the bar codes over a scanner, hands them back. Martin slips his into a leather briefcase. 
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - DAWN 
Raining. A melee of travelers and vehicles. Liz beside him, Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush. An ATTENDANT ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER... a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper, piling their bags into the trunk, cursing. Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver... 
I/E. TAXI CAB - DAWN The DRIVER merges onto the autobahn. Liz yawns with jet-lag, studies Martin who stares out at the passing city. 
LIZ Hey... You're gonna do great. You always do. 
I/E. TAXI/HOTEL IMPERIAL, BERLIN - MORNING Modern 'Deco Revival' hotel/conference center. A banner welcomes delegates to the World Biotechnology Forum. The Harris' taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red-eye travelers arriving for early morning check-in. Martin takes out his billfold. 
MARTIN I'll do this. You check in. Liz pecks his cheek, gets out. Martin leans forward. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) How much do we owe you? 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME 
Liz presses up to the crowded desk. A busy RECEPTIONIST takes Liz's booking slip. 
LIZ The Eisenhower suite. Dr. and Mrs. Harris. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT - SAME 
A BELLHOP holds a large umbrella up to the rain, loads the Harris' bags onto his cart. Shuts the trunk, the taxi pulls away. Heading for the entrance... 
BELLHOP Welcome to the Hotel Imperial. Have you stayed with us before? 
MARTIN No, this is our first visit to Berlin. We're -- -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the luggage cart. He turns, tracks the their taxi, already pulling out of the drive... 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME 
a stab of concern on Liz's face. 
LIZ What do you mean the suite may not be available? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RECEPTIONIST I have to check with the manager. Security inspections of the rooms are still being completed. 
LIZ But we confirmed two months ago. Receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a ringing phone. Liz sighs, glances back toward the entrance. Suddenly curious as she sees... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE FILMY RED . of light seen from behind closed eyelids. Quiet... except for a distant sound. CRACKLING. Like falling rain. The sound growing. Close now. Filling our ears, as... 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
.a tiny pin-hole of light, TOO BRIGHT. GLIMPSES of a NURSE as she tears the wrapping off a fresh drip sac... 
BLACK .A man's voice... distant. German words. Small, faded image of a German DOCTOR, speaking with the nurse... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLACK .again, a pin-hole of consciousness. The Nurse, taking a private moment, speaking in German on her cell-phone. The Nurse looks over, straight at us, realization in her face, she hurries from the room. We REVOLVE... finding... MARTIN HARRIS. Arms by his sides. A few days beard. A sutured cut on his temple. His eyes fluttering, barely open... then closing. Clipboard beside the bed. An admission form. In German. Where Martin's name should be: "unbekannte maennliche Person", and the SUBTITLE becomes our MAIN TITLE... 
'UNKNOWN WHITE MALE'... 
CLOSE - MARTIN'S FACE Squeak of a door. Distant FOOTSTEPS. Quiet again. Just the distant PULSE of his heartbeat. His eyes... flick OPEN. 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. - HIS SURROUNDINGS... Vision BLURRED, BLINKING to focus. Scrubbed floor, white walls, Banks of drips and monitors, his possessions on a table near him... 
VOICE (O.S.) Konnen Sie mich horen? 
MARTIN'S EYES -- TRACKING OVER Daylight through a window. Sitting by the bed is a dark- haired man with a van Dyke beard. DR. FARGE. 
FARGE Wenn Sie mich horen konnen, blinken Sie zweimal. He watches as Martin's eyes tilt. Look directly at him. A sound. A dry croak... slowly forms itself into speech: 
MARTIN I... I don't... speak German... 
FARGE (beat - accented) Are you English? 
MARTIN . American... A beat. Farge signals the Nurse to come in. Speaks to him slowly and clearly in English: 
(CONTINUED) 
S. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
FARGE My name is Doctor Farge. You are in the Waldfriede Hospital. I'm the head neurologist here. You have been in an accident. 
(BEAT) Can you tell me your name? Beat. Martin nods. Voice weak. 
MARTIN Martin... Harris. Doctor... Martin Harris... Farge exchanges a look with the nurse. To Martin... 
FARCE Where are you staying? Is there anyone here, in Berlin, that we 
MIGHT -- Martin suddenly looks around, struggles to sit up. 
MARTIN My wife.. ? 
(SUDDEN PANIC) Where's my wife? Liz...? Is she hurt? Where is she --?! 
FARGE Doctor Harris, it's all right. The taxi you were in went into the river. You were the only passenger. Your heart stopped for six minutes. It is Thursday, November 27th. For four days you have been in a coma. 
MARTIN Thanksgiving... but my wife... she's in Berlin with me. Where is she? Why isn't she here? 
FARGE We didn't find any identification with you, Doctor Harris... the driver, who saved your life, disappeared soon after the accident and no one else has come forward. I must apologize, but we had no idea who you were. It sinks in. Martin shakes his head wretchedly. 
MARTIN Oh, Jesus... Liz doesn't know... She'll... she'll be worried sick. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
FARGE Calm down, Doctor Harris, please. Where can we reach your wife? Does she have a cell phone? 
MARTIN .Liz? 
INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
. hallway leads into the spacious sitting room. No one there. Draped over a chair, Martin recognizes Liz's jacket. Martin smiles, blinks against tears, he's home. Sound of MOVEMENT from the BEDROOM DOOR... 
MARTIN Liz! I'm here, I... A HOTEL MAID appears from the bedroom door. Startled as she sees Martin... 
MARTIN (CONT'D) My wife... Meine Frau... I'm looking for Mrs. Harris... She suddenly gets him... nodding, pointing down. 
MAID Ah. Entpfang... reception... 
INT. HOTEL IMPERIAL, MEZZANINE LEVEL - NIGHT 
World MUSIC. GUESTS flow in through the ornate doors. Martin moves among them. Significantly under-dressed in his tattered jacket, the sutured head injury. Almost at the doors... when a hotel SECURITY GUARD intercepts him. 
GUARD Excuse me, sir. Do you have an invitation, sir? 
MARTIN No... I mean yes... Distracted, still looking at passing faces... 
MARTIN (CONT'D) I don't have it with me. My name's Harris, Dr. Martin Harris. I'm on the list. My wife is Elizabeth Harris. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN (CONT'D) I'm trying to find her. I've been in the hospital. As the guard checks a screen, a crop-haired man in a cheap suit nearby tracks them: HERR STRAUSS, head of hotel security. He approaches, also checks the screen as the guard speaks to him quietly in German. 
STRAUSS Dr. Harris. Do you have any other identification? Passport? Drivers license? 
MARTIN I've already told this gentleman, I've been in the hospital. I was in an accident... Martin sees someone through the crowd... 
P.O.V. -- ENTERING FROM THE FAR DOOR a striking, intense-looking man with dark, wiry hair, a designer laptop bag slung over his shoulder. Smiling, arms around his two ten year old daughters, twin GIRLS, prettily dressed. Immediately the center of attention. People moving forward to meet him. Flashguns POP... MARTIN, raises his hand, calling out: 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Professor Bressler! Words lost in the noise. Martin pushes toward him. But: 
STRAUSS I'm sorry, sir... 
MARTIN That's Professor Bressler, right there. He knows me, he can confirm who I am. 
STRAUSS If you would be patient, sir. 
MARTIN No, I'm done being patient... Martin stops short. Staring past them: 
MARTIN (CONT'D) That's her, that's my wife. Over there. By the buffet table. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
P.O.V -- GLIMPSED THROUGH THE CROWD Liz. Looking superb in a black evening dress. In conversation with a group of men and women. 
MARTIN Seeing her. The look on his face. Processing... an overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) That's her. That's Liz, my wife. Strauss stares at him blankly. Martin starts to lose it. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Look I have been missing for four days and she has no idea what happened to me! So you need to take me to her, right now. Heads are turning. A beat. Herr Strauss mutters to the guard, then beckons Martin to accompany him inside. 
MARTIN AND STRAUSS thread through the crush. Martin ignoring the glances he's getting. His eyes fixed on Liz... her back to him. A glass of wine in her hand... her golden hair... the ivory skin of her shoulders. Strauss taps her on the arm. She half turns... 
STRAUSS Excuse me Madam. Your husband is here. He needs to -- 
MARTIN Liz... Liz turns fully. That beauty. A flash of surprise as she sees Martin. His clothes. The suture on his head. 
CONTINUED: (5) 
MARTIN (CONT'D) (to Liz, serious) It's not funny. I was hurt... Liz just stares at him, afraid, anchored to Martin B's arm. 
TNT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Seen through glass. A WALL OF MONITORS show images from around the hotel. Inside, Martin sits, surrounded. 
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME 
Martin rocks in a chair; restless, hands knotted. A FEMALE DETECTIVE watches him. An OLDER DETECTIVE is on the phone. Strauss sits near him, studying him, while a TECHNICIAN fast- forwards 4-PANE video of the hotel reception area, the drive in front of the hotel... 
MARTIN There! Right there! ON THE VIDEO: Slowing to real-time. Liz, arriving at reception, speaking with the Receptionist, gesturing outside. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) That's Liz, and I... I must have been outside, I... I can't remember. The video plays on. Liz thanks the receptionist, leaves. 
STRAUSS As you can see... you're not there. Martin STARES at him, helpless. The Older Detective hangs up the phone... 
OLDER DETECTIVE Immigration confirms the arrival of a Doctor and Mrs. Harris on November 23rd at 16.37. An hour later they checked into their suite at the Hotel. Martin breathes in. Chooses his words carefully. 
MARTIN He's not Martin Harris. I am Martin Harris. The man downstairs is pretending to be me. 
OLDER DETECTIVE And this impostor... may I ask? Did he also steal your wife? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Silence. Martin searching for a response. The hint of a smile on the female detective's face. 
MARTIN He's forcing her... he must have-- 
STRAUSS -- but why? Exactly? .Why? There's no answer to that. Martin looks down. A beat. 
MARTIN This... this is insane. He stares at their faces. He calms himself, trying to get a grip. A memory resurfacing... 
MARTIN (CONT'D) My lab number... at Dartmouth... Call my assistant, she can verify who I am. Call her right now... He picks up a pad, scribbles down the number. Beat. The female detective picks up the phone, dials. She switches to speaker. RINGING TONE. CLICK. A recorded message... 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hello. This is 235-0535, the office of Doctor Martin Harris. If you're calling... The older detective presses "off". Martin recalling... 
MARTIN it's Thanksgiving... no one's going to be there till Monday... (racking his brain) Rod... Rodney Cole... he's a colleague. A friend. I know his number... 603-389-4457... Female detective dutifully dials the number. RINGING again. CLICK of a machine. Then a jovial male voice: 
VOICE (O.S.) 
(THROUGH PHONE) This is Doctor Cole. I'm having an out-of-office experience right now, so... leave a message. Click. Awkward SILENCE. Martin flailing... 
MARTIN Professor Bressler, talk to him. He's why I'm in Berlin. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
STRAUSS You want us to disturb a Nobel prize winning scientist, simply to attest to your story... when no crime has been committed? 
MARTIN But it has!... That man has taken everything from me, don't you see? You have to arrest him... 
STRAUSS For what? Entering the country legally? Presenting all the correct documentation? ON ONE OF THE MONITORS: A view of the Rose Room: Liz and Martin B visible in the corner, dining. 
STRAUSS (CONT'D) (off the monitor) .And sharing a hotel suite with his wife? Excuse me, your wife? 
MARTIN 
(EYES GLUED) She is my wife! 
OLDER DETECTIVE Even if she is your wife, sharing a room with her is not illegal. Not in Germany. 
FEMALE DETECTIVE (German, subtitled:) Look at her. Soon we'll have twenty more men claiming to be her husband. The room tries not to laugh, can't help smiling. The monitor image flips, now just a corridor. 
MARTIN 
MARTIN Rodney it's me, Martin. Rod, I'm in Berlin for the conference, but it's Liz. She's... I'm in trouble, Rod... Phone issues a DEMAND for more money. Martin fumbles for change, drops a crumpled ball of Euros into the GUTTER. 
INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - ROSENTHALER PLATZ - NIGHT 
'Hotel' is a charitable description. Martin counts out sodden bills, hands them to a WOMAN behind the desk. She in turn gives Martin a form to fill. 
WOMAN Fur Reisepaf3... passport... A beat. Martin looks at her, helpless. The woman sighs. Pushes back his money. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) Nicht Reisepal3, nicht Hotelzimmer. Police... very bad. 
EXT. TRANSIT HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER 
Martin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold. He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling. He squints, paranoid, checks the other way... His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz. 
EXT. S-BAHN STATION BERLIN MITTE - NIGHT 
Martin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the advertisements. Happy sexy Germans smile back at him... The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his. He slowly becomes aware, glances back. MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away... Martin STOPS, listens... nothing. He starts to move again, aware that the delicate "click" of the following steps also begins again. UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform, several late-night travelers waiting. Martin begins to hurry... the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed. Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING. Martin gives up cool, starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its noise eclipsing all sound. Doors open and Martin leaps in, turns to face the open door... .moments pass, the car's bell signals. Then a MAN appears, rushing from the corridor, one hand raised. 
MAN (German, subtitled:) Please! Hold the door! He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one hand. He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door. The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to move. The man shakes his head: foreigners. 
INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - NIGHT 
Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the few passengers in the car... a nondescript man a few benches down who stares at him, then back to his paper. Martin eyes him, paranoid. Slowly gives up, lets his gaze plays over the adverts. Times, dates... Nov 26th. Memories reawakened... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Has to write something down. Fumbles in his jacket for his the copy of 'Horticus,' looking for a blank page to write on. A piece of CARD falls from between its pages. Something printed on one side. Martin flips it over, scribbles on the other: "28th. Bressler. 12.30..." Other times, dates, numbers. Everything he can remember... Sudden overwhelming fatigue. The roar of the train. VOICES. Lights racing by the windows. Martin's eyelids droop. Flickering. Closing... 
SUDDEN FLASH CUT - FRACTURED MEMORY... . LECTURE HALL, younger Liz in the audience. Students CLAPPING. Smiling older colleague SHAKING his hand... becoming... bees' WINGS swarming in their hive... YOUNG MARTIN watching mesmerized through a magnifying glass... their movement morphing into NAKED BODIES. Urgent, passionate. Martin and Liz making love. 
WHOMPF! SUDDEN SHIFT -- A HOTEL BEDROOM... . Liz towelling her hair. Only now it's dark, and cut short. Turns, smiles at him. Face close. Lips moving. 
LIZ Are you ready...? 
INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - MORNING 
Martin's eyes creak open. The train is still moving, but everything has changed. Morning passengers crowd the car, giving him space. An AMERICAN COUPLE, their bags tucked tight. The WIFE staring down at him. 
INT. S-BAHN BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Martin runs water, combs his hair with his fingers. Tries to press creases out of his stained suit. He stares into the graffiti-stained metal mirror of the bathroom. 
MARTIN Are you going to give up? 
(BEAT) okay. Solve the problem... 
INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT 
Martin sits in front of a stickered and stained monitor, eyes glued to the screen as he types in an URL. The Dartmouth Mail website appears. Martin types in his login, password. "Login failed. Please try again." 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Another attempt. Same results. He switches tactics. Types "Martin Harris" into Google... 605,000 results come back at him. On an impulse, he clicks "IMAGES."... .page after page of men young and old. Getting married, posing, partying, historical illustrations... Behind Martin, door jingles, a YOUNG MAN comes into the cafe, seats himself across and to the side of Martin. Martin focuses, tries 'Martin Harris, Phd'... Cursor clicks. A new window opens. 'The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination.' 'Research Faculty information: Dr. Martin Harris...' Contact numbers. No picture. He stares in disbelief... suddenly becomes AWARE of the man across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his computer... The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes, holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back. Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the page, the negation of his life on a small screen. 
THE YOUNG MAN . Glances over again. Martin catching him. 
MARTIN Can I help you? Hello? The guy points to his headphones, shrugs. Martin STARES at his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music seeping from the earbuds... nothing. Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT 
Martin slips into the alley, trots towards the street, glancing back. No one is following. He moves onto the street, waits at a light... eyes lock onto the familiar "Ace Taxi" logo of a taxi passing... 
SUDDEN FLASH OF MEMORY --: CARTWHEELING TAXI... Silent freefall dive. The 'Ace Taxis' logo... The face in the mirror. Looking back at him. Gina. Eyes meet... 
I /E. TAXI DEPOT - BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING Revving ENGINES. Echoing VOICES. Hunched against the drizzle, Martin pauses outside it. The playing card 'Ace Taxis' logo. Martin ducks under the open steel shutters... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE NURSE'S FACE FADING INTO... Far-off VOICES. Gurney MOVING beneath him. Looking up. Lights passing. RHYTHMIC SOUND of the wheels becoming... 
INT. MRI ROOM, WALDFRIEDE HOSPITAL - DAY 
.Claustrophobic nightmare; a support holds Martin's head rigid, earphones piping soothing CLASSICAL MUSIC, but the noise of the machine is all-engulfing. DUNN-DUNN-DUNN. The sound DEAFENING. Scanner moving over him... Martin's eyes empty... far far away. 
SMASH CUT INTO MEMORY - FRACTURED IMAGES... Undulating bodies moving over each other, Martin and Liz making love. Urgency building. Suddenly SHIFTING... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: . Martin B and Liz drinking in the hotel bar... she leaning over, whispering to him, intimate. 
BACK TO SCENE -- SUDDEN QUIET an abrupt jolt. Electric WHINE. Platform moves, sliding Martin out of the tube. His eyes open, take in the room. 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- TWO ORDERLIES .tending to him. One raises a needle, injects a CLOUDY SUBSTANCE into Martin's IV bag... .The MRI Control Booth, empty. Martin squints, a little confused. He raises his eyes, looks into the face of the man from the Internet Cafe! Call him JONES. 
MARTIN his mind struggles to compute. The sudden overwhelming realization that he's not insane. This man is HERE. His eyes DART as the other orderly glances over, the man from the train tunnel. Call him SMITH. He smiles at Martin, polite, nondescript. Ghostly in his disinterest. 
JONES Hello, Martin. This won't take very long. Martin tries to raise up but can't move -- his arms and legs are like lead. He opens his mouth to call out, his voice barely a murmur. His eyes lock on the IV bag, the steady drip... drip... down the line into his body... The two men quickly lift Martin, hefting him face-down onto a gurney. One arm dangles. 
MARTIN'S P.O.V.-- STRAIGHT DOWN -- The Men's shoes, thick soled, black. Linoleum Tile. Wheels of the gurney. -- Jones, stuffing his clothes and effects into a plastic bag, tossing them under the gurney. Smith pushing... 
NURSE (German, subtitles:) Excuse me, where are you taking this patient? Martin's vision RACKS, traces the Nurse's white sneakers, standing in the now open doorway to the room. Martin STRAINS to yell, to speak, nothing. He can just move his head enough to eyeball the IV. Drip... drip... drip... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JONES (German, subtitles:) We have instruction to move this patient to the American Hospital at Wiesbaden. Here are the papers. The rustle of paper. Martin CONCENTRATES, eyes on the IV tube, hanging between the bars of the gurney and his arm. Great Effort, He LEANS, pinching the tube closed. CLOSE ON THE IV: The drips... stop. 
NURSE (German, subtitles:) I'm surprised I wasn't informed... Let me check with -- A SOUND, like paper torn quick... and THE NURSE FALLS TO THE FLOOR, STARING UP AT MARTIN, 
HER THROAT CUT. Martin gazes down at her in HORROR as she bleeds out, staring upwards at him, the light in her eyes dying. Around him Smith and Jones start to MOVE, locking the door, opening cabinets, working fast, Martin's eyes lock on: a pair of scissors, tucked in her apron. Eyes watering, adrenaline surging, Martin WILLS his hand to reach down, palm the scissors, just as the Nurse's body is dragged away, leaving a trail of red... 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
The MRI ROOM door opens, the two 'orderlies' wheel the barely conscious Martin out into the corridor. Behind them, the room is spotless. They round a corner, almost at the EXIT... Doors ahead BLOW OPEN. Doctors, Paramedics rushing forward with various WOUNDED on gurneys. Something big has happened. Smith and Jones eye the madness coming their way, command decision, they duck into 
INT. PATIENT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
. where a feeble OLD MAN mumbles at them from his bed. They ignore the man, go about checking Martin. Jones lifts his head, pries open one eyelid after the other while Smith ties down his arms, covers him with a sheet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Suddenly, the door OPENS. A DOCTOR, breathless. 
DOCTOR (German, subtitles:) You two. We need help!. Right now! (off their hesitation) 
COME ON! NOW! No choice. They exit after the doctor, Jones glancing back at Martin as the door swings shut behind them. A beat. The covered shape on the gurney starts to MOVE. Martin's hand saws back and forth, using the scissors to cut the straps that bind him. ACROSS, the Old Man tracks the motion... scared. Success! A strap gives way. Martin paws the blanket weakly away. Feels along his arm, and pulls out the IV. Blood drips. He rises up, trying to orient... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FLARED, DISTORTED . the old MAN staring at him... DAZZLING daylight framed by a window... strange reverberating ECHOES... 
MARTIN . pulls himself upright. Tries to stand, but his body is like Jello. Reaches out, grabs the leg of a steel equipment trolley which TEETERS... CRASHES to the floor, showering Martin with a CASCADE of instruments and dressings. 
INT. RECOVERY ROOM (ALONG CORRIDOR) - SAME 
ALARMS RING. Emergency team clusters around a lifeless PATIENT, working fast. Smith and Jones, resentfully holding drip bags. They heard that. Turn, eyes meeting. Set down their drip bags. Edge back toward the door... 
INT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - SAME 
Smith and Jones, hurrying down the hall. Quick check into the patient's room reveals Martin GONE, the old man GESTURING, panicked... They moves on, fast, around a corner into... 
INT. HOSPITAL E.R. RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS 
Very busy. Patients... doctors and nurses. Smith and Jones push into the room, scanning... see:

JURGEN (CONT'D) He forgot. Germans are experts at forgetting. We forgot we were Nazis. Now we've forgotten forty years of Communism. All gone. But it's not just history that's forgotten. It's people, too. He sinks into a chair. Tired smile. 
JURGEN (CONT'D) But enough of me... 
LATER -- SMOKE RISES FROM A CIGARETTE Jurgen jots notes in a pad. Hand unsteady, he perches his cigarette on the ashtray, picks up the 'Horticus'. 
MARTIN I always have it with me. It was a gift from my father... Jurgen flips it open. Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS written inside the front endpaper. A beat. 
JURGEN These mean anything to you? 
MARTIN No. It's my wife's handwriting. 
JURGEN So, they mean something to her. He looks to Martin. Direct. 
JURGEN (CONT'D) Her involvement in this. There must have been something... in the past... some indication? A beat. Martin shakes his head, at a loss. Jurgen leafs on... the piece of CARD drops from between the pages. Jurgen picks it up. Martin's notations from the night before in the train: times... dates... places. 
MARTIN My schedule... for this week. It's everything I remember. Jurgen turns over the card. German print. A cheery cartoon Uncle Sam: 'Uncle Sam's Bowling & Billiards'. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) My friend Rodney Cole told us to go, said it was a blast. 
LATER STILL -- JURGEN Tapping his pencil on the pad... intrigued. 
JURGEN Passport, credit cards, family photos... things like these take time to prepare. You say this man has detailed knowledge of your research, of your relationship with... 
MARTIN Professor Bressler. He knows everything... 
JURGEN Including the fact that you were going to have a random accident that would allow him seamlessly to take your place? These people may be good, but they're not God. The question is, why would they want to take your place? What could they gain from being you? 
MARTIN They tried to kill me. 
JURGEN Yes, did you a favor I'd say. Now you have... Redlichkeit... Now you know you are right. 
MARTIN Do you believe me? A beat. Jurgen pours them both another brandy. 
JURGEN In the Stasi, we had a basic principle: Ask enough questions and a man who is lying will eventually change his story. But a man who tells the truth cannot change his, however unlikely his story sounds. I believe you are telling the truth, Doctor Harris. A long beat. Jurgen closes the notebook. 
JURGEN (CONT'D) I'll start by calling these numbers again... as you say, it's Thanksgiving...

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JURGEN (CONT'D) and there's the time difference, so it may take time to make contact. And then there is the question... 
MARTIN of money... ? 
JURGEN Yes. Of money. Martin takes off his Rolex. Sets it on the table. 
MARTIN It's all I have. I'll pay you in cash as soon as I can. Jurgen nods, picks up the watch. Turns it, looks at the engraving on the back. As Martin turns to leave... 
JURGEN Doctor Harris... A wince of pain as Jurgen gets up. Lifts a tea tin off the shelf. Opens it. Takes out a hundred Euros... 
JURGEN (CONT'D) A loan against your guarantee. 
MARTIN Thank you. 
JURGEN I'll need twenty-four hours. Call me tomorrow afternoon. Do you have a place to stay? A long beat. Off Martin's FACE... 
INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT 
MARTIN We have to go up... He starts to pull her, but she's FROZEN, staring in horror. Martin tracks her gaze: Biko's body, tucked under the stairs. Lifeless eyes stare back. 
EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
Immigrant families emerge from the flaming building. Jones stands next to the Range Rover, eyes tracking the crowd, the upper floors, now engulfed in flame... 
EXT. ROOF TOP, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
Martin and Gina emerge at the top, run to the edge. He LEANS... reaching across to the next building... BELOW HIM: Five flights down. A mortal fall. Martin's hands grip a ledge, pull him over. He reaches back, pulls her across. They keep moving... 
EXT. STREET, KREUZBERG DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS 
Crowds parting as FIRE TRUCKS scream around the corner. Smith comes out, the last to exit the building. He meets eyes with Jones, satisfied. 
DOWN THE STREET Martin and Gina emerge from the neighboring building. See Smith climbing into the Range Rover. Martin takes Gina's arm, steers her away. Notices an old Mercedes Diesel taxi at the curb, covered in debris. Biko's. 
MARTIN The keys. Where are the keys? Gina stares at him, lost. Martin reaches into her pockets. Finds Biko's keys. He HAULS broken panes, debris off the car, manages to get it open. He bundles her inside. 
INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS 
Martin fumbles the key into the ignition. He turns it. Warning light delay as the diesel's glow-plugs warm up. 
MARTIN C'mon. C'mon... IN THE REARVIEW: The Range Rover, making a U-Turn, heading their way... 
INT. RANGE ROVER - SAME 
Jones drives, Smith shotgun. They cruise slowly, keeping an eye peeled. Pass the debris-covered taxi, empty. They keep moving, gaze still tracking. Smith pops his cell phone. 
I./E. TAXI/KREUZBERG DISTRICT STREETS - SAME Crouched down, Martin watches in the mirror as the Range Rover turns a corner. He restarts the engine, puts the car in gear and pulls them away from the curb. Gina still in stunned silence. Wipes tears and grime off her face. She looks across at Martin. He glances up at the mirror... sudden change in his expression. Gina turns, sees... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BEHIND THEM -- THE BROWN RANGER ROVER Four cars back. Jones driving. Smith riding shotgun. Faces expressionless as they swerve out into traffic, deftly cut back in one vehicle closer to Martin and Gina. Gina turns back to Martin. Eyes wide. This can't be happening. Adrenaline clearing her mind... 
GINA Left --! Turn left... Martin spins the wheel. Taxi swerves across oncoming traffic into a SIDE-STREET. Gina waving frantically... 
GINA (CONT'D) Left again! Left again! Now right. Here. HERE! Just in time, Martin pulls a right. Cab drifts, SLAMS a wall side-on... bounces back into the center of the road. 
GINA (CONT'D) Jesus! A look from Martin: What? Gina glances behind. No sign of them. Moment's relief. Turns to her right. Sees the RANGE ROVER racing down the parallel side-street... 
GINA (CONT'D) They're going to cut us off! Right. Turn right -- ! Martin SCREECHES into a turn. Heads for the parallel alley. Range Rover FLASHES through the intersection just ahead. Taxi cuts across feet behind them... 
IN THE RANGE ROVER Jones spots the taxi in the mirror. BRAKES, high speed 180... races back up the alley. 
IN THE TAXI Martin floors the gas. SCREAMS out into oncoming traffic, across a red light. Zig-zags past cars. Edge of control. Zooms through open gates into... 
EXT. VOLKSPARK CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS 
Tree-lined avenue. Closed GATES at the far end... . Range Rover moving fast down the street alongside the cemetery. Suddenly cutting left across traffic. Bounces over the curb, full-speed into the grounds. 4WD slaloming past gravestones, rapidly closing on the taxi... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Closed gates ahead. No choice. Martin puts his foot down. SMASHES through the gates. Flying hinge SLAMS the windshield -- glass instantly spidering opaque... Martin driving blind. Careens against the embankment, WHIPLASHES up, spin on its axis. Rolling... over the edge of the embankment, TUMBLING over and over. SLAMS DOWN right way up, axles crumpling. QUIET. Steaming HISS of the engine. Martin's hands still locked on the wheel. Gina next to him. Martin shoves open the door. Clambers out. 
EXT. BERLIN RAIL YARDS - CONTINUOUS 
A maze of tracks and power lines below street level. S-Bahn, U-Bahn, high-speed ICE trains, freight... tracks disappearing in each direction into tunnels. A sound. Martin turns, looks up... THE RANGE ROVER, Jones at the wheel... SPOTS THEM. Engine GUNS, Range Rover plunges headlong down the embankment... Whistling ROAR... as a HIGH SPEED TRAIN hurtles out of the one of the tunnels. Martin grabs Gina's hand. 
MARTIN C'mon...! Running side-by-side. Train horn BLASTS as they cross right in front of it as the Range Rover, cut off, SPINS 90 degrees, races down the tracks alongside it. Martin and Gina scramble across tracks, towards a tunnel... . the Range Rover passes the back of the train. HARD right, over the tracks. Too Fast. The car catches air... . BELLIES down hard onto the next set of tracks. Front tire EXPLODES... . Range Rover SPINS... rear wheels SLAM into the track. Another tire BURSTS. Scraping STOP, car straddling the rails. Jones shifts into reverse. Rims SPIN against metal. 
ACROSS THE TRACKS . Martin and Gina sprinting towards the tunnel. Smith jumps out of the Range Rover, lines his weapon. BLAM! BLAM! 
INSIDE THE TUNNEL Martin and Gina hit the ground, bullets chipping ceramic off the walls. Up ahead, illuminated, some utility stairs. Gina GASPS air, spent. Martin looks behind them... 
Martin's eyes flick open and the SOUND and LIGHT of the club come flooding back in... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- GINA. UNDRESSING Low, moving lights pass across her body, wifebeater undershirt and jeans. She unzips the jeans, pulls them down long legs, pulls off the wifebeater, no bra... . hesitates. Looks back, sees that Martin is watching her. Beat. Beat. Lights catch glimpses of her body, her breasts, the arch of her back. She turns slightly away from him, pushes a pile of borrowed clothing towards him. A heavy coat, some jeans. 
GINA .Put these on. She pulls a mod shirt on, glances back as he now undresses. 
GINA (CONT'D) Were you happy? He looks up, shirt in his hands. She doesn't waiver. 
GINA (CONT'D) Your marriage? Was it happy? 
MARTIN .Yes. I think so... I don't remember... how it felt exactly. She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes... 
GINA So why would she do this to you? 
MARTIN .For the same reason I would. If I thought it was the only way to protect her. Gina nods, distant. Martin presses on, difficult. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) I keep having a dream. Liz is in the bedroom of our home, although it's different somehow. Her hair's different... she's smiling, about to say something. Then it ends. I can remember places, details... 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN (CONT'D) I just can't remember... how I felt. He stops. Just the low pulsing BEAT from the other room The lights revolving over them. Gina watching him. Looking back at her. That connection again. He looks away. She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to him. He shakes his head no. She shrugs, sparks it. Inhales deeply, eyes close. She leans back. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) You'll need to get out of town. There's a man who's helping me. He can -- 
GINA (seems to ignore him) In Bosnia... It was not like you probably imagine. It was nice. .there were cherry blossoms. 
(BEAT) One day, I was sixteen. My sister and my brother came to me and said hey let's play hide and seek, down by the creek. He had ten Marka for whoever won. It was amazing, the way he just said it... Beat. She raises the joint, hits it again. Her eyes open, but she's deep in the memory and it's intense. 
GINA (CONT'D) .So I went down to this place I knew, under the small bridge over the creek. And I hid and waited. Not really that long... Then I went back home, to find my brother and collect my money. 
(BEAT) He, and my father and my uncle were dead. And so was my mother. My sister was alive... for a little while. She turns her head, eyes blaze straight at Martin. 
GINA (CONT'D) It was not enough, to kill us. They wanted us to remember, every day, for the rest of our lives. 
MARTIN We're you... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GINA What? Raped? 
(BEAT) No. No one touched me. But now... I'm not going anywhere. I'm not running anymore. She nestles in under his arm. Closes her eyes. He lets his hand gently stroke her hair. 
MARTIN I won't let anything happen to you. 
GINA 
(SMILES SLEEPY) Liar... Say it again. 
MARTIN I'll protect you. She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way to sleep. 
GINA .Cool. 
CHILL SPACE - LATER Gina sleeps, at peace. Martin leans over the one object he has left, his copy of "Horticus." He studies the number markings on the flap, working... 
EXT. BERLIN VELODROME - DAY 
Vast windowless cylindrical building on the city's edge. 
MARTIN Yes. Bressler invited him... Martin trails off. Starting to get there... 
JURGEN Martin Harris... with just a few guests, in a confined space with Prince Fahad. For some, that might be a very good reason to want to be you. 
MARTIN Oh, Jesus... You can't -- Jurgen flips his notebook shut. Gets up. 
JURGEN -- I need a few more hours. You need to go somewhere you will not be seen. Then meet me outside the Cafe Adler on the Kochstrasse. 6.30 sharp. 
EXT. NEUKOLLN DISTRICT, BERLIN - DAY 
Martin and Gina thread their way through streets teeming with AFRICAN and MIDDLE EASTERN immigrants, music blasting from storefronts. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: An ELECTRONICS STORE. In the window a muted TV flickers with the NEWS: A report on the hospital murder. Martin's image. Gina glances around... a COP up the street. 
GINA We have to go. We have to do what Jurgen said, stay out of -- She starts to pull him away, but he's not moving. He's staring at the pre-paid cell phones on display. 
MARTIN Jurgen may have nothing. (beat, to her) I need your help. 
INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - DAY 
Liz sits in front of the bedroom vanity in her bra and skirt, putting on makeup. The room's shower is on. CLOSE as she applies mascara. The Camera searches her face, her small gestures, looking for clues... Shower stops. IN DEEP FOCUS behind her, Martin B comes out of the bathroom, nude. He picks a robe up off the bed, pulls it on as he approaches her, places his hands on her shoulders. They stare at each other in the vanity mirror... RING! RING! Martin B picks up the phone. 
MARTIN B Dr. Harris speaking. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) 
(GERMAN ACCENT) Yes, hello, Dr. Harris. This is Else Adlam from Dr. Bressler's office. Dr. Bressler was wondering if you might be able to meet with him today...

MARTIN Yes, hello, this is Dr. Harris. I have a message for Dr. Bressler... 
INT. LIBRARY BUILDING, FREIE UNIVERSITAT BERLIN - SAME 
Jurgen hands over a library card. A LIBRARIAN finds his request slip, slides two documents across the counter. One a printed monograph; the other a photocopy in brads. 
A WHILE LATER -- JURGEN AT A DESK He finishes reading the printed monograph. Closes it. Looking down at the cover... "The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination" by Martin Harris, PhD. He slides the bound photocopy next to it. "The process of Drakea pollination" by Laurence Darnell, University of Wisconsin. A long beat. The two titles side-by-side. Sudden thought... Jurgen takes something out of his pocket; the card that was inside Martin's 'Horticus'. The scribbled schedule notations on one side... turns it over: the bowling alley's Uncle Sam logo. Jurgen holds closer, studying it. His mind clicking... . printed German text. A number: 21. And right at the bottom, a small time-clock stamp... 
EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK -- DAY 
Martin and Gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals, near the entrance to Berlin's equivalent of Central Park and its zoo. Across, the Weinhaus Restaurant is a fin-de-siecle style brasserie bordering the avenue. 
GINA Why here? 
MARTIN .The zoo. She loves Polar Bears. I never knew exactly why. Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant. Looks back at Martin who hasn't moved. She checks her watch. 
GINA Okay, go. You're going to be late for your date. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Martin nods, heads into the park. Long, curving paths bordered by green. A labyrinth. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Martin B catches a waiter's eye, signals for the check. Bressler catches this, looks to Martin B, questioning. 
MARTIN B I'm sorry, it's my fault. Another appointment I forgot. 
BRESSLER It doesn't matter. (jumping back in) But see you, you say I am too cautious. It's an idiot thing to say. I'm a realist! 
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME 
Liz wanders past some flamingos, checks a sign, heads in another direction. Behind her, Martin keeps his distance, keeps his eyes on Smith who's shadowing Liz, one path over... 
INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME 
Martin B standing. Bressler, collecting his bag and scarf... 
MARTIN B I'm sorry if I offended you, Dr. Bressler. I just -- 
BRESSLER Don't be stupid. You can't offend me. We are colleagues, this is good discussion. But please, Dr. Harris -- Power is an animal, all to itself. It adapts, mutates to whatever form will best preserve it. It's always closer than we know. ON MARTIN B, extending a hand... 
MARTIN B .Perhaps you're right. 
EXT. TIERGARTEN STREET ---SAME 
Gina, crossing the street, searching the restaurant windows, the table empty, busboy gathering up plates. P.O.V. urgently searching. Finds... . Bressler outside the restaurant getting into a taxi. He's alone. No sign of Martin B. Pulls out her phone... 
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME

EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME 
Martin B striding through the park toward the zoo... Gina way behind, trying to catch up. Dials again, Martin's phone going straight to voicemail. 
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME 
P.O.V. -- LIZ PAUSED AT A GLASS WALL -- GETTING CLOSER Her slim shoulders; her hair tucked into a scarf against the rain, silhouetted in front of an underwater view. The giant Polar Bear swims, inches in front of her. LIZ'S FACE. Her eyes, soft. A smile... which fades as she senses a presence. Turns. FACES us. 
MARTIN Standing across from her in this protected space. A strange numbness. Doesn't know where to start... 
MARTIN . Liz. Just that syllable. She stares back, features tense. 
LIZ What are you doing here? 
MARTIN Liz. What's happening? 
LIZ You're crazy -- you have to leave me alone. 
MARTIN Why --?: I have to know why, Liz. Are they making you do this? Are they threatening you? 
LIZ .How did you find me -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN The zoo. The Polar Bears. 
(BEAT) You see? I KNOW YOU, Liz. You KNOW me... Liz's eyes fixed on his. She searches his face. A long beat. Her facade seems suddenly to crumble... 
LIZ I can't... 
MARTIN You can't what? 
LIZ . can't get out. Can't leave. They'll kill me. 
DETAIL SHOT -- TWO PRINT-OUT SCANS... from the security camera at airport Immigration. A couple at a desk. Liz and Martin. Unmistakably Martin.

VOICE (O.S.) 
(THROUGH PHONE) Is that Ernst Jurgen? 
JURGEN Yes, it is. 
VOICE (O.S.) My name's Rodney Cole. You left a message on my phone. There were two from Martin as well. What kind of trouble is he in? 
INT. LEHRTER BAHNHOF TRAIN STATION, BERLIN DAY 
Trains rumble and whoosh. Booming ANNOUNCEMENTS. Hurried commuters pushing past... . RODNEY COLE -- he's the academic colleague we've seen in Martin's memory flashes -- an avuncular man about ten years Martin's senior. Talks on a cell phone: 
COLE Oh my God... that's unbelievable, the poor man. Well here's the good news -- I've just arrived in Berlin... yes, I've been teaching in Leipzig, at the Hochschule fur Technik. I came up for the last day to hear Bressler's speech... 
(LISTENS) I'll come right over, it's not far... No, it's no problem. 
INT. JURGEN'S APARTMENT - SAME 
JURGEN 
(INTO PHONE:) I appreciate it, Herr Cole... Puts the phone down. A beat. Another look at the airport scans of Martin. Studying them a moment. Jurgen opens the bowling bag, up-ends it onto the table. Bowling shoes, a shirt, a hand towel... Taking a knife from the counter, Jurgen cuts around the bottom of the bag... lifts away a false floor. Reaches inside. The contents hidden from us... a shadow of tension crosses his face. Then a slow, enigmatic smile. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A LITTLE LATER -- A KETTLE BOILING... . the mournful HOWL of its whistle. Jurgen turns off the gas. Spoons Nescafe into a mug. Opens a closet, reaches over a musty clutter of jars and boxes... finds a rusted sugar tin. Inside is a single ancient sachet of sweetener. A beat, pensive. He tears it open, adds it to the Nescafe. He looks up. Listening for... anticipating... . the lively KNOCK at his door. 
THE HALLWAY Jurgen opens the door... it's RODNEY COLE, grinning... shaking rain from his coat. 
COLE Herr Jurgen? 
JURGEN Dr. Cole... Please, come on in. Jurgen ushers him in. Leads them into the living room. 
JURGEN (CONT'D) Drink? I've a bottle labelled 'brandy', which is more than likely hair lacquer... or some vodka my neighbor gave me after it made her husband go blind. 
COLE 
(LAUGHING) No, thank you... 
JURGEN Maybe some coffee? I'm making some for myself. 
COLE I'm good. Thanks. Cole looks around the tiny apartment. Sees the framed photos on the mantel. Looks closer. 
COLE (CONT'D) You were in the military? 
JURGEN The Stasi. In East Germany. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WOMAN May I see some identification? She looks up. Martin's expression distant... 
GINA He doesn't have any. He was in an accident, that's why the bag was unclaimed... 
MARTIN The combination. For the lock. It's 2... 8... 0... 6... A beat. The woman and Gina both looking at Martin. The woman enters the numbers. The locks pop open. She lifts the lid, picks something up. A pause... then her expression softens. She turns it toward Martin... 
THE BRIEFCASE Filled with personal effects. Sitting on top a US passport. A long beat. Martin's hands unsteady as he opens it... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: His photo. And his name... Doctor Martin Harris. 
INT. AIRPORT CAFE -- LATE AFTERNOON 
Noisy and busy. Gina uneasy... watching Martin as he carefully examines each item in the case. Everything familiar, yet strange. His, but somehow not his. a copy of 'Scientific American' magazine, a comb, some gum, a Newark Airport parking ticket. His published paper -- the same edition Jurgen found at the library. his leather wallet. Martin studies it. Identical to the one Martin B had. Opens it... 
CLOSE -- THE WALLET New Hampshire Driver's license. Credit cards. Martin fumbles inside a pocket, pulls out... . the EXACT SAME PHOTO we saw in Bressler's lab of a younger Liz with a younger Martin B in Paris. Except this time it's a younger Martin beside Liz-in the photo. 
MARTIN gazing at it. He runs his fingers over its dock-eared corners, every bump and crease. Looks up to find Gina watching him. A long, awkward pause. She reaches over. Takes the photo from him. Studies it. 
GINA Can you remember now... how you felt? Martin's silence hangs in the noise and activity around them. Gina handing back the photo. He stares down at Liz again as Gina stands, start to collect her things... 
GINA (CONT'D) We shouldn't stay here, it's not safe for you... Her voice trails off as she looks at Martin, really sees him in this moment. He looks up at her, torn, back down at the pictures, the relics of his life, his memories, spread out in front of him. He glances at the clock: 2:55... Gina tracks his gaze... gets it, takes a step back... 
GINA (CONT'D) Oh, God. I'm an idiot. She's meeting you here. Martin meets her gaze, open book. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN .Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. She's my wife. She's in danger. I have to -- 
GINA (nodding, auto-pilot) That's good. I'm happy for you. I have to go. 
MARTIN No, wait. I meant what I said. We can take care of you. I can get you money, arrange -- 
GINA 
(FIERCE ) Stop. Be quiet. You've got what you wanted. You don't need me anymore and in case "we've" forgotten, I take care of myself very well. She starts for the door. Martin getting up... 
MARTIN Gina stops, turns. A beat. Sadness, anger. 
GINA One kiss and suddenly... Everything that's happened? To Biko? To us? -- I know, she's your wife. Like I said, I'm an idiot. 
(BEAT) Goodbye, Martin. She turns away again. Martin, frozen, watches her go. 
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME 
Gina keeps walking. Pouring rain... ROAR of traffic. No look back. She joins the line waiting for taxis. 
INT. AIRPORT CAFE - SAME 
Martin still sitting there. The photo of him and Liz in Paris. Sudden decision, snaps the briefcase shut... 
EXT. AIRPORT TAXI RANK - SAME 
Gina almost at the head of the taxi line. A glance back. People... vehicles... no sign of Martin.

Gina at the front of the line. A taxi pulls up. She steals a last look back at the terminal... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
COLE -- they aren't real memories. Don't you get it? Martin Harris is a fabrication... but you've one and filled in the caps, invented a whole damn life for him. They could write a textbook about you! Jesus --! Martin's face. Spinning. Refusing to believe. The Van SCREECHES to a stop, Smith gets out pops the doors. The distant sound of the city traffic, a light wind, whistling. 
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME 
Gina, driving through traffic, searching, no sign of the van... then her gaze LOCKING ACROSS THE RIVER, four stories up on a parking garage: The white van. She hauls the wheel over, Taxi sliding through a U-turn. 
EXT. TOP STORY PARKING GARAGE - SAME 
Martin is tossed out onto the asphalt. Picks himself up, trying to orient... The structure abandoned, broke. No side rails, just pavement to the edge. Trash and graffiti everywhere. Desolate. Cole approaches, losing it now. Boiling with rage: 
COLE All that studying... planning. Hell, you even had us take out that kid after we ripped off his thesis. A year of prep and you try to screw it up... . we do everything to bring you back in, but you go on trying to screw it up. Do you know how much time you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving for Christ's sake! I should be eating turkey with my kids, not here cleaning up after some wacko who bumps his head and decides his cover story's for real. Martin's eyes... staring back at him. Crumbling... 
MARTIN But... I... who am I...? A pause. Cole shakes his head, pats him on the cheek. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLE You. You were my best boy. .suddenly Cole SLAMS a fist into Martin's stomach. Martin doubles over. Cole WHIPS the gun across his FACE. Kicks him AGAIN. Martin on his hands and knees, spits blood. Cole glaring down at him. Disgusted. Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton balls, lighter. Expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin. Draws it into the syringe, glancing back: 
COLE (CONT'D) Look at you now. Nobody. A no- one. Just another dead junkie... Streak of CONCERN as the sound of tires screeching reaches them. Cole looks up in time to see Gina's taxi, rounding the ramp, accelerating towards them! Smith steps forward, gun raised, firing! 
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME 
Gina DUCKS as bullets pierce the front windscreen. The image of Smith, firing, grows large... 
BAM! -- IMPACT! 
EXT. TOP STORY, PARKING GARAGE - SAME 
Taxi catches Smith, carrying into the van, crushing him as the two vehicles slide towards the edge... Cole is HURLED across the van like a rag-doll, his legs are crushed between buckling rows of seats as... . The van SLIDES with the TAXI'S IMPACT... front wheels pushed off the garage edge... teeters, see-sawing. Gina scrambles from the wrecked taxi. Runs toward Martin, lying on the ground. Pulls Martin away, arm around him... 
MARTIN Wait! WAIT! Martin breaks free, walks unsteady to the rear of the van, locks eyes with Cole, trapped, clawing towards the back... Martin puts a hand out... and takes his briefcase. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Is it true...? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLE Caught, the van TEETERING... Sneers at Martin, starts to speak.. Eyes go WIDE as... THE VAN... TIPS... FALLING off the edge, Smith's body going with it... disappears. A moment of calm silence and then CRUNCH! A dull sick crash as the Van hits below. 
MARTIN Stares down at the wreck. Mind spinning... Gina comes up, touches his shoulder. 
GINA Martin... He turns, MOVES. She chases after him... 
EXT. GRUNERSTRASSE - CONTINUOUS 
Pouring rain. Vehicles hiss over the bridge. Gina catches up to Martin. Her voice straining above the traffic: 
GINA (CONT'D) Martin! Stop! Martin, what's wrong... ? Martin! 
MARTIN . Jurgen... we were going to meet... I have to see him. 
GINA We've got to go... leave Berlin. We've got to get out of here...! 
MARTIN I have to! Martin's face. Blood streaking in the rain. Absolute. A long beat. Gina takes a deep breath. 
INT. CAFE ADLER - AFTERNOON 
A cafe looking onto the Kochstrasse, Checkpoint Charlie. Rain mists the windows. Mostly empty... TWO FIGURES, sitting in the shadows. Martin and Gina. He STARES down, lost, shivering -- not from the cold. 
MARTIN Prince Fahad is going to be assassinated today. There's a bomb in the suite. I put it there. A long beat. Gina's eyes meet his, brief, scared. Sudden shift. Martin stuffs the cash back in the bag. Grabs her by the arm, propels them both outside... 
EXT. KOCHSTRASSE - SAME 
Martin pushes them into the alley next to cafe, jams the bag into her arms. 
MARTIN Take this... get out of Berlin. Gina shaking her head. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Take it and go! Get as far away from me as you can. 
GINA I'm not leaving you! Listen to me: Maybe you're not the man who went into the water. But you are the man I pulled out... Martin, staring into his reflection on the wet street... 
GINA (CONT'D) Martin, there's no way you can show your face at the hotel. Everyone is looking for you. I 
CAN -- WHAM! MARTIN LURCHES UP AT GINA! He SLAMS her back against the brick wall, his hand around her neck, cutting off her air, literally lifting her feet off the ground. 
MARTIN 
(THE MONSTER) Look at me. Look at me... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Gina SPUTTERS, tries to draw air. Her eyes LOCK on his. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) .Is this what you want? Is this the person you still want to help. 
(SQUEEZING TIGHTER) You should have let me drown... She sputters, eyes start to roll back in her head, losing consciousness. Martin RELEASES and she drops in the dirt water of the Alley, hands and knees, GASPING for breath. Martin stares down at her. He picks up the bag, drops it in front of her face... 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Pure instinct and adrenaline. Gina grabs the bag, stumbles across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her... And she's gone. 
EXT. BERLIN STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON 
Martin walks... numb. He waits at street corners, crosses with lights, moves through the city... 
EXT. MARSHALL BRIDGE - SUNSET 
Martin stands at the broken railing where Gina's taxi plunged into the water seven days ago. The tire marks are there. The railing is half-repaired, half taped off. He stares down into the oily black water, toes near the edge... weight shifting... then his knees give. He sits hard, his hands moving uselessly, almost on their own. Tears flow freely. Sobs RACK his body. 
PULLING WAY BACK -- ACROSS THE STREET . to where Gina stands, hidden in shadows. She's followed him here. Now frozen, watching him suffer. 
E/I. HOTEL IMPERIAL & CONFERENCE CENTER - NIGHT Lit up for the big night. Taxis and limos pulling in. In the lobby, beautiful people mingle with the celebrities of science. Herr Strauss scans the crowd, watchful.

PRINCE FAHAD, flanked by his entourage, arrives at the door to the Eisenhower Suite. Hum of a party from within. Security KNOCKS. Beat... Liz opens the door. Radiant. 
LIZ Your highness... we're honored you could attend this evening. 
FAHAD (kissing her hand) The honor is all mine. Liz BEAMS, gestures him into the room filled with a dozen or so notable guests. Martin B engrossed in a conversation... 
BRESSLER (O.S.) Look, I probably have it somewhere... Perhaps my wife -- BRESSLER, held at the door by Fahad's security, searching his pockets for an invitation. 
BRESSLER (CONT'D) I'm late. Very un-German of me. 
FARAD (to his security) I don't think the professor needs an invitation. He is, after all, the reason we are all here. 
(CONTINUED) 
MARTIN You're not listening! There is a bomb, in the Eisenhower Suite. I put it there. 
STRAUSS But isn't that the suite 'you' are staying in, 'Dr. Harris'...? Or wait, you're not Dr. -- 
MARTIN I've told you! There's no time to explain this...

MARTIN (CONT'D) 
(SUDDENLY) I can prove it. Pull up your lobby recordings from August 27 of this year. Strauss, startled by the ferocity in Martin's voice.

INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT 
Gina reaches the door to the suite, stopped by security. 
SECURITY GUARD Invitation? She meets the guard's gaze with cool superiority. Her eyes flick to Fahad across the room. 
GINA Are you serious...? Why don't you ask the Prince? The guard hesitates, unsure... it's all she needs. She moves by him, into the room. 
INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - SAME 
Gina quickly takes in the suite. Far away, Bressler and Fahad, engrossed in conversation. One of Bressler's daughters, LILY, peeking out from under a table. At the bar, Martin B, drinks in his hands, turning towards her... She turns towards a picture window, watches the reflection... 
MARTIN B . makes eye contact with Liz across the room, she heads towards the back. He begins to follow... hesitates... He looks back, to the picture windows. Empty now. 
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
Martin, sweating, nervous, eyes flicking to the monitors as the technician brings up the reception video, starts fast- forwarding through footage. Images go by, almost too fast... 
STRAUSS .What exactly are you hoping to find? Martin ignores him, his eyes TRACKING. 
INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Fahad finishes a joke. Laughter. Martin B still scanning the room... Gives up, turns to meet Liz already there with their computer case and a sportsbag. She hands him the sportsbag, they wordlessly leave through the rear door... 
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Unseen by anyone, a monitor shows Liz and Martin B, entering an emergency stairwell, hurrying. Martin's eyes scan... 
MARTIN There! Stop! The technician freezes the image: A dapper couple, checking in. He wears a sportsjacket, light-haired, horn-rimmed glasses. She's got short dark hair. Martin points. Strauss leans in, sensing it. 
INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Gina approaches Bressler and Prince Fahad, intense, urgent. Fahad's SECURITY reads her expression, GRABS her arm. 
GINA 
(CALLING OUT) Sir! Your highness! You're in danger here. There is a bomb in this room! Bressler and the Prince look over, confused, interested... . and Fahad's Security ACTS. A gun lined on Gina, pushing her back. Two men grab the Prince, pushing back other guests, hustle him toward the suite's emergency exit,. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Champagne crystal, hors d'oeuvres and furniture FLYING. Fahad in the middle, looking back as he's swept out, captive to his own security... 
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
The image ROLLS FORWARD, slowly: The man at the counter kisses his wife's hair, glances upwards... It's MARTIN. 
MARTIN 
(QUIET) Do you see...? Beat. Beat. And then MOTION on the monitors: The Prince and his detail, rushing down a corridor. Strauss tracks... 
LIZ 
(LOUD) Oh thank God you're here! Martin stares at her in horror as she beams up at him. One hand caressing his cheek... .her other hand pressing a knife against his chest. 
GINA Seeing Martin and Liz, embracing. Confused. Alarmed. Hurt. 
LIZ AND MARTIN Liz still hugging him tight, whispering hard, her free hand sliding something metallic into his pocket. 
LIZ (CONT'D) Hello, Martin. I just placed a gun in your jacket pocket. One bullet. There's really only one person, one right way to kill Bressler now, isn't there? The crazy man whose been stalking him, the crazy man who pretended to be Martin Harris... 
MARTIN No... 
LIZ Oh, and after you've shot him, point the gun at the Police. 
MARTIN I won't do it... 
LIZ God you're weak. The 'Martin' I knew wouldn't have been able to go on living like you are. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Her eyes duck, purposeful, he tracks her gaze. Sees the Uzi in the sportsbag... 
LIZ (CONT'D) I'll kill them all. Bressler, the girls... your new girlfriend, and whoever tries to stop me. Look at it this way: I'm giving you a chance to save most of them. You can be the hero... A kiss, sexy. Gina in the background, taking a step back... 
LIZ (CONT'D) Ooops, bet you wish you could explain that. Time's up, Martin. Go finish what you came to Berlin for in the first place. On Martin. Caught. No play. He turns, walks... 
INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Martin B has a small hole opened up. He can see the digital timer. 00:00:14, 00:00:13... Jams his hand into the hole. Trying to force it past the narrow opening. Desperately feeling for the controls. 
INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS 
Martin, on a suicide mission. Walks in a daze towards Gina, Bressler beyond. His hand moves into his pocket. Gina, stepping forward... 
GINA Martin...? Martin? He STARES at her. Tears in his eyes... 
REAR ENTRANCE TO THE LOBBY Strauss re-enters, commanding his security. STOPS as he recognizes Martin, mouths words to his men... 
INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Martin B, forcing his arm further. Fingers reach the controls... search for the right one... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: .his finger flips a small switch. The timer... STOPS. Martin B sighs, breathes hard. Holy shit that was close. 
INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS 
Martin and Gina, locked, staring. Her face a million questions... No answers. Martin shakes his head, turns away from her, towards Bressler, his hand coming out of his pocket with the gun... In Martin's face: horror, deadly conviction... Time SLOOOWS. Sound AMPLIFIES... 
STRAUSS AND HIS MEN .Seeing the gun. Shouting! Weapons being drawn! 
GINA Also seeing the gun. A hand going out, a scream building... 
MARTIN Bringing the Vun up, pointed at Bressler's head, perfect kill shot. No choice. Finger on the trigger... 
INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Martin B stands, dusts off his coat, starts to walk out of the bathroom... "crunch" he steps on something. A soft "beep." He looks down, REACTS to: The remote control... under his foot. 
VISION RACKS TO THE BOMB: 00:00:02., 00:00:01... 
MARTIN B Fuck... 
KABOOM!!! WHITE OUT BLAST as the bomb DETONATES. Martin B atomized. Sheets of flame bursting through windows.

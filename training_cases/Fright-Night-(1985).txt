FRIGHT NIGHT

FADE IN: 
EXT. FULL MOON - NIGHT (AND CREDITS. ROLL) 
Clouds obscure the starless heavens for a moment, heavy and ominous in the black firmament. Then suddenly they clear, exposing a full moon streaked with red like a killer's face, a stalking moon staring down at man's evil on the earth below. A HOWL breaks the night, a wolf pursuing its prey perhaps, or perhaps something much, much worse. VOICES break the perfect stillness. 
JONATHAN (V.0.) What was that? 
MISS NINA (V.0.) Just a child of night, Jonathan. Come, sit here beside me on the veranda. 
JONATHAN (V.0.) It's chilly out here. 
MISS NINA (V.0.) Oh, no, it isn't. It's beautiful. I love the night so. 
2 EXT. RANCHO CORVALLIS - NIGHT 
A middling size town lost somewhere in the Southwest, the lights of its sixty some thousand residents twinkling like so many Christmas lights in the night. 
JONATHAN (V.0.) I've never seen you so beautiful before, Nina. So pale, so luminescent, so He suddenly stops. There is a moment. Then: 
MISS NINA (V.0. ) Yes? 
JONATHAN (V.0.) Your lips are so red. 
MISS NINA (V.O.) Are they? Would you like to kiss them? The CAMERA STARTS TO PUSH IN CLOSER AND CLOSER on the town as though searching for the source of the voices. 
3 EXT. CHARLEY'S STREET - NIGHT 
It's a typical middle class suburban street, full of pre- 1 World War II houses, the substantial places they built then, two and three story homes with attics and basements., porches and detached garages. There is the SOUND OF A LONG DRAWN OUT KISS as Jonathan and Miss Nina's lips meet. The CAMERA. MOVES DOWN the street, still looking for the voices. 
4 EXT. DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT 
V The CAMERA PAUSES TO STARE AT the Dandrige house, so dif- ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the street. It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and uncared for. However the "For Sale" on the lawn has a "Sold" sign just beneath it. The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still SEARCHING for those voices. It's in sharp contrast to the Dandrige house, newly painted, its lawn neatly shorn, a house almost dwarfed in comparison to the Dandrige house, but a happy home, its windows lit and smiling out warmly at the night. The voices seem to be coming from the Brewster house, spe- cifically from a dark second-story window that is open to the night breeze. 
JONATHAN (V.0.) Why are you looking at me so strangely, Nina? 
MISS NINA (V.0.) Not you, Jonathan. Your neck. Has anyone ever told you it was beautiful? 
JONATHAN (V.O. ) 
(UNCERTAINLY) No. 
MISS NINA (V.0.) Come, lay your head on my breast. The CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO PUSH IN on the second-.story window.

6 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the window, past the billowing drapes to find itself staring at a TV, the flickering screen the only light in the room. 
(CONTINUED) 
6 CONTINUED: One of those terrible AIP/Hammer horror films is on the tube, a woman, obviously a vampire, talking to one of those vapid juveniles used so much in these types of films, the two of them standing on a veranda to some huge, old house. The young man rests his head against her breast, incredibly enough, unaware that she is bending toward his neck with these huge fangs. Just as. she is about to sink them into his jugular, a tall, saturnine man steps out of the darkness., wearing a rather daffy Victorian suit and carrying a stake and mallet in his hand. His name is PETER VINCENT. 
PETER (V.0.) Stop, you creature of the Night! The vampiress leaps to her feet, her hapless, intended victim forgotten. She faces Peter with a, hiss, her fangs sparkling in the moonlight. 
MISS NINA (V.O.) Who are you who interrupts my nightly feeding? 
PETER (V.O.) (drawing himself up to his full height) Peter Vincent, vampire killer! He rushes her, the stake held high to plunge into her breast and the CAMERA TURNS AWAY from the TV as the sounds of the movie CROSS FADE with the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING, LIPS MEETING, TONGUES INTERTWINING in the room itself. Only the room, a typical teenager's lair, seems devoid of life, the bed empty, schoolbooks untouched sitting on the desk. The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for the source of this new sound, much more interesting than the old flick on the tube. And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN, two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy- ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV. The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now, rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen as CREDITS END.

8 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
JUDY Have you two been having a lovers' spat? 
CHARLEY 
(embarrassed as hell) No, Mom, nothing like that. 
JUDY Well, there's nothing wrong with that. (pointing at the maga- zine in her lap) Right here it says the divorce rate is 76% higher among couples who don't argue before marriage. 
CHARLEY 
Mom, we're in high school. 
JUDY Oh, yes, that's right. Well it never hurts to-plan ahead. 
(TO AMY) Tell your mother I said hello, will you, Amy. And remind her we're playing bridge at her house this week. I'm bringing the cheesepuffs, she's making the dessert.

AMY Yes, Mrs. Brewster. 
(TO CHARLEY) Good night, Charley. 
CHARLEY- 
(ABSENTLY) 
Yeah, goodnight. But he's no longer listening; he's moving toward the window that stares out at the house next door. There are lights on in the first floor.now. Behind him Amy turns back to his mother. 
AMY 
Well, good night, Mrs. Brewster. 
JUDY Good night, Amy. And thanks for helping Charley. 
AMY Anytime. See you tomorrow, Charley. Be hardly hears her, staring out the window. Miffed again, Amy turns and stomps out of the room, the front DOOR heard SLAMMING behind her a moment later. 
(CONTINUED)

8 CONTINUED: Judy turns to her son to see what's wrong with him. He's glued to the window, staring at the house next door. 
JUDY Charley, that wasn't very nice, not walking Amy to the front door. 
CHARLEY (hardly hearing her) Mom, there are people. next door. 
JUDY Oh, the new owner must.be moving in. 
CHARLEY What new owner? 
JUDY I Didn't I tell you? Bob Hopkins told me he finally sold the place. 
I 
CHARLEY To who? 
JUDY I.d.on't know. Some fellow who fikes up houses, he said. Supposed to be attractive, too. Anyway I just hope whoever he is, he knows what he's getting into with that house. It's going to take a lot of work just to make it liveable -- And the CAMERA leaves them behind, SLOWLY PUSHING IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on the TV Judy was watching, their VOICES FADING out to be taken over by the newscaster dron- ing away on the screen. 
NEWSCASTER (V.0.) And now for the local news. A man was found murdered tonight behind the railroad yards. Details are pending waiting notification of next of

AMY It was my fault, not yours. 
CHARLEY 
(REALLY STARTLED) It was? (she nods;.he recovers, taking her hand) Look, Amy, I. love you. I never.. want to fight with you again, okay? 
AMY (breaking into a big smile) God, I'm so glad we're getting this straightened out. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
13 CONTINUED: 
AMY (CONT' D) I've been miserable the last two days. You don't know what it's been 
LIKE -- Over her shoulder he suddenly sees that the TV has gone to the local news, a picture of a girl who looks very much like the one he saw going into the Dandrige house the afternoon before on the screen. He is suddenly no longer listening or looking at Amy, his complete attention on the TV. She trails-off as she realizes she's lost his atten- tion, staring at him. 
AMY Charley, are-you listening to me? He gets up abruptly and walks away, leaving her sitting there staring after him. He stops'below the TV, staring up at it as the newscaster's voice runs over the picture of the girl. 
NEWSCASTER (V.0.) 
(CAUGHT MID-SENTENCE) Cheryl Lane, a known prostitute, was found murdered this morning -- Evil Ed steps up beside him, staring up at the 'screen along with him. 
EVIL ED Know what I heard on the police band .last night? 
CHARLEY What? 
EVIL ED (nodding at the TV) That wasn't the only murder. It's the second in two days. 
(GLEEFULLY) And get this. Both of 'em had their heads cut off. Can you believe it? 
CHARLEY' (staring at him) You're sick. A voice suddenly comes from behind him. 
AMY (O.S.) Charley. 
(CONTINUED) 
16 EXT. BREWSTER AND DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT 
tD The two houses sit there side by side,.only the Dandrige house has changed although it's hard to say exactly how. It just seems worse than before, more abandoned, more-hulk- ing, more... dead. 
17 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Charley has the house next door staked out. He sits in a chair before his window, all the lights off in his room, only the flickering TV to keep him company. It's Peter Vincent on Fright Night, another one of his films on, this time the volume turned off. Charley holds his binoculars in his hand, staring at the dark window of the house next door, waiting. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
18 ZNT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT The TV is just flickering snow now, the channel having signed off hours before. Charley still sits in front of his window, but he's sound asleep, breathing deeply, lost in his dreams. Soft, sensual MUSIC snakes through his open window, enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake. Groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the lit window of the bedroom next door. He sits up with a start. There is no drawn shade now. Be can see clearly into the room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair stands there, framed in the window, slowly taking her blouse off. Charley rubs his eyes., hardly able to believe what he's seeing. As he watches she drops the blouse to the floor and stands there, bare breasted. Charley gulps, fumbling for his binoculars. He gets them to his eyes just as Jerry Dandrige steps out of the shadows behind the girl, gliding across the room toward her with incredible grace. To Charley the whole thing has.a dreamlike quality, Jerry more an impression than a reality. He's thirty maybe, almost beautiful with alabaster skin and chestnut hair. He stops behind the girl, sweeping her hair back, exposing her tender, young neck. He slowly leans down as though to kiss her. As Charley watches through his binoculars, unable to tear his eyes away, Jerry Dandrige's upper lip slowly begins to pull back,. revealing just the hint of fangs, long, razor sharp, and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight. Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch above the girl's throat. He slowly raises his head, star- ing out the window across the side yard and into Charley's bedroom. 
(CONTINUED) 
pk Rev. 11/16/84 15. 
18 CONTINUED: It's almost as though he can see the boy watching him. - With an involuntary gasp of terror, Charley steps back into the deeper darkness of his room, his hand instinctively reaching up to-protect his own throat. Jerry Dandrigeâ¢slowly reaches up and pulls down the shade, cutting off all view into the room. Charley stands there for a moment, unable to believe what he just saw. The binoculars slip from his hand, crashing to the floor, and. he whirls, racing out of the room. 
19 INT. HIS MOTHER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
He bursts through the door to find his mother sound asleep in bed. He grabs her, shaking her awake. 
CHARLEY Morn, you've yot to get up. I can't believe what s happening next door. 
JUDY (staring up as her son 
SLEEPILY) What, what are you talking about? 
CHARLEY He has fangs. The man who bought the house has fanas! 
JUDY Oh, Charley, I have to be at work at 
SEVEN TOMORROW He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM in the yard next door. He jumps to the window, peering out into the back of the Dandrige house just in time to see Billy Cole walking away from a shiny new black Cherokee Jeep, its back door left open. Charley whirls and dashes out of the room, leaving his mother staring after him. 
JT1DT 
AMY (blocking his path) Charley, you can't go to the police with a story like that. They'll lock you up. 
CHARLEY All right, then I won't tell them it's a vampire. But I sure as hell am going to tell them about the two women -- 
AMY 
CHARLEY -- Be slams out the back door, leaving her staring after him, ) T worried sick. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
24A EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - DAY 
A police car pulls up, Charley in a red Mustang behind him. He gets out, walking to meet LIEUTENANT DETECTIVE LENNOX, a tall man in his early.forties. He hitches his pants, staring at the teenager hard. 
LENNOX You sure about this now? Charley nods emphatically and the cop turns toward the house, Charley following. 
25 OMITTED 
27 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - PORTICO - STAIRWAY - DAY 
The KNOCK reverberates through the silent house. Nothing for several seconds; then the sound of someone walking down the hall from the kitchen. Billy Cole appears, stopping before the door, staring through the curtain at the dim outline of Charley and the Detective standing on the porch. He opens the door, staring at the boy and the cop. 
BILLY Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
Rev. 11/26/84 
27 CONTINUED: 
LT. LENNOX Mr. Dandrige? 
BILLY ' No, I'm his roommate,â¢Billy Cole. 
LT. LENNOX (flashing his badge) Lieutenant Lennox, homicide. Mind if we come in? 
BILLY No, not at all. He steps back from the door, allowing them to enter. The house is a mess of cardboard moving boxes and heavy Victorian furniture scattered everywhere, a number of the pieces still under white dust covers. Clocks line one wall, none of them working, all set at 6 p.m. 
BILLY Is there anything I can help you with? 
LIEUT. .LENNOX There was a murder last night. Charley lives'next door and thinks he saw the victim in this house. 
BILLY 
(SEEMINGLY SHOCKED) That's impossible. I was here with Jerry all last night. There was nobody else in the house. 
CHARLEY That's a lie. (nodding at Billy) I saw him carry her body out in a plastic bag. 
LIEUT. LENNOX What do you say to that, Mr. Cole? 
BILLY 
(RELIEVED) The kid's crazy, officer. I did take some bags out last night, but they were full of trash. Here, let me show you -- 
28 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
He leads them into the living room which is'a mess of pack- ing crates, boxes, and furniture. He holds up a plastic trash bag stuffed with wrapping paper and cardboard boxes. 
(CONTINUED)

28 CONTINUED: 28 
BILLY See. We're just in the process of moving in -- 
CHARLEY, The bag I saw had a body in it, not trash. 
I 
BILLY Did you actually see the body, Charley? 
CHARLEY No, but --. 
EVIL ED (V.0.) You still have my'cross? 
CHARLEY Yeah, and I nailed my.window shut. 
EVIL ED ' (V .0 . ) Then relax. There's no way he can get to you. 
CHARLEY You sure? 
CUT BACK TO: 
42 INT. EVIL ED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
EVIL ED Positive. Now good night. I've got some studying to do. He hangs up, returning to painting his monster model of the Ghoul, mumbling to himself. 
EVIL ED Fucking idiot. 
CUT BACK TQ: 
43. INT. CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Charley-grabs the cross off his desk and nervously fingers it, turning to stare out his window at Jerry's window next door. The shade is pulled, but there's a light on behind it. It doesn't make Charley any less nervous. 
DISSOLVE: 
44 EXT...DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT 
Both houses sit quietly on the street, wrapped in the dark- ness of the night air. An ordinary enough image, two houses, sitting there, but there's something disturbing about it. After.a few seconds one realizes what it-is: the Dandrige house almost looks like it's about to pounce on its next door neighbor, the Brewster house. 
45 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Judy is sound asleep, a light breeze wafting the curtains. of her partially open window, sleeping mask over her eyes. 
46 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT 
Darkness and silence, and nothing else but moonlight spill- ing through the window at the far end. 
47 INT.. CHARLEY' S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
He sleeps fitfully in his chair, his door locked behind him, his window barricaded with his desk. 
48 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT 
Suddenly the shadowy outline of.what might be a huge bat swoops past the window outside followed by the BEATING OF MIGHTY WINGS. A second later something is heard landing on the roof with a heavy THUD. 
49 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Charley sits bolt upright in his bed as he hears it, lis- tening hard. But now there's nothing but silence. He stares up at the ceiling, listening and waiting. Then he hears what SOUNDS LIRE FOOTSTEPS walking across the roof. And then silence again. Grabbing the cross and holding on to it tightly, he walks toward his door. 
50 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
He unlocks the door and pokes his head out, looking up and down the hall. Nothing. Then he hears it, a NOISE from the floor below. It sounds like fingernails scratching-. across glass. He tiptoes to the landing, staring down at the shadow enshrouded portico below. The NOISE IS LOUDER now, spookier, more insistent. Clutching his cross, he starts down the stairs. 
51 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT' 
Jerry Dandrige stands above Judy, staring down at her sleeping peacefully in her bed. The window behind him is now fully open. He glides across the room past Judy's bureau with her wigs sitting on it, past the wall mirror without leaving a reflection to mark his passing, and out the door with unnatural silence. 
52 INT. HALLWAY -.NIGHT 
Jerry closes the door behind him, giving it a sharp tug that slightly dislodges it-from it hinges, wedging it..tight against the frame. It's something no man of ordinary strength could accomplish that easily. He turns away, gliding across the hall toward the open door to Charley's bedroom. 
53 INT. STAIRWAY - PORTICO - NIGHT 
Charley stands on the stairs, staring through the doorway into the living room. There is nothing but shadows in there. And then he sees it, the source of the scratching sound. 
(CONTINUED) 
ch Rev. 12/4/84 30. 
53 CONTINUED: A tree branch, caressed by the wind, is slowly.moving back and forth across a pane of glass in one of the french doors to the patio. Relieved, Charley slips the cross into his pants pocket and turns, walking back up the stairs. 
54 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
He walks down the hall past his mother's bedroom, hardly giving it â¢ glance as he disappears into his own room. 
(STEPPING IN) You remember a fruitcake kid named Charley Brewster. He said he came to see you? 
PETER' (shaking his head) No. 
AMY He's the one who thinks a vampire is living next door.

(SMILING) Oh, yes. He's insane. (looking at Amy) Dear me, I hope he's not a friend of yours? 
EVIL ED . 
(MALICIOUSLY) She's got the hots for the creep. She flushes and smacks Evil Ed, making him yelp. She turns back to Peter. 
AMY We need your help' to stop him, Mr. Vincent. You see, he really does believe his next 'door neighbor is a vampire. Re's planning to kill him. 
EVIL ED 
(GLEEFULLY) Yeah, with a stake through the heart. 'Peter stares at them for a moment. 
PETER Are you two serious? (as Any nods) My dear, your friend needs a psychiatrist, not'a vampire killer. 
AMY 
(BEGGING) Please, Mr. Vincent. 
PETER I'm afraid not, my dear. (nodding at an open suitcase on the bed) You see, Hollywood beckons. I've been offered a starring role in a major movie. I've even had to quit Fright Night. So you see, I'm 
AFRAID -- 
.AMY I'll hire you. I'll give you money.

BOND -- 
PETER I'll take it. (sitting in a chair across from her, sud- denly all charm) Now how are we going to cure your little friend of this delusion? 
EVIL ED I got it all figured out. We all go next door to the neighbor and you run some kind of vampire test on-him and pronounce-him human. Like in "Orgy of the Damned." You know, where you looked in the mirror and the guy didn't have a reflection and then you knew he was a vampire. 
PETER 
(GETTING MISTY-EYED) Ah, yes, that was one of my favorite roles. I still have the prop. 'He pulls out a silver cigarette case and flips it open. The inside of the lid is a mirror. He suddenly snaps it shut and slips it back into his pocket, looking up at them. 
PETER It sounds fine to me, but how do we get this next door neighbor to agree? 
EVIL ED 
(CONFIDENTLY) Leave that to me -- Nobody glances out the window as Evil Ed picks up the phone and dials 411, but if they did, they'd see night has fallen. 
CUT TO: 
70 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
As the CAMERA watches all the clocks on the wall begin to tick, signaling dusk has fallen and Jerry is awakening. CAMERA PANS off the clocks to phone on the portico table. It RINGS. Billy appears down the hall. from the kitchen. He picks it up. 
BILLY Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
AMY 
(LYING MIGHTILY) Oh, he did, Charley, he did. 
CHARLEY (looking at her) Honest? 
AMY 
(NODDING SOLEMNLY) Honest. 
CHARLEY 
(SLOWLY) Then maybe we it really have a chance to kill Dandrige tomorrow night. (tears welling up in his eyes) You two don't know what it's been like, knowing there's a vampire living next door and having no one believe me -- 
AMY 
(SOOTHINGLY) It's all right, Charley She takes him in her arms, holding him close as Evil Ed turns away in disgust, staring out the window at the dark- ened window next door. 
75 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jerry sits in the dark, rocking back and forth in a chair, staring out the window into Charley's room, catching just the dim outlines of the three kids in the house next door. He smiles; if anybody saw the smile, they'd run screaming in the opposite direction.

76 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - DUSK INTO NIGHT 
The three teenagers, Charley, Evil Ed, and Amy, stand in front of the house waiting. Dusk is slowly gathering, the shadows lengthening as night closes about them. Charley glances nervously at his watch. 
CHARLEY 'It's six ten. He said he'd be here at six, right? 
EVIL ED Relax. He said he'd be here, he'll be here. Peter's old clunker appears around the corner. Amy is the first to see it. 
AMY Here he comes. The kids rush the car as Peter pulls up. 
CHARLEY Mr. Vincent, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this -- Peter slowly gets out of the car, stretching to his full height. He wears his vampire killer regalia, the Victorian suit, and carries a small leather satchel. There is some- thing truly majestic about him.. He looks down at Charley, laying it on. with a trowel. 
PETER Charley Brewster, I presume? (as Charley nods; Peter shakes his hand) Peter Vincent, vampire killer. And now down to business. Where is the lair of this suspected creature of the night? 
CHARLEY (pointing at the 
DANDRIGE HOUSE) There. 
PETER 
(STUDYING IT) Ah, yes, I see what you mean. There is a distinct possibility. He opens the satchel, withdraws a small crystal vial of water, slips it into his jacket pocket, closes the bag, and replaces it on the front seat of his car. He locks the car and turns back to the kids., straightening his shoulders. 
PETER Well, shall we?

CHARLEY Where're your stakes and hammer? 
PETER. I left them in my bag-. 
CHARLEY 
(HORRIFIED) You're not going in there without them? 
PETER I have to prove he's a vampire before I kill him, Charley. 
CHARLEY But I know he's a vampire. 
PETER But I am the one that has to know, Charley. This is holy water. If it touches him, he'll blister- and in this case I asked him to drink it while we all watched. He readily agreed. 
CHARLEY 
(SHOCKED) He did? 
(SOURLY) 1 Where do you keep your coffin? Or do you have more than one? 
PETER (a warning growl) 
CHARLEY -- 
JERRY 
(SMILING) It's all right, Mr. Vincent. I'm quite used to it by,now. As you may or may not know, Charley even brought the police over a few days ago. Peter, Amy, and Evil Ed all look at Charley, shocked. 
AMY Charley, you didn't. 
CHARLEY 
(ANGRILY) Damn right, I did; Only the cops .didn't believe me anymore than any of you. (back to Jerry) But you'll believe me in a few seconds. Mr. Vincent, give him the holy water. 
PETER 
(WARNING HIM) Charley, there's no reason to be rude about this -- 
PETER (raising a placating hand) It's perfectly all right, Mr. Vincent. Where is the, ah, holy water? 
(CONTINUED) 
78 CONTINUED: Peter withdraws the vial from his pocket. Jerry eyes it warily, staring at Peter, his voice suddenly heavy with double meaning. 
JERRY Are you sure that's holy water, Mr. Vincent? 
PETER (playing it up) Positive. I saw Father Scanlon bless it down at Saint Mary's myself. Jerry takes the vial from his-hand, pulling the stopper, and sniffing at it, for the first time nervousness creeping into his manner.. Charley sidles up to Amy, whispering in her ear as Jerry prepares to drink the water. 
CHARLEY Get ready to run. I'll protect you with this. He edges a cross out of his pocket, just giving her a glimpse of it. He glances up just as Jerry lifts his head back and. downs the contents of the vial in one swallow. He 1 7 7 turns to Peter triumphantly. 
JERRY There, satisfied? 
PETER Totally. 
(TO CHARLEY) Charley, you saw it. Are you convinced now that Mr. Dandrige isn't a vampire? Charley stares at Jerry and the vial, stunned almost into speechlessness. 
CHARLEY But, it can't be -- 
PETER You just saw it, Charley. You know as well as I do that no vampire could drink blessed water. 
CHARLEY Then it wasn't blessed! 
PETER 
(HUFF ILY) Are you calling me a liar, young man? 
(CONTINUED) 
78 CONTINUED: ( 2) Charley looks at Jerry. Jerry stares back at hire, smiling. Charley suddenly whips the cross out of his packet and holds it up. 
CHARLEY If he's not a vampire, then have him touch this? Jerry stiffens, his face losing its color, but none of the others notice. They're all looking askance at Charley. Peter steps up to the boy. 
PETER Charley, you've already made a fool of yourself once. There's no reason to compound the error. 
_ JERRY Yes, Charley, you've already.caused your friends quite enough pain. (his eyes burning into Charley, hammering the 
POINT HOME) You don't want to cause them any more, do you? Charley sees.Dandrigeâ¢coiling to . spring, Billy sliding into place blocking the doorway to the portico. The tension level in the room is suddenly unbearable. Peter, Amy, and Evil Ed are aware of it although they don't know the reason. Charley slowly edges the cross back into his pocket. 
CHARLEY No, no, of course not., 
JERRY And you're finally-convinced I'm not a vampire either,-correct? Their eyes lock; a moment passes. Then finally: 
CHARLEY Yes. Jerry smiles at him and the tension suddenly flows out of the room. Billy even smiles. Jerry steps forward, usher- ing them all toward the portico. 
JERRY Well, I'm glad that's all.settled.

BILLY (still at window) Well, at least they'll never believe the kid now. Jerry glances down and sees a sliver of mirror from Peter's cracked cigarette case at his feet. He picks it up, examining it. He casts no reflection in it. He holds it up for Billy to see. 
JERRY No?

CHARLEY (turning to Amy and Evil Ed) Well, at least you two heard him. 
EVIL ED 
Heard who?- 
I 
CHARLEY 
Peter Vincent. He said Dandrige had no reflection. 
EVIL ED Probably just a trick of the light. 
CHARLEY (whirling on Amy) You felt how evil Dandrige was, didn't you, Amy? Remember the way he looked at you? 
AMY (confused by the 
MEMORIES) Yes, sort of -- 
EVIL ED (bored with it all) Oh, for Christ sake -- 
He turns, about to duck between two houses. 
CHARLEY Where are you going? 
EVIL ED Rome. It's dinner time. 
CHARLEY Wait a minute. We walk Amy home first. 
EVIL ED Why? 
CHARLEY Because it's after dark, pencil.dick, and there's a vampire back there! Be points back at the Dandrige house. Evil Ed just stares at him. 
EVIL ED Oh, shit, Brewster, you're certifiable, you know that.

82 EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
The town of Rancho Corvallis is middling size, perhaps a hundred thousand people. 
(CONTINUED) 
JERRY Hello, .Edward. Evil Ed turns with a scream to find Jerry standing right next to him. Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure, hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes. Dandrige walks over to him, staring down with something like pity in his eyes. 
JERRY You have nothing to fear from me. (in a voice like honey) I understand what it's like, being different. Only they won't make fun of you anymore or beat you up. I'll see to that. All you have to do is take my hand. Evil Ed slowly looks up at him through his tear-stained eyes to see Jerry staring-down at him, his. hand outstretch- ed to.him, a slight smile on his face, gentle, seductive, beguiling. 
JERRY Here, Edward, take my hand. Evil Ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him. 
(CONTINUED) 
Rev. 11/16/84 63. 
83C CONTINUED: It's beautiful, perfectly shaped with thin, elegant fingers, almost womanly, the nails impossibly long, perfectly shapped, tapering to five gleaming, razor sharp points. Evil Ed slowly reaches out and-takes the vampire's hand. Jerry smiles down at him and slowly leans down, lifting him up into the last embrace Edward Thompson will ever know. 
84 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Charley and Amy walk rapidly along a street, heading toward Amy's home. He casts a glance at her. 
CHARLEY How much further? 
AMY About ten minutes -- A DEATH RATTLE, long and-high-pitched, suddenly comes to them, ECHOING through the city streets, down alleyways and across apartment buildings, faint yet filled with so much terror it stops them in their tracks and leaves them staring fearfully about at the shadows. 
CHARLEY What was that? 
AMY Evil Ed messing around. 
(SHOUTING) Not funny, Evil! Her voice bounces off the walls down the street and then dies, leaving them staring at the darkness and the shadows, fearful. Amy tries to act brave, turning to Charley. 
AMY 
C'MON -- They start down the street again, Charley glancing nervously over his. shoulder in the direction of Evil Ed's scream. 
CHARLEY Amy, what if Evil really was in trouble? 
AMY Oh, come on, Charley, don't let him suck you in again -- All the street lights suddenly go out, plunging them into almost total blackness. 
(CONTINUED) 
Rev. 12/4/84 64. 
84 CONTINUED: They whirl, looking back down the now totally dark street, slowly backing away from the darkness. 
CHARLEY (to Army, in a 
HOARSE WHISPER) Don't tell me it's a power outage. 
AMY 
(EQUALLY SCARED) What else could it be -- 7 Charley stops, grabbing her, and nods to a light pole oppo- site them. She follows his gaze to see a power box on the pole, its front ripped open, the wires inside shredded.- Before they can even gasp at the sight, they hear the SOUND 
OF HUGE WINGS beating overhead.. A huge shadow of a bat flies across the building wall opposite them. That's all it takes; they whirl, dashing down the street. 
85 OMITTED 
87 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT 
They come-racing down a street, under a bridge and start up the incline toward the ROAR above. They turn onto the bridge, starting to.cross it., slowing to a walk, breathing hard. 
CHARLEY I think we lost him. 
AMY Yeah. (stopping and turning 
TO CHARLEY) Charley, you were right about the holy water. We faked it. I'm just sorry I didn't believe you. 
CHARLEY It's all right, Amy. He kisses her, takes her hand, and they start walking up the bridge. 
CHARLEY We've got it made And they freeze.' There, high above them on one of the arches of the bridge, so high up no one could possibly get there unless they flew, stands Jerry Dandrige, staring down at them. With a scream, they whirl, racing off the bridge and down the street.

87 CONTINUED: They suddenly turn the corner only to find they are facing Jerry Dandrige, standing on the sidewalk directly in front of them, amused by the frozen expressions of horror on their faces. 
CHARLEY- Run? He grabs Amy's hand, the two of them whirling and dis- appearing around the street corner. 
There is a KNOCK at Peter's locked and barred door. He slowly rises from his chair, the cross clenched in his hand, staring at it, terrified. The KNOCKING COMES.AGAIN, louder this time. He presses his lips to the door, whis- pering. 
PETER Who is it? 
EVIL ED Me, Evil Ed. 
PETER What do you want? 
EVIL ED There's a vampire out here. Let me in. Peter slips the cross into his pocket and unlocks the door. Be pulls Evil Ed into the room, hurriedly locking and bar- ring the door behind him. Evil Ed has changed, and not for the better. His skin is more sallow, huge dark circles under his eyes, his lips bloodless, his collar pulled up tightly around his neck. Peter turns to him. 
PETER What are we going-to do? 
EVIL ED What are you going to do, not me. Peter stares at him as Evil Ed slowly reaches up and pulls down the collar of his shirt, revealing two small puncture marks on his throat. Peter's eyes widen in horror; Evil Ed's smile only grows wider. 
EVIL ED I used to admire you, you know that. Of course, that was before I found out what â¢a fake you were. 
(CONTINUED) 
94A CONTINUED: He advances on Peter, looming over him, Peter staring up at the boy in growing terror. Evil. Ed smiles at him, reveal- ing two huge fangs. Peter leaps out of the chair, dashing for the door, fumbling to undo the locks and bars with trembling fingers. Evil Ed watches, his rictus grin just growing wider. 
EVIL ED Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer, indeed! He throws himself at Peter, grabbing him from behind and whirling him about, opening his mouth wide to sink his fangs into him. Peter straightens, grabbing the cross from his pocket and thrusting it directly into Evil Ed's face, slamming it into his forehead between his eyes. His skin sizzles and cracks, smoke rising, and Evil Ed backs away, bent over screaming in pain, his hands held to his face. He slowly looks up as Peter watches, frozen in horror. Evil Ed drops his hands from his face, revealing a smoking sign of the cross branded into his forehead. He stares at Peter. 
EVIL ED What have you done to me? He turns to look into the wall mirror, but there's no re- flection.for him to see. He whirls on Peter, screaming at him like the spoiled brat he is. 
EVIL ED What have you done to me? He takes a step toward Peter and Peter thrusts the cross at him. 
PETER Back. 
EVIL ED The master will kill you for â¢this. And not fast, slowly, oh, so slowly -- Peter advances on him, the cross held out in front of him with shaking hands, backing Evil Ed across the room toward the window. 
PETER Back, I say, back --

Peter rushes to the window, staring out at the street below. Nothing. He cranes his-'neck peering at the heavens above. Nothing. He draws his head back in, leaning against.the wall, gasping for breath, on hand on his heart, feeling it about to leap out of his chest with the horror of it all.

CORE USER Hey, watch out,.asshole! Charley glances down to see the table of users grouped around their mirror of white powder. He moves quickly away, searching for Amy. He stops by the wall of poseurs cruising everything that walks by, asking a girl that looks from behind as though she must be Amy's age.

OLDER WOMAN Forget her, take me instead She reaches out to kiss Charley and he flees the crowd of flesh.watchers laughing at him as he goes. He moves along a wall of LESBIANS, stopping one, his des- peration growing. 
CHARLEY I'm looking for a girl -- 
LESBIAN So am I. Before Charley can recover a woman moves into her arms, Charley, shocked and disconcerted, backing away until he bumps to a halt against a heavy metal biker, the kind of guy who's into Twisted Sister. The parody of biker throws him to the floor for the insult, his friends, walking par- odies of bikers, laughing at Charley as he leaps to his feet and backs away into the crowd. He breaks free of the packed humanity, stopping on the stairs. It is at that moment that he catches a glimpse of Amy on the dance floor, dancing with Jerry. He hurries down the stairs and onto the floor. On the dance floor, Amy moves.with Jerry, their bodies locked together, slowly falling. into his eyes, dancing slower and slower with him until finally she has no will left of her own. She is "in love" with him. It is at that moment that she bends her head forward, laying it on his shoulder, exposing her neck to him, her eyes staring at the wall as they revolve around and around, Jerry bending down to kiss her neck, his mouth slowly opening. It is at that moment Amy sees her reflection in the mirrors mounted against one wall;.she is dancing alone. Shocked back to her senses, she goes rigid in Jerry's arms, trying to pull away from him, screaming as the music and the dancers stop. 
'AMY Charley! Across the dance floor, Charley hears her SCREAM and pushes his way through the sea of humanity, fighting his way to her side where she stands with Jerry, once again caught in his eyes, slowly losing her will. Charley grabs Jerry by the shoulder, trying to pull him away from Amy.

JERRY What's wrong, Charley? Jealous? He grinds his pelvis against.Amy, dry humping her in front of Charley. She throws her head back, her mouth opening in .something close to ecstasy, her eyes glazed, staring up at him with adoration, giving herself to him as she cocks her head to one side, exposing her tender young throat. Charley goes crazy. 
CHARLEY You filthy son-of-a-bitch -- ! He swings at him only to have Jerry release Amy, catching Charley's fist in the palm of his hand easily. Be stares down at the boy, smiling cruelly. 
.JERRY You shouldn't lose your temper, Charley. It isn't polite. He tightens his grip, slowly squeezing Charley's fist. You can almost hear the knuckle bones grinding as Charley's face'contorts in agony, driving him to his knees before Jerry. Charley looks up at him, tears of pain streaming down his face. 
CHARLEY (gasping with pain) You can't kill me here -- 
JERRY I don't want to kill you, Charley. I -want you to bring Peter Vincent to my house, just the two of you. That is if you ever want to see Amy again. He casually releases Charley, letting the boy drop to the floor as he disappears with Amy into the swirling mass of dancers. Charley leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain in his hand and plunges after them. Charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar, looking everywhere and not seeing either of them. Suddenly he's grabbed by a strong, pair of arms. He looks up to find himself staring into the face of a huge, black BOUNCER.

JERRY Am I? And she's gone, his eyes drawing her in and swallowing her up, drowning her in their faint red glow. He holds out his hand to her. She slowly takes it and-he raises her up into his arms, moving in place to the MUSIC with her, smiling down as she stares up at him blindly.

It seems to have assumed a life of its own and turned into a hulking, brooding monster, about to leap forward and pounce on him. Charley grips his stake and hammer, checks the cross stuck in his jacket pocket, takes'a deep breath, squares his shoulders, and starts the slow walk toward the Dandrige house.

Behind Peter there is suddenly a POUNDING at the attic door. Its Amy, trying to get out. Peter stares wor- riedly at the attic door as the POUNDING from within be- comes more VIOLENT. Suddenly ALL THE CLOCKS on the wall below GO OFF, signaling that it's 6 a.m., dawn, time for Jerry to go to bed. Peter takes his eyes off the clocks as the LAST CHIME DIES, looking at Charley over the Balustrade. 
PETER Keep searching for him. Se's got to be close. It's almost dawn. Charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION OF SHATTERING GLASS and Jerry Dandrige plunges in from the outside, landing in a crouch before Peter. He rises as the. older man backs away. Charley rushes down the hail back into the portico, brought by the sound of the crash. He's about to start up the stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him. Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige. 
PETER Stay there, Charley -- Charley freezes, staring up at the vampire and the man above, watching, waiting. Dandrige's gaze bores into Peter. 
JERRY So. Just the two of us at last.

151F CONTINUED: He-takes a step for Peter. Peter whips out a cross, thrusting it at him. Dandrige stops, smiling at him. He starts for him again, Peter holding his ground, the cross thrust out in front of hiin. 
PETER Back! 
JERRY 
(SMILING THINLY) You have to have faith for that to work, Mr. Vincent. Remember? Peter continues to hold his ground, the cross held up higher, staring defiantly back at Dandrige, refusing to drop his gaze. And then it happens: the vampire jerks to a halt, staring with slowly dawning fury at Peter, real- izing by whatever invisible force it is emanating from that cross that indeed Peter has recovered his faith. He stands there, stymied, snarling at the man. Peter peers over his shoulder, out the ruined window. On the horizon, the first pink tendrils of dawn are breaking. Now it's Peter's turn to smile as he shifts his gaze back to Dandrige. 
PETER Look over your shoulder. Dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring with fury. 
JERRY No! Peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire, Dandrige is too quick for him. He throws himself off the landing, tucking his body into a somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an enormous bat. The' bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms down the hallway, smashing into Charley chest high, blowing him off his feet as his claws rake the boy, sending two bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and disappears down the hallway into the darkness.

151F CONTINUED: (2) Peter recovers above, hurrying down the stairs to the portico below. He rushes to Charley's side, helping the badly shaken boy to his feet. 
PETER Are you all right? 
CHARLEY Yes. Amy begins POUNDING AT THE ATTIC DOOR. above again. The two men look up as it begins to splinter. 
PETER Quick, he's in the basement. He helps the boy. down the hall, the two of them disappear- ing through the basement door. A second later the attic DOOR above RIPS FROM ITS HINGES, CRASHING to the floor. Amy steps out of the attic, her eyes sightless, a stake grasped in her hand.' She walks like an automaton down the stairway toward the portico below.. 
152 INT. BASEMENT - DAWN 
Charley anaa$ Peter hurry down the stairs into the dark room, its windows covered with blackout drapes. The floor is a mass of antiques, row after row of them, many covered with dust cloths. Peter dives for the first one, ripping the cloth off only to discover an armoire. He rushes to the next one. 
PETER Quick, his coffin has to be here 
SOMEWHERE -- They race down the aisle continuing to rip dust covers away only to discover a line of mirrors, several of them obviously removed from pieces in the house above. They stop, staring at them. 
CHARLEY Well, now we know what he did with the mirrors -- The DOOR to the stairway- CREAKS open behind them, lost somewhere in the dark. Peter whirls, looking back the way they just came. 
PETER What was that?

152 CONTINUED: 
.CHARLEY 
(MOVING AWAY) You keep searching. I'll check it out. 
PETER 
CHARLEY But Charley has disappeared into the darkness before Peter can stop him. Charley appears down the row of antiques, stopping at the foot of the stairs and staring up at.the basement door above. It is partially open, allowing just a sliver of light into the darkness. He calls out, clutching his stake nervously. 
CHARLEY Who's there -- Amy appears out of the darkness behind him, slowly. approaching; her face deathly white, her lips blood red, her eyes almost glowing in the dark. He hears her at the last second, whirling to face her with a gasp. She reads the fear on his face and smiles sadly, reaching out a hand to him. 
AMY Don't be frightened, Charley. She takes a step closer and he steps away. Amy stops, staring at him; then she slowly begins to advance on him, unbuttoning her blouse, her voi ce a husky, purring whisper.

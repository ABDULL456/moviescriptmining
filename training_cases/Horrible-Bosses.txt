FADE IN: 
1 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 1 
Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into -- 
2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2 
He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM." 
MATCH CUT TO: 
3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3 
The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the saddest, deadest houseplant in history. 
4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4 
Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange juice container he grabs is empty. 
NICK Damn. 
He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!" Nick sighs sadly. 
5 INT. NICK'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 5 
Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes his mouth with it. 
6 INT. NICK'S SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER 6 
Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the toothbrush. 
7 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 7 
Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a while. 
8 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 8 
Nick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby. 
9 INT. NICK'S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER 9 
As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it to speakerphone. 
JENNA (V.O.) (GROGGY) Hello? 
NICK (CHEERY) Hey, Jenna, it's Nick. 
JENNA (V.O.) It's five-thirty in the morning, Nick. 
NICK Yeah, sorry. This is like the only time I have to make any personal calls. I just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because I had a great time with you on our last date. 
JENNA (V.O.) Our last date was two weeks ago. You haven't called me since. 
NICK I know and that's my bad. I've been swamped at work -- 
JENNA (V.O.) Yeah, I remember. Work was all you talked about when we went out. 
NICK Right. Well, I'm up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time -- 
(CONTINUED) 9 CONTINUED: 9 
JENNA (V.O.) Listen, I'm actually seeing someone. And even if I weren't, the last thing I need is some career-obsessed guy complaining about work all the time. See you around, Nick. 
She hangs up. 
10 EXT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - SHORT TIME LATER 10 
A soulless four-story building in a drab office park. Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance. 
11 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 11 
Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch. It reads "6:02." He looks up at a security camera with a flashing red light, indicating he is on tape. 
NICK Fuck! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
HARKEN My pleasure. 
Harken returns to his chair and sits. 
NICK Aren't you having one? 
HARKEN It's 8:15, Nick. I'm not an alcoholic. 
NICK Oh. Well, I only took it because I thought you were having one. 
HARKEN You took a drink because you thought I was going to have one? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 15 CONTINUED: (2) 15 HARKEN (CONT'D) That doesn't exactly sound like something a Senior VP would do. 
NICK Well, I -- 
HARKEN What if you thought I was going to dip my balls in honey and shaved coconut? Would you do that too? 
NICK (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Of course not. 
HARKEN Of course not. Anyway, we've moved up the date of the AGM so you're gonna need to complete your due diligence by Monday. You'll probably need to be here all weekend. 
NICK (SIGHS) Okay. 
HARKEN Hey, you want a promotion, you've gotta earn it. Life's a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples. 
NICK (huh?) Got it. 
Nick gets up to go. 
HARKEN Nick. 
Nick turns back. 
HARKEN That's 18-year-old Scotch. I can't really pour it back into the bottle. 
Nick, unsure of what to do, picks up the glass and gulps it down. 
(CONTINUED) 15 CONTINUED: (3) 15 
HARKEN That should carry you till lunch, huh? 
16 EXT. DENTAL OFFICE - DAY 16 
A car pulls up outside the modest building. 
17 INT. STACY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 17 
STACY, cute, 30's, is dropping off DALE STEVENS, 30's, who wears the scrubs of a dental hygienist. 
STACY Boy, I have to get used to driving with this heavy ring on. I keep swerving to the left. 
DALE Aww. You really like it? 
STACY I love it. I feel like a queen. 
18 CLOSE ON HER ENGAGEMENT DIAMOND 18 
It's tiny and yellowish. 
19 BACK TO SCENE 19 
DALE Well, you're my queen. I love you, Stacy. 
STACY Have a great day at work. 
They kiss. Dale exits the car. 
20 EXT. DENTAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 20 
Stacy drives off. Dale steels himself for what lies ahead, then goes inside. 
21 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 21 
Dale enters the waiting room, passing a few PATIENTS. He grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then heads INTO -- 
22 INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 22 
Dale finds his boss, DR. JULIA HARRIS, 30's, sexy but with something a little off, hovering over a patient, MR. ANDERTON, 50's. Dale seems visibly uneasy. 
JULIA All right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going to give you the nitrous now and your root canal will be over before you know it. (TO DALE) Dale? Please. 
Dale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr. Anderton's eyes roll back in his head. Julia shuts the door, picks up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar. 
JULIA (loudly, over the DRILL) How are you today, Dale? 
DALE I'm fine. Thanks. 
KURT GAMBLE, 30s, good-looking, sits at his desk. Unlike Nick and Dale, Kurt seems content in his workplace. A reasonably cute, but by no means drop-dead gorgeous, UPS GIRL approaches his desk with a package. 
UPS GIRL Excuse me? Can you sign for this, please? 
KURT (TAKING IT) Sure. (LOOKING UP) Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What is this? 
UPS GIRL I'm sorry? 
KURT This is one of those hidden camera shows, isn't it? 
UPS GIRL What do you mean? 
KURT Come on. You're way too good- looking to be a UPS girl. What are you, a model? An actress? What's gonna happen when I open this box? Is something going to jump out at me? 
(CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: 24 
UPS GIRL (GRINNING) Nothing's gonna happen. I'm just a UPS girl. 
KURT Shut up. 
UPS GIRL (PLAYFULLY) You shut up. It's true. 
KURT Well, then, I need to take you out to dinner. 
UPS GIRL Why? 
KURT Because I want to be able to tell my friends that I took out the hottest UPS girl in America. Come on, what do you say? 
She considers this briefly, then scribbles her number on a Post-it note. 
KURT Awesome. I'm Kurt. 
UPS GIRL Myrna. 
KURT Pretty name. How's Tuesday? Macaroni Grill? 
UPS GIRL Okay. 
KURT See you then, Myrna. 
She heads off. Kurt opens his DATEBOOK and scribbles "UPS Girl" in the Tuesday slot. We see every night of the week is filled with appointments with other women: "Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren? Laura?," "Blonde Chick" and so on. 
JACK (O.S.) Busy week? 
Kurt looks up at JACK PELLIT, 70s, the kindly, affectionate owner of the company. (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: (2) 24 
KURT Hey, Jack. Yeah, just doing my part for the women of America. 
JACK (CHUCKLING) You're what we used to call a rapscallion. 
KURT That sounds a lot more innocent than `sex addict.' 
JACK Walk with me, Kurt. 
The two of them head toward the exit. 
JACK I wanted to talk to you about -- 
KURT Last quarter's profits? I ran the numbers. We're down by 11 percent year-to-year. 
JACK It's this damn recession. What about cost-cutting measures? 
KURT Well, I know you don't want to cut STAFF -- 
JACK No way. These people have worked their asses off for me. There's no reason they should suffer. 
Kurt looks at his boss with admiration. There's a lot of love between these two. 
KURT There's also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal. We're paying a lot right now and the Bolivians have come back with a very good offer. 
JACK You know why it's good? Because they'll dump our chemicals in rivers, pollute water supplies and hurt people. I've spent my life building this company. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: (3) 24 JACK (CONT'D) Would you want the Pellit name to be associated with something like that? 
KURT No, I wouldn't. 
As they pass the unisex rest room, they see MARGIE, 30s and clearly pregnant, looking uncomfortable as she waits to get in. 
JACK Everything okay, Margie? 
MARGIE Oh hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt. I've just been waiting to get in there for a while now... 
JACK Who's in there? 
MARGIE It's... your son. 
JACK (SIGHS) Of course it is. (then, knocking on THE DOOR) Bobby? There's someone waiting. You almost done in there? 
NICK There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there. 
DALE I can't apply for another job, remember? 
KURT Oh, right. Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester. 
(CONTINUED) 26 CONTINUED: (2) 26 
NICK He's not a child molester. He just took his dick out in a playground. 
DALE It was nighttime and I was peeing! And it's bullshit that I got put on the registered sex offender list for that! 
KURT It worked out. Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself. 
DALE Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway? That's entrapment. 
A SEMI-CUTE GIRL walks past. 
KURT (WITH JOYLESS RESIGNATION) Well, I should go see if that girl wants to bone. 
Kurt groans as he pulls himself out of the booth. 
NICK I thought you were all broken up about your boss dying. 
KURT This is how I grieve, okay? 
Kurt heads off after the girl. 
DALE Man. He must be grieving all the time. 
27 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY 27 
Nick sits alongside five other CO-WORKERS at a conference table. Harken's chair at the head is empty. Nick pours himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table. 
NICK He did say ten o'clock, right? 
(CONTINUED) 27 CONTINUED: 27 
CO-WORKER Yeah. Do you know what this is about? 
NICK It just said `staff meeting' on the memo. (WHISPERING) Funny how he gets all over me if I'm a minute late, but he makes us wait fifteen. 
HARKEN (O.S.) You were two minutes late, Nick. 
Nick jumps as Harken enters. 
HARKEN And I didn't know I had to punch a clock with you. 
NICK You don't. Of course you don't. I'm sorry -- 
HARKEN I'm going to attribute this to your drinking problem. 
NICK I don't have a -- 
HARKEN (with a smile to the OTHERS) Let's get started. Shall we? 
Nick's eyes narrow. Suddenly, he grabs the heavy glass pitcher from the table and SHATTERS IT AGAINST HARKEN'S FACE. Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls from his chair onto the floor. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
28 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 28 
Harken is fine. Nick is as we left him. 
HARKEN Okay, have we figured out our best sales distribution plan for the new model year handsets? 
(CONTINUED) 28 CONTINUED: 28 
Nick's CO-WORKERS bury their heads in their notes. Nick tensely raises his hand. 
HARKEN Yes? 
NICK I simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables. 
HARKEN And? 
NICK And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield. 
Harken nods. Is he impressed? 
HARKEN Thank you, Nick. Did everyone see how he did that? Yes, he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem, but when the chips are down, Nick has what it takes. 
Nick glows. 
HARKEN Which brings us to our next order of business. I've decided who I want as our new Senior VP of Sales. He's sitting right here among you. 
PELLIT Bullshit. Look, I know you and my dad were pals. Frankly, I always thought it was weird and gay and I never understood why my dad thought you were so great. But it doesn't matter now because he's in the ground and I'm your boss. And there's gonna be some changes around here. First of all... (pointing to a BALANCE SHEET) What is this `EnviroTech Waste Management' shit that we're paying so much for? 
KURT Your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly. 
PELLIT Yeah, fuck that. We've got an offer from Bolivia to dump the stuff for a third the cost. 
KURT But that would endanger thousands of local residents. 
(CONTINUED) 31 CONTINUED: 31 
PELLIT So some jungle tribesmen get cancer. Boo friggin' hoo. 
KURT They're not tribesmen. It's a MODERN -- (THEN) Look, Bobby, your dad told me very clearly he'd die before he'd save money by hurting people. 
PELLIT Well then, we're right on schedule, aren't we? 
Kurt's eyes narrow. He reaches into the trash can and grabs one of Jack's discarded ACHIEVEMENT TROPHIES and PLUNGES its pointy end deep into Pellit's chest, impaling him in his chair. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
32 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 32 
Kurt sits across from an unharmed Pellit. 
PELLIT Oh, and we also need to trim the fat around here. 
KURT (snapping out of it) What do you mean? 
PELLIT I want you to fire the fat people. They're slow and lazy and they make me sad to look at. Start with Large Marge. 
ANGLE ON Margie at her desk. 
KURT Margie's not fat. She's pregnant. I'm not firing her. 
PELLIT Fine. Then fire Professor Xavier over there. 
ANGLE ON a balding, middle-aged man in a wheelchair, HANK, who sits at a desk near Margie's. 
(CONTINUED) 32 CONTINUED: 32 
KURT Hank? 
PELLIT He creeps me out. Rolling around in that weird little chair of his. 
KURT I'm not firing anyone! It's like you don't care about this company at all. 
PELLIT No shit. You think when I was a kid I dreamed of running a fucking chemical company? No. I dreamed of retiring. Of being fed tropical fruit on a beach by a model while she blows me. And as soon as I squeeze all the profit out of this place, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. So here's the deal. You either fire the fatty or the cripple, or I fire both of them. 
33 INT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. - MOMENTS LATER 33 
Kurt sighs as he looks from Margie to Hank and back. At last, he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hank's desk. From a RESPECTFUL DISTANCE we watch as Kurt breaks the news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation. 
Kurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him. 
PELLIT (loudly, to the room) Everyone, can I have your attention please? I've just learned that Kurt has fired our dear friend Hank here. I want you to know that I am as surprised and angry about this as you are. 
KURT What are you -- ?! 
PELLIT This is entirely an accounting department decision. My hands are tied. (then, to Kurt) You are one heartless bastard, Gamble. (CONTINUED) 33 CONTINUED: 33 
Pellit heads off. Hank glares at Kurt. 
KURT Look, Hank, this was not my -- 
HANK Fuck you, Kurt. 
Hank wheels away, leaving Kurt to face the angry looks of his CO-WORKERS. 
CUT TO: 
34 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - DAY 34 
Dale, dressed for work, knocks on Julia's office door. 
JULIA (O.S.) Come in. 
35 INT. JULIA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 35 
Dale enters. 
DALE You wanted to see -- 
He looks up to find Julia sitting at her desk in nothing but an unbuttoned white lab coat. 
DALE (AVERTING EYES) Oh, God. 
DALE Easy, Kenny. 
KENNY It's just not fair. I was making high six-figures. Now I can't even afford this drink. (holds up glass) Seriously, you think you guys can help me out at all? 
The three guys exchange uncomfortable looks as they reach for their wallets. 
DALE Uh, sure. Here's a few bucks, Kenny. 
KENNY Okay, y'know that's not really gonna do it for me. (looking around, LEANING IN) I'll tell you what? What if I give you guys handjobs? Forty bucks. We can do it in the bathroom right here. I'll do the three of you for a hundred. 
KURT You're gay now? 
KENNY No, I'm not gay. 
They look skeptical. 
KENNY I'm the opposite of gay! 
They guys look at each other with eyebrows raised. Nick mouths "opposite." 
KENNY Come on. Handjobs for the Three Musketeers. Let's do this! 
The BARTENDER spots Kenny and points at him. 
BARTENDER (YELLING) I thought I told you to stay out of here! 
(CONTINUED) 36 CONTINUED: (3) 36 
KENNY Whoops. Gotta go, guys. Call me if you change your minds. I'm at my mom's. 
He hurries out. There's a silent beat as the guys process what they've just witnessed. 
CUT TO: 
37 EXT. STREET - LATER 37 
The three guys are walking home, all mildly buzzed. 
KURT So I guess we're just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives. 
DALE What do you mean? 
KURT What options do we have? We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny. Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses. 
There's a beat as Nick regards Kurt. 
NICK You do that too? 
KURT Of course. Everyone does. It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit. 
NICK The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes. 
DALE Jeez. 
KURT That's so funny. I had the same idea for Pellit. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: 37 KURT (CONT'D) Only using gasoline instead of water. And his ass instead of his mouth. 
DALE You guys are sick. 
KURT What's sick about it? It's just a way to let off steam. 
NICK Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses. 
They continue walking. After a beat. 
KURT You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead. 
NICK Well, of course. It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy. 
DALE Me too. 
There's another beat. 
KURT Let's just consider this, for one second. 
DALE Consider what? 
KURT Killing our bosses. I'm just being hypothetical here. 
DALE (laughing it off) Yeah, right. 
NICK Very funny. 
KURT Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever. These pieces of shit are going to die someday. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: (2) 37 KURT (CONT'D) We'd just be accelerating that natural process. 
NICK Shut up, Kurt. 
He points to his computer. On the screen is a listing FROM -- 
DALE Craigslist?! You found a hitman on Craigslist. 
KURT Yup. But they don't post it as `hitman.' That would be stupid. They use code words, like `liquidation,' `pest control,' `wet work.' Check it out. This is our guy. 
Nick reads the listing. 
NICK `Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work. Fast and discreet. No children or political figures.' 
KURT See? He's principled. 
DALE This is so dangerous. What if he's a narc? 
NICK Yeah, Kurt. Call him back and cancel. 
KURT It's too late. He's on his way. 
DALE What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we can't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us? 
KURT I don't think he'd stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldn't afford him. 
NICK (looking out window) Guys! I think this is him! 
The others hurry to look. From -- 
44 THEIR POV 44 
We see a black Mercedes SLK pull up. A distinguished- looking MAN in a well-tailored suit steps out. He wears sunglasses and carries a briefcase. 
45 BACK TO SCENE 45 
NICK Nice car. 
KURT Whoa. This guy's legit. 
DALE I bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together. 
NICK All right, let's just be professional here. We don't want to seem all giddy. 
A knock at the door. 
KURT (HUSHED) How's my hair? 
NICK (SOTTO) It doesn't matter! 
Kurt opens the door on the Man who looks even smoother up close. 
MAN (BRITISH ACCENT) Is one of you Kurt? 
DALE (whispering to Nick) Oh my God, he's like James Bond! 
KURT (to the Man) Yes, hi, I'm Kurt. Please come in. 
MAN Thank you. Are all three of you participating in this? 
(CONTINUED) 45 CONTINUED: 45 
NICK Yes, we are. 
MAN Very well. Now before we go any further, I need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in this room. I will find out if there are. 
DALE No, no! We definitely don't want to record this, sir. 
MAN Then let's get started. 
He walks to the middle of the living room, opens his briefcase and takes out a plastic tarp which he proceeds to unfurl over the carpet. 
KURT Whoa, whoa. What's that for? 
MAN For the mess. 
NICK We don't want you to kill us! 
DALE (FREAKING OUT) Oh my God! I knew it! 
MAN Kill you? What are you talking about? 
The guys exchange a confused look. 
KURT Your ad said you do wet work. 
MAN That's correct. I urinate on other men for money. 
NICK/KURT What?! 
KURT Actually, I do find Atmanand a little off-putting. 
(CONTINUED) 48 CONTINUED: 48 
GREGORY (V.O.) (FLAT) You have arrived at your destination, sir. 
DALE/NICK Thank you, Gregory./Thanks, Gregory. 
49 EXT. DIVE BAR - SHORT TIME LATER 49 
Kurt's car pulls up on a grimy-looking South-Central street and stops in front of a dingy bar. The guys get out and look around warily. 
KURT This must be the place. 
DALE Aren't you worried about your car? 
KURT Nah, Gregory's watching it. 
NICK You really think we're gonna find a hitman in there? 
KURT I think we're gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there. Trust me, these are the lowest of the low. 
50 INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 50 
The three guys enter the squalid, smoky place. The room is full of surly-looking PATRONS, none of them white. People turn to stare. 
NICK Oh, real nice, Kurt. Way to be racist. 
KURT This isn't a race thing. We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live. I'm not saying that's because there are a lot of black people here. That's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them. (CONTINUED) 50 CONTINUED: 50 
DALE You said they were the lowest of the low. 
KURT I was speaking socio-economically. 
NICK So what do we do now? Yell out `anyone here kill people for money?' 
KURT Let me handle this. 
They each take a seat at the bar where a no-nonsense BARTENDER walks over to them. 
BARTENDER Yeah? 
KURT Hey. How you doing? Nice place. (LEANING IN) Listen, does anyone here kill people for money? 
NICK Kurt! 
An intense-looking GUY on the next stool notices them. 
BARTENDER The fuck did you just say? 
KURT Don't get me wrong. This isn't about race. Our society discriminates and disenfranchises YOU -- 
DALE (head in hands) Oh my God. 
BARTENDER I'm a small business owner. Who are you calling disenfranchised? 
KURT I didn't mean you in particular. 
BARTENDER Right. You mean all black people. 
(CONTINUED) 50 CONTINUED: (2) 50 
NICK Maybe we should go? 
BARTENDER You could do that. Or I could take the aluminum baseball bat I'm holding in my right hand and disenfranchise your teeth from your mouth. 
DALE I vote we go. 
The three stand and head for the door. 
KURT Okay, we're going. I'm sorry if I offended you. It was never my -- 
BARTENDER Oh shit, please shut up. 
KURT Okey doke. 
51 EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 51 
The guys come out onto the sidewalk. 
DALE This is ridiculous. We're never gonna find someone to do this for us. 
COCKSUCKER JONES (O.S.) Yo! 
They turn to see COCKSUCKER JONES, 30s, the guy who was sitting next to them at the bar. 
DALE Or plastic. I read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper. 
COCKSUCKER JONES Fuck the environment! Just put that shit in a briefcase. 
NICK Got it. Thanks. Come on, guys. 
They turn to go, when Dale turns back. (CONTINUED) 52 CONTINUED: (4) 52 
DALE Should we deduct the cost of the briefcase? 
COCKSUCKER JONES What?! 
DALE I mean, assuming we don't get the case back... We're not getting the case back, right? 
Cocksucker glares at him. 
DALE Well, that's like an extra eighty bucks. Only seems fair that we should take that out of your end. 
NICK We'll cover the briefcase, Dale. 
DALE Then let's get a cheap one. It doesn't have to be real leather. (then to Cocksucker) Are you cool with faux -- ? 
Kurt grabs Dale by the shoulder and hustles him to the car. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
53 SERIES OF SHOTS 53 
MUSIC CUE: Frank Sinatra's "(Forget Your Troubles, Come On) Get Happy" 
-- Dale, Kurt and Nick each take a turn at an ATM machine, withdrawing the maximum amount they can. 
-- Nick at his desk at work. He looks over his cubicle wall and his eyes narrow as he sees Harken directing a WORKMAN who stencils the words "Senior Vice President of Sales" below where it already says "President." Another WORKMAN uses a sledgehammer on the wall of the office. Nick grins malevolently. 
-- Kurt is at his desk in the chemical company. He looks up to see Bobby Pellit open his office door and lead out two obvious HOOKERS. Pellit has white powder around his nostrils. He spots Kurt watching him and he sneers back. Kurt smiles devilishly. 
(CONTINUED) 53 CONTINUED: 53 
-- CLOSE ON Dale as he places tooth X-rays into plastic contact sheets. PULL BACK to reveal Julia is licking his neck while tweaking his nipples through his scrubs. In contrast to earlier, Dale appears to be unfazed and almost amused by Julia's antics. 
54 EXT. ALLEY - THAT NIGHT 54 
Cocksucker Jones holds an open briefcase that's empty but for a single stack of taped together 20-dollar bills. 
COCKSUCKER JONES Looks like it's all here. 
DALE Turns out we didn't really need the briefcase after all. Could've just used a manila envelope. 
KURT Shut up, Dale. 
NICK So, Cocksucker, how long do you think it'll be before you've... taken care of business? 
COCKSUCKER JONES Here's the thing. I just got out of doing a dime for some pretty ugly shit and I'm still on probation. They're watching me. So if I step out of line, I go right back inside. 
KURT You told us you could take care of it. 
COCKSUCKER JONES And I'm gonna. I'm gonna be your professional advisor. Think of me as your murder consultant. 
NICK We don't want a murder consultant. We want a murderer. 
DALE I knew we were getting ripped off! 
KURT Okay, look. This isn't what we talked about. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 54 CONTINUED: 54 KURT (CONT'D) Can we just get our money back, please? Then we'll be on our way. 
COCKSUCKER JONES Sorry, no refunds. 
NICK That's five thousand dollars. You think we're just gonna walk away and let you keep that? 
COCKSUCKER JONES (getting in his face) I think you're forgetting who you're talking to. 
Cocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun. 
DALE Whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble. 
COCKSUCKER JONES Now either I give you the advice you paid for, or you can walk away with nothing. Up to you. 
KURT Look, the whole reason we came to you is because we don't have the experience to do it ourselves. 
COCKSUCKER JONES Most killers are first-timers. Look, the key to a good murder is making it look like an accident. Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide, that sort of thing. If you do it right, you won't even have to be there when it goes down. 
NICK That makes sense. But how would we fake three accidents? 
COCKSUCKER JONES You need to stalk your prey, track their movements, get to know them inside and out. Where do they go? What do they eat for breakfast? Who're they fucking? 
(CONTINUED) 54 CONTINUED: (2) 54 
NICK Are we even sure he's home? 
They exchange looks. 
KURT (opening his door) Let's go check it out. 
They get out of the car. Dale pockets his sandwich. 
60 EXT. PELLIT'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 60 
The three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in doors and windows. Finally: 
NICK I don't see him. 
Kurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him. 
DALE What are you doing? 
KURT We're not gonna get intel standing on his lawn. We have to go in. 
DALE What about fingerprints? We don't have gloves. 
KURT Here, do this. 
Kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands. Dale does the same. Nick, who wears a T-shirt, tucks his hands inside the bottom of the shirt. With some difficulty, Kurt slides open the window. 
KURT Here we go. 
The three of them manage to wriggle through the window. It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill, causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last, all three are inside. 
61 INT. PELLIT'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 61 
KURT Dale, keep an eye out. Let us know if Pellit's coming. 
DALE Got it. Wait, I don't know what he looks like. 
NICK It doesn't matter. Just tell us if anyone comes. 
DALE Got it. 
They take in Pellit's living room. There's a leather sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers. On the wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and half-naked girls. 
KURT Wow. This guy's a bigger douchebag than me. 
NICK Okay, let's split up. Look for any intel we can use on him. 
KURT What kind of intel? 
NICK I don't know. I guess we'll know it when we see it. 
Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the living room. 
DALE Hey, Nick? Does this count as intel? 
Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered hands an open wooden box filled with white powder. 
NICK Holy shit, that's a lot of blow. 
DALE God, this must be worth, like, ten thousand -- oh shit! 
(CONTINUED) 61 CONTINUED: 61 
Suddenly, the box slips out of Dale's hands. It hits the floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug. 
NICK What the fuck?!! 
DALE Sorry, my sleeves were slippery! 
NICK We've got to get that back in the box. 
DALE I've got it. 
He kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his hands. It's an impossible task. 
62 INT. PELLIT'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 62 
Kurt looks around the room. He doesn't see anything useful so he heads into -- 
63 INT. PELLIT'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 63 
He flips on the light. His eyes land on Pellit's toothbrush. He grins slyly. 
64 INT. PELLIT'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 64 
Dale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick returns from the kitchen cradling a Dustbuster in his T- shirt. 
KURT Holy shit! He's really doing it! (REALIZING) Out where everyone can see him. 
(CONTINUED) 80 CONTINUED: 80 
NICK What the hell is he thinking?! 
KURT He's not stopping. He's gonna get us all caught. We've gotta get out of here. 
NICK What about Dale? 
KURT He's a psychopath. We leave him behind. 
NICK Right. Let's go through the back! 
As they hurry to leave the room, Kurt stumbles over the CAT which has appeared yet again. Unseen by either of them, PELLIT'S BLACKBERRY SLIPS out of his pocket and lands on the floor at the foot of Harken's bed. 
81 EXT. HARKEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 81 
As Dale kneels over Harken to check his breathing, a car pulls up alongside and MRS. HARKEN steps out. Seeing her husband on the ground, she rushes over. 
MRS. HARKEN Oh my god! What happened?! 
DALE He had an allergic reaction. But I think he's coming around. Do you know him? 
MRS. HARKEN He's my husband. 
Mrs. Harken kneels beside Harken and supports his head. 
MRS. HARKEN Honey? Can you hear me? 
Harken groggily looks down at his torso which is perforated by dozens of tiny needle marks. 
HARKEN (groggy, to Dale) Wha-- What did you do to me? 
DALE I injected you with your thing. (CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: 81 
MRS. HARKEN He saved your life, honey. (TO DALE) Thank you so much! 
She grabs Dale in a warm hug. 
DALE Oh, it was nothing. 
HARKEN (to Mrs. Harken) What's this? What's with the hugging? 
MRS. HARKEN I'm just thankful that he was here. 
HARKEN I'll bet you are. Do you know this guy? 
MRS. HARKEN No. We just -- 
HARKEN Are you fucking him, Rhonda? 
MRS. HARKEN Oh, come on. 
HARKEN (TO DALE) What were you doing out here, anyway? Waiting to fuck my wife? 
DALE (FLUSTERED) I've never met your wife -- 
Still a bit woozy, Harken gets to his feet and points at Dale. 
HARKEN You need to get the hell out of here. 
MRS. HARKEN Dave, stop it. You should be thanking him. Why are you being so suspicious? 
(CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: (2) 81 
HARKEN Why? Because I know you sleep around on me. And I'm going to find out who it is. 
MRS. HARKEN You're being ridiculous. 
HARKEN Am I? What about Maurilio? I see the way you look at him. 
MRS. HARKEN I am not having sex with the gardener! 
As Harken and his wife continue to bicker, Dale quietly retreats to Kurt's car. 
82 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATER 82 
Nick and Kurt pace nervously. 
NICK I can't believe that idiot Dale. You realize we're all going to jail because of him. 
KURT I can't go to jail. Look at these eyes. Look at this ass. They'll be all over me. 
NICK Yeah, me too. 
NICK (ON PHONE) Hey. Have you learned anything about Julia yet? 
KURT Well, I've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot. How's it going over there? 
NICK I'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep. I wonder how Dale's doing with Harken. 
86 EXT. HARKEN'S STREET - SAME TIME 86 
Dale's car is parked. 
87 INT. DALE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 87 
Dale watches the movie Precious on his laptop. He glances over to see Harken turn on the light in his bedroom. On the seat beside Dale, we see a large jar of Planters peanuts. 
88 INT. HARKEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 88 
Harken looks around suspiciously, then goes to Mrs. Harken's closet. He opens it and begins looking through her clothing. He sniffs one of her dresses and his eyes narrow. He sniffs himself, then compares it to the smell of the dress. Unsatisfied, he continues searching around the room for any incriminating evidence. Suddenly, his foot comes in contact with something on the floor. He reaches down and picks up... 
PELLIT'S BLACKBERRY. 
He turns it on and scrolls down the contacts list to "HOME" which shows Bobby Pellit's name and address. Harken's face turns beet red. 
89 INT. DALE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 89 
Dale ducks down as he sees Harken's garage door opening. Harken's Porsche 911 pulls out and zooms up the street. Still scooched down, Dale dials his phone. 
90 INT. NICK'S CAR - SAME TIME 90 
Nick watches Pellit performing a series of sweaty KUNG FU MOVES in a full-length mirror. 
NICK Jesus, where does he get the energy? (REMEMBERING) Oh yeah. 
CELL PHONE RINGS. 
Nick answers. 
NICK What's up, Dale? (CONTINUED) 90 CONTINUED: 90 
DALE Harken just left his house. I'm going in. 
NICK Good luck, man. 
DALE Thanks. 
91 INT. HARKEN'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 91 
Dale flips on the light and enters clutching the peanut jar in his gloved hands. He slides open the shower curtain and Harken's CAT LEAPS OUT at him. 
DALE Ahhh! 
He regains his composure and finds a bottle of men's shampoo. As he nervously removes the cap from the shampoo and the lid from the peanuts, he notices that MR. PEANUT is STARING right at him. Despite his jaunty top hat and little monocle, there is something almost accusing in his look. Dale stares back at Mr. Peanut as we see his resolve soften. 
92 INT. NICK'S CAR - SAME TIME 92 
Nick watches as Pellit finally gets into bed and turns off his bedside lamp. 
NICK Okay. Here we go. 
Nick reaches for the door handle as -- 
SFX: Nick's cell phone rings. Nick jumps, then answers the phone. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
93 INT. HARKEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 93 
DALE (INTO PHONE) Nick? 
NICK What? 
(CONTINUED) 93 CONTINUED: 93 
DALE I'm not sure if I can do this. 
NICK Where are you? 
DALE In Harken's bathroom. About to pour the nuts in his shampoo. But, I just... I know he's a real shithead, but he's still a person, y'know? 
Lights appear in Nick's rearview mirror. 
NICK (looking down at the rat poison, RELUCTANTLY) Yeah. I know. 
Harken's Porsche pulls up and stops just behind Nick's car. Harken gets out and heads toward Pellit's front door. 
DALE What should I do? Should I do it? 
NICK You think when it came down to it, you would've been able to murder Julia? 
Kurt softens. 
KURT I don't know. I mean, afterwards, it was kind of hard to imagine killing her. 
Nick and Dale turn to him, quizzically. 
DALE `Afterwards'? 
Kurt realizes what he said. 
NICK You slept with her, didn't you? 
DALE (TO KURT) Oh god. Please tell me you didn't sleep with her. 
Kurt lowers his head. 
NICK You are a mess. 
KURT I know, I know. But it's not my fault. 
CUT TO: 
100 FLASHBACK - EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 100 
Kurt's car is parked across the street. 
KURT (V.O.) At first I was surveilling her just like I was supposed to... 
101 INT. KURT'S CAR - NIGHT 101 
Kurt watches through her bedroom window as Julia undresses sexily. 
KURT (V.O.) Then she started deliberately undressing in front of the window. With the lights on. She must've known I was there. 
As Julia removes her bra, we see Kurt's face pressed against his car window, his breath fogging it up. 
102 INT. KURT'S CAR - LATER 102 
Julia enters her bedroom with a tray of food. She wears a skimpy kimono-style robe. She sits on her bed and unwraps a Popsicle. 
KURT (V.O.) Then she made herself a little snack. A Popsicle... 
We see Julia eat the Popsicle as suggestively as humanly possible. Then she picks up a banana and peels it. 
KURT (V.O.) ... then a banana.... 
Julia eases the whole banana into her mouth. Then she picks up a hot dog. 
KURT (V.O.) ... and finally a hot dog. I mean, three penis-shaped foods cannot be coincidence. And in that weird order? That's not a proper meal. 
103 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER 103 
DALE (V.O.) So you took that as an invitation to fuck her? 
Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and beckons him inside with one finger. She walks back inside, leaving the door wide open. 
KURT (V.O.) No. I took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her. (CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: 103 
Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out headfirst, planting his face on the street. He jumps up, but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt. He finally extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he can. 
104 INT. BRADFORD'S BAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) 104 
NICK There is something clinically wrong with you. 
KURT I know. I'm a rapscallion. 
DALE You're not a rapscallion. You're a whore. A filthy whore. 
KURT Hey. Not nice. And besides, I think I actually solved your problem, Dale. Julia just needed a good fucking. I bet she's not going to mess with you anymore. 
NICK Whatever. We have bigger fish to fry right now. What do we do about Harken? 
KURT Here's what we do. We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit. Boom. Harken's in jail. Pellit's in hell. Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her. Our problems are solved. Boom. 
NICK Okay, but we should find a payphone. We don't want them tracing the call to us. 
105 EXT. BRADFORD'S BAR - MINUTES LATER 105 
Nick, Kurt and Dale emerge from the bar. 
NICK Come on, we'll take my car. 
The three of them climb into Nick's car. 
DALE (WRY) You want me to get you a Kleenex? 
KURT I can't believe this. (TO NICK) What were you doing near his house?! 
Nick looks at him, pissed. 
NICK Where were you during the murder? 
KURT I was making love. 
DALE (SNORTS) `Making love.' 
KURT (to the cops) Let me ask you something, Detective. Let's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter. Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information? 
Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him. 
HAGAN No. But he would be entitled to some sort of jail time. Because if he knew who the shooter was and didn't tell us, that would be obstruction of justice. 
A beat. 
KURT Well, then I'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is, right, guys? 
(CONTINUED) 110 CONTINUED: (2) 110 
SAMSON (LOSING PATIENCE) If you expect us to believe this is all just a big coincidence, we're going to be here for a long time. 
DALE Okay wait! 
Now it's Kurt and Nick who look nervous. Is Dale about to crack? 
DALE Saying that we'll be here for a long time implies that we can't leave. Does that mean we're under arrest? 
Samson looks to Hagan who grimaces. 
HAGAN No. We just brought you in for questioning. 
DALE So, you don't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us? 
SAMSON Not yet. 
DALE Well then, we're free to go? 
HAGAN Technically. 
Dale nervously stands up, half expecting to be hit. 
DALE Come on, guys. 
Kurt and Nick, impressed and relieved, stand and head out. 
111 INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION 111 
The three guys head for the exit. 
(CONTINUED) 111 CONTINUED: 111 
NICK (TO DALE) Nice work. Where'd that come from? 
DALE `Law & Order.' 
KURT We really showed those guys. 
NICK `We'? You were gonna turn us in! 
KURT For, like, a second. 
SAMSON (O.S.) Stop! 
The guys turn to see Samson holding out a traffic citation. 
SAMSON (handing it to Nick) For speeding and running a red light. (THEN) Don't get too comfortable out there, boys. Our forensics team is sweeping Pellit's house for fingerprints and DNA. And they don't miss much. 
We HOLD ON Kurt's face and -- 
CUT TO: 
112 FLASHBACK - INT. PELLIT'S BATHROOM - DAY 112 
Kurt pulls Pellit's toothbrush out of his butt and returns it to its holder. 
113 BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) 113 
Kurt suddenly looks nauseous. 
114 INT. KURT'S CAR - MINUTES LATER 114 
KURT Hold on. You're telling me we've been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie?! 
COCKSUCKER JONES So you do know it. 
DALE If you're not a murderer, why do you carry that gun on your belt? 
COCKSUCKER JONES Gun? 
He pulls back his jacket to reveal the holster we saw earlier. 
COCKSUCKER JONES This is a motherfucking iPhone. 
He pulls the phone out and shows them. 
NICK I feel like such a moron. 
COCKSUCKER JONES Well, you are a moron. You don't walk into a bar and hand a guy five thousand dollars just because he's black. 
KURT Come on, guys. Let's get out of here. 
The three of them turn to go. 
COCKSUCKER JONES (calling after them) Trust me on the wire thing, though. Worked for Donnie Brasco. Bootlegged that movie too. 
116 EXT. POLICE CRIME LAB - NEXT DAY 116 
Hagan and Samson pull up in their car and get out. 
117 INT. FORENSICS LAB - MOMENTS LATER 117 
The detectives enter to find a CRIME TECH leaning over his computer. (CONTINUED) 117 CONTINUED: 117 
HAGAN You got something for us? 
CRIME TECH We didn't find any foreign prints in the house, but we did get a DNA match for one of your suspects, Kurt Gamble. 
SAMSON Where was it? 
CRIME TECH Pellit's upstairs bathroom. His toothbrush. It had traces of Gamble's fecal matter. 
HAGAN That sick bastard. 
CRIME TECH That's not all. We found feces on Pellit's hairbrush, face soap, floss and razor. 
SAMSON Razor?! 
CRIME TECH The handle. Not the blade. This Gamble guy put just about everything in that bathroom up his ass. 
HAGAN All I care about is that it puts him inside the house. That's enough for a warrant for him and his drag racing, sex offender friends. (takes out cell) I'll call the DA. 
118 EXT. HARKEN'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT 118 
Kurt's car pulls up with the lights off and parks. 
119 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 119 
Kurt is at the wheel, Nick sits shotgun, Dale in back. 
(CONTINUED) 119 CONTINUED: 119 
KURT Okay, looks quiet. Is the tape recorder ready? 
Dale pulls out a mini-tape recorder and hands it to Nick along with a roll of surgical tape. 
DALE Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour tape, voice activated. 
NICK One of us needs to tape it to our chest. 
KURT I'll do it. I'm the only one without hair on my chest. 
NICK That's `cause you shave it. 
KURT I don't shave it. I wax it. 
Nick gives Kurt the recorder and Kurt tapes it to his chest then lowers his shirt. 
DALE So what do we do now? Wait for Harken to come home and ambush him? 
NICK I have a better idea. Let's be in the house when he walks in. He'll be so mad, he'll be more likely to confess. 
KURT Right. We'll sit there in the dark till he comes in, and then switch on a lamp. That'll freak him out. 
DALE Hey, we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken. 
NICK I'll be in the chair. 
SFX: Dale's cell phone rings. 
DALE (ANSWERING PHONE) Hello? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
133 INT. JULIA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME 133 
Julia lies in a bubble bath, a glass of wine on the edge of the tub. 
JULIA Hello, lover. 
DALE Oh God. Look, Julia, I can't talk right now -- 
Kurt reacts at hearing it's Julia. He makes an "I'm not here" gesture. 
JULIA No worries, baby. I actually meant to call your home phone. You know, to tell Stacy about us. 
DALE No! Wait! 
JULIA I think I've waited long enough. I'm tired of you playing with my emotions. 
DALE I'm not playing. I'm going to do it. I swear! 
JULIA This Friday. At the office. 
DALE Fine! 
JULIA Wait. What are you going to do to me? 
DALE I'm going to... have sex with you. 
JULIA Details! And be explicit. 
DALE Right now? You want me to say it? 
KURT Oh, shit. We've got company. 
(CONTINUED) 133 CONTINUED: 133 
He points out the back window and the guys react as they see Harken driving directly on their tail. 
NICK It's Harken! Lose him! 
KURT Lose him? Sure, Nick. His 500 horsepower is no match for my 150. 
JULIA (ON PHONE) Say it! 
DALE (BLURTING OUT) I'm gonna put my penis in your pussy! 
Despite the danger, Kurt and Nick turn curiously to look at Dale. 
JULIA Oh, come on, Casanova. You can do better than that. 
DALE (WITH DIFFICULTY) I'm gonna make you feel good. With my tongue... and my fingers. And whatnot. 
Just then, Harken speeds up and SLAMS into the tail of Kurt's car. Kurt struggles to stay on the road. 
NICK Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts! 
JULIA You going to slap me with your cock, Dale? 
DALE Yes! Yes! I'm going to beat your face with my cock! 
JULIA More! 
BANG! Harken again HITS Kurt's car from behind. A tail light shatters. 
(CONTINUED) 133 CONTINUED: (2) 133 
DALE (FRANTIC) I'm gonna put my balls in your hair! I'm gonna spit on your arms! 
Kurt and Nick exchange a baffled look. 
JULIA See you Friday, you dirty bird. 
Julia hangs up. Dale looks like he's been violated. 
DALE Nice job `fucking the crazy out of her,' Kurt! 
KURT Maybe I should've spit on her arms. 
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Good evening, Mr. Gamble. 
The three of them JUMP, startled by the sudden voice in the car with them. 
HARKEN Is it? Because I don't see a shred of evidence proving that I killed Pellit. It's like I've always told you, Nick. Life is a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples. 
Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won. Then, from the car's open window they hear: 
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Did I mention that this conversation is being recorded? 
Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief. 
HARKEN Who said that? 
KURT (GRINNING) That's Gregory, our On Star rep. 
ON STAR REP (V.O.) (PROUDLY) My name is Atmanand! 
Harken's face falls. He looks around nervously as the police cars come to a halt. 
HARKEN You can't -- this isn't -- 
And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment together. 
(CONTINUED) 134 CONTINUED: (3) 134 
NICK I think this is gonna work out okay for us. 
KURT I told you. 
DALE (RE: HARKEN) Should we stop him? 
KURT Probably. 
NICK I've got this. (looking to heaven) This is for you, Gam Gam. 
Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt. 
As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of Harken's neck, pinning him. 
HARKEN Get the fuck off me! 
Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure. 
KURT (GENTLY) Hey, Harken, one last thing? 
HARKEN (BARKING) What?! 
KURT Your wife gives great head. 
Harken struggles wildly but he's helpless. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
135 EXT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. - MORNING 135 
SUPERIMPOSE: ONE WEEK LATER 
(CONTINUED) 135 CONTINUED: 135 
The sun is shining. Birds are chirping. It's a bright, new day as Kurt heads into the building. 
136 INT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. - DAY 136 
Kurt enters and looks over at what was Pellit's office. He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now running the company. He heads over. 
137 INT. MARGIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 137 
Kurt knocks on the doorframe and enters. 
MARGIE Oh, hey, Kurt. Come in. 
KURT Thanks, Margie. I just wanted to congratulate you on taking over Bobby's job. 
MARGIE Thank you. Terrible what happened to him. 
KURT Yeah. Tough month for the Pellit family. Anyway, if there's anything I can do to help out before the baby gets here, please let me know. 
MARGIE (CONFUSED) What baby? 
KURT Your baby. 
MARGIE (beat, offended) I'm not pregnant. 
KURT (CHUCKLING) Yeah, right. Look at that big belly. 
Kurt pats her belly. Margie now looks genuinely pissed off.

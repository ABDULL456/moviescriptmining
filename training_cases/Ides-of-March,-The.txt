INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight on him. The rest of the stage is dark. Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter of factly. STEPHEN I am neither Christian...nor atheist. I am not Jewish or Muslim. What I believe...my religion is called the constitution... A pause. Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops. 
We hear the director speak over the loud speaker. 
DIRECTOR Hang on...let me open these up.... We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS ROUTINE. DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Okay... 
Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage. Stephen continues. 
STEPHEN I will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in... 
The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He keeps going. STEPHEN (CONT'D) If I'm not religious enough for you, don't vote for me. To the Director. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) You got it? 
His podium light comes back on. No answer from the Director, Stephen continues. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) If I'm not experienced enough don't vote for me. If I'm not... 
DIRECTOR Okay got it, thanks. 
STEPHEN Thanks. We'll need these monitors turned up a bit...it's a big space and he wants to be able to hear. STAGE MANAGER You got it. 
STEPHEN Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions. You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes. 
STAGE MANAGER No I know, we just got those specs last night and they're building a piece to go under... 
STEPHEN Great, thanks. See you guys in a few hours. 
We see we're in an auditorium of a college. Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer. 
BEN I didn't know the Governor had trouble reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear... STEPHEN He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8" he'll look like a hobbit behind that podium. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
They walk off... 
CUT TO: 
SENATOR PULLMAN (READING) "I have no idea what happens when we die, maybe nothing...maybe it was like before we were born." You did write this Governor... 
GOV. MORRIS Then let me try and clarify...I was raised Catholic, I am not a practicing Catholic...I have no idea what happens when you die and if the Senator does, then perhaps he should be President. I'll even vote for him. 
The audience laughs. 
SENATOR PULLMAN Is that your idea of being specific? 
MOLLY passes out coffee. 
CUT TO: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS We're now live inside the debate. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GOV. MORRIS Let me be more specific. I am neither a Christian, nor an atheist, I'm not Jewish or Muslim...what I believe...my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the Constitution. Meaning I will defend, till my dying breath, your right to worship, in whatever God or lack thereof you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others. I believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who can't take care of themselves. That's my religion. If you feel that I'm not religious enough, then don't vote for me. If you feel I'm not experienced enough or tall enough then don't vote for me. Because I'm not going to change those to get elected. 
SENATOR PULLMAN I just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the Bible. 
GOV. MORRIS Is this a Democratic primary or a general election? 
People laugh. 
SENATOR PULLMAN (ON MONITOR) Well Governor, whoever wins this contest will be running for President...and if you don't think that these questions won't be central in a general election then you are living in fantasy land. I applaud your honesty Governor, I do...I'm simply pointing to what is obvious...we are running for President of the United States...not for student council president. 
INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS PAUL ZARA - Morris's campaign manager - is waiting in the wings off stage. STEPHEN sidles up next to him. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
In the background we can see the candidates shaking hands. There is applause. 
PAUL is pushing fifty with the grizzled look of a hardened campaign veteran. He's Stephen's boss, the only guy between him and Governor Morris. 
Arms crossed, they watch their man on stage. PAUL A double? 
STEPHEN A double. PAUL Fucking national security. The GOVERNOR looks off stage to PAUL and STEPHEN for approval. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Outta the park. 
STEPHEN Home run. We hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the debate. TOM DUFFY - campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign - is also watching from the wings. Duffy's smooth, calculated and icy. He walks over to Stephen and Paul. 
DUFFY I'm trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist before... 
PAUL Well, we know they've nominated jackasses before. 
DUFFY (TO STEPHEN) Must've been you that did the prep work. Paul's not that clever. 
PAUL You always had the brains Duffy, but me - I always had the balls. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
STAFFER 1 We're still checking...it was a blog so who the fuck knows... 
STEPHEN Doesn't matter I want to hear him denying it. If it's true, find out, if it's not, let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia...win win. 
STAFFER 1 Okay. STEPHEN We need to counter this Christian shit we're taking from last night...so get going...Where's our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots? We'll show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting. 
EDITOR Got it. The Editor and staffer exit. 
Stephen turns to his computer and types as Molly walks in and hands him some papers. 
MOLLY Ben wanted me to get you to sign off on this before the staff meeting. 
STEPHEN Oh, right. Thanks. I've been waiting for this. MOLLY Anything interesting? 
STEPHEN Just some white paper I gotta pass out tonight. 
MOLLY White paper? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
STEPHEN Negative shit. Our oppo guys do research - we feed it to the press, hope they bite. MOLLY So like what sort of negative stuff? STEPHEN Read tomorrow's paper and you'll see. 
MOLLY Which paper? STEPHEN All of them. MOLLY So it's something big? 
STEPHEN I wish it were something bigger actually. Just some transportation numbers. I'll have to spin this shit pretty heavy if we want it to stick. 
MOLLY Well that's what you're good at, right? 
STEPHEN I guess. MOLLY (Holding up her phone) Did you get your phone? STEPHEN (Holds his up) Just now. 
MOLLY (MOCK SERIOUS) It's exciting isn't it? 
He looks at her. STEPHEN You a Bearcat...? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
MOLLY A what? 
STEPHEN A Cincinnati Bearcat? MOLLY Oh no...I'm not from here...I worked with you in Iowa actually. 
STEPHEN Oh that's right...but you changed something. (Searching for a way out.) MOLLY My hair? STEPHEN You changed your hair. 
MOLLY (ENJOYING THIS) No.. 
STEPHEN I must look like a total dumb ass right now. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN Paul knows...Paul agrees... 
GOV. MORRIS Ben, where's my op ed on national service? It's better for me to work off of that. 
BEN Got it right here. (He opens his laptop.) 
GOV. MORRIS Get me a hard copy...I hate these fucking things... STEPHEN Print it out. BEN I'll get it printed. Molly, I'm printing out this op ed...can you grab it off the printer? 
MOLLY Be right back. 
STEPHEN Governor...if you want to change...or lets call it refresh... 
GOV. MORRIS Just give me a second... STEPHEN National service isn't polling like the rest of your domestic policy. 
GOV. MORRIS I don't give a shit about polling...I'm not going to play this game with you Stephen...and if this is your good cop bad cop act with Paul... STEPHEN Good cop, good cop. GOV. MORRIS I'm not changing it. 
MOLLY returns and hands the Governor a copy. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) Hang on. 
He reads down until he finds what he's looking for. GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) Yeah I said it all here, "It's going to help people get an education...it's going to create national unity...it's going to teach young people a trade...and it's going to help get people out of debt from college loans. Tell me where that fails. STEPHEN All of that is exactly right...Governor if you're going to do it...then do it. Don't make it voluntary...mandatory. 
GOV. MORRIS That'll poll well. 
STEPHEN Mandatory!...everyone who graduates high school or turns eighteen, gives two years to his or her country. Military...peace corps...plant fucking trees, I don't care...and for that...their college education is paid for...period. 
GOV. MORRIS We do all of that now, with this... 
STEPHEN No sir you don't...do it all...all the way. Mandatory. GOV. MORRIS Paul likes this?...you guys are my brain trust. 
STEPHEN And here's the beauty of it...everyone who is older than eighteen and past the age of eligibility, would be for it...create national pride...give all the kids an education. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
GOV. MORRIS And all the others? 
STEPHEN Can't vote. Too young. This sits with them. Some start to smile. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) You can't lose. 
MOLLY enters. 
MOLLY Stephen you have a call on three, your dad. 
DUFFY You're working for the wrong man. 
STEPHEN You're working for the wrong man. 
DUFFY Oh on the contrary you are working for the wrong man. You've got something the other guys don't have. 
STEPHEN Yeah? 
DUFFY Yeah, what is it exactly? Charm isn't the right word. It's more than that. You exude something. You draw people in. All the reporters love you. Even the ones that hate you love you. You play them all like they're pieces on a chess board. And you make it look effortless. We both know how much work it takes, constantly being on guard, weighing every word so carefully, every move. But from the outside, you make it look easy. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: DUFFY (CONT'D) People are scared of you because they don't understand how you do it, and they love you for it. There's nothing more valuable in this business - the ability to win people's respect by making them mistake their fear for love. You can guess what I'm gonna say next. STEPHEN No...I don't think I can. 
DUFFY I want you to work for us. STEPHEN You gotta be kidding me. DUFFY Not in the least. 
Beat. You are going to lose Ohio. 
STEPHEN I am not. DUFFY You're sitting on about a six percent lead in both polls...six percent of the Democrats polled. 
STEPHEN Eight. DUFFY Six...but that doesn't matter...Independents and Republicans can vote for the Democratic candidate. STEPHEN You think they like your guy?...pro choice...tax and spend liberal? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
DUFFY Fuck no they hate him...they think they can beat my guy...but they're worried about yours...so starting tomorrow morning you're gonna see a fucking blitz...Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all the right wing blogs are gonna start a "Get out the vote campaign"...it's already started...every fucking conservative in Ohio is gonna stand in line and punch my guys ticket...that's just one of the steps...Ohio is gone...the polls don't mean shit...tomorrow morning everyone will know...that's why I want you to handle the fallout we'll take in the press... They look at each other. 
DUFFY (CONT'D) And by the way...we've got Thompson in the bag. 
STEPHEN I know for a fact that Thompson is going with us. 
DUFFY We promised him Secretary of State, Ohio is over...it's been over for weeks...and with Thompson's delegates...I'm thinking down the road now...that's why I want you...I'll bring you in straight at the top. 
STEPHEN I can't do it. DUFFY I'm not asking for an answer right this moment. 
STEPHEN I've played dirty but I don't have to play dirty anymore...you know why? Cause I got Morris! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
DUFFY None of this is about the democratic process Steve, It's about getting your guy into office. Simple as that. STEPHEN This is the sort of shit the Republicans pull. 
DUFFY You're right, this is exactly what the Republicans do, and it's about time we learned from them. They're meaner, tougher and more disciplined than we are. I've been in this business for twenty five years and I've seen way too many Democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down in the mud with the fucking elephants. 
STEPHEN Paul's a friend. 
DUFFY Do you want to work for a friend or do you want to work for the President? Think about it...you have my number. Duffy gets up and leaves. 
CUT TO: EXT HEAD FIRST SPORTS BAR / PAUL'S RENTAL CAR / RESIDENTIAL STREET 
STEPHEN walks to his car. He dials PAUL on his phone. Paul is in North Carolina driving. We intercut. 
CHARLIE ROSE and GOV. MORRIS mid-interview... 
GOV. MORRIS Is it a difficult decision? I would have to believe that it is... would I do it? No... but I can't see myself... or anyone... certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do with her body. 
CHARLIE ROSE So you would appoint a judge to... GOV. MORRIS ... I would consider it arrogant to judge someone until I've walked in their shoes. CHARLIE ROSE But you're against the death penalty? GOV. MORRIS Yes. Because of what it says about us as a society. 
CHARLIE ROSE Suppose Governor it was your wife... 
GOV. MORRIS And she was murdered, what would I do. CHARLIE ROSE It gets more complicated when it's personal. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GOV. MORRIS Sure...well if I could get to him I'd find a way to kill him. 
CHARLIE ROSE So you, you Governor would impose the death penalty. 
GOV. MORRIS No, I would commit a crime for which I would happily go to jail. 
CHARLIE ROSE Then why not let society do that? GOV. MORRIS Because society has to be better than the individual. If I were to do that I would be wrong. 
CHARLIE ROSE And what about guns? 
GOV. MORRIS Isn't it time for a commercial. They laugh. 
CHARLIE ROSE This is public TV, we don't have commercials... 
GOV. MORRIS That's unfortunate.

STEPHEN I had to go to New York. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MOLLY I know...you guys needed a lot more help over there. 
STEPHEN Yeah. So why politics? 
MOLLY Because the pay is so good. 
STEPHEN It just seems like an odd fit. 
MOLLY My dad is Jack Stearns. Beat. STEPHEN He's a good guy. 
INT. MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEPHENS'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING STEPHEN is on his cell phone, he paces back and forth in front of the TV - A news show in on. 
MOLLY is in bed - sheets pulled up around her, she's just waking up. 
CHRIS MATTHEWS (ON TV) In fairness, this has been tried before...Operation Chaos, as Rush Limbaugh called it, where Republicans voted for a Democrat they thought they could beat in the general election. We asked Senator Pullman's campaign manager if this sudden right wing support is welcome... 
Cut to a pre-tape with DUFFY. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DUFFY (O.S.) Is it decisive?...Of Course not...look, we believe that the polls are within the margin of error and that the Senator will win Ohio...with Ohio Democrats...I can't really see Republicans showing up to vote for our candidate...having said that, we'll take all the support we can get. 
STEPHEN (On the phone) What time does Paul land?... Christ...who do we talk to about polling?...no...I just...I just need to get some internal polling on the fucking Independents and the right-wing nuts. 
MOLLY Do you want me to go? 
He gestures for her to wait. 
STEPHEN Listen, put me on the line with...what's the guy's name at the Wall Street Journal?... yeah... MOLLY You seem busy...I should go. 
He whispers to her. STEPHEN Wait. 
Back to phone. STEPHEN (CONT'D) Right...Adler...get me on the line with him. 
MOLLY Steve? She starts to get dressed. STEPHEN Molly listen, just give me a second...I want to talk to you about something. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
MOLLY We can talk about it later if... 
Stephen holds his finger up. STEPHEN (INTO PHONE) What? No nobody...just the cleaning lady...listen Ben...keep trying till you get him. We're gonna go with the position that we've always said, the race is closer than the polling...right...no don't...don't say that...just get him on the line and call me...I'll handle it...yup. He hangs up. STEPHEN (CONT'D) Sorry about that. 
MOLLY The cleaning lady. 
STEPHEN What? MOLLY You called me the cleaning lady. STEPHEN You're not mad about that are you? 
MOLLY No why would I be mad? Beat. 
MOLLY looks at the TV. MOLLY (CONT'D) Look. 
STEPHEN'S eyes go to the TV where CHRIS is still talking. 
CHRIS MATHEWS Earlier I spoke with Jack Stearns, head of the DNC, and he had this to say... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
JACK STEARNS I know you're looking for a reaction, but listen we have two great candidates in a very tight race...and at the end of the day the voters will decide who best can represent this party in the fall. 
STEPHEN Paul I'm sorry. Believe me...I just didn't think it was true. 
PAUL It doesn't fucking matter what you thought. It matters what you did. It matters what you didn't do. If all this shit is true I made a fucking ass of myself at Thompson's place. And I gave away our game plan. 
STEPHEN Please believe me that I honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have Thompson in the bag and I didn't see the point. But it doesn't make it right and I'm sorry. 
PAUL Let me think...let me think... 
CUT TO: 
INT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - STAGE - CONTINUOUS GOV. MORRIS If I'm your president, the first thing I put in motion, ten years from the day I'm in office...no new car in America runs on an internal combustion engine.

PAUL He'll be late...we're gonna tell him that if he doesn't offer Thompson a cabinet position...he's not gonna get the nomination. 
STEPHEN Will he go for it? PAUL I don't fucking know Stephen. 
As Paul exits he shoots back. PAUL (CONT'D) Find us a room...

GOV. MORRIS How real are the numbers? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
STEPHEN We might pick up a couple of points...but we're...I don't know, we lose by three or four percent. PAUL Who the fuck knows Governor...but we can't take the chance... GOV. MORRIS What do you think? 
PAUL I think we fold up the campaign in Ohio...take a loss and blame it on the Republican's playing games...head to North Carolina. GOV. MORRIS I can't run from Ohio...they'll kill us.

GOV. MORRIS Fucking Congressmen. Could you imagine doing this every two years? 
CINDY No I can't. Lets just do this one more time. GOV. MORRIS In four more years. CINDY That's it. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED:

We see MOLLY watching through the door... as STEPHEN finishes, he opens the door. 
STEPHEN I've given you everything -every fucking scoop, your profile with Pau1.... IDA You're right -you've given me a lot. But let's get real here Steve. The only reason you ever treated me well was that I work for the Times. Not because I was your friend. You give me what I want, I write you better stories. Don't pretend it's any more than that. Why'd you meet with Duffy? STEPHEN Go fuck yourself. 
STEPHEN starts walking away. IDA Okay, I'll make it easier on you. Forget Duffy. What happened at Paul and Thompson's meeting? STEPHEN (STOPPING) Will you keep your voice down. Do you have any idea what a story like this could do to me? 
IDA Of course I do. That's why I'm giving you a choice here. STEPHEN I could get fired. IDA So it's not a difficult choice, is it? I've got to file by three p.m. (MORE)

DUFFY You think I leaked it to her? STEPHEN Who else? DUFFY I didn't leak it to her.

MOLLY Then why? 
STEPHEN You fucked up, Molly...

STEPHEN Molly you've go to wake the fuck up... this is the big leagues... it's mean...and when you make mistakes you lose your right to play. Make the appointment and tell me when and where we have to go. He exits.

STEPHEN sits at the desk in front of his laptop. BEN sits on the floor surrounded by papers and a laptop. As BEN is talking Stephen is staring blankly at the screen. 
BEN Listen to this. I got the placement in the Times...this is a match up of hope versus fear. Nine times out of ten the fear candidate tends to be the most experienced...but in our presidential races the least experienced candidate almost always wins. JFK versus Nixon...Carter versus Ford...Bush versus Gore...I like our chances with the new kid on the block, end quote. Thomas Fucking Duffy...he's gotta be having a stroke right now. 
STEPHEN'S phone buzzes, he picks it up and reads the text. It reads: NOON TOMORROW, MOLLY.

EXT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT MOLLY gets out of a cab and walks into the hotel. Under this we hear: 
BEN Hey, where were you today? 
MOLLY I'm not feeling great Ben... INT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT 
We're in front of MOLLY'S door as the scene continues. BEN You picked a hell of day to call in sick...Jesus...fucking wild day... 
MOLLY Why? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) STEPHEN (CONT'D) I can lay out his whole strategy for you. 
DUFFY I already know his strategy. Paul gave it all to Thompson. 
STEPHEN What if I had something else? 
DUFFY You'd do that to Morris? To Paul? 
STEPHEN Yeah. DUFFY Revenge makes people unpredictable Steve. I can't have someone who's unpredictable. Who's unstable. 
STEPHEN (CALMLY) I'm not unstable. 
DUFFY If it had been a clean break -if you'd left Morris before this story broke, that'd be one thing. That we could control. But the way it'd look now -Paul fires you and then you come work for us. Looks like we're picking up the scraps. Puts Morris in the drivers seat. I can't have that. We see a shot close on STEPHEN'S clinched fist holding the yellow copies from Molly's clinic visit down by his side. We pan up to his face. STEPHEN What if I had something big? 
DUFFY Like what? STEPHEN Something big. Something that'll bring Morris down. DUFFY What is it? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
STEPHEN (Shaking his head) Give me the job. 
DUFFY It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry. Go take a nice long vacation. 
Beat. 
DUFFY (CONT'D) You're a smart guy Steve. Everything I said yesterday is true. But maybe politics isn't for you. STEPHEN Politics is my life. DUFFY Do yourself a favor. Get out now while you still can. Go into entertainment, or business, or open a fucking restaurant in Costa Rica - anything. Do what will make you happy. You stay in this business long enough it makes you jaded and cynical. 
STEPHEN Like you? 
DUFFY Yeah. Just like me. STEPHEN You knew I was gonna tell Paul. 
DUFFY I didn't know. I thought you might, but I didn't know. 
STEPHEN You knew if I told him he'd fire me. DUFFY Thing you gotta know about Paul- he's big on loyalty. STEPHEN Yeah I got a nice speech on that. You were never gonna hire me. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
DUFFY Put yourself in my shoes Steve. Your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team. What do you try to do? You either try to hire him yourself, or work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either. This was a win-win situation for me. You work for us -great. Paul doesn't have you. Then again, if Paul fires you and I don't take you -fine - Paul still doesn't have you. Either way I win. The moment I got you to sit down in that chair, I knew I'd won. 
STEPHEN This is my life you're talking about. 
DUFFY It's not easy for me to do this sort of thing Steve. Don't think I take any pleasure in it. I'm sorry for you. I really am. Take care of yourself. 
CUT TO: 64 
STEPHEN pulls into the parking lot. 
INT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT STEPHEN climbs the back stairwell to avoid seeing any of his former co-workers. He gets to the fifth floor and walks down the hall towards Molly's room. As he turns the corner he sees a maid's cart in front of her room. The door is halfway open. 
The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN and the other staffers, sit in front of a monitor watching a news piece. We now cut to CNN footage in front of a hospital as we hear the report continue. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN KING (V.O.) The coroner has stated, that based on the evidence found by the police in the hotel room, that this was an accidental overdose, a lethal cocktail of alcohol and prescription drugs. The Cincinnati police chief, Darryl Mathews, has called for a full investigation pending a toxicology report which could take up to two weeks. Just a terrible terrible situation for the former Senator, now DNC Chairman, Jack Stearns and his family. Off the Governor's face we: 
CUT TO: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - KENTUCKY - DAY 
STEPHEN and SENATOR THOMPSON are seated on a bench. 
SENATOR THOMPSON I want on the ticket...you need me on the ticket...and you need my delegates...you could use em before Tuesday. Make a fine story on the Sunday morning news cycle...so I expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow...or I endorse Pullman and take my cabinet seat. 
They look at each other. SENATOR THOMPSON (CONT'D) Anything else you want to talk about? 
CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - CINCINNATI - NEXT MORNING 
We're at a press conference - The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN, and the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone. The Governor is making a statement GOV. MORRIS The entire staff is in a state of shock. We have sent our condolences to Jack and JoAnna Stearns and their whole family... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) and of course our hearts go out to them... it's hard to imagine what they're going through... All we know at this point is it appears to be a drug...an accidental prescription overdose. Ida? 
IDA Is suicide ruled out? 
GOV. MORRIS We have no reason to believe... 
He looks to Paul. GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) I don't think we have any of that information yet. Obviously there will be a full investigation. Just wanted to say that our hearts go out...our prayers go out to the entire family...and she was part of our family. 
REPORTER 5 Did you know her well Governor? 
GOV. MORRIS Not well. But I did know her, and what I saw was a hard working, young woman, with a great and positive spirit. It's a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to Jack. REPORTER 6 How long has she interned with you Governor? The Governor looks back at Paul. Paul steps up to the mic. 
PAUL She'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks...maybe four I think, I can check. IDA Will you continue with your schedule today? You're set to tour Proctor & Gamble this afternoon. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
PAUL We will most certainly stay on schedule. This accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy. The work, the schedule won't be altered. It just means that those of us that knew Molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart. 
As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating. The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen. 
STEPHEN holds a cell phone to his ear. They stare at each other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops vibrating. 
Stephen turns and leaves. CUT TO: 
EXT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - THAT NIGHT STEPHEN approaches the restaurant - the lights are off. He peers through a window - we hear the door unlock. One of the Governor's SECRET SERVICE MEN opens the door. He motions Stephen in. INT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - CONTINUOUS 
Stephen follows the secret service guy through the dark restaurant - they pass several other secret service guys sitting in booths. They cross towards the back to the kitchen door - STEPHEN enters. 
INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
GOV. MORRIS No. You were already fired, you were out. What were you doing in her room? 
STEPHEN I was fixing a situation...I got a call, someone from the hotel thought I could help and called me. GOV. MORRIS You were off the campaign, but you thought it was important to come back and fix things? It was your voice on the phone the other night. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) You were fucking her. What did you do Stephen? 
STEPHEN I loaned her some money and gave her a ride. 
GOV. MORRIS I bet you did. 
Pause. 
AND THEN: 
GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) There's no note. 
STEPHEN Okay, there's no note. 
GOV. MORRIS Show it to me. 
STEPHEN You think I brought it here? That's how people get hurt. GOV. MORRIS Okay let's play this out. You're not wearing a wire because everything you've suggested is illegal...and you wouldn't fare well in federal prison. You were fucking her and she told you about her situation. There are no records or conversations between us. And since she's had an abortion, no DNA evidence. So if there's no note, then it's your word against mine. Your word. A fired, disgruntled, employee, or a sitting governor...There's no note. 
STEPHEN It's your call Governor. As the Governor weighs his options we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BARBER SHOP - EARLY MORNING 
PAUL is sitting in a barber shop getting his hair cut... the BARBER cuts... Paul sits there. The TV is on... a sports show... no one talks. We watch Paul's face as the barber clips the back of his head. 
CUT TO: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BARBER SHOP 
PAUL walks out, starts down the street. As he passes the first corner, he sees the Governor's SUV and the Secret Service SUV both parked on the side of the road. Paul looks at the SUV... then walks up to the window. The window rolls down and the GOVERNOR leans his head out. 
GOV. MORRIS Paul you got a minute? 
We stay outside the car for along time. We hear CHRIS MATHEWS under this shot. We see Paul get out of the SUV and the two SUVs drive off, leaving him standing there. 
EXT. NICER HOTEL - CINCINNATI - NEXT DAY - ESTABLISHING INT. NICER HOTEL ROOM- CINCINNATI - NEXT DAY 
STEPHEN'S in a different hotel now. The TV is on. 
CHRIS MATHEWS How much could a big shake up days before the Ohio primary hurt a campaign. I asked Paul Zara how his firing could actually help the candidate. 
We See STEPHEN, shaving in the bathroom mirror, as he listens to the TV. 
PAUL The Governor and I both felt, that in light of some of these changing numbers, it was best to put a new face on the campaign...Stephen is very talented...very smart... CUT TO: 
Thompson turns and shakes the hand of Governor Morris. Morris steps up to the microphone. CUT TO: EXT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY - CINCINNATI 
Under the following we hear the Governor's speech. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
We see Satellite trucks, press vehicles, police cars, etc. 
At a catering truck we see a pair of hands grab some coffee and cookies. This is another young intern, JILL. We follow her across the street and into a door. 
INT. XAVIER HALLWAYS & RECEPTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS JILL comes through the door. 
We follow her through the hallways crowded with television cables and technicians. She makes her way in to a large reception room, where Stephen is watching Governor Morris give his speech. She hands him a coffee. We cut between The Governor and Stephen watching from the back. GOV. MORRIS Thank you Senator Thompson! Well the polls aren't quite closed, but I want to congratulate Senator Pullman...And his Republican constituents on their win here in Ohio. The room explodes in laughter and applause. 
GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) Senator Thompson I am honored to stand here today with you. I am humbled by your kind words, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals. Either we're going to move forward or were going to live in the past... Either we're going to lead the world in technology, or we are going to bury our heads in the sand... the sands of Saudi Arabia...the sands of Iraq! Either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country! We are not a nation used to coming in second or third... 
Cheers. 
CUT TO: 
INT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY & STAGING ROOM 
While the Governor's speech continues we stay close on Stephen as he walks through the crowd. We follow him into Governor Morris's staging area. Four monitors on a table show different network feeds. We watch Stephen roll down his sleeves and button his shirt. He ties his tie and puts his jacket on. From the monitors we hear reporters etc. 
We push in on one of the monitors where DUFFY is being interviewed. As we push in we see STEPHEN cross out of the room. BEN is watching, he looks back and smiles at STEPHEN. DUFFY No it's not decisive, we still have several contests and those states are going to want to have their say. It does look like we'll win Ohio... 
RACHEL MADDOW But you must concede that these three hundred and fifty-six delegates put the pledged delegates out of reach. And with word today that the super delegates are breaking three to one for Morris. DUFFY We still have a lot of contests Rachel, Ohio is- 
RACHEL MADDOW Well then do you have the funds? As we read it- 
DUFFY (SMILING) Of course we have the funds. We're getting new donations daily... 
Our new intern, JILL crosses into frame looking down at BEN. 
JILL Hey...Ben...I was told to talk to you. I'm supposed to get a phone... BEN Right...you're....

JILL Jill Morris...no relation. 
BEN Are you a Bearcat? JILL No...I'm from Columbus I'm a Buckeye.

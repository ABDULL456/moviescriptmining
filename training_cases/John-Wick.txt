FADE IN: 
EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY 
SUPER: ARDMORE, PENNSYLVANIA 
A verdant landscape of rolling hills, lush countryside, and ambient peace. 
EXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY 
A small, quaint, two-bedroom farmhouse: a classic. Nearby, a small barn -its paint chipped, wood worn- sits nestled within the setting. The homestead feels slightly abandoned, the facade -especially the roof- in dire need of an overhaul. 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The hour hand of an old, electric clock shifts slightly, marking six a.m. A soft alarm sounds. Beneath the blankets, a body shifts, a weathered hand reaching out to silence the antique. 
A beat... a sigh... a groan... and JOHN WICK -early sixties, salt-and-pepper hair, three-day beard, former boxer, former military, tired, beaten down, and at wit's end- sits up, staring unblinkingly out at the day. 
A beat... and he stands, donning a weathered robe and a pair of slippers. John stuffs his hands into his pockets... 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
...and shuffles down the corridor, the walls overflowing with family pictures, each badly in need of dusting. They catalogue a long and healthy life with his wife, Norma; the pictures presenting a time line of sorts. No children, yet sheer, unadulterated happiness. 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As John makes his way through his home, we can see that it is cluttered and unorganized. Dirty, in fact, as if it hasn't been cleaned in months. 
EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS 
John opens the door, retrieves the newspaper, closes, and locks the door behind him, without giving the outside so much as a glance. 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
John unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table, opens a cupboard, and measures out a couple of tablespoons of Folgers Coffee into an old percolator. 
As it begins to bubble, John open the fridge, studies its contents for a moment or two, and then closes it, abandoning the thought of breakfast. 
He pours himself a cup of coffee and sits at the table. The newspaper is ignored. He drinks in silence for a long, dark, brooding moment, the loneliness almost unsettling. 
Suddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS. 
John lowers his cup, staring at the device, his eyes tired. A beat... and he stands, walking slowly to answer it. 
JOHN This is John. 
As he listens to the voice on the other end, John remains still... stoic. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Ok. 
John hangs up the phone and returns to the table, sinking slowly down into his chair. 
A long beat... 
...and John begins to weep, his hands trembling as he lowers his face in excruciating, utter, and complete sorrow. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. THE BARN - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
Having shaved and showered, wearing an old -but well-fitted- gray suit, John pushes open the garage door... 
...to reveal a legend in dire need of a total overhaul: a black, 1969 FORD MUSTANG `BOSS 429'. 
A smile plays at his lips as John walks into the garage, running a hand along the chassis, desperately in need of a wash and wax. Behind him, the wall is lined with tools: a mechanic's dream enclave. 
JOHN ENTERS- 
INT. JOHN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
-and closes the door behind him. 
John takes a moment to breath it in: he loves this car... although he hasn't taken very good care of it as of late. A beat... and he slips the key into the ignition, twisting it, the motor coughing to life, the exhaust pipe belching black smoke. 
EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS 
The vehicle pulls out of the garage, stalls briefly, come back to life, puttering on down the road. 
EXT. THE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
DELIVERY WOMAN Sign here, please. 
In a daze, John signs the clipboard and hands it back to her. 
DELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D) And the pen? 
JOHN Oh.   Sorry. 
John hands her the pen. 
DELIVERY WOMAN Here you go! 
The Delivery Woman hands him a card and a PLASTIC CASE by the handle which he takes without looking. 
DELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D) Have a good day. 
John nods, and -as she takes off- heads back inside. 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
John closing the door behind him... 
...and is startled by a small BARK. 
A beat... and he looks down to find that he is actually holding a small PET CARRIER. He lifts it to look inside: the face of a young, tri-colored (black, white, and brown), CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, her tail wagging fiercely. 
She barks again, and John lowers it, confused. 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - DAY 
Holding the envelope in his hands, John sits across from the carrier which he has set upon the table. Inside, the Chorgi lies with paws crossed, studying him, tilting her head from side to side. 
A beat... and John opens the letter. The card inside is simple; white with a single DAISY drawn upon it. John smiles, instantly knowing who it is from, running a thumb along the face of the flower. He hesitates, but opens the card. 
NORMA (V.O.) Dear, John. If you have received this, then I have not survived the surgery. (a beat, then) I am so, so sorry. 
Tears begin to well in John's eyes. 
NORMA (V.O.) But you've still got a life ahead of you, and I intend for you to live it. You may think you've hidden things from me, but you haven't. I know you. And should this reach you in time -which I pray it has- I beg you, I implore you, to stop. To think. To live. (a beat, then) I love you, John. With all my heart. Our years were good. The best, in fact. But I'd rather see you later... than sooner... your best friend... Norma. 
John lowers the letter, wipes the tears from his cheeks, and stares at the puppy... chuckling. 
JOHN Well played, Norma. 
John reaches across, and flicks open the pet carrier. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (MUTTERS) Well played. 
The Chorgi scrambles out of the cage and studies him; sniffing, licking, and barking. 
JOHN (CONT'D) So... you gotta' name? 
John checks the collar to find a DAISY-SHAPED medallion which READS- 
JOHN (CONT'D) Moose. (a beat, then) Seriously? 
As if in reply, Moose barks. 
JOHN (CONT'D) All right, then... (SMILES) ...Moose, it is. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY 
SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER 
The homestead has been completely overhauled with a new roof on the house, the barn having been painted, the yard attended to... a picturesque scene worthy of a postcard. 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The alarm sounds, followed by silence when a heavy hand drops down upon the snooze button. 
THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 
Silence. 
THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 
Silence. 
THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 
A beat... and John sighs, pulls back the covers, and kicks out his legs, sitting on the edge of the bed, rubbing his eyes. 
THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
-and freezes at the sight of two MASKED MEN... 
...a half-second before a THIRD MAN steps into frame and drives the butt of his shotgun against the side of John's head. He drops to the floor, hard. 
JOHN'S POV: 
Across the room, the silhouette of Moose's body faces him, her breathing labored. 
VOICE #1 (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) You find the keys? 
One of the masked men, LIMPS by, dragging his foot slightly, an old injury or birth defect. 
VOICE #2 (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) Yeah. He kept `em in a bowl like my old man. 
Voice #1 chuckles enjoying this as he sucks on a fresh mint. 
VOICE #1 (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) Then shit... let the fuckin' babushka fade away and let's get the fuck outta' here. 
One of the men kneels down next to John, pulling back his mask to reveal his mouth which grins upon him with white lacquered teeth: it is IOSEF. 
IOSEF I'm glad you didn't wanna' sell, old man. (CHUCKLES) I enjoyed this. 
Iosef cold cocks John as we- 
SMASHCUT TO: 
DARKNESS. 
Silence. 
...a long beat, then... 
...thump... 
...long beat, then... 
...thump... 
...a long beat, then... 
FADE TO: 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A small tail rises slowly, and lands with a soft "thump". 
John stirs with a groan, and opens his eyes... 
...to find Moose's nose touching his cheek. 
He suddenly sits up, remembering. 
JOHN ...Moose... 
Moose takes a shallow breath... 
...thump... 
John begins to unravel, hands trembling. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Moose... 
He touches Moose's side, and she whimpers. 
John recoils... 
...and sees the trail of blood from where she was first injured... 
...having pulled her broken body over to his side. 
John lies down beside Moose, and softly... tenderly... cradles her head in his hand, rubbing her cheek with his thumb. 
Moose relaxes, licks his thumb, sighs one last time... 
...and grows still. 
John pulls himself up into a sitting position, cradles Moose's still body... 
...and begins to cry... 
...rocking back and forth. 
FADE TO: 
...staring straight ahead... 
...unblinking. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A CITYSCAPE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
EXT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
A 24/7 chop shop, this facility is populated by dozens of hardened criminals, but has become the only family anyone knows. 
This is a tight knit, loyal, and talented crew. 
A number of vehicles are being repaired, dismantled, painted, and the like: a non-stop flurry of activity. 
Walking the floor, AURELIO -late sixties, hard eyes, soft smile, the father figure of this little family- banters with his crew before pausing to help lower a new engine into a car. 
EXT. THE STREET - DAY 
John's Mustang roars down the street, tires clawing at the earth as it rounds a tight corner. 
INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS 
Perched behind the wheel, IOSEF smiles as, in the passenger's seat... 
...VIKTOR -mid-twenties, short, stout, a pronounced LIMP, well-dressed, gawdy jewelry, terrible glasses- and, in the back seat... 
...KIRILL -early thirties, enormous, muscular, meathead- cheers him on. 
EXT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
The Mustang pulls into the lot, and enters- 
INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
-pulling into an empty space. 
A pair of OLDER MECHANICS notice the car, share an emotionless -yet knowing- look, set down their tools, and calmly leave the building. 
Iosef, Viktor, and Kirill pour out of the vehicle, laughing. 
IOSEF (in Russian, subtitled) Shit, dude! (MORE) 
IOSEF (CONT'D) I'ma gonna' keep this muthafucker! (to a mechanic) Hey, where's Aurelio at? 
Iosef sees Aurelio walking towards him, his gaze locked onto the Mustang, recognizing it. 
AURELIO Where'd you get that? 
IOSEF I gots my ways, yo! Now, it's hot as shit, so I wanna paint job, papers, fuckin- 
AURELIO (INTERRUPTING) I said, where... did you get that? 
IOSEF (SHRUGS) Some old fuck. 
AURELIO (a beat, then) I know this car. 
IOSEF What the fuck are you sayin'? 
Aurelio opens the driver's side door, reaches up behind the visor, and pulls out the registration card which reads JOHN WICK. 
AURELIO (in Italian, subtitled) Fuck... me. 
Aurelio quickly replaces the card. 
IOSEF What? 
AURELIO Out.    Now. 
IOSEF What the fuck are you talking about? 
By now, everyone in the facility has stopped working, watching the drama unfold. 
AURELIO I'm talkin' about you takin' this fuckin' car and gettin' the fuck outta' my shop. 
IOSEF Did you lose your shit, Aurelio? We own you. You do what we say. 
AURELIO The fuck you do. Tell me... 
Aurelio motions towards the car. 
AURELIO (CONT'D) ...did you kill him? 
JOHN (MUTTERS) Aren't "they" always... 
A long beat, and Aurelio sighs, relaxing as he pours himself another drink. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A CITYSCAPE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
An old, quiet, and clean building lost amongst dozens of others in a dying industrial park. 
EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
A bus pulls up the curb, pauses for a beat, and then rolls off... 
...leaving behind John who walks across the street, his expression blank. 
His gait is steady, his shoulders relaxed, hands limp at his sides, breath steady. 
The two GUARDS at the door glance up as he approaches, standing as they shift into character. 
GUARD #1 What are you- 
Without slowing, John reaches into the man's jacket, slips free the pistol from the shoulder holster therein and- 
THUMP! THUMP! 
-fires -twice- into the man's heart, before turning- 
THUMP! 
- to fire once into the other guard's face, never slowing, kicking open the door- 
INT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
-to enter the facility, shooting anything that moves. He is the angel of death: each target receives two well-placed bullets to ensure incapacitation. He never slows, never misses, and will not stop. 
The primarily Japanese crew is in a panic with most fleeing - a number of whom are shot in the back- while those choosing to shoot back are cut down in a blink. 
Once emptied, John drops his pistol, kneels, sweeps up a fallen gun up, levels, fires, always moving, and -as he passes by a lift- slaps a button, slowly lowering his Mustang down to the floor behind him. 
John is a force of nature as he clears out the building. 
Unstoppable. 
EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - THE REAR LOT - CONTINUOUS 
A couple of mechanics escape the building, the last of which is shot in the back; dropping to his knees as a bullet slams into the back of his head. 
Running with all of his might, MECHANIC #1 screams into his phone. 
MECHANIC #1 (in Japanese, subtitled) I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK HE IS! HE JUST SHOWED UP AND STARTED SHOOTING! 
Behind him, John appears in the doorway, aims... 
...and decides otherwise, lowering the pistol. 
INT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
John opens the door to the Mustang, tosses the pistol onto the passenger's seat- 
INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS 
-and slips behind the wheel. A slight smile plays upon his lips as he sighs; a part of him having been returned. He turns the key, revs the engine, slams his foot down on the GAS- 
EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
-and crashes through the garage door of the building, tires squealing as the Mustang pulls a one-eighty, righting itself BEFORE- 
EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
-leaping out onto the street, furiously gaining momentum, as a trio of heavily-modified NISSAN SKYLINES appear and take chase. 
INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS 
John glances into the rearview mirror, takes the pistol in his left hand, shifts, and spins the wheel- 
EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
-turning to face the oncoming vehicles. 
INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS 
John shifts again, and crushes the gas pedal underfoot- 
-driving down narrow service alleys with reckless abandon- 
-and going against traffic, steering with an apt hand. 
Eventually, John creates enough mayhem to tie up the police on the ground- 
-leaving the helicopter overhead. 
On a long stretch of road, John reaches the vehicle's top speed, reaches down, flips open a hidden compartment, and presses a button for- 
-his NITROUS OXIDE SYSTEM- 
-which causes the engine to SCREAM, roaring down the road at an incredible speed- 
-distancing himself from the helicopter to eventually hide in an abandoned warehouse. 
He parks... 
...and walks across the street to the local diner... 
...as overhead, the police chopper searches in vain.

FADE TO: 
EXT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS 
The floor is empty, the building quiet. 
INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - THE MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Sitting at his desk, Aurelio -a cigarette dangling from between his lips- works on a model car, carefully gluing pieces together. 
The bottle of Campari rests nearby.     Music plays softly from a radio nearby. 
The phone rings.     Aurelio takes a deep breath, exhales, and answers it. 
AURELIO This is Aurelio. 
VIGGO (O.S.) I hear you've struck my son. 
AURELIO (deep breath, sighs) Yes, sir. I did. 
VIGGO (O.S.) Might I ask why? 
AURELIO Because he stole John Wick's car. 
Silence. 
VIGGO (a long beat, then) Oh. 
AURELIO And Viggo? 
VIGGO Yes? 
AURELIO Your son killed his dog. 
VIGGO (a long beat, then) Good evening, Aurelio. 
Click - the line goes dead. 
Aurelio refills his drink... and chuckles with a shake of his head. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A TOWNHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
SUPER:   MANHATTAN, NEW YORK 
A resplendent home in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. 
A trio of military-grade SEDANS -heavily armored, tinted/bulletproof glass, intimidating- pull up to the curb. The first and third empty as the keen eyes of ten gunmen scour the street, buildings, and rooftops. 
A beat... and one of them slaps a hand on the middle Sedan's roof. 
Preceded -and proceeded- by a gunman, IOSEF emerges; belligerently naive and yet... scared. 
INT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
Lighting himself a cigarette, VIGGO TARASOV -60s, face scarred by a hard life, one eye dead, hair perfectly coifed, expensive suit, a slight limp, relying on a cane- fills a tumbler with ice. 
He selects a fresh bottle of JEWEL OF RUSSIAN CLASSIC VODKA and twisting off the cap, hesitating. Deciding otherwise, Viggo dumps out the ice, pours himself a double shot, and slams it back... 
John retrieves his keys, phone, and wallet from the tray- 
EVAN (CONT'D) Good day, sir. 
-and walks on as Evan turns the x-ray machine back on, slipping the gold coins into his pocket. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. THE RAIL TRACKS - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
A silver-nosed train roars past, its wheels melting snow from the tracks beneath it. 
INT. THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS 
John sits alone, the train half-empty, staring out at the countryside passing him by. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A CITYSCAPE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
The city is a roiling mass of activity. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. THE CONTINENTAL - A HOTEL - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
Small, trendy, and posh:    an upscale, boutique hotel. 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Carrying a bulky briefcase in each hand -with the duffel bag slung across his shoulders- John approaches the front desk where the MANAGER smiles up at him. 
MANAGER Hello, sir. How may I help you today? 
JOHN I called ahead.     Reservation for John Wick. 
The Manager checks his computer. 
MANAGER Ah, yes.   I have you for two nights. 
JOHN Depending on business, it may be more. 
MANAGER That's not a problem, sir. We're only at sixty percent capacity. (MORE) 
MANAGER (CONT'D) Just let me know should you choose to extend your stay. 
JOHN (LOOKING AROUND) Y'know, I haven't been here in years. When did the old girl get a facelift? 
MANAGER About twelve years ago. 
JOHN Same owner? 
MANAGER (NODS) Same owner. 
John slides across a GOLD COIN... 
JOHN Is she still singin'? 
...which the Manager -without so much as a blink- slides into his pocket. 
MANAGER She is. Daily, in fact.   Round about midnight. 
JOHN That's good to hear. 
The Manager hands him a key. 
MANAGER Floor seven, room nine. (MOTIONS) Would you like help with your bags? 
JOHN No, thanks. 
MANAGER Will there be anything else then, sir? 
JOHN (glances at his watch) Can you send me up a hamburger - rare, mustard, onions, pickle- and fries? 
MANAGER (writing it down) Yes, sir. And to drink? 
JOHN A nice Pinot. Mid-range. I'll leave that to your discretion. 
MANAGER Yes, sir. I have one in mind. It'll be up in a half-hour. 
JOHN Thank you. 
FADE TO: 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - DUSK 
John follows the Waitress... 
...to a table with a perfect view of both levels. 
WAITRESS (CONT'D) Will this do? 
JOHN Yes, thank you. 
WAITRESS What would you like to drink? 
JOHN Single Malt. Irish, if you've got it. 
John slides her two more hundred dollar bills. 
JOHN (CONT'D) And start me up a tab. 
WAITRESS Yes, sir. I've got a ten-year Michael Collins. 
JOHN Perfect. Do you have a meat and cheese plate? 
WAITRESS I do.   Anything else? 
JOHN No.   Thank you. 
As the Waitress turns to fill his order, John studies the floor... 
...and the upper balcony... searching. 
EXT. THE RED CIRCLE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
A soft snow begins to fall. 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS 
John nibbles on some cheese and bread as he pours himself a generous helping of whiskey. 
Down below, Viktor -finishing off his drink- LIMPS past. 
John's eyes narrow. 
He finishes his drink, stands, and follows after Viktor, almost breathing down his neck. 
Book-ended by a pair of Estruscan bodyguards who follow every move he makes, Viktor slaps a waitress on the ass as he walks past. 
VIKTOR (in Russian, subtitled) Another bottle of the Goose, love! 
SMASHCUT TO: 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK 
As John stares at Moose's silhouette... 
...VIKTOR limps past. 
VIKTOR (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) Yeah. He kept `em in a bowl like my old man. 
SMASHCUT TO: 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Drunk, Viktor and his bodyguards enter the bathroom, pausing to light a cigarette, before limping into- 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS 
-where he leans against the wall in front of the toilet, eyes at half-mast. 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
John enters as a patron leaves, the bathroom now empty save himself, Viktor, and the bodyguards. 
As the door closes, John produces his CERAMIC STRAIGHT RAZOR, drives it between the door and the jamb, and snaps it in two. 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS 
A patron approaches the door and attempts to enter, but it won't budge. He shrugs and heads off in search of another bathroom. 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
One of the bodyguards turns as John approaches, his eyes instantly wide -uncomprehending- as the broken tip of the blade easily slices open his neck, splashing John with his own hot blood. 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS 
Viktor glances towards the closed door with a smirk. 
VIKTOR Hello? 
JOHN Good evening. 
WAITRESS Good evening, sir. 
John heads down the staircase- 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
-and calmly makes his way through the sea of dancers... 
...as up top, chaos erupts but is silenced by the deafening music. 
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 
Using his one good shoulder, John opens the steel door, and - his skin pale, cold sweat upon his brow- moves as fast as he can downwards. 
His shoulder hurts. 
The blood loss nears critical. 
EXT. THE RED CIRCLE - AN ALLEY - NIGHT 
John exits the building as he scrolls through Viktor's phone, searching. 
He finds Iosef's number, and as he calls it, studies the image of Iosef which appears on screen. 
EXT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
INT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - A BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Iosef lays on his bed with an arm behind his head, smoking as he stares up at the ceiling. 
We hear the vibration of his cell phone. He lifts the phone, smiles at the sight of Viktor's caller I.D., and answers. 
IOSEF (in Russian, subtitled) Hey, Vik. 
JOHN (O.S.) (a long beat, then) Viktor is dead. 
Iosef bolts upright, his breath stuck in his throat, eyes wide. 
INT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
John trudges through the snow with Viktor's phone to his ear. 
JOHN As for the car, I got that back, but as for Moose, well... I'm takin' a page from Exodus on that one: an eye for an eye. (a beat, then) No... no, better yet, Genesis. 
INT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Iosef swallows hard. 
JOHN (O.S.) Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for hurting me. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold. 
INT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
John peers around the corner. 
JOHN Make your peace with God, Iosef... (in Russian, subtitled) ...for the Devil shall see you soon. 
INT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - A BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A long beat... and Iosef hangs up his phone, staring at the wall... a solitary tear rolling down his cheek. 
EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
John tosses the phone down into the snow, and jogs across the street... 
...as MARCUS -a cigarette smoldering between his lips- watches him from the shadows. 
FADE TO: 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
The lobby is empty -save the Manager- who glances up from his computer... 
...to find a wounded -and quite bloody- John walking towards him. 
MANAGER (WITHOUT BLINKING) Good evenin', sir. 
JOHN Evenin'.    Is the doctor in? 
MANAGER Yes, sir.    Twenty-four/seven. 
JOHN Send him up, please. 
EDDIE (a beat, then) I don't know you. 
JOHN Maybe not... but I know this place. 
A beat... and Eddie slides the view piece shut. 
A beat... and the door is unlocked, swinging open. 
John enters, and the door is immediately swung shut behind, sealed and locked tight. 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SPEAK EASY - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The room is small, but comfortable. 
To the right are a number of coat/hat racks populated by a dozen or so items. 
To the left is a bank of modified cigar locker; dozens of transparent, safety-deposit boxes framed in mahogany with a plaque -etched with a name- upon each. 
Eddie hands the coin back to John. 
EDDIE You carryin'? 
JOHN No.   Wait... 
John snaps back his wrist... 
...and hands Eddie the ceramic straight blade. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Sorry. 
EDDIE You gotta' name? 
JOHN John Wick. 
Eddie recognizes this name, his demeanor changing drastically. 
EDDIE Oh. 
Eddie turns, finds a locker with the name JOHN WICK carved upon it, opens the small door, slides in the blade, and closes it. 
JOHN How about you? 
EDDIE What about me? 
JOHN You gotta' name? 
A beat... and Eddie smiles, extending a hand, instantly warm. 
EDDIE They call me Eddie. 
JOHN (SMILES) Pleased to meet you, Eddie. 
EDDIE Same goes for me, Mr. Wick. 
JOHN Please... call me, John. 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SPEAK EASY - NIGHT 
John enters the room through a pair of velvet drapes... 
...and pauses, taking it all in with a smile. 
A luxurious tavern crafted from a long forgotten speak-easy, the room isn't too big, and isn't too small, but... just right. 
Booths line the outside walls while a number of tables are scattered about. 
Near the stage, a small dance floor has been cleared, the wooden tiles worn, but lovingly cared for. 
On stage, JENNY -80s, African-American, petite, a commanding presence- sways behind the microphone, singing an old standard, her voice similar to that of Billie Holiday; strong, tender, and sincere. 
Her eyes grow wide at the sight of John, but she never wavers from her tune. 
As John makes his way through the room, everyone nodes, offers a handshake, or a simple greeting: this is an old family... of a sort. 
In the corner, WINSTON -70s, English, tall, lean, well- dressed, glasses, tailored, precise- sits with a worn, paperback copy of THE TELL-TALE SHREW in one hand and a dry sherry in the other. 
JOHN Hello, Winston. 
Winston lowers the book, and glances across at John with a blank -yet warm- look. 
WINSTON Hello, Jonathan. (a beat, then) It's been awhile. 
JOHN That, it has. (LOOKING AROUND) I'm glad to see the old place still up and runnin'. 
WINSTON (HALF-SMILES) I could say the same for you. 
...and Jenny sings IT HAD TO BE YOU. 
Her rendition is powerful, sweet, endearing, passionate, and sincere. As John watches her sing, a smile tugs at the corner of his lips. 
On the empty dance floor... 
...John watches a younger version of himself with Norma... 
...dancing slowly... twirling... her head on his shoulder... 
...smiling... 
...with a sigh... 
...before disappearing. 
John swallows -hard- as a trembling hand wipes away a tear. 
Jenny smiles at him with a nod. 
He returns the gesture. 
She continues to sing. 
John raises his glass as- 
-SNAP.   SNAP.   SNAP.   SNAP.   SNAP. 
CUT TO: 
A CELLPHONE 
Five pictures of John are inconspicuously taken... 
...by DAVID PERKINS -late twenties, cocky, expensive tastes, lean, cruel- at a table across the way. 
David sends them with a text:     "Is this him?" 
A beat... and he receives a text in return:       "Yes.    Where are you?" 
David texts back:   "The Continental." 
A beat... and he receives a text:        "We may not engage in hostilities upon those premises." 
David texts back:   "I'm willing to take the risk." 
A beat... and he receives a follow up text: "Take him alive. Should you fail, we disavow. Should you succeed, we reward... greatly." 
David smiles... 
CUT TO: 
...as does John. 
Once the song is done, Jenny is met with boisterous applause... 
...with John clapping the hardest among them. 
FADE TO: 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Exhausted -and more than a bit tipsy- John runs a hand along the wall to maintain his balance. 
He sings under his breath... humming the tune to IT HAD TO BE YOU. 
At his door, he fumbles with his key card, but finally manages to open it. 
INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
John closes and locks the door behind him.    He sheds his jacket, his shoes, and his pants... 
...flicks off the lights... 
...and crawls beneath the blankets with a sigh. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
The snowstorm ends, the city suddenly still. 
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Empty. 
JOHN (SIGHS) Do you know anythin' worth knowin'? 
Tears roll down David's cheeks as he wracks his brain, thinking. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Just because I'm good at killin'... doesn't mean I like it all that much. (a beat, then) Give me something. 
DAVID Wait, wait! (swallowing hard, then) Little Russia. There's a small bank near Cannon Court... 
JOHN What about it? 
DAVID Viggo owns it. It's where he keeps his money. Every dollar of business he does clears through that building. 
JOHN (a beat, then) That'll do. 
John swings the shotgun, knocking David out with the butt. 
CLICK. 
John freezes... 
...as HARRY -60s, African-American, former NFL receiver, tall, lean, and imposing, yet currently dressed in boxers, a t-shirt, and dress shoes- aims a pistol at the back of John's head from the open doorway of his hotel room. 
Silence. 
HARRY Do I know you? 
JOHN I'm thinkin' so. 
John turns... 
...and Harry lowers his pistol. 
HARRY Oh.    Hey, John. 
JOHN Hey, Harry. 
Harry glances about at the bodies... 
...and steps back inside his room. 
HARRY Good night, John. 
JOHN (NODS) Night, Harry. (a beat, then) Hey, Harry. 
Harry hesitates, but glances out from behind his door. 
HARRY Yeah, John? 
JOHN You keen on earnin' a coin? 
HARRY (hesitates, then sighs) Times bein' as they are? Yeah, John... I am. 
JOHN Do you mind babysittin' the breathin' one for, I dunno... (checking his watch) ...the next six hours or so? 
HARRY Catch and release? 
John tosses Harry a gold coin. 
JOHN (NODS) Catch and release. 
HARRY Can do. 
We hear the sound of a phone ringing. 
Harry grabs David by the feet as John heads back towards his room. 
JOHN Good night, Harry. 
Harry drags David back towards his room. 
HARRY Good night, John. 
INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
John enters his room, and answers the ringing phone. 
MANAGER Good evening, Mr. Wick. I'm sorry to be calling you at this hour, but we've received a number of noise complaints from your floor. 
JOHN You don't have to worry about that anymore. I'll be going to bed soon. 
MANAGER Have you any need of -say- a dinner reservation, perhaps? 
JOHN Yes, in fact. (COUNTING) For four. 
MANAGER Six o'clock? 
VIGGO (in Russian, subtitled) Wait in the car. 
The two men exit as Viggo walks towards the booth, shedding his jacket as he does so. 
Only one of John's hands is above the table, the other hovering beneath it, a pistol held tight, unwavering. 
Viggo slips into the seat. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) Is that really necessary? 
John answers by taking a sip of his coffee. Viggo shrugs with a frown, motioning towards the waitress as he flips over his mug. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) So be it. 
WAITRESS (filling the mug) Cream or sugar? 
VIGGO No, thank you. 
As she walks away, Viggo takes a long pull off of his drink. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) It's been what? 30 years? 
JOHN Yeah, that's about right. 
VIGGO Left the game, got married, settled down... I envy that. (a beat, then) Kids? 
JOHN No. 
VIGGO Lucky bastard. 
JOHN We tried, but... wasn't in the cards. 
VIGGO I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!- nine months later, I had me a piece a' shit tossed on the old doorstep, but... when it comes down to it... (GLOWERS) He's still my son. 
JOHN (NODS) I figured as much. 
VIGGO Funny how one would both die and kill for something they do not love. 
JOHN Imagine what one would do if they did. 
Viggo nods, takes a sip of his coffee, and stands. 
VIGGO Goodbye, John. 
JOHN Goodbye, Viggo. 
Viggo leaves the diner, and slides into- 
INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS 
-where four of his men wait, each armed with a silenced, submachine gun: intimidating hardware. 
Viggo closes the door, takes a deep breath, and sighs, rubbing his brow. 
VIGGO Kill him. 
BOOM! 
A round slams into his window, barely missing him before hitting the man seated next to him in the side of the head, blood spattering against glass. 
Viggo dives to the floor as his men prepare to return fire- 
EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS 
-but John is a crackshot, firing as he strides towards the VEHICLE- 
INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS 
-killing two men and wounding a fourth who drops down next to Viggo, screaming. 
VIGGO DRIVE! 
EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS 
John ejects a spent clip, slaps in a fresh one in a blink, and unloads into the limousine which jerks forward, tires squealing as it drives off. 
INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS 
Viggo lies on his back, staring at the ceiling as he lights himself a cigarette. 
VIGGO People don't change. Do they, John? (to the screaming gunman) SHUT... THE FUCK... UP! 
EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS 
John slips the gun into the back of his pants, turns, and calmly walks away. 
...and retrieves a LARGE BRIEFCASE. 
INT. A BANK - SECONDARY VAULT - LATER 
Viggo stands in the center of the small room with his head down, prodding a smoldering Picasso with the tip of his foot. 
VIGGO (in Russian, subtitled) Where's the manager? 
The question is met by silence. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) I'd run, too. (a beat, then in English) What a shame... what a fucking... (SIGHS) ...shame... 
Viggo is trembling with rage, hands clenched at his sides, eyes unblinking. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) Iosef... my son... is worth less than this... far less... treasures reduced to ash... (in Russian, subtitled) ...ash... 
EXT. A BANK - LATER 
With his head down -hands stuffed deep into his pockets, a cigarette smoldering between his lips- Viggo exits, slowly making his way towards his car. 
INT. A DIESEL TRUCK - CONTINUOUS 
Perched behind the wheel -the driver's side window missing- John shifts gears, slams his foot down onto the gas... 
...and narrows his eyes, tensing, his knuckles creaking from within leather gloves as his fingers constrict around the wheel of the stolen vehicle. 
EXT. A BANK - CONTINUOUS 
The gunmen react to the sound of the engine's roar, the two nearest it's approach dropping to a knee, aiming, and firing. 
Bullets slam into the windshield -a round slashing into John's cheek, clipping his ear- and engine block before the front left tire blows. 
John loses control of the truck which fishtails wildly, slamming into a sedan, crushing two gunmen before it cartwheels through their midst, killing three more before coming to a stop on its side. 
A gunmen pushes Viggo towards the center sedan- 
GUNMEN (in Russian, subtitled) GET IN! NOW! 
-shoving him inside. 
Three gunmen approach the truck, firing repeatedly. 
INT. A DIESEL TRUCK - CONTINUOUS 
Dazed, John -his face cut by glass, fresh wounds seeping hot blood- reaches over into the open briefcase, removing the silenced-UZI therein. 
John shoots out the sunroof, dragging himself free of the vehicle as he ducks for cover. 
EXT. A STREET - CONTINUOUS 
As the Sedan peels out, John swiftly ejects the clip, selects another -wrapped in blue tape, these ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS are dark gray, seemingly sharpened to a tip- from a clip belt, slaps it into weapon, drops to a knee and- 
-as the Sedan drives past- 
-depresses the trigger. 
INT. THE SEDAN - CONTINUOUS 
Bullets easily punch through the doors and windows, riddling the dash.. 
...the passenger, the driver... 
...the seats... 
...one gunmen, Viggo, another gunmen... 
...and the seats. 
EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS 
The Sedan veers off, plummeting into the store front of a pharmacy. 
EXT. A BANK - CONTINUOUS 
John ejects the spent clip, selects another wrapped in blue tape, turns towards the fallen truck, and pulls the trigger. 
The bullets punch through the roof, seats/floor, and undercarriage of the vehicle... 
...cutting the remaining gunmen to shreds on the sidewalk behind it. 
The clip empties. 
Silence. 
John tosses the Uzi into the truck, turns, and walks towards the store front from which the rear half of a sedan protrudes, pausing to slip free a silenced-pistol from a dead man's hand. 
Day becomes night. 
EXT. THE DOCKS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
A bustling mecca of commerce, the port never sleeps; ships of all shapes and sizes dock, empty their shipment, refilled with return cargo, and slip out into the night. 
A multi-hulled beast of a ship, THE CHAYKA (Seagull) rests dock-side, its bridge guarded by a small army of security guards. 
Overhead, scattered throughout the cranes, are a half-dozen SNIPERS, searching/studying the dockyard. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE HULL - CONTINUOUS 
Cellophane-wrapped pallets of WEAPONS and bales of CASH are carried by forklifts into the center of the hull and bolted to the floor. 
Meanwhile, two dozen high-end, luxury cars enter the hull, each driven into its own reinforced, steel crate, the doors sealed shut behind them. 
As the last WORKER leaves, he shouts into his walkie-talkie. 
WORKER FILL HER UP! 
Overhead, a large chute appears- 
EXT. THE CHAYKA - CONTINUOUS 
-and the OPERATOR presses a button, sending a seemingly endless stream of grain down into the hull, covering the smuggled goods. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 
Chewing on an unlit cigar, the CAPTAIN -60s, enormous, grizzled, salt-and-pepper beard, long, unkempt hair, dressed in denim and leather- studies paperwork at his desk while Iosef paces; a cigarette in one hand, a drink in the other. 
IOSEF How the fuck long do I have to stay down here? 
CAPTAIN Until we are at sea, and even then, your access up top will be limited. 
The Captain's phone rings.   He answers it. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Yes? 
The Captain's face falls, his jaw clenched. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) I'll let him know. Proceed as scheduled. 
The Captain hangs up, finds a match, sparks it to flame, and ignites the tip of his cigar, puffing it like an old steam engine. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Your father... 
IOSEF (SCOFFS) What about him? 
CAPTAIN He is dead. 
Iosef is stunned. 
IOSEF What? 
CAPTAIN I'm sorry.     He was k- 
The Captain is cut off by the intercom which squawks to life, a screaming voice reduced to panicked static. The Captain slaps a hand down onto the call button. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Come again? 
OPERATOR (O.S.) We're taking fire, sir! 
EXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - CONTINUOUS 
A number of security guards lay dead upon the deck -bleeding out from single gunshot wounds- as the others sprint for cover. The Operator leans hard against the call button of the intercom. 
OPERATOR Someone's shooting at u- 
A round slams into the side of the Operator's head, killing him instantly, his body sinking to the deck. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 
The Captain stands, checks the chamber of the LUGER PISTOL at his side, and heads for the door. 
CAPTAIN Until you hear otherwise... stay. 
The Captain exits the cabin and slams the door behind him. Trembling, Iosef latches close the door... 
...and pours himself a tall drink. 
EXT. A CRANE - CONTINUOUS 
A SNIPER searches the yard through his scope, his earpiece overwhelmed by panicked chatter. 
SNIPER This is Alpha. I don't- 
-disappearing down into the darkness- 
INT. BENEATH THE CANNERY - CONTINUOUS 
-his body SLAPPING against the water as he sinks like a stone. 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
A gunmen rounds a corner... 
...stepping over the empty duffel bag we last saw in John's trunk... 
...and freezes, his eyes wide. 
HIS POV: A brick of C-4 is attached to one of the main support beams, the pale red light of the detonator glowing with ominous disdain. 
He takes a step back, lowering his weapon, and glances about... 
...noticing for the first time the RED LIGHTS of a DOZEN OR MORE C-4 charges scattered throughout the interior. 
GUNMEN RUN! 
INT. BENEATH THE CANNERY - CONTINUOUS 
Underwater, John lifts his hand... 
...to reveal a REMOTE DETONATER... 
...which he depresses with his thumb. 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
The gunman goes pale at the sight of all of those red lights... turning green. 
EXT. THE SHIPYARD - CONTINUOUS 
A series of powerful explosion tear through the building, reducing it to splinters as it collapses in upon itself. 
INT. BENEATH THE CANNERY - CONTINUOUS 
As debris begins to sink down all around him, John swims as hard as he can. 
Surfacing when he is safe, gasping for breath. 
Finding a ladder, John climbs upwards- 
EXT. THE DOCK - CONTINUOUS 
-emerging from behind an access panel. 
John turns towards the ship and moves at a steady pace, eyes roving. 
EXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - NIGHT 
Surrounded by crewmen and security personnel, the Captain watches the explosion, his eyes wide. 
CAPTAIN My... God. 
CREWMAN #1 What do we do? 
CAPTAIN I- 
POP!   POP!    POP!   POP! 
The sound of a pistol echoes up past them. 
CREWMAN Captain... he's coming. 
EXT. THE DOCK - THE CHAYKA - CONTINUOUS 
With his pistol held in both hands -soaked to the bone- John strides towards the boat's entryway, dropping five guards with two perfectly-placed shots apiece. 
He ejects the spent clips, slaps in a replacement, drops to a knee, and fires off six shots at the two gunmen as they round the corner, dead before they hit the ground. 
John drops his pistol, retrieves a submachine gun off a dead guard, unfolds the stock, presses it to his shoulder, and enters the ship. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
With a trembling hand, Iosef pours himself a drink, staring at the door... 
...from behind which is heard the sound of sheer, unadulterated chaos: gunfire, screams, and explosions. 
Silence. 
THUM! THUM! THUM! 
A beat... and John raises the pistol, and fires off his last round, punching a hole in the glass. 
Iosef grins, laughing as John drops his weapon. 
IOSEF (CONT'D) You missed, bitch! 
JOHN No.   I didn't. 
John surges into Iosef... 
...whose hand comes down with the letter opener. John catches his wrist, and snaps it as his right hand darts up, constricts around Iosef's jaw, cracking it in two... 
...lifting him from with the ground... 
JOHN (CONT'D) (GROWLS) For Moose. 
...and hurling him through the pane of glass which EXPLODES. 
SCREAMING, Iosef tumbles end over end, his body slamming into chute from which grain continues to pour, the hull close to full. 
Iosef cartwheels over it and lands half-in/half-out of the hull, SNAPPING his back, as around him... 
...grain piles higher... 
...as he sinks. 
IOSEF NO!    HELP ME! NO! N... (FADING) 
While his legs remain on deck, his upper torso sinks slightly, the grain covering his face, muting his screams... 
...as he suffocates to death. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
John stares down at him for a long moment, turns... 
...and leaves. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A CITY STREET - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
Silence as a soft snow begins to fall. 
A beat... 
...and a sedan rounds the corner, takes it too wide, and crashes. 
INT. A SEDAN - CONTINUOUS 
Perched behind the wheel with his head down, John groans, leaning back as snow wafts through the door's broken side window. 
EXT. A STREET - CONTINUOUS 
John pulls himself out of the vehicle, stumbles a few feet, ENTERS- 
EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
-leans heavy against the wall, and slides into a sitting position. 
John Wick looks to be on death's very doorstep.... 
...however... 
...death will not take him. 
With an almost frustrated/irritated groan John pulls himself to his feet, and staggers down the alley. 
INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Small, simple, and clean. 
A beat... and an elbow is driven through the door's window. John reaches in, unlocks the door, opens it, enters, and closes it behind him. 
INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT 
John grabs an empty box and begins filling it with instruments, medication, bandages, and the like. 
INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE BACK ROOM - NIGHT 
John enters to find an empty room... 
...save a single YOUNG DOG -a mutt of no distinguishable breed, three years old- who sits staring at him, offering little more than a tilt of its head. 
John strips and -using the hose attachment- rinses his body clean: the damage is extensive with cuts, bruises, and three bullet holes (one in his shoulder, one his side, and one in his chest).

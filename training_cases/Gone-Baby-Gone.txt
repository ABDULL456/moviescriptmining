GONE BABY GONE 
Written by 
Ben Affleck & Aaron Stockard 
Morning. 
Clouds moving through the sky. 
We see various shots of the city, exterior storefronts, people going about their lives and some wider shots of the city. 
As they continue, the hour gets progressively later in the day until the final sequence which takes place at night. Over this we hear our guy, PATRICK (30). 
PATRICK (V. 0 . ) To people who grow up here, this city is like family. The thing about family, about the city, about the church, about the people you grow up with-- is that no matter how much they hurt you, no matter what the cost is, you still love them. 
And despite all our flaws-- what we do to each other-- what is done to us-- I've always felt proprietary about it all. 
Like the old commercial for dog food: 'doesn't your dog deserve to be treated like a member of the family?' I've always believed it depended on the dog. Beyond that, the most I thought about anything was what I wanted to do. Who I wanted to be. To rise where my father said I couldn't go, to succeed. To be a man. 
EXT. MCCREADY THREE DECKER       NIGHT 
A playground at night, completely empty. One of the swings drifts back and forth . . . The back door to a home is open. A piece of light cuts across the porch from inside . . . 
Up the back stairwell another door is open, leading into an apartment . . . Down the hall, a third door opens to reveal a small, sparse bedroom. A small mattress on the floor holds a dirty-faced little girl asleep under her blanket . . . Footsteps heard, quietly moving through the house . . . A three foot gate hangs open. A car starts and pulls away. We begin to hear the voice of Jack Doyle. 
DOYLE Amanda McCready was taken from her home sometime between eight and eight thirty. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PATRICK AND ANGIE' S CAR - DAY 
JACK DOYLE (60s) speaks at a press conference on a small, PORTABLE TELEVISION with a 3x4 inch screen resting on the dashboard of a car and plugged into the lighter outlet. 
DOYLE She is four years old, has blond hair and green eyes, 35 pounds and about 3 and a half feet tall. Amanda's mother says she put her to bed in her B e a u t y and t h e B e a s t nightgown . . . 
Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro sit in the car watching idly. TV: A clip from an interview with Amanda's mother, HELENE MCCREADY (29-39). She looks haggard and in desperate need of sleep, if not a stint in detox. Standing beside her is her brother LIONEL and sister-in-law BEATRICE, both of whom we will come to know later. 
HELENE (ON TV) The thing is she just always had a smile on her face, you know? That was her. She was always smilin'. 
(TEARS WELLING) I mean, who would take my little girl? What did she ever do to anyone? 
PATRICK Did you know her? 
ANGIE Vaguely. 
(RE: TV) This is horrible. 
PATRICK Not if you're channel nine. 
ANGIE That's Timmy Reilly. Is he a cop now? A press conference with JACK DOYLE (68) comes on. Beneath his image is written "JACK DOYLE, CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN." 
DOYLE (ON TV) I know the pain of losing a daughter --We will pursue every avenue-- 
PATRICK They can't be taking that many avenues. The whole force is outside the house. 
They are parked on a street in Dorchester lined with residential apartments and storefronts. 
A KNOCK on the windowsill startles them both. It's A 
NEIGHBORHOOD GUY, BOBBY. 
BOBBY (winks, being funny ) Hey. How are you? 
PATRICK Good, Bobby. Nice to see you. 
Bobby moves on down the street. She looks at Patrick. 
ANGIE This is why it's embarrassing to do surveillance three blocks from where we live. 
Over Patrick and through the windshield we see A MAN AND A WOMAN emerge from a MINT GREEN 3-DECKER. 
PATRICK There they go. 
They kiss before parting ways. The MAN hops into a GREEN LINCOLN while the WOMAN heads down the block, on foot. 
PATRICK (CONT' D) They' re splitting up. 
ANGIE Go with him. I'll follow the mother. 
Angie jumps out and starts following the woman. Patrick pulls slowly from the curb and trails the Lincoln. 
ANGIE'S CAR, DRIVING - DAY (MOVING) 
INT. PATRICK   & 
Patrick turns a corner on a residential street. Then another one, keeping about a block between himself and the Lincoln. 
EXT. DORCHESTER ST.         CONTINUOUS 
Suddenly, A TEN YEAR OLD KID darts in front of Patrick atop a BMX bicycle. Patrick has to stop. 
PATRICK Get out of the way. 
KID Fuck your mother. 
Patrick comes in. There are a bunch of the ubiquitous MISSING CHILDREN FLIERS on the ground. A door to a unit is ajar. 
EXT. MAUREEN QUINN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Patrick eases the door open a bit. Patrick goes to his haunches so as to stay out of sight at the opening. Through the crack we see a man and a woman arguing. A woman MAUREEN, Irish (34) is making breakfast. She calls out to the next room. 
MAUREEN 
(CALLING OUT) You want them eggs runnin' ? 
TOMMY MEADE rolls into frame, bitching about his condition. 
TOMMY Yah. Where'd my father leave the bag? 
She indicates. 
MAUREEN By the chair. 
TOMMY You know Cheryl Martin said Donna hired missing persons investigators to find me? 
MAUREEN 
(FEEBLY) 
You're not missin' 
TOMMY Fuckin' bullshit. I can't go back to my own home to get my own clothes for fear of gettin' my wages garnished to support Mike Cuddehy' s fuckin' kids? 
Patrick looks at the floor, the BAG the Father was carrying has CLOTHES in it. The KID comes to the opening in the door. He looks at Patrick. Patrick holds a finger to his lips: shhh. 
EXT TAFT ST. - DAY Patrick parks and walks by various families. 
PATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
INT. 
Patrick looks at a paper. It's their ad. 
PATRICK "Dorchester' s best missing persons?" That's terrible. 
ANGIE What's wrong with it? 
PATRICK It's like having world's tallest midget as your slogan. 
ANGIE It's better than the old one. 
PATRICK You're just saying that cause the new one has your name on it. Patrick takes his gun out, wallet, puts them on the table. 
ANGIE At a certain point the person who books half the business is entitled to her name on the door. 
(BEAT) Speaking of which, how'd you get Tommy? 
PATRICK These people need to learn how to hide better. Staying at your girlfriend's in OC projects ain't slick. 
(BEAT) 
( MORE ) 
PATRICK (CONT'D) And the reason you book half the business is cause no one's trying to get in my trousers. 
ANGIE Keep telling yourself that. 
INT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S BEDROOM       NIGHT 
Long, intimate improvised scene in their bedroom. 
INT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Patrick walks down the hallway toward the kitchen. 
PATRICK Yo, you want some cereal? 
ANGIE (O.S.) I'm in the bathroom. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Makes cereal.   Walks out. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Patrick walks by the door. He pushes on it. She BUMPS it shut. He stands there for a minute, thinks of an explanation. 
PATRICK I just wanted to see if you wanted some food . 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Patrick comes into the living room, the television is on.   He puts the cereal down and starts eating. 
JACK DOYLE (60s) speaks at a press conference. 
DOYLE She is four years old, has blond hair and green eyes, 35 pounds and about 3 and a half feet tall. Amanda's mother says she put her to bed in her B e a u t y a n d t h e B e a s t nightgown . . . Patrick watches. TV: A clip from an interview with Amanda's mother, HELENE 
MCCREADY (29-39). 
HELENE (ON TV) The thing is she just always had a smile on her face, you know? That was her. She was always smilin'. Angle enters. 
BEA Or Amanda. He doesn't think she's his. 
PATRICK Is there anyone you know? An acquaintance who could have taken her . . . a neighbor? 
LIONEL I don't know. You think she was definitely taken though? 
PATRICK If she were lost I think they . . . 
Bea may be coming unglued. 
BEA Couldn't she have fallen down a well or something? Like in Texas? 
PATRICK That's not what we hope for.. . 
Awkward moment. 
ANGIE How is Helene holding up? 
LIONEL She's trying. 
BEA Please, Lionel. 
LIONEL Look, it. I had my problems, hard bust at 22. Bea straightened me out. Helene hasn't had that. 
BEA No, she has you. You find her work-- she was our housekeeper for a year and a half- 
(BEAT) Look, come talk to Helene yourself. I don't care if you think you can help. Try. There must be something you can do. 
She looks at them expectantly. 
PATRICK We'll meet you over there. He throws Angie another small look. 
BEA We don't have a lot of money, but I saved over the years. Don't think we can't afford it. Angie gives her a smile. 
ANGIE'S CAR - LATER 
INT. PATRICK   & 
Patrick and Angie are in their car. They pull to a stop, looking at something off-camera right. 
ANGIE If a missing child isn't found in seventy two hours they are almost never recovered. 
PATRICK Pretty quick with the facts for someone who's so unqualified. 
ANGIE I read that on the computer in two minutes while you were getting dressed. 
PATRICK See that, you're already on the case. 
ANGIE We aren't needed, we canrt make a difference and we can't take their money. 
PATRICK I don't want to take their money. 
ANGIE I don't want to find a child in a dumpster. 
PATRICK Neither do I. I want to find one alive who we can bring home. 
ANGIE We have a good life, Patrick. 
PATRICK This won't change that. 
ANGIE You go out in the rain, you get wet. 
PATRICK If it's a four year-old girl out there, you go out and bring her back. We'll be okay. 
(SMILES) It's just rain. 
DAY 
EXT HELENE'S APT.   - 
We might recognize it from the nighttime abduction sequence except that now it's swarming with: CAMERA TRUCKS, MEDIA TYPES and LOOKEY-LOOS. 
This is a big shot full of REPORTERS, LOCALS, KIDS, A GUY 
WITH A GRILL, AN ICE-CREAM TRUCK. People mill around and converse. KIDS wave behind REPORTERS heads, trying to get on camera. We carry Patrick and Angie through with a Steadi-Cam as they react to the circus. 
A FIELD REPORTER does a stand-up, dressed formally to the waist in a sports coat and tie but wears shorts below. He has heavy pancake make-up on. 
PATRICK Block party. 
EXT. HELENE'S APT - DAY 
They reach the front porch. One, OFFICER REILLY (from TV) stops Patrick as he comes in. 
OFFICER REILLY Friends of the family? 
Patrick rolls his eyes. 
PATRICK Timrny. It's me. 
Lionel is out on the porch. 
LIONEL It's okay. Come on in. Patrick heads down the hall toward the kitchen but turns back when he sees Angie going into the living room. 
INT. HELENE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM         CONTINUOUS 
SAME       LATER (KITCHEN) 
The sink is FULL OF SHIT. Lionel tries getting out a cup for coffee. 
Patrick, Lionel, and Bea sit around the kitchen. Angie makes her way around the kitchen, looking over the environment. Shots of the mess that is Helene's apartment (and a nod to our extraordinary set decorator.) 
PATRICK What about who she hangs out with? What kind of people are around? 
Bea looks to Lionel to answer this sort of thing. 
LIONEL I don't know. She's at the Fillmore all the time. 
PATRICK (knows its reputation) The Fillmore Lounge? 
LIONEL She drinks every day, she's got the gene. The disease. Our parents had it, too. 
PATRICK She use drugs? 
LIONEL I think she does a little coke. 
PATRICK How much is a little? 
LIONEL I don't know . . . few times a week, maybe. How much is a lot? 
PATRICK Few times a week is a lot. 
LIONEL Then she does a lot. I don't know anything about that. 
(TO PATRICK) I put the plug in the jug, myself. I got twenty three years sobriety. There is a short beat before: 
PATRICK f o r lack of anything else) Good for you. 
ANGIE What's Amanda like? 
BEATRICE She's quiet. Has her manners, please and thank yous. She tries her hardest to be good. 
ANGIE You mind if we look in her room? 
INT AMANDA'S BEDROOM - DAY Patrick and Angie stand just inside the door to Amanda's drab little bedroom. The only furniture a TWIN-SIZED MATTRESS and a CHEST OF DRAWERS. It's all third hand. 
PATRICK We get a bonus for finding the furniture? 
Patrick looks over the dirtied walls, faded glowing stars, stickers, a sad sight. 
ANGIE Maybe she ran away. 
DOYLE (0.C.) Solved it yet? Patrick and Angie turn to the voice. Standing in the doorway is JACK DOYLE, the police officer from the TV report. 
PATRICK Almost . He extends his hand. 
DOYLE Jack Doyle. 
PATRICK 
(REACHING OUT) Patrick Kenzie. Angela Gennaro. 
DOYLE Nice to meet you. 
ANGIE Good to meet you, Captain 
DOYLE I take it Bea hired you? 
PATRICK She wants to cover as much ground as she can. He looks them over. 
ANGIE I take it you didn't want us hired. 
DOYLE These people aren' t rich. 
PATRICK We understand that. This is about helping in whatever way we can. Not about making money. 
DOYLE Good. I don't care who finds her. I just want it done. 
ANGIE We want that too, sir. 
DOYLE Fine. Keep us apprised. 
PATRICK Of course... is there any way we can see what you're looking at so far? 
DOYLE 
(SMILES) I'll put my two best men on it. Where can they find you? 
EXT FILLMORE LOUNGE       DAY 
The Fillmore Lounge is a dreary looking bar up an alley off Dorchester Avenue. 
Degenerate drinkers are now forced to go outside and smoke under the noon day sun and the place's faux, stacked stone facade . 
INT FILLMORE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS And it's no more welcoming inside. Men come here to nurse their drug habits, their alcoholism and their hate. 
While you wouldn't think there were many clamoring to get into their club, they don't look kindly on potential applicants. At one end of the bar, LENNY (mid 40' s) sips a whiskey and studies the Keno results. In the rear, 4 ALCOHOLICS sit around muttering to one another. And at one of the tables a CAULIFLOWER FACED MAN drinks alone. In addition there is a SMATTERING OF ROUGH LOOKING FACES. The bartender BIG DAVE (hence the name) has a newspaper spread out before him on the bar. 
PATRICK I'm not asking for the combination to the safe here . . . 
BIG DAVE I got nothin' to say. I already talked to the cops. 
BIG DAVE Don' t run your mouth like you're better than me. 
PATRICK Just cool it, all right? 
LENNY 'Cool it" Listen to this douche bag. 
BIG DAVE I bet she fucks this asshole in half. AN ALCOHOLIC calls out to Lenny. 
ALCOHOLIC #1 Ask her if she sucks cock. 
LENNY Ask her yourself. The door outside is ajar. LENNY'S PAL pushes it CLOSED. 
PATRICK What the fuck is wrong with you? 
LENNY You know, I wouldn't mind seein' some tit. Anyone else like tit? 
ALCOHOLIC # 3 I like tuna. 
ALCOHOLIC # 2 Show me your tunaaaa! 
ANGIE Shut the fuck up. 
ALCOHOLIC #4 (mimes throwing his voice) Twat steak! 
ANGIE Don't be stupid, Lenny. 
ALCOHOLIC # 2 He's talking to his friends. 
LENNY Must be your good looks, Dave, bringin' in all the new snatch. There's some good lookin' pussy in here tonight. 
The alcoholic men are laughing, egging one another on. 
BIG DAVE Lenny, think she wants to see your prick, first. Patrick reaches into his waistband and puts his hand on a SMALL HOLSTER, revealing a 9mrn Kahr handgun. 
PATRICK No, Lenny. No one wants to see your prick. 
B I G DAVE I do! 
B i g Dave l a u g h s . A h i n t o f f e a r b e t r a y s Lenny. 
LENNY Dave. 
PATRICK Back u p .

PATRICK (CONT' D) 
(TO DAVE) You got something to say now, too? Fat Dave? Huh?. 
BIG DAVE All right. Get out 
PATRICK Fuck you, make me a martini. 
ANGIE Patrick, letfs go. They move to the door. 
EXT DORCHESTER AVE.- CONTINUOUS 
Patrick and Angie emerge. They look to one another. Sounds of laughter return inside. The guys appear to have gone right back to their day. Patrick tucks his gun away and looks to Angie. 
PATRICK You okay? 
ANGIE I'm fine. How's your hand. 
PATRICK It fuckinf stings. He indicates his hand, there is some blood. He smiles. They are a little rattled. 
ANGIE Thanks for that. He smiles. 
PATRICK No problem. 
OMIT 
PATRICK That's not what I meant 
ANGIE Is this who you think has Amanda? 
POOLE 
(FROWNING) Well, they' re just suspects and there's some holes in the theory. Corwin likes boys. And he likes 'em seven to nine. 
A pause. 
PATRICK 
(INNOCENTLY) That's what you got? There are no other suspects? 
BRESSANT 
(OFFENDED) Yeah. That's it. A convicted finger blaster who plans to keep a pre-teen at the foot of his bed and just cut off his 
ANKLE BRACELET-- 
POOLE Take it easy, Remy-- 
BRESSANT --Who the fuck is this guy? You're here because Jack Doyle had us extend you a courtesy. You got something to contribute, be my guest. Otherwise go back to your Harry Potter book. 
PATRICK I think you misunderstood my tone, sergeant detective. They gauge one another. 
ANGIE Isn't it usually someone who knows the victim? 
POOLE I think Helene McCready has plenty of people in her life capable of this. 
PATRICK I'm sure you've interviewed Ray Likanski. 
POOLE Who? 
PATRICK Ray Likanski. Skinny Ray? 
(BEAT) No? 
BRESSANT Never heard of him. 
PATRICK Well, with all due respect, we might be able to contribute on that point-- 
POOLE How' s that? 
PATRICK The night Amanda went missing Ray was doing coke at the Fillmore Lounge for two hours between eight and ten. 
BRESSANT Fascinating. 
PATRICK With Helene McCready. Poole and Bressant are genuinely surprised by this. 
POOLE She did bullshit us... 
BRESSANT 
(TO POOLE) We need to straighten her out. 
ANGIE Why would she lie about that? 
POOLE 'Cause it's fucking embarrassing. They go for their coats. Patrick takes the MUG SHOTS. 
PATRICK I'll just grab a copy.. . As they stand, getting their things, Angie turns to Remy. 
PATRICK (CONT' D) What kind of name is Bressant? 
BRESSANT The kind they give you in Louisiana. 
PATRICK I thought you were from here. 
BRESSANT Depends on how you look at it. You might think you're more 'from heref than I am, for example-- but then again, I been living here longer than you been alive. 
(BEAT) So who's right? Patrick shakes his head. 
PATRICK I'll have to mull that over. He takes the photos. 
PATRICK ( CONT ' D) We'll meet you over there. 
CUT TO: 
TRETT PHOTOS       ROBERTA'S FACE 
BUBBA (O.C.) What the fuck makes you think I know people like this? 
INT. BUBBA'S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER 
Reveal BUBBA ROGOWSKI. He is around 30 and hard. He has a calm opacity which belies his strength. His loft is spare and industrial. 
PATRICK I know you don't pay your rent doin' peoplers taxes. 
BUBBA I don't do it sellin' penny rocks to wall- eyed child molesters neither. 
PATRICK Just this one, Corwin Earle, is a molester. He might be staying with the other two baseheads. Just if you hear somethin' . 
BUBBA What are you two? Crime dogs now? 
PATRICK We got hired to help find that little girl. 
LIONEL Of what, drugs? 
HELENE Yeas, Lionel. 
BEATRICE What kind of drugs? 
HELENE Yay, ron. . . 
BEATRICE What does that mean? 
POOLE Cocaine and heroin. 
BEATRICE No, we would have seen the tract marks-- 
BRESSANT Not if you snort it, right sugar? 
HELENE Less addictive that way. 
Helene gets up and gets a beer. It's 10:15 am. 
INT. HELENE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
The conversation has moved to the living room. The same participants, but the collection of EMPTY BEER CANS surrounding Helene suggest she's loosened up some. 
Patrick peers out the WINDOW to see the CIRCUS below (POV) 
BRESSANT I don't know Helene. I keep thinking about this thing I heard. You know where I'm going with this? 
HELENE No. 
BRESSANT Did you know I used to work DCU? 
HELENE I give a fuck. 
BRESSANT Right. So, I still know some of those guys real well. Anyway, I heard that someone ripped Cheese off on a New Hampshire run. You didn't hear that, did you? Angle on Patrick and Angie. 
HELENE No. 
BRESSANT Care to take a polygraph? 
HELENE 
(PROUDLY) Already passed. 
BRESSANT Different questions this time. 
POOLE How much you take, Helene? Nothing. Angle on Patrick. 
POOLE (CONT'D) It's all right. We don't care about hopheads beatin' each other. We care about your daughter. 
(GENTLY) Come on. How much? A beat. 
BRESSANT You want Amanda back or not? Silence in the room. 
BRESSANT (CONT'D) Do you give a fuck about your kid? Another beat. 
POOLE We know you took the money. How much did you take? 
BRESSANT rising, scary) How much? She takes a pull on her beer. Looks around. Fuck it. 
HELENE Ninety five. The room goes quiet. 
LIONEL Hundred? 
HELENE rolls her eyes) Thousand. 
BEATRICE Nintey five thousand dollars?! 
HELENE Yeas, Bea! 
BRESSANT Howrd you do it. She exhales a long thread of smoke. 
HELENE Two weeks ago me and Ray did a run up Nashua to drop four keys on some bikers. When we was walking back through the motel with the money, all these cops swooped in and went for the bikers. Amanda was with us so we pretended to be like a family and they went right past us. So we just-- got in the car and took off. 
BEATRICE You took Amanda with you? 
HELENE What am I gonna do? Leave her in the car, Bea? 
BEATRICE (shakes head, plainly) You are an abomination. God as my witness. 
HELENE 
(GETS 'EMOTIONALR) You know what, Bea? It's hard bein' a mother. It's hard raisinf children. (beat, pointedly) And if God made you barren then you can' t judge me. 'Cause you wouldnrt fuckin' know. By Bears silence, and the narrowing of her eyes, we presume this to be a low blow and that Bea can't have children. 
BRESSANT Hey. (snaps fingers at Helene) Right here. What happened? 
Helene takes a pull from her beer. 
HELENE When we was driving back. Ray's like, 'everyone's gonna think the cops got the money too.' 
BRESSANT You told Cheese the cops got it? 
PATRICK But you and Ray kept the money? 
HELENE This whole fuckin' thing is Ray' s fault. Reactions to this realization. 
PATRICK That's a mistake. He'll never talk to a badge. I know him. If there's a deal to be brokered we're the ones who can do it. 
BRESSANT No. Me and Nick are handling this. This is too important. 
PATRICK If you two go in, negotiate a ransom for a girl, then it is kidnapping and that's the FBI. 
ANGIE All you're gonna do is scare him and the more scared he is the worse it is for her. 
The look at each other. 
PATRICK Do you want to get the kid back or not? 
BRESSANT I'm gonna take that as a rhetorical question. 
PATRICK Sit fuckin' tight. We know him, he111 talk to us and we'll be right back. 
CUT TO: 
A PIPE BEING SMOKED. MARIJUANA BURNS 
INT. CHEESE'S HOUSE, BACK ROOM - MINUTES LATER 
CHEESE Been a long time. 
CHEESE JEAN BAPTISTE sits in frame. He is a wiry, intense man who looks over Patrick and Angie suspiciously. 
Along with Cheese, there are a MAN (CHRIS MULLEN, 30) and a WOMAN (Cheese's Girlfriend, 22, from Laos) . There are flat screen plasma TVs, piles of clothes and nearly sixty boxes of sneakers against one wall. 
Patrick and Angie sit opposite Cheese. Cheese exhales. He gestures to his girlfriend. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) I'm a talk some private shit. 
She starts to go. Chris remains. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) But don't get too far. 
GIRL You know I' 11 be right here. 
He looks them over. He is languid but extremely intimidating. 
CHEESE Bitches love the cheddar. 
Small laugh. 
PATRICK How you been, Chris? 
CHRIS MULLEN Better than you. 
PATRICK Good to hear it. 
CHEESE 
(TO CHRIS) Be cool. 
(BEAT) Been too long not to see a fool. I give you an audience. 
(BEAT) Go. 
Patrick and Anqie exchange looks. He goes. 
PATRICK We found what you were lookin' for in Chelsea. 
CHEESE What makes you think I am concerned with the doings in Chelsea? 
PATRICK Cause I know one of the idiots who robbed you lives there. 
CHEESE What idiot? 
PATRICK The one you just killed. 
CHEESE I don't know about nobody gettin' killed. If someone robbed me and end up dead, you know, life a ma' fucker. 
He looks at Chris, they smile.   Angie leans forward. 
ANGIE Cheese, I appreciate you're seeing us. I know you're busy so we' 11 be quick. 
(BEAT) We have your money. It was buried in Ray' s backyard. 
(BEAT) We want to give it back to you in exchange for Amanda. The two police outside are the only other people who know. They're willing to risk their careers to do this quietly and they've sent us in here to demonstrate that. They don't want to investigate you or prosecute you for anything -- they just want the girl back. 
CHEESE What you talkin' about?   What girl? 
ANGIE 
(PATIENCE TRIED) You know what girl. Cheese. Amanda McCready. Who has nothing to do with Helene stealing from you. 
(BEAT) Don't punish her for who her mother is. 
(BEAT) Tell us where to meet you, tell us what your terms are and we'll do whatever makes you comfortable. You'll get your money and you made your point. Just give us Amanda. Please. 
Cheese seems confused. 
PATRICK Cheese, look at me. No one gives    a fuck what you did. I never even liked    Ray. You get the money. The girl goes    home to her mother we'll say we found her   in the bushes or whatever. 
CHEESE I donft know. 
ANGIE Are we rationalizing this? I mean, wouldn't a hundred police up there be better for her than the four of us? Doyle stops. 
DOYLE What does that mean? 
ANGIE I'm asking if keeping this quiet is better for Amanda, or is it better for us? 
Doyle is opaque. 
DOYLE Do you have any children, Miss Gennaro? 
She shakes her head. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) Then you've never lost one. My only child was murdered. She was twelve. You heard about it? 
The question is rhetorical. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) What you didn't hear, what you don' t know, is what that feels like. 
There are articles on the wall.   COP FATHER OF SLAIN CHILD 
VOWS: NEVER AGAIN. 
DOYLE ( CONT' D) What I live with? Is knowing my daughter likely died crying out for me to protect her, to come save her. 
(BEAT) And that I never came. 
(BEAT) She died afraid and alone, in a shallow ditch bank, a few feet from the road and not ten minutes from our house. 
Silence. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) I know what it is- to lose my child. He now gets more upset than he usually does delivering this speech. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) God damn it. 
(BEAT) You force my hand and then question the way I handle to it? Question me? 
BRESSANT 
(TO ANGIE) No one's questioning you. He relaxes a little. 
DOYLE I honor my daughter with this, this division, so no parent has to live what I've known . . .Not even a woman like Helene McCready . 
(BEAT) 
THAT GIRL-- (indicates photo of Amanda) is all I care about. And we're going to bring her home. 
EXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING QUINCY QUARRY - SUNSET 
From the sky, lit by the last slivers of light from a setting sun, we see the Quincy quarry. It has become, in essence, a huge lake, set a hundred or so feet into a rock quarry and surrounded by acres of dense pine. As we travel past the quarry, we see PATRICK'S CAR IN A PARKING LOT. 
SUN JUST SET 
EXT. QUARRY PARKING LOT   - 
The car idles. Patrick and Angie sit inside. 
ANGIE Why is he bringing us all the way up here? 
PATRICK Dark, big, make sure he can get away. 
ANGIE No. Something's wrong. 
PATRICK All he wants is the money. He just doesn't want to get arrested doing it. 
ANGIE They're gonna kill her. I can feel it. He looks out the window. 
EXT QUARRY TRAIL - NIGHT 
Angie, Patrick, Bressant, & Poole follow up a steep incline. Remy has the BAG OF MONEY. 
POOLE This asshole could have picked somewhere on level ground. 
BRESSANT Keep the lights off for now. 
ANGIE Is this where all the peak rocks have names? 
PATRICK (listing the names of the 
PEAKS ) Running Tierny, Leo, Dan, Gooch, Jigger, Goreski and runnin' Mike. 
POOLE Where'd they get those fuckin' names? 
PATRICK From the kids who died tryin' to jump off em.. 
EXT. QUARRY TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER 
More climbing. It starts to get steep. Some stones come loose underfoot and trickle downhill. We see that the quarry rocks are covered in the graffiti left by previous visitors. They walk in silence. 
EXT QUARRY TOP - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER They CREST the hill. The city lights are behind them and we move to reveal the QUARRY WATER below and the edge before them. The path forks in two, opposite directions. 
BRES SANT (to Patrick & Angie) This is where we part ways 
POOLE 
(SMILES) Divide and conquer. 
ANGIE Then she could be alive. She could be hiding. She could be stuck . . . 
PATRICK Yeah but, the one cop told me that two years ago some guy killed his wife and dumped her in there-- the divers found the body . . .but it was so dark they lost it and then they could never find it again. There's so many crags and outcroppings and old cars and shit. 
(BEAT) So don't get your hopes up. 
He sees she is crying. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Oh, hey.   It's okay. I know. 
She bends over, more emotional pain than physical. She curls her knee up to her chin, holds her abdomen, in obvious pain. Patrick climbs into bed with her, wraps her in his arms. 
ANGIE I'm sorry. . . I'm sorry. . 
PATRICK Don' t say that. 
ANGIE I'm sorry.. . 
PATRICK It's okay. We creep back slowly as the news plays. 
DOYLE (ON TV) . . . every effort to recover her remains so the McCready family can have a proper burial. However this quarry is extremely deep and treacherous. All too often she keeps that which she takes in . . . 
They cut back to the Anchor desk. 
ANCHOR (ON TV) Well, a sad end to that story, Susanne. 
SUSANNE (ON TV) Yes it is, Phil. 
ANCHOR (ON TV) Ron is next with Sports. The Bruins in action tonight? 
RON (ON TV) Yes, they are, Phil. The B f s took a crack at the Flyers tonight and the rough stuff started in the first perio--

PATRICK (V. 0. ) I tried to catch my balance, but the world kept turning forward. 
ANGIE'S APT - NIGHT 
INT. PATRICK   & 
Patrick in the living room. The only light is the television. 
ON TV: A MUG SHOT OF CHRIS MULLEN. 
PATRICK (V. ) 
Chris' run lasted a day and a half until, from what they could tell, he ran into someone else who wanted the money even more than he did. 
NEWSCASTER # 2 A Dorchester man was gunned down today . . . 
FIELD REPORTER # 7 In the third Dorchester slaying in as many days, 29 year old Chris Mullen was gunned down in an apparent robbery. The Police Commissioner defended the rising tide of crime as a statistical abberation tied to growing umemployment and the humidity of an unusually sweltering summer month. 
INT. SAME - LATER 
Patrick lies on the couch, heavy. The coffee table is piled high with empty beer cans. 
PATRICK (V. ) 
You couldn't turn on the television without another kid gone and feared whatever. Another horror story. 
NEWSCASTER (ON TV) Missing for four days and Shrewsbury is gripped with fear. After Jimmy Pietro's disappearance, doors are locked and community watch patrols are being formed-- 
INT. BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING, 4TH DISTRICT - DAY

EXT. TOWNSEND 
Doyle's 'summer cottage.' He pulls up in a Suburban and gets out of the car. The first time we see him in plain-clothes he looks humbled. 
INT. FATHER'S FOUR BAR - MONTAGE 
Bressant and Poole drink with Patrick 
PATRICK It's bullshit. He was trying to save her life. 
POOLE They don't see it that way. 
PATRICK Can he fight it? 
BRESSANT When you gamble, you don't put money on the table if you're gonna cry about losing it. 
BUBBA Your gun, dummy. 
EXT. ROUTE 1A - SUNSET, MAGIC HOUR 
Bubba's Navigator, full chrome package cruises down the parkway. 
INT. BUBBA'S NAVIGATOR        CONTINUOUS 
Bubba and Patrick ride silently. Patrick drinks a BEER. 
EXT. EVERETT STREET       DUSK 
This used to be a neighborhood where families lived and worked in factories nearby. The factories are long gone and the families with them. All that remains are the ghosts of their homes, derelict and near abandoned for decades. They are ringed sparsely by the kind of industrial facilities self-respecting neighborhoods won't permit. 
The Navigator pulls up outside a particularly decrepit house. 
INT. BUBBA'S NAVIGATOR - CONTINUOUS 
Bubba takes a Beretta from beneath his seat. He checks the clip. Patrick gives him a look. 
BUBBA Calm down. I'm doing you a favor. 
PATRICK You are? 
BUBBA You were lookin' for someone. I found 'em for you. 
PATRICK The case is over.

LEON TRETT Okay, chill. 
INT TRETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Bubba and Patrick step inside. It's a dirty, grim place. They follow Leon down a hallway and through several rooms. Music comes from upstairs. 
BUBBA You guys startin' a band? 
INT KITCHEN - LATER Bubba throws Leon a small "taste bag." Leon tosses Bubba a KNOT OF MONEY. Leon promptly empties the bag and snorts it from atop his closed fist. Bubba sighs at the mess of money he' s been given. 
BUBBA Organizational skills are poor. 
ROBERTA TRETT, a LARGE and UNATTRACTIVE woman appears. 
ROBERTA I told you to call me when it got here. 
LEON It just got here. 
ROBERTA You already did some. 
LEON I did two l i n e s . That was the taste bag. 
Leon gives Patrick a look: Women. 
Roberta POPS Leon in the face. He holds his hand to his face 
ROBERTA That's for gettin' wise. 
LEON I said I'm sorry. Roberta takes the bag and snorts some from her pinky nail. 
BUBBA (CONT ' D ) ( t o Patrick) Where you g o i n ' ? P i c k up t h e money. 
BOOM. A TRUNK OPENS AS WE CUT T THE NEXT SCENE

EXT. TRETT HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 
POOLE and BRESSANT who r i f l e t h r o u g h t h e i r t r u n k , p u t t i n g on v e s t s and r e a d y i n g t h e i r weapons.

BRESSANT What e l s e ? 
PATRICK They're d e f i n i t e l y high. 
BRESSANT On w h a t ? 
PATRICK Cocaine. 
BRESSANT 
(WINKS) That what your 'friend' told ya? 
POOLE SWAT will be here in five minutes. 
PATRICK You're not gonna wait for them? 
BRESSANT 
(TO PATRICK) Did you or did you not tell me that you saw Corwin Earle with the medallion of St. Christopher on his fucking wrist? 
PATRICK I think it was a medallion. 
(BEAT) It was definitely Corwin Earle. 
BRESSANT We' re not waiting. 
Poole cocks the shotgun. Bressant picks up the radio in his car. 
POOLE Stay here. Don't fuck around. 
BRESSANT (rapid fire cop speak) 290, German Road. Suspect 1860 moving in now. Possible captive in danger. 
Bressant throws the radio on his seat and starts for the house. As he goes, he turns back to Patrick. 
BRESSANT (CONT' D) 
(GENUINE) Nice job. As they reach the sidewalk out front, Bressant cuts across the yard toward the side of the house. Poole heads for the front door. Bressant does a ONE ARM COCK of the shotgun before disappearing from Patrick's sight. 
EXT. TRETT HOUSE       CONTINUOUS 
Poole rings the buzzer and steps back.. 
SHOTS FIRE THROUGH THE DOOR and clip into Poole. It seems almost too clumsy to be real. He falls over, holding his neck. A moment of STUNNED SILENCE, then: Patrick runs from the car. Staying low, he races for the cover of the FRONT YARD OF THE HOUSE. 
BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG Patrick TRIPS taking cover and is splayed across the muddy grass, looks over his shoulder. 
Patrick reaches Poole and lies on top of him. He messily checks for a pulse, gets smeared with blood. Poole is torn up. Several rounds hit where the vest wasn't, including his neck. He grunts. Patrick fumbles for his cell phone. 
PATRICK There's an officer shot. Shots fired. An officer down at (he looks up at the door) Two-nine-zero German St. 
Patrick hears shots from inside. He leaves his phone by Poole and heads inside. HOWLING can be heard from within. 
INT TRETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The foyer floor is spattered with blood. He cautiously moves forward. Into a completely bare room. He moves to the hallway. Just inside the hall a BODY lies motionless on its stomach. Patrick inches through the door, crouches next to the body, and cranes his head. It's Leon Trett: DEAD. Patrick momentarily pauses to examine Leon. 
BOOM A GUNSHOT explodes and a SLUG rips into the wall above Patrick's head, showering him in plaster. Looking up, he sees Roberta Trett at the far end of the hall gripping her revolver. 
BOOM BOOM, two more shots bury into the wall. 
ROBERTA 
(ENRAGED) 
GET AWAY FROM HIM! GET AWAY FROM LEON! 
She CHARGES. Patrick whips open a door opposite the one he just came through and leaps out of the hallway . . . And TRIPS up a staircase        SMACKING HIS FACE against the 
wood. . . Roberta FIRES UP AT HIM. He scrambles up the stairs and crashes his body against a STEEL DOOR at the top. It flies open and he tumbles through. 
INT. CORWIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Patrick spins over and kicks the door closed. He springs to his feet, throws his body against the door, and locks it with the heavy DEAD BOLT on the POLICE DOOR. WHAM. Roberta slams into the other side of the door with everything she's got. She does it again, WHAM. And again, WHAM. But the door holds. Patrick turns to survey his surroundings. Patrick moves to ANOTHER ROOM outfitted with a COFFEE TABLE piled high with empty beer cans, a frayed COUCH, a small TV. The room connects to a small BEDROOM. Patrick steps toward. A SOILED, BARE MATTRESS lies in one corner. 
Patrick steps in, his gun raised . . . 
And finds himself staring directly into the face of: 
CORWIN EARLE. Crouched on the floor, naked from the waist down and wearing a half-shirt. His stare is bug-eyed & frightened. Corwin stares at Patrick, scared. 
PATRICK Don' t move. 
CORWIN EARLE It was an accident. 
He looks up at Patrick like a whipped dog, eyes shifting nervously to the door. 
BRESSANT It's fucked up, right? 
PATRICK They tell you anything about Nick? 
BRESSANT They say he could be okay. I don't know. 
Bressant hands Patrick the bottle. Patrick sits down next to him. There is a beat. He drinks. 
PATRICK How old did they say the kid was? 
BRESSANT Seven. 
PATRICK Second grade. 
BRESSANT You should be proud of yourself. Most men would have stayed outside. 
PATRICK It doesn't matter. 
BRESSANT 
( KNOWING) Yes it does. 
PATRICK I had a priest who always said, "shame is God's voice telling us where we did wrong. " 
BRESSANT Fuck him, you did good. 
PATRICK Murder is a sin. 
BRESSANT Depends on who you do it to. 
PATRICK 
(QUIET MATTER-OF-FACT) It don't work like that. It is what it is. Bressant sees Patrick is struggling. 
BRESSANT I planted evidence on a guy once. 
(BEAT) We got a call from our pal Ray Likanski. Back in '95 we were paying a hundred an eight ball to snitches. He couldn't find enough guys to rat out. Anyway, he tells us there's a guy pumpin' out of an apartment in Colombia point. Me and Nick go in-- this was fifteen years ago; when Nicky went in, it was no joke. 
(BEAT) So it's a stash house, the old lady is beat to shit and the husband is mean, cracked out, tries to give us trouble. Nick takes him down. We' re doin' an inventory but it looks like we missed it cause there's no dope in the house. I go in the back room, now this place was a shit-hole, mind you, rats and roaches all over the place, but the kid's room in the back is spotless. He swept it, mopped it. Immaculate. The kid is sitting there, holding on to his Playstation for dear life, no expression, tears streaming down his face. He wants to tell me how he just learned his multiplication tables. 
PATRICK Jesus. 
BRESSANT The father has the kid living in a crack den, subsisting on twinkles and ass- whippings and the kid is still asking me, "is my daddy all right?" 
(BEAT) You're worried about what's Christian? Kids forgive, they don't judge, they turn the other cheek. 
(MORE) 
BRESSANT (CONT' D) What do they get for it? 
(BEAT) I went back out and put an ounce of heroin on the living room floor. Sent the father on a ride. Seven to nine. 
PATRICK Think you did the right thing? 
BRESSANT I don't give a fuck. You take a side. You beat a child, you molest a child, you hurt a child -- you ain't on my side. And hope you don't run into me because I will lay you the fuck down. Easy. 
PATRICK Doesn' t feel easy. 
BRESSANT Look, was he better off without the father? Yes. But okay, the kid might be out there, pumpin7 with a gun in his waistband. It's a war. Are we winning? No. (beat, shift) Look, I got a great wife, money saved, hit my 30 in three months, pick up that pension and hail a fucking cab. Go down 
TO FLORIDA-- 
PATRICK 'Cause a bad day in Florida-- 
BRESSANT --Better than a good day anywhere else. They share a small laugh, 
BRESSANT (CONT'D) Would you do it again? Clip Corwin Earle? 
PATRICK No. 
BRESSANT Does that make you right? 
PATRICK I donft know. 
BRESSANT Don't make you wrong t h o u g h , d o e s i t ? 
He l a u g h s . T a k e s a d r i n k . 
BRESSANT (CONT ' D ) When I s t a r t e d h e r e a n o l d e r c o p t o l d me: D y o u r b e s t , l i v e w i t h y o u r r e g r e t s and

P a t r i c k moves o f f i n t o t h e n i g h t . 
From a high angle, we see the bar. 
From the car we see Patrick and Angie wait in their car outside Murphy's Law. They see Lionel approach and head into the bar. 
INT. MURPHY'S LAW - DUSK SETTING IN 
2 TEAMSTERS share a bottle of whiskey at the bar while 3 SECRETARIES chat nearby. A BARTENDER works with a WAITRESS. Near the back door, TWO MEN throw darts. Patrick, Angie and Lionel sit around a table in the middle of the bar. Lionel stares at his hands. 
PATRICK How long you known Remy? 
LIONEL Detective Bressant? 
(LIAR'S PAUSE) Just, in, met him through the investigation of Amanda. 
PATRICK That's it? 
LIONEL Yeah. 
PATRICK How long you known Remy? 
LIONEL What is this? 
PATRICK They have the internet now, Lionel. 
LIONEL (pauses -- looking from one to 
THE OTHER) You know how it is in town. Everybody knows everybody. 
PATRICK No, Lionel. Everybody don't know everybody. 
LIONEL What are you talkin' about? 
PATRICK Why you lyin' Lionel? 
LIONEL I'm not. 
PATRICK Do you have something to hide? Why can't you tell me? 
Beat. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) When you want to get away with a crime, Lionel it ain't bullshitting your way past ten questions. It's nobody asking the first one. 
PATRICK ALTERNATIVE LINE: 
PATRICK (CONT'D) You came to our house . . . .fuckin' explode. 
Lionel puts up his hands. 
LIONEL Fine. Fine. 
(BEAT) I haven't been honest with you. It's just not something I'm proud of, you know? I was in a bar fight, in the day. The other guy cracked his skull. At some point, I musta said, "I' 11 kill you." So they had me up for attempted. My word against the other guy's. A witness testified to my version and the jury believed him. 
PATRICK 'Cause he was a cop. 
LIONEL Yeah.   He testified for me. Angie starts to believe Lionel might be lying. 
ANGIE Why didn't you mention that? 
LIONEL I was embarrassed. 
PATRICK Bullshit. You bragged about taking a hard bust the first day we met you. 
LIONEL No I didn't. 
PATRICK So you knew 'Detective Bressant.' 
LIONEL It's not like we were best friends. 
ANGIE 
(BUILDING SUSPICION) But you lied. 
PATRICK Why did you call Remy? 
LIONEL He's a cop.. . 
PATRICK And? 
LIONEL 
(GETTING FLUSTERED) The c a s e i s c l o s e d , P a t r i c k . I t ' s c l o s e d .

PATRICK You a n d him t o o k Amanda, t o b l a c k m a i l your s i s t e r . 
LIONEL Why would I do t h a t ? 
108   A COMMOTION draws their attention to the front door. A MAN 108 WEARING A POPEYE MASK stands just inside the door brandishing a shotgun. 
POPEYE 
(TO BARTENDER) 
YOU! THE SAFE . . . NOW! (pointing with his gun) Right under there. 
The bartender does as he's told -- sliding open a door beneath the bar to reveal a safe. 
POPEYE (CONT'D) Everyone needs to shut up. I'll be done in two minutes. (to the dart players) You get down on the floor. Hands behind your head! Just relax. 
A woman starts to panic. 
WOMAN AT BAR Oh, god, no. 
POPEYE This will all be over in a minute if everyone stays calm. 
TEAMSTER Do you know who's bar this is, shit-head? 
Popeye CRACKS the teamster in the jaw with the butt of his shotgun. 
POPEYE Or you can get wise. It's up to you. The bartender places a STACK OF BILLS on the bar -- 2 or 3 grand. Popeye throws a DUFFLE BAG at him and he fills it. 
DART PLAYER We got families. 
POPEYE Pipe down. 
He turns to Lionel. 
POPEYE (CONT'D) What did you say?! 
Nobody said anything. 
POPEYE (CONT' D) Another smart guy? 
The bar is silent. 
POPEYE (CONT'D) 
(TO LIONEL) You1re a talker, huh? Keep yapping motherfucker. 
WOMAN AT BAR Stop antagonizing him! He has a gun. 
POPEYE 
(TO LIONEL) You want to keep talking trash? Okay. 
DART PLAYER 
SHUT UP! Even though Lionel has said nothing, every witness at the bar would remember it this way. That Lionel had been talking and he had been killed. Popeye SNAPS THE ROUND INTO THE CHAMBER WITH ONE HAND. 
HE CRANES HIS NECK 
On Patrick, this rings a bell. From the Tretts. . . Popeye is Bressant. Bressant levels the shotgun at Lionel. 
POPEYE 
(TO LIONEL) Close your eyes, Mouth. Close 'em tight. 
LIONEL You don't have to do this 
PATRICK 
REMY BRESSANT. 
Bressant looks at him, then sticks the shotgun between Lionel' s eyes. 
LIONEL (his eyes shut) Wait. Jesus. 
PATRICK Amanda McCready was taken by Remy Bressant ! 
BRESSANT Don't say that fucking name! 
LIONEL I already told him we did it for ransom. I told him we did it for ransom! Remy . . . Please. Ill. 
BRESSANT Fuck. . . His heart isn't in it. He begins to lower his gun 
BANG! BANG! TWO SHOTS HIT Bressant. He takes a beat to register this, standing stock-still. The Bartender is standing there with a smoking gun, in shock. Patrick leaps out of his chair and drives his head into Bressant's stomach. Wrapping his arms around his waist, he plows his spine straight back into the bar. 
Bressant cracks the shotgun stock down onto the back of Patrick's neck, buckling his knees and crashing him to the floor. He SCRAMBLES OUT the front door. Patrick gets to his feet and looks around. Angie is okay. Patrick turns and RACES out the front door after Bressant. Angie goes to Lionel's side. 
SECRETARY Call 911! Call 911! 
EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS Patrick looks up and down the street, but Bressant is nowhere to be seen. He sees a BLOODY POPEYE MASK on the ground. A TRAIL OF BLOOD runs away from it which Patrick follows across the street. The thickening trail leads Patrick along the side of a LARGE 3-STORY FACTORY (in the process of being converted to lofts) and to a DOOR near the back. Blood is smeared on the door and a small red puddle has formed on the ground. 
INT FACTORY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS Leading with his gun, Patrick steps into a bright STAIRWELL. Blood tracks up the stairs and Patrick ascends cautiously. He climbs one flight. And then another -- pausing on the landing. Above him, light comes through an OPEN DOOR. He starts for it. Patrick continues up the last few steps. He reaches the top and peers out onto: 
EXT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS Patrick scans the roof for Remy. He sees nothing on his right and turns around to his left, circling the stairwell. Behind him we see a magnificent view of the neighborhood. He turns another corner to see: 
Bressant sits against an aluminum vent - - his head leaned back and his eyes half closed. A ROSE OF BLOOD spreads out against Bressant's shirt. His flesh is beginning to grey. 
Patrick holds his gun on him and calls out. 
PATRICK Put the fuckin' gun down!            Put it down. 
The Police look at him. 
PATRICK (CONT' D) Look, I've cooperated. Unless you want me to go out there and start calling the papers to give 'em my Police corruption exclusive, I'm leaving. 
He gets up. 
CAPTAIN Calm down. 
(BEAT) You're released. But Mr. Kenize-- 
(WINKS) I hope you don't get pulled over any time soon. 
INT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Patrick comes into the office/living room. Angie is there. 
ANGIE What happened? 
PATRICK They kept my shoelaces. 
She smiles. 
ANGIE We'll go down to Zayre's tomorrow and get you some new ones. 
PATRICK I don't want to do that tomorrow. 
ANGIE What do you want to do? 
PATRICK Take a trip. 
EXT MASS TURNPIKE - DAY The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick forests of pine trees. Inside the car it's quiet. Patrick's stare is fixed to the road -- the rhythm of the white lines that pulse by. Angie rests her head against the passenger window, the BLUR of the tree-line reflected in her eyes. 
EXT . RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY A 2-LANE ROAD winds them through rolling hills and past a SIGN welcoming them to: 'WEST BECKETT, MA. Pop. 974' -- a Rockwell painting in the heart of the Berkshire Mountains. 
EXT TOWNSEND ROAD - MOMENTS LATER The car rolls down a quiet road where small COTTAGES nestle in clumps of birch and pine trees. Patrick parks opposite a long driveway. A MAILBOX at its mouth reads: DOYLE 
ROAD - AFTERNOON 
EXT. TOWNSEND 
Patrick and Angie sit in the car.   They look down a driveway. 
She takes a beat. 
ANGIE You want to tell me where our trip has taken us? 
PATRICK You know where we are. 
ANGIE 
(BEAT) He would never, ever do something to endanger a child. 
PATRICK Are you sure? 
ANGIE Yes. 
PATRICK He was a part of it. They don't tape calls. He handed us a transcript like it was evidence and he knew it was a forgery- -maybe he forged it himself. He knew what they were doing, he supported it and he covered it up. 
ANGIE Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty grand? What for? 
He just looks at her. 
PATRICK Had to be for something. 
ANGIE When you're talking about ruining an old man who lost his child and gave years of service . . . "something" isn't enough. 
PATRICK For a guy who tried to ruin us, something' s plenty. 
ANGIE This is the kind of thing where if you do it, you want to be sure. 
(BEAT) Are you sure? 
PATRICK No. 
(BEAT) Are you coming? 
ANGIE No. 
And he goes down the road. 
EXT DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
They start down the driveway towards a small, red cottage set a hundred yards or so off the road. But after only a few steps, they stop. PATRICK & ANGIE'S POV: Through the trees, Doyle emerges from the cottage. He carries 2 FULL SUITCASES to a SUBURBAN and loads them in the back. His wife, FRANCINE, follows. Patrick & Angie take a beat before resuming down the drive. Only to FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS at the sight of: 
AMANDA MCCREADY CHARGING ONTO THE PORCH, clutching a BACK- PACK, and wearing a look of utter determination. 
AMANDA Don't forget mine, gramma. 
FRANCINE I'd never forget yours, sweetheart. Doyle lifts Amanda off the porch and carries her to the Suburban. He dips down, allowing Amanda to place her back- pack inside. 
AMANDA Can I have a, please a sandwich? 
DOYLE What kind do you want. 
AMANDA Grill Cheese. 
DOYLE Patrick Kenzie. To what do I owe the pleasure? 
He holds Doyle's look. 
PATRICK Remy Bressant died last night. 
DOYLE I was told. It's a shame. 
PATRICK Hard to understand.    He seemed like a good man. 
DOYLE He was a good man. You don't know why people do what they do. Only they see out their own windows. With that, AMANDA walks out the door, running to Jack and clinging to his leg. Jack holds Patrick's look. 
AMANDA Papapa.    Come make sandwiches now please. 
Doyle smiles, giving away nothing of his tension with Patrick. Francine comes to the door. 
DOYLE 
(TO FRANCINE) It's all right. 
(TO AMANDA) Go inside, my sweet. I'll be there soon and make you a sandwich. Francine hesitates.    Doyle is gentle. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) I'm all right. Francine takes her back inside. 
A beat.   Doyle smiles. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) So you know. Good for you. You uncovered the thing men died for. 
PATRICK Men killed for. 
DOYLE I'm giving that little girl a life. 
PATRICK It's not your life to give. Helene is her mother. You think she's a bad mother you should have gone to social services. Short of that, it's her mother, it's where she belongs. 
DOYLE Turn around, get back in your car and wait thirty years. You don't know what the world is made of yet. 
PATRICK I know I'm tired of being lied to   and tired of being lectured by a gang   of criminals. I'm calling the State    Police in five minutes. They'll be here    in ten. 
DOYLE No. 
(BEAT) You haven't made that call because you think it might be an irreparable mistake. Because part of you believes it doesn't matter what the rules say. Because you know, when the lights go out and it's just you and your conscience you ask yourself if she's better here or better there, you know the answer and you always will. 
PATRICK See you at the arraignment. 
DOYLE You can do one good pure thing here today. One right thing. Most men don't get that chance in a lifetime. 
(BEAT) You walk away from that, you may not regret it when you get home, or in a year but I promise you, get to where I am, you will. But I'll be dead by then, you'll be old, and she'll be trailing a ragged, tattered childhood of her own -- and you'll be the one who has to tell them you' re sorry. 
PATRICK Then I guess I will. I'll tell them I'm sorry and I'll live with it. And maybe that will happen, what I'm not gonna do, is have to apologize to a grown woman who says, why did you leave me? I got kidnapped, my aunt hired you to find me, and you did. You found me with a strange family but you broke your promise and you left me there. Why? Why didn't you bring me home? 
(MORE) 
PATRICK (CONT' D) It don't matter how many outfits and snacks and family trips we took-- they weren't my family, they stole me and I was raised as a stranger to myself and the life I would have had. You knew about it, you knew better and you did nothing. And maybe that grown woman will forgive me but I won't forgive myself. 
Silence . . . It hangs in the air. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) The only thing I care about is that little girl. And I'm gonna bring her home. Doyle hears this. Has his reaction, something like a sagging, an emptiness, and a resolution. 
DOYLE 
I STILL Then you'll have to excuse me. have a sandwich left to make. 
He turns and walks inside. 
SAME - LATER Patrick watches from down the road. Doyle is on the porch. Jack sits in his favorite chair. Amanda is on his    lap, facing him, arms around his shoulders, head tucked   into his neck. He slowly rocks the chair. He holds Amanda     like its the last hug of his life. His eyes are fixed on a    point somewhere far off in the distance. 
Patrick takes out his phone. 
In the distance sirens wail faintly, getting louder. Just inside the door is Amanda's colorful kids back-pack, a strange and cute stuffed snake, and Francine's bag spilling over with zip-locked snacks and children's cups-- all the stuff Francine had packed to make sure Amanda would have, whereever she'd go. Over this all, beginning faintly and growing increasingly audible, is the inanity of the television news. It's blather like a merciless blanket of idiocy over something hopelessly sad. A swarm of West Beckett POLICE CRUISERS cram the small road. A Deputy knocks on the door. Doyle answers. He knows the local cops' who are embarrassed to arrest him. He makes it easy for them. Doyle nods at the deputy with quiet acceptance and the dignity of a man at peace with the choices h e r s made. The DEPUTY puts a hand-cuffed Doyle into the back of his car. 
Francine Doyle silently mouthing! "oh my God' oh my God." Angie looks out from the car' past the policef past everything. They move to Francine to put her in a police car. Amandal being taken from Francine' cries and reaches out to her. She screams. Francine is handcuffed. Patrick tries to hold his look. Patrick stands with a GROUP OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. He looks to Angie . . . She doesn' t look back. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT HELENE'S APARTMENT - EVENING The crush of media has descended outside the apartment for footage of the joyous reunion. Helene is made up. She waits on the curb as the POLICE CAR arrives. Out gets a FEMALE OFFICERr holding Amandar who is terrified by the rapacious mob of REPORTERS AND PHOTOGWPHERS. Amanda's  fear of the throng causes her to cling to Helenel giving the photographers the shot they want. Patrick watches from his car' parked up the block. He is alone. 
ADDITIONAL STREET MONTAGE IMAGES FEATURING PATRICK He is in the neighborhood. 
EXT. CITY STRETT - SUNSET 
Patrick drives. He sees the ITALIAN MAN (Gerry Speca) and they trade looksl once again' 40 fps as he drives by. 
ANGIE'S APT - EVENING 
INT PATRICK    & 
Patrick comes home. Boxes are packed. The place feels less warm. More bare. A voice from the doorway turns him around. It's Angie. 
ANGIE Sorryr I had to come back and get some stuff. 
PATRICK It's okay. She looks at himl almost sympathetic. 
PATRICK ( CONT ' D) Can we at least talk? 
ANGIE There's nothing to say

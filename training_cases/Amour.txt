AMOUR 
Written by 
Michael Haneke 
SCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is open. 
The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain- clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses. Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand, the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor. 
PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE (to the superintendent and the NEIGHBOR) Wait Outside please. 
He signals to a police officer who herds the curious onlookers back out through the door. 
POLICE OFFICER (to the superintendent, pointing to a pile of mail) What's the date of the last letter? 
SUPERINTENDENT (VERIFYING) The 16th from what I can see... Wait... 
The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape. 
PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE (to the fire officer) Can you try? 
While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room, where he also opens up the windows... 
FIREMAN (O.S.) The door is open. 
...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the police officer and the janitor. 
JANITOR ...no as far as I know. During the whole time, they had a nurse, but it's been a while since I last saw her. My wife has been... 
The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the curtains billow into the room. 
PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE (to the firemen who are now curious enough to come and stand by the DOOR) Did you open the windows? 
The firemen shake their heads. 
The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right- hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a crucifix. 
SCENE 2 - White letters on a black background: THE CREDITS 
SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT 
All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the lights go out. APPLAUSE. 
She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with his in the closet. 
ANNE Imagine if we were here, in our beds, and someone broke in. 
GEORGES Why should I imagine that? 
ANNE But it's terrible! I think I'd die of fright. 
GEORGES (LAUGHING) So would I. 
He undoes his shoes. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Shall we have a drink? 
ANNE I'm tired. 
GEORGES I still fancy a drink. 
He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom. 
ANNE (O.S.) Go ahead then. Mathilde told me that in her building, the attic apartment was burgled from the loft. They just knocked a hole in the wall, cut out all of the valuable pictures from their frames and disappeared without a trace. 
He goes toward the kitchen. 
GEORGES They must have been professionals. 
As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears to be looking at Anne. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Did I tell you, you looked good tonight? 
SHORT PAUSE. THEN: 
ANNE (O.S.) (FLATTERED) What's got into you? 
With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen, where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND, apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short PAUSE: 
ANNE (CONT'D) Weren't those semiquavers in the presto incredible? What staccato! Don't you agree? 
Short PAUSE. 
GEORGES (O.S.) You're proud of him, huh? 
SCENE 7 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against the headboard. 
GEORGES Just now, a few minutes ago. 
ANNE So...?? 
GEORGES There's no "So". I went into the bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to get help. 
ANNE Help? 
GEORGES Yes, and then you turned off the tap. 
ANNE Yes. Because you left it on. 
SILENCE 
ANNE (CONT'D) I don't understand. 
GEORGES Neither do I. 
PAUSE. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Don't you think it's best if I call Dr. Bertier? 
ANNE Why? What can he do? 
GEORGES I don't know. Examine you. 
ANNE I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me. 
GEORGES Anne, please!! That's absurd. We can't pretend that nothing happened. 
ANNE But what DID happen? 
PAUSE. 
ANNE (CONT'D) I'm here. I'm having my breakfast, and you're telling me things happened that I don't understand. 
GEORGES Can you explain how the tea towel got there? 
ANNE (IRRITATED) No, I can't! 
GEORGES Who turned on the tap? 
ANNE You did! 
GEORGES Can you remember that? 
EVA (with a little laugh) My God, you know him, don't you? Over the winter, he suddenly discovered his passion for a viola player who'd been in our ensemble for years. What can I tell you? It was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide. That scared him and he came back to me in full remorse. I've got used to it now. What's a bit embarrassing is that the ensemble, you can't keep any secrets from anyone. 
GEORGES Do you love him? 
EVA Yes, I think so. 
Brief PAUSE. 
EVA (CONT'D) What's aphasia? 
Georges gestures that it's too complicated. 
GEORGES What can I say? The carotid artery was blocked. They did an ultrasound scan, two in fact, and they said they had to operate on her. She was scared. She was confused and scared. You know she has always been afraid of doctors. They said the risk was very low and that if they didn't operate, she'd be certain to have a serious stroke. 
EVA And what do they say now? 
GEORGES Just that it didn't go well. It's one of the 5% that go wrong. 
He yawns. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) It's pretty upsetting. 
He looks at his watch. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Usually at this time, I take a nap. My blood sugar is somewhere down in my socks. 
PAUSE. 
EVA I'm so sorry. 
GEORGES Yeah. 
PAUSE. 
EVA What can I do for you? 
GEORGES Nothing. It was nice of you to come despite all of your stress. 
Brief PAUSE. 
She doesn't know what to say. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) No, really. There's nothing you can do. We'll see how things go when she's back here in the apartment. We'll manage. Maybe I'll get a caretaker in, or maybe I'll manage on my own. We'll see. We've been through quite a lot in our time, your mother and I. (LITTLE LAUGH) All this is still a bit new. 
PAUSE. 
The doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the armchairs and then steps in front of her. 
GEORGES Shall I make some tea? 
ANNE (with a faint smile) First come sit with me. 
George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs. 
ANNE (CONT'D) Can you help me into the chair? 
Georges stands back up. 
GEORGES (EAGERLY) Of course. 
He extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm to Georges. 
ANNE It's best if you put my arm around your neck and your right arm around me, that way it'll be easy. 
He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward and clumsy. 
ANNE (CONT'D) Thanks. 
He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "Don't mention it". Then he sits down opposite her. 
LONG PAUSE. 
At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the fact that words do not come easily. After a long while, during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC below. 
GEORGES (softly almost to himself) I'm glad you're back. 
ANNE (in a voice just as soft) Me too. 
Another PAUSE. Then Anne says: 
ANNE (CONT'D) Promise me one thing. 
GEORGES What? 
ANNE Please never take me back to the hospital. 
GEORGES What? 
PAUSE. 
She looks at him. He has understood. 
GEORGES (with a slight smile) OK. 
ANNE Did you buy the new book on Harnoncourt? 
GEORGES I've already read it. 
ANNE And? 
GEORGES Do you want it? I'll get it for you. 
ANNE Sure. 
He goes out of the room to fetch the book. She remains lying there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a while, we hear Georges shouting. 
GEORGES (O.S.) I don't know where I put it. 
ANNE Don't worry. It isn't that important. 
GEORGES (O.S.) Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in the... Just a moment! Viola! Here you are! Nothing like an infallible memory! 
She smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book in his hand. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) I thought I'd left it over there in the other room, but I'd already put it away. Tidy people just can't help being tidy. 
ANNE (taking the book) Thanks. 
She puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges. 
ANNE (CONT'D) Right now, take care of yourself. And don't wait to see how I hold the book in my hand, OK? 
GEORGES OK. 
He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom. She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries to open it. It's not easy for her. 
Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens the book again, and tries to read. 
SCENE 14 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
The superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top of one of the bags and puts it down beside them. Then she takes out the receipt and the change. 
SUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE Unfortunately the strawberries were already moldy. I'll go and get you some fresh ones tomorrow from the market. My husband will bring you the bottled water this afternoon. I'm not supposed to carry anything heavy: my back, you know... 
GEORGES Sure, no problem. 
SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE It came to 76 euros and 40 cents. There's the till receipt and here's your change: 23 euros 60. 
GEORGES No idea. He probably found it amusing. I don't remember. I don't remember the film either. But I remember the feeling. That I was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when I was actually watching the film, and that I just couldn't stop. 
She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food. 
ANNE That's cute. Why didn't you ever tell me before? 
GEORGES There are still a few stories you don't know. 
ANNE Aha...? Don't tell me you're going to ruin your image in your old age? 
GEORGES (GRINNING) You bet I won't. But what is my image? 
She takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. Then she looks at him. 
ANNE (TENDERLY) Sometimes you're a rotter. But you're nice. 
GEORGES (EMBARRASSED GRIN) Can I take you for a drink? 
She laughs. 
SCENE 18 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
He does physiotherapy exercises with her. Counts the repetitive movements of the exercises. 
SCENE 19 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
She's lying on the sofa. He's seated in the armchair. They're both reading the newspaper. After a while: 
ANNE Listen to this! My horoscope. Motto: You have lots of verve, but need to be more serious! Love: High-class conversation is what you need. Work: You're motivated again. But proceed with care. Health: Loosen up by doing exercises. It'll give you renewed pizzazz. 
PAUSE. Then 
GEORGES (GOOD-HUMORED) You've only yourself to blame if you read stuff like that. 
Brief PAUSE. Then: 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's funeral. 
ANNE You have to go. 
GEORGES I fear I must. I don't want to go at all. 
ANNE Who does like going to funerals? 
GEORGES Oh, I know a few people who do. Annette can never wait to get all dolled up again. And François has... 
Then just stands there, at a loss. 
SILENCE. Then 
ANNE (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Forgive me, I was too slow. 
GEORGES Anne... 
ANNE Can you wheel me into the living room? 
PAUSE. 
GEORGES Yes. 
He turns toward her, pushes the wheelchair into the living room between the two armchairs. Turns on the light. Stops beside the switch. They both look exhausted. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) You're always good at surprises. 
ANNE Yes. Why are you home earlier? 
GEORGES I didn't come home earlier. I took a taxi. In August, there isn't a lot of traffic. 
ANNE That's true. How was the funeral? 
GEORGES Anne...! 
ANNE How was it, go on, tell me! 
He thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in an armchair. Looks at her. She raises her head and returns his look. He understands that he can't insist right now. Long PAUSE. Then he begins: 
GEORGES It was rather bizarre. The priest was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's co-workers made a speech that was embarrassingly emotional. His old secretary came with a radio- cassette player and after the speech she put on "Yesterday" by the Beatles. You can't imagine. Everybody turned round to look at her. Apparently, it wasn't planned. His grandchildren were there. Of course they giggled as soon as the music began. Then the urn was put on a huge stretcher that was obviously designed for a coffin, and out we went into the rain. They placed the urn on a small electric cart that crawled along for what seemed like an eternity to the tiny hole they had dug. A lot of people had to stifle their laughter. It must have been terrible for Jeanne. I have... 
ANNE (INTERRUPTING HIM) There's just no point in going on living. I know it can only get worse. Why should I inflict it on us? On you and me. 
GEORGES You're not inflicting anything on me. 
ANNE You don't have to lie, Georges. 
PAUSE. 
GEORGES Imagine you were me. Didn't you ever think something like this could happen to one of us? 
ANNE Of course I did. But imagination and reality have little in common. 
GEORGES But things are getting better every day. We'll... 
SOLOIST No, no, thank you very much. 
GEORGES Hold on, I'll just freshen up the flowers; in this heat they wilt so fast... 
SOLOIST I've only just bought them. They should keep quite... 
But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and closed the door behind him. The soloist looks around him. 
After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in the distance, without understanding what they're saying. It lasts a while. 
Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her wheelchair, into the living room. 
ANNE Martin! What a delight. How lovely to see you! 
The (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite know how to handle the situation. 
SOLOIST Mrs. Laurent! Lovely to see you too. 
ANNE Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself down and don't look so shocked. 
The soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down. Brief embarrassed PAUSE. 
ANNE (CONT'D) I'm so proud of you. We were both in raptures after your concert. Georges wanted to buy your new CD the very next morning. 
SOLOIST Oh God! I wanted to bring you the CD, but I left in such a hurry that I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'll get one today and drop it by. 
ANNE (SMILING) No, no, don't worry. We want to make a contribution to your success. Even if it's only twenty euros. 
SOLOIST You've already contributed so much. I owe you so much, Madame. 
ANNE You owe it to your hard work and your talent. 
SOLOIST (shaking his head a little) Do you remember, when you first gave me the Bagatelles to play? I was twelve at the time, and in my youthful arrogance I said: "But why the Bagatelles?" And you really gave me a piece of your mind. 
They both smile. PAUSE. Then he goes on: 
SOLOIST (CONT'D) So what happened? 
ANNE My right side is paralyzed, that's all. It can happen when you get older. 
SOLOIST And how...? 
ANNE Let's talk about something else, shall we? 
SOLOIST (DISCONCERTED) Sure ... 
Anne is seated on a stool. Georges washes her. 
SCENE 27 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - TWILIGHT 
Georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating. On the radio, we hear the EVENING NEWS. Suddenly, coming from the neighboring room, a LOUD CRASH and the SOUND of crockery breaking. Stifled CRY from Anne. Georges gets up, irritated, crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM. 
Anne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal. 
GEORGES (shocked, and hence furious) Good God, what are you doing? 
He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into the bed. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Have you lost your senses?! I don't believe it! How stupid! 
He points to the broken objects. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Look at that! Did you need to do that? Can't you call me when you need something? 
ANNE (meekly) I'm sorry. 
GEORGES (STILL FURIOUS) Yes, so am I. 
ANNE (SOFTLY) Sorry. 
Georges bends down, and begins to gather up the scattered objects. 
GEORGES The lamp is broken too. 
SCENE 28 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - ANNEX - DAY 
Bathroom. 
Georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. The doorbell rings. 
Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and over to the front door. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Yes? Who's there? 
No answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to HIM: 
ANNE Georges? What's going on? Who is it? 
Georges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened. Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door. 
O.S., in the distance, Anne's worried voice: 
ANNE I don't want that. 
GEORGES What? 
ANNE Geoff doesn't need to come. 
PAUSE. 
Georges doesn't agree, but continues to dress Anne. 
ANNE (CONT'D) I don't need any comments on my predicament. I can only take his British humor in small doses. 
SCENE 31 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Once more the set of physiotherapy exercises. Things are going better. Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing her improvement. She reacts like someone duty-bound, but without conviction. 
SCENE 32 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Close shot: a CD is inserted into a player. As the MUSIC begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to ANNE: 
GEORGES Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur Laurent, it was beautiful and yet sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes that things will get better. With deep gratitude, your former pupil, Martin. 
The MUSIC makes their SILENCE less awkward. Then, after a long while, Anne says: 
ANNE Stop the CD. 
He hesitates, looks at her, then stops the music. They remain SILENT. 
SCENE 33- INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING ROOM - DAY 
They eat. Suddenly, Anne says: 
ANNE (CONT'D) Where are the family albums? 
GEORGES The family albums? I don't know, there, in the other room. Why? 
ANNE Can you get them for me? 
GEORGES What, now? 
Anne nods. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Why, Anne? 
ANNE I'd like to look at them. 
During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed, and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat of the wheelchair. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) It's no big deal. Come on. 
He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes her through the hallway into the bathroom. 
He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Come on, darling. It's nothing serious. Things like that happen.. 
ANNE (SOBBING) I can't... take it any more. 
He holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling helpless. 
GEORGES My love. My darling. 
SCENE 36 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Anne is in bed. She's on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair beside the bed. 
EVA ... thinking about whether it wouldn't be better to invest the money in an apartment block. If inflation gets going again, property is the only sure thing. Right now, savings accounts pay 1.75% at best. Four years ago, Geoff bought some stocks with a small sum of money and the whole thing collapsed. So now we're obviously worried. Unfortunately, in the meantime, other people have had the same idea, and property prices are going through the roof. Since we came back from Scandinavia, I spend all my spare time looking through newspaper ads. 
To put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds: 
EVA (CONT'D) It takes time, that's all. We'll find something in the end. 
Another oppressive PAUSE. 
ANNE (slowly) Yes yes I have... I have... the grandmother... woman with house... not... the house then ... money 
EVA I don't understand you, I'm afraid. 
ANNE ... yes... now... it's all... house sel... sel... sel... was... in two strokes of... so quickly... god it's hard... to say... sell... money gone... left... there too... 
PAUSE. Eva has tears in her eyes. 
SCENE 37 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Georges and Eva's husband, GEOFF, around fifty. He speaks with a British accent. 
GEORGES ... three times a week... I'm not experienced enough. We'll see if that's enough. 
GEOFF How much is she asking? 
GEORGES It's paid by the hour. We'll see. 
Geoff doesn't know what to say. Eva has composed herself somewhat and blows her nose. 
EVA I can't believe that these days there's no way of handling this efficiently. 
GEORGES (CURTLY) No one's stopping you from finding out. 
Eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. Georges follows her with his eyes. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) (PEACEABLY) Believe me, I love your mother as much as you do. So please, don't treat me as if I was a total idiot incapable of doing the obvious. 
EVA I didn't say that. I'm simply questioning whether what I see going on here is the answer to everything! 
GEOFF (TO GEORGES) Don't you want to get a second opinion? 
GEORGES Now you two had better stop, OK? Another doctor did come. He said Bertier was right. From Monday, a nurse will come three times a week. Now can we talk about something else? 
EVA Like what? 
SCENE 38 - INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Georges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff. On the radio, the EVENING NEWS. 
SCENE 39 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an object, as tears flow silently down her face. 
SCENE 40 - INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY 
Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We watch her and listen to her for a while. 
Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano. Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated. 
SCENE 41 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY 
He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close to Anne to feed her her food. 
GEORGES There, my love, I hope you like it. 
ANNE OK... 
He begins to feed her. 
GEORGES I added a little orange juice. I find it tastes quite good. 
She can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running back out of her mouth. He wipes it with a tea towel, continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she keeps her mouth shut. 
She takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up. 
NURSE (CONT'D) Thanks for the coffee. 
GEORGES My pleasure. I'll see you out. 
They both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway, takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on, she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP. 
NURSE You mustn't take it too seriously. Usually they always say something. She might just as well say "Mom, Mom, Mom". It's just mechanical. 
GEORGES (nodding, softly) I know. 
They've reached the door. 
NURSE Goodbye, sir. 
GEORGES Goodbye. 
He closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment, then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP, unaltered, continue. 
Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand, holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP become quieter and finally stop altogether. 
After a long PAUSE: 
GEORGES (CONT'D) (slowly, softly) I'd like to hire a second nurse. The two could take turns. That would make everything a bit simpler. What do you think? 
Long PAUSE. Then: 
ANNE (softly) ...Help...Help... 
SCENE 44 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
They are both lying in bed. Georges SNORES noisily. Anne's eyes are open. 
SCENE 45 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY 
The front door. We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open for him. 
GEORGES Would you mind putting them in the kitchen. 
The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the bags. Georges calls toward the bedroom: 
GEORGES (CONT'D) I'm ba-aack! 
He then follows the superintendent into the kitchen. 
ANNE po ... pont ... sss 
GEORGES ...Sur le pont ... Sur le pont ... 
ANNE ... Ssssur le pont ... 
GEORGES (smiling to encourage her): ... Sur le pont d'Avignon... 
ANNE ... ssur... le .. 
GEORGES ... pont... Sur le pont d'Avignon... (he begins to sing): Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse, on y danse, sur le pont d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en rond... 
He encourages her to sing with him. Starts singing again: 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse, on y danse ... 
Anne tries to sing too, she has a hint of a smile on her face, but she produces only isolated SOUNDS. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) (singing to encourage Anne, accompanied by the sounds that she produces): Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse, on y danse ... Sur le pont d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en rond ... 
SCENE 47 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
A second nurse is doing Anne's hair roughly. The brush sticks in her tangled hair. 
SECOND NURSE ("CHEERY") ... there we are...now we're all beautiful again...so everybody will admire us...there...you see... wait... 
She takes a mirror that she has placed within reach. Holds it in front of Anne's face. 
SECOND NURSE (CONT'D) Well?... What do we say to that? Aren't we a pretty sight? 
Anne, sickened, averts her eyes. Emits a muffled SOUND. The nurse ignores it. 
SECOND NURSE (CONT'D) You'll see, Monsieur will be dazzled by you... 
Furious SOUND from Anne. 
SCENE 48 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The window opening onto the light well is open. A pigeon has landed on the window ledge. 
It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside, onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings. 
We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet. The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its wings, it flutters about the room. 
After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite direction. George follows it. 
SCENE 50 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
He tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping cup. She won't loosen her lips. 
GEORGES ... Please, open your mouth... go on... open it... Anne! Please!... come on... stop that!... 
He sits upright. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) If you don't drink, you'll die. 
Indecipherable SOUND from ANNE. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Is that what you want? 
PAUSE. She looks at him. He bends over her again, presents the cup in front of her sealed lips. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Come on, Anne, please. 
She doesn't react. He opens her lips with his fingers and tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth. Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) (ANGRILY) Goddammit! 
He puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid, some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show his helplessness and his anger. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Anne! ... You can't force me to let you die of thirst. If you persist, I'll call Bertier and he'll put you in hospital. They can force-feed you there. Is that what you want? 
BRIEF PAUSE. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) I promised to spare you that. But you must help me. I'm out of my depth. 
He takes the cup again and puts it against her lips. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Please, Anne! 
Her lips remain sealed. He presses the cup hard against them. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Drink that, now! 
It hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little liquid. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) There! 
She closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) 
The bright light from outside filters through the blinds. 
Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne. Finally, she caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. Anne opens her eyes. Looks at her. No movement. 
EVA It's me, Mom. 
Anne emits a FURIOUS SOUND. 
EVA (CONT'D) (HELPLESS) Can I do something for you? Mom... 
ANNE Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... 
SILENCE. 
Georges has remained by the door. After a while, they both leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the living room. 
Georges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down. 
Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing. 
After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva, vexed, blows her nose. 
Shortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down. 
GEORGES The tea isn't very hot any more. 
Eva turns toward him. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) But it does make you feel better. 
After a short PAUSE, Eva comes toward the table. Sits down. He fills her cup. 
EVA Thanks. 
She takes the cup, drinks. Replaces it. Still can't bring herself to look at him. 
GEORGES It was silly of me to lock the door. I'm sorry. You took me by surprise, that's all. I'm sorry. 
She nods her head, indicating she understands. Finally she looks at him: 
EVA What's going to happen now? 
GEORGES (with a little ironic laugh) What's going to happen now? The nurse comes twice a week, and every two weeks Dr. Bertier and the hairdresser come. That's what you want to know, right? Things will go on as they have done up until now. They'll go from bad to worse. Things will go on, and then one day it will all be over. 
Brief PAUSE.

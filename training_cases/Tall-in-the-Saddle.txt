ON ROCKLIN 
He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually, but loud enough to be heard by the women. 
ROCKLIN I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman. 
INT. COACH - DAY 
THROUGH window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara. The women have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark. Miss Martin smiles vindictively at Clara, who flushes. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the Clerk, who moves to the coach door. 
CLERK Well, I hope you have a nice trip, ladies. 
MISS MARTIN I hope we get there -- wouldn't surprise me if we didn't. 
EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY 
On Dave and Rocklin. 
DAVE (mutters) Wait till I get you on the road, you old buzzard, you'll be surprised all right. 
He takes up the reins and shouts the team away. 
DISSOLVE OUT 
DISSOLVE IN 
EXT. ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY 
EXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in the same direction as the coach. 
EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT OF COACH - DAY 
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach, Dave steals a look at his companion. 
DAVE I wonder why a young feller who don't have to wants to come into this God danged country? 
Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead. Dave glances down toward the women. 
DAVE Say -- did you mean what you said back there about wimmen? 
ROCKLIN (grimly) Every word of it. 
DAVE (chuckling) Then you're smarter than most. 
ROCKLIN Maybe I seen more of 'em than most. 
DAVE (looking at him admiringly) Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be a leetle bit surprised. (reflectively) All the same... 
He breaks off and chuckles again. 
ROCKLIN (unsmilingly) All the same -- what? 
Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail. 
DAVE (offering bottle to Rocklin) Take a slug. 
Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all but empties it in one pull. 
DAVE (holding up the bottle and squinting through it) Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how much alike they are? Both fool you, but you never figger out how to do without 'em. 
Rocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again. 
DAVE Take another. 
ROCKLIN Not just yet. 
DAVE (unoffended) Well... (putting the bottle to his lips) Here's to her. 
ROCKLIN Who? 
DAVE The next one that fools you. 
He empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time, the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over and looks down o.s. 
INT. COACH - DAY 
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Clara and Miss Martin. The former is showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is hanging on grimly. 
EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT - DAY 
Dave straightens up, grinning. 
DAVE (with relish) Mighty rough stretch along here. 
He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little unsteadily in his seat. 
ROCKLIN Like me to speel you a while? 
DAVE Nope. I've had a few snorts but that don't make no difference. Leas'ways, never has... (after a second's pause) Don't ever git wore out, and useless, like me. 
ROCKLIN Who're them as say you are? 
DAVE Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly- aching. Reckon he's entitled to his opinion. But him and me never did see eye to eye. 
ROCKLIN What's wrong? 
DAVE It's constitootional, I reckon. Like that step-daughter of his is crazy -- he's too sane. Believes In law and order. 
ROCKLIN (grinning) What's wrong with law and order? 
DAVE Depends on who's a-dishin' it out. Never was good at takin' orders meself. As for the law -- well, you'll soon find out what that means 'round these parts. 
ZEKE (holding out his arms) Dave! 
DAVE (letting out a yell and rushing to Zeke) Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot! 
CLOSE SHOT 
Zeke and Dave as they beat one another on the back. 
DAVE Whar you been all these months? 
ZEKE Up in the hills workin' my way down the biggest hole you ever seed. 
DAVE Good -- What's at the bottom of it? 
ZEKE Nothin'! 
DAVE (roaring with laughter) What, again!! 
MED. SHOT 
Rocklin has entered and moved to the fire. Miss Martin and Clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at the bar. A pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking man of about 45 (Stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them ingratiatingly. 
STAN Good evening, ladies. How about something to eat? 
MISS MARTIN (with a dubious look toward the pair at the bar) Well -- if it won't take too long. 
STAN (leading the way toward the partition) This way, ladies. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
bar. Dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of "She Was Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage" to an old-type phonograph. 
DAVE Yep -- this is my last trip. 
ZEKE Why? 
DAVE Old Harolday won't take back what he said. 
ZEKE What'd he say? 
DAVE "You're fired." 
They both yell with laughter and slap one another on the back. 
MED. SHOT 
from fireplace. Rocklin is standing in f.g. looking down at the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket dip. Seated at the table are Clara and Miss Martin. From o.s. comes the sound of Zeke and Dave singing to the phonograph record. Miss Martin glares indignantly in the direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest. At this moment Stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in his hand which he dumps on the table. 
STAN There you are, folks. Dig in and help y'rselves. 
Miss Martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish of meat and freezes. 
CLOSE SHOT

table. Clara has filled a plate with food, which she offers to her aunt. 
CLARA Auntie -- 
MISS MARTIN With my dyspepsia? Do you want to kill me? 
Clara hesitates for a second, then looks across to Rocklin. 
CLARA Aren't you going to have any supper? 
ROCKLIN Reckon so. 
He comes to table and begins to help himself. There is a loud burst of laughter from the bar. 
MISS MARTIN Young man, that driver's had all the liquor he can take. 
ROCKLIN Has he? 
MISS MARTIN You know he has. You're not a complete fool, are you? 
ROCKLIN Frequently. 
MISS MARTIN (to Clara, furiously) The rudeness of people in these parts is appalling! 
Clara looks apologetically at Rocklin, then away again nervously. Suddenly, she sees something o.s. and drops her knife and fork with a little start. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
window. A thin, unpleasant-looking face is seen through the glass. The windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower part of the face into a hideous smile. It is the younger of the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel. 
PANNING SHOT 
on kitchen door as Stan comes through with a dish of potatoes. A man's voice is heard o.s. and he pulls up abruptly. 
MISS MARTIN Hold your tongue. (to Zeke, who is gaping at her) And you -- stop staring as if we were monsters. 
Zeke takes it and staggers into the b.g. near Bob Clews. 
DAVE (to Rocklin) Where's Stan? We got to have another drink. 
ROCKLIN He's outside tryin' to explain away a hide. 
DAVE Eh? 
ROCKLIN (indicating food) Seems we're eatin' stolen beef. 
DAVE Somebody's loco. Stan might have given house-room to bit o' dead beef, but he'd never be fool enough to leave the hide lyin' around. (to Zeke) How 'bout it, Zeke? 
Zeke opens his mouth to speak, and slowly folds up, sliding down the wall to the floor. 
MED. SHOT 
as Clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group. 
BOB CLEWS That's the way it is, Dave. 
Dave has gone to Zeke's aid and now peers at Clews closely, recognizing him for the first time. 
DAVE (disgustedly) Oh -- it's you. 
BOB CLEWS That's right -- your old pal Bob Clews. 
DAVE (shoves Clews) Git away from me -- you two-timin' horse thief. 
BOB CLEWS (grinning) Them's fightin' words, pardner. 
Stan and Jackson come from the kitchen. Dave is again picking up Zeke, but seeing Stan, lets Zeke drop. 
DAVE (moving to Stan) Hey, Stan -- don't let 'em hang nothin' on you, you ain't done. They're just a couple of fourflushers -- the pair of 'em, everybody knows that. 
Jackson addresses everyone present with an indulgent Smile. 
JACKSON Crazy drunk. 
DAVE (wheels on Jackson) Mebbe I am drunk -- mebbe that's why I'm tellin' the truth -- I'm drunk an' I'll say what I think -- I'll say what I know. 
Zeke, on the floor, takes up Dave's belligerent mood for a flash. 
ZEKE So will -- I -- (goes out again) 
Jackson goes to Dave. 
JACKSON Don't act up this ways, Dave -- They's women watchin'. 
Clews moves in to Jackson and Dave, and now both men urge Dave toward the door. 
DAVE (attempting to throw them off) Git your hands off me -- 
BOB CLEWS (to company in general) What he needs is a short lay-down. 
ROCKLIN (taking a step forward) I'll lend a hand. 
JACKSON (brushing past him) Me an' Bob'll look after him. We're his friends -- come on, Bob. (as they steer Dave through door) Careful now -- don't hurt him. 
They exit. Rocklin stands frowning a second, then turns toward the table where Stan is making a show of clearing dishes, etc. 
ROCKLIN (quietly to Stan) How are things standin' now between you an' the law? (indicates direction Jackson went out) 
STAN (not wanting to talk about it particularly) All right, I reckon -- (looks at Rocklin; more confidently) I guess this bill of sale -- (indicates it in Vest pocket) -- kinda winded him. 
Rocklin's lips curl in a wise smile. 
ROCKLIN Good thing you saved it. 
Zeke is discovered on all fours crawling around on the floor near the table where the women sit. He seems to be looking for something. 
MISS MARTIN (mystified) What are you doing? 
Zeke turns his hairy face up toward Miss Martin. 
ZEKE Musta been dreamin' -- Thought I was sittin' on a pot of gold. 
STAN (wearily) There ain't no gold here. 
ZEKE (takes it) There ain't even a pot. 
The door leading from the barn opens and Jackson enters followed by Clews a few steps behind. 
ROCKLIN How is he? 
JACKSON Went to sleep soon's we laid him down. (pulling off hat again) Sorry to have a ruckus in front of you ladies. Dave's an ornery old cuss when he gets goin' -- No shape to drive on, I'm afraid. 
MISS MARTIN (this is a fine kettle of fish) Hmmm -- 
JACKSON Don't worry, ma'am. Bob, here, 'll take you on in -- knows every inch of the road -- Don't you? 
BOB CLEWS (grins) You bet. 
Rocklin has been listening intently. 
ROCKLIN I'm drivin'. 
CLOSE SHOT 
of the group, with Clews looking significantly at Jackson, who is obviously checkmated by Rocklin's remark. 
JACKSON (finally speaks) But if anything was to happen to the ladies, I'd feel -- to blame. 
CAMERA PANS to show Rocklin and Dave coming along the boardwalk in front of the saloon. CAMERA PANS them to the swing-doors, which Rocklin pushes open, passing through into the saloon. 
INT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
PANNING SHOT -- SHOOTING FROM BEHIND the bar toward the swing- doors as Dave and Rocklin enter. The bartender (Cap), a lean, tallish man of about 50, studies them as they enter, then turns and calls across the room. 
CAP Hey Doc! 
CAMERA PANS to show a group of poker players seated around a table. This consists of a well-dressed, powerful-looking man of about 45 (Judge Garvey), with a smooth face and an impressive manner; a flashily-dressed young man with a weak face (Clint Harolday); a tough-looking cowboy of about 35 (Ab Jenkins); a pleasant-faced storekeeper of about 50 (Pap Fossler); and a little man with a weather-beaten face and intensely blue eyes (Doc Riding). Watching the game are Sam Haynes and Shorty Davis, the former a townsman and the latter a cowboy. As they all look toward the door, Cap's voice continues. 
CAP'S VOICE Customer -- 
Doc Riding looks quickly toward the door, taking in the situation. 
DOC RIDING (to Haynes) Take my hand, Sammy. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Rocklin and Dave come to the bar. At the same time, Doc Riding comes into shot from the poker table. 
DOC RIDING What happened? 
ROCKLIN Bumped his head. 
DOC RIDING (dryly) I see. (examining the head) Looks like he's going to need a couple or so stitches. (to Cap) Better get him upstairs. 
The bartender looks dubious. 
ROCKLIN (nodding) Okay. You can book me a room, too. 
As Rocklin and Doc Riding begin to lead Dave toward the Stairs. 
DISSOLVE IN 
INT. DAVE'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
TRUCKING SHOT -- starting on big head of Dave, as he lies in bed, with his eyes closed. His head is swathed in a clean bandage. He stirs and gives a little chuckle. 
DAVE (muttering) No laigs. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Doc Riding at the bed and Rocklin beyond, standing in the connecting doorway between two bedrooms. The latter has a face towel in his hands and has evidently been washing up. As Dave settles down comfortably in the bed, Doc Riding closes his bag, nods to Rocklin and moves toward the second bedroom. 
INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- as Doc Riding comes through the doorway from Dave's room. 
DOC RIDING He'll be all right in the morning. 
Rocklin closes door behind him. 
DOC RIDING How about a snort? 
ROCKLIN Don't mind if I do. 
He moves across the room, followed by Rocklin, who throws the towel down on the bed as he passes. For a second, he hesitates as if about to pick up the gun-belt which is lying on the bed. Then, deciding to leave it, he follows the doctor through the door. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- at bar, with Cap Setting up glasses for Doc Riding and Rocklin. He nods to indicate the bedroom upstairs. 
CAP (with a grin) Will he make it? 
DOC RIDING Sure he'll make it. Can't kill off a salty old hairpin like Dave that easy. 
CAP You're right. Reckon Saint Peter must be gitten' mighty tired of dustin' off that doormat for him. (to Rocklin) By the way, how did you say it happened? 
ROCKLIN (stolidly) I didn't. 
CAP (with a slight nod of approval) That's right; you didn't. (casually) Reason I ask is, a couple fellers was in saying how Dave was kickin' up a ruckus up at Stan's place. (to Doc Riding) Sheriff Jackson it was and one of the Clewses. 
DOC RIDING (with a look of distaste) Oh! 
Cap reverts to Rocklin, still casually, but with an undertone of friendly warning. 
CAP Tough customers, the Clewses. 
DOC RIDING Yeah -- don't pay to start something with 'em you don't intend to finish. 
CAP (to Doc Riding before Rocklin can answer) By the way, Doc, they tell me George'll be out again. (to Rocklin, with the same casual air) That's Bob Clews' brother. Jest done a stretch in pen 'tentiary for horse stealin'. 
ROCKLIN They string 'em up for that where I come from. 
DOC RIDING (muttering into his drink) Pity they didn't string him up while they wore about it. 
CAP That's what Arly Harolday was sayin' only this mornin'. (to Rocklin) You ain't met our Arly yet, I reckon? 
DOC RIDING He will, if he stays here long enough. (chuckles) 
CAP Hell-fire in skirts. 
DOC RIDING (raises his glass; grinning) Well, here's now. 
They down the drinks. There is a burst of excited comment from o.s. and they all look around toward the poker table. 
MED. SHOT 
Poker table from bar. The flashily-dressed youngster is raking in the stakes triumphantly. 
CLINT What did I tell you? They gotta be big to beat me! 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Rocklin, his hands outspread, slowly straightens up, rises and backs away. At the foot of the stairs, he turns deliberately and walks upstairs. When he disappears from view -- 
CLINT - WITH OTHERS AT THE POKER TABLE 
Clint breaks the tension, looking from one to the other. 
CLINT No man can run a bluff on me. 
There is a cold silence. 
PAP (finally) He wasn't armed. 
CAP I don't like to tell men how to play cards unless I'm settin' in -- but I mebbe ought to have spoken up. (directly to Clint) That Queen was dead, Clint -- and you know it. 
CLINT (arrogantly) When anybody plays poker with me, they play my game or not at all. 
CAP You can't just go makin' your own rules, Clint -- (starts for the bar -- stops and turns) -- an' if I was you I'd hightail outa here before he comes back. 
CLINT (jolted) Comes back? 
CAP (wearily) He's the kind. 
Cap turns and resumes his trek to the bar. Suddenly he stops before reaching it and is looking up, o.s. 
THE TOP OF STAIRS FROM CAP'S ANGLE 
Rocklin is standing there grimly surveying the situation. As he starts down the stairs... 
THE GROUP AROUND THE POKER TABLE 
They are staring o.s. Clint is very uneasy. And now Rocklin moves slowly into the scene. 
ROCKLIN (with deadly calm) I've come for my money. 
CLINT (nervously pleasant) It's all yours, mister -- Cap, there -- Cap is an old gambler -- he says you were right all the time. 
Clint again looks around for approval, but gets no response. Rocklin comes slowly forward, picks up the money from the table and turns back to the stairs. As he reaches the foot of the stairs, he turns and looks straight at Garvey with a peculiar expression. 
ROCKLIN By the way, Judge -- the name is Rocklin. 
FADE OUT 
INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY 
TRUCKING SHOT -- on a small cracked mirror in which can be seen the reflection of a man shaving. A voice is heard singing, atrociously off key. 
SINGER'S VOICE She was only a bird in a gilded cage... (etc.) 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that the owner of tie voice is Rocklin, who has almost finished shaving. As he scrapes his chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns, then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing the mirror. There is the sound of the door slamming and Rocklin grins. He picks up the boot and goes to the door leading to Dave's room. 
INT. DAVE'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY 
As Rocklin enters, Dave is discovered almost dressed sitting on the bed. Rocklin, glad to see him, smiles and tosses the boot to him. 
ROCKLIN How you feelin'? 
DAVE After that singin'? -- Thirsty. (pulls on his boot) 
ROCKLIN How's your head? 
DAVE (evidently not aware of what happened) Oh -- a mite hungover -- but I'll feel better once I git downstairs. 
He hurries out the hall door. Rocklin, amused at the old coot, starts back into his room. 
INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY 
Rocklin is just coming through the door and sees something o.s., stops and freezes. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bob Clews leaning against the open ball door leading into Rocklin's room. He smiles as Rocklin sees him. 
BOB CLEWS I knocked, but guess you didn't hear me. 
ROCKLIN (closing door to Dave's room) What do you want? 
BOB CLEWS (grinning) Looks like you stirred things up around here last night, stranger. 
ROCKLIN That all you came to say? 
BOB CLEWS No. I got a message for you. (getting no response) From Old Man Harolday. Wants to see you out front. 
ROCKLIN What about? 
BOB CLEWS Maybe he wants to thank you for teaching that pup of his a lesson. 
ROCKLIN (after a second) I'll be down. 
Clews hesitates for a second as if anxious to wake sure he is coming, then, turning, he disappears into the hall. Rocklin wipes the last of the lather off his chin, buckles on his gun-belt and picking up his hat goes out, closing the door. 
INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY 
MED. SHOT -- Dave, at the bar, grabbing a bottle, pours himself a drink which he sinks in one draught. He shudders and repeats the dose. During this, an excited murmur of voices has been heard o.s. Dave turns and looks toward the far side of the saloon and suddenly gapes. 
MED. SHOT - FROM THE BAR 
with Dave in f.g., and SHOOTING TOWARD the street. A group of men, including Cap, the bartender, is gathered round the window looking out into the street. Dave staggers across to them and begins to push his way to the window.

group at window as Dave pushes them aside to get a view of what is happening outside. 
DAVE What's goin' on here? 
PAP FOSSLER Arly Harolday's on the warpath. 
ROCKLIN Don't I? (indicating whiskey with a sickly grin) Why d'you think I need this? 
He sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another. At the same time, the swing-doors open and Bob Clews comes through. AS Rocklin raises the glass to his lips, Bob Clews hits him on the back, causing him to spill the whisky. 
BOB CLEWS Funniest sight I ever seen. 
There is a moment's pause. Then with a slow, grim smile of satisfaction, Rocklin turns and knocks Bob Clews off his feet. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
with Bob Clews on the floor, tugging at his gun. As it comes free of the holster, Rocklin brings his heel down on Clews' wrist, grinding on it with his whole weights. Then, kicking the gun out of reach, Rocklin steps back. Bob Clews sits up, clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth. 
BOB CLEWS (moaning) You broke it! You broke it! 
ROCKLIN Try another trick like that on me and it'll be worse. 
BOB CLEWS I never played you no trick. You broke my wrist. 
WIDER ANGLE 
to include the bystanders. They look at Bob Clews without sympathy. He gets to his feet and stumbles back, collapsing in a chair. 
CLOSE SHOT 
at bar, Dave has taken the bottle from Cap and is refilling Rocklin's and his own glass ecstatically. 
DAVE (gurgling with delight) Oh boy -- has somebody come to town! 
He sinks both drinks quickly and is about to refill them when Cap takes the bottle from him. 
ROCKLIN (to Cap) Where'll I find Judge Garvey? 
CAP He rooms behind his office down the street. Don't usually pull up the blinds till around noon, though. 
ROCKLIN (putting down money) He will this morning. (to Dave) See you later, old-timer...

Rocklin, FROM Garvey's ANGLE as he leaves the Sun-Up and starts toward the Judge's office.

MED. SHOT -- TOWARD door, with Garvey at desk in f.g. The door opens and Rocklin enters. 
GARVEY (effusively) Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right in. 
Rocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to the desk. 
ROCKLIN I understand you were Red Caldwell's lawyer? 
GARVEY (immediately on guard) I was. 
ROCKLIN Know anything about this? 
He takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey. The latter takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. He looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again. Then reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read. 
LETTER -- It reads: 
Dear Mr. Rocklin: 
Glad you have made up your mind to take the job. Enclosed find train fare and $150 advance on wages. 
Yours faithfully, 
J. Caldwell 
MED. SHOT 
Rocklin and Garvey. The latter looks up from the letter completely bewildered. 
GARVEY I don't understand. Job? What job? 
ROCKLIN Foreman. 
GARVEY (gaping) On the "K.C."? (trying to take it in) But -- but why should he want you? 
ROCKLIN Why not? Good foremen don't grow on bushes. 
There is a little pause, with Garvey still bewildered. 
GARVEY (thinking hard) Is that your only motive for coming here? 
ROCKLIN What other motive could I have? 
GARVEY I don't know -- It's just that Red Caldwell was a peculiar man -- had a funny way of doing things. 
MED. SHOT -- Harolday watching from behind the window of his office. Behind Harolday are Julio and Arly. The latter makes a step as if about to move to the door, but Julio restrains her.

ROCKLIN (quietly) Draw a gun and I'll kill you. 
MED. SHOT 
George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole- axed steer. 
INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window. Arly gives an involuntary exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by Juan. Harolday continues to stare frowningly out of the window.

EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY 
MED. SHOT -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him offering congratulations. Dave pushes his way through the crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and Jackson comes into shot. 
JACKSON (to Rocklin) Hey, you! What's this you been up to? 
ROCKLIN I just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours -- same as you did over Dave's here yesterday. 
DAVE (surprised) Eh? 
JACKSON (blustering) I don't know what you're talking about. 
ROCKLIN (calmly) You're a liar! 
He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside blusteringly. 
JACKSON Now you lookee here, young feller. You go on talking that way and you'll find yourself in trouble. 
The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a final shout to Rocklin. 
JACKSON Don't say you ain't been warned. 
Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street. 
MED. SHOT 
as Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move off. 
MISS MARTIN (ignoring everyone but Rocklin) I saw you. I saw you strike that poor man. 
ROCKLIN Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could. 
MISS MARTIN You ruffian, you! 
Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly. 
MISS MARTIN Let me go! (to Rocklin) I knew the sort you were the moment I set eyes on you. You can't fool me! You're nothing but a common adventurer! Come, Clara! 
She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same grim look, enters Harolday's office. 
INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Harolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door, having seen Rocklin approaching. The door opens and Rocklin enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly interrupted. 
ROCKLIN -- Now what was that you were sayin' about Caldwell? 
HAROLDAY You being hired by Red Caldwell only confirms what I'd suspected -- he was getting ready to fight. 
ROCKLIN (trying to get information) Fight? Who? 
HAROLDAY Organized rustling. Well at least -- that's my belief. Red was no friend of mine. Too fond of taking the law into his own hands. But he had my sympathy. He'd been harder hit than any of us. And on top of it all, he lost his foreman. 
ROCKLIN You mean, he quit on him? 
HAROLDAY He was shot -- in the back -- with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got Red. 
ROCKLIN Got any ideas? 
HAROLDAY No -- Except that the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere. (bitterly) Pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance. 
Rocklin realizes that maybe Harolday is trying to throw a curve -- trying to get him to talk. 
ROCKLIN Say -- it don't sound as if it's goin' to be too easy for them wimmen at the K.C. 
HAROLDAY (watching him keenly) Want to go back and work for them? 
ROCKLIN No, sir. And I ain't jumping at this offer o' yours either because I don't hold with working for wimmen. 
HAROLDAY (quickly) Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well don't worry. She won't interfere with you...Rocklin -- I figure we've been losin' cattle over a place called Table Top -- it's the back way into the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route for rustlers -- I'm going to send you up to the line camp -- you don't mind working a lone hand -- do you? 
ROCKLIN (measuring) -- I like workin' that way. 
HAROLDAY (rising and holding out a hand) Good -- be ready to move out this afternoon.

ARLY (over her shoulder to Rocklin) Juan'll show you the bunkhouse. I'll talk to you about your duties in the morning. 
Before Rocklin can speak, she runs quickly up the steps of the verandah and disappears into the house. Leading Arly's Horse, Juan moves out of shot to the left of the ranch house and Rocklin follows.

ROCKLIN How far is the line-camp at Table- Top? 
JUAN Twenty-five -- thirty mile. 
ROCKLIN I'm moving out there first thing in the morning. (as Juan turns and stares) Boss' orders. Care to show me the way? 
There is a moment's pause. Then, what almost amounts to a smile of relief, crosses Juan's face. 
JUAN I will show you.

JUAN (pointing ahead) The trail is straight ahead. You will find the cabin at the top. (turning back to his horse) Adios, Senor. 
ROCKLIN (challenging, but perfectly friendly) Senor Romerez, it appears that you do not like me. 
For a second Juan does not reply. Then, as he speaks, he takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket. Rocklin, his mind on other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch, but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's head of hammered silver. 
JUAN (during the above business) Senor, that is true. I do not like you. 
ROCKLIN Why? 
JUAN (extending the pouch) Permit that I offer you a cigarette. 
Rocklin shakes his head. Juan, having spilled tobacco in a paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own. 
JUAN It is not your fault that your shadow is black. But you will only bring unhappiness to my senorita. I do not blame you, but I fear I must hate you. 
He turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse; then looks down from the saddle. 
JUAN Adios, Senor.

DAVE Yeah. Haulin' freight for ole Pap Fossler. Got a letter here for that crazy galoot, Rocklin. (with a little Wink) From the little Caldwell girl. Seems mighty took up about sumpin'. Made me promise to deliver it personal. (indicates letter)

Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for someone. 
Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder. 
CLINT (turning to Shelley) Have you seen Arly? 
SHELLEY No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly today, but Ah seed her las' night, and she shore was mad. 
To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a whistle. 
ARLY How do you know that? 
TALA I have just now met Dave, and he tell me. -- So now he rides to Table Top.

HAROLDAY Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly. (to Julio as he dismounts) Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my desk. 
Julio exits. 
HAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO 
still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems lost in thought. After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks. 
HAROLDAY Looks like we're going to get that land we've been wanting along the river bottom. 
Arly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues. 
HAROLDAY I didn't tell you -- but I bought the mortgage on the Hardman ranch, and it's due today -- On my way over there now. 
Arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly. 
ARLY Did you send that Rocklin to Table- Top? 
HAROLDAY I did. 
ARLY (furiously) Well, let's get things straight. This place was my mother's -- now it's mine and Clint's -- It's true you've been helping out -- but the way things are going we'll soon be able to pay you back every penny we owe. Meanwhile, I'm running this outfit and I expect to give the orders. 
HAROLDAY You generally do. 
ARLY Why did you send Rocklin up to Table- Top? 
HAROLDAY It seemed to me a good idea -- what with all this rustling going on -- 
ARLY Who'd ever try driving cattle over Table-Top? -- Unless they were crazy. 
HAROLDAY (coldly) I don't agree with you. In any case -- if you must have it -- I'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman's wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman! 
ARLY (dangerously) You take care what you're saying. 
HAROLDAY (very controlled) It's you should take care, my dear. I'm afraid there's one man you can't rawhide into jumping the way you want. You've made a fool of yourself over him once. Better watch out you don't do it again. 
He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah.

INT. CABIN - NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. It is addressed to: 
Mr. Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan. 
DAVE (during the above) Durn funny -- that storm quittin' just about the time I get here. 
ROCKLIN No funnier than you sloggin' through it, just to deliver a letter from a woman. 
DAVE (disgustedly) Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older I get. 
Dave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for biscuits and putting it in the pan. 
DAVE When are we gonna get around to readin' it? 
Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes himself in. 
ROCKLIN Thought I'd wait till mornin' -- might be bad news an' I wouldn't be able to sleep. 
DAVE Well, now that's just what I asked -- but all he said, was that it belonged to a good friend. Then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone. 
ROCKLIN That's when they got him. 
DAVE Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from Stan's place. A bullet in the back an' his pockets empty. 
ROCKLIN How come you never told this before? 
DAVE Who was there to tell? -- Sheriff Jackson? -- Him an' Garvey's thick as thieves. 
ROCKLIN How about what's his name -- Harolday? -- He's no friend of the Judge's, is he? 
DAVE Hates his guts -- sure riles him to see young Clint hangin' onto the Judge's coattails. All the same, I jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open. 
ROCKLIN (after a pause) Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' about -- it don't follow that he killed him. 
DAVE No -- general opinion is that it was rustlers. 
ROCKLIN Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him? 
Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as Dave talks. 
DAVE Looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards, you get the killer. 
ROCKLIN (drinking) Funny tho' -- first the K.C. foreman -- then Caldwell -- an' now these women. 
DAVE Lordy -- you ain't thinkin' somebody might try bumpin' them? 
ROCKLIN (slowly, to himself) I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried already -- (to Dave) Remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way Over from Garden City -- 
DAVE Shore -- you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan. 
ROCKLIN (nods) Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure he'd keep his mouth shut about something. 
Dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly under the large earthen jug of water.

ROCKLIN (nods) It was almost as if -- 
A shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug on the shelf directly above Dave's head. The contents pour down on Dave and he topples over. Rocklin meanwhile has wiped the lantern off the table and ducked. They are both on the floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace. 
ROCKLIN (going to Dave) You all right? 
DAVE (blustering) Will be if I ever get dry. 
Rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two holes drilled by the bullet. 
ROCKLIN Lookit that -- 
DAVE Good Lord -- 
Rocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt -- straps it on. 
ROCKLIN Come on -- 
He opens the door cautiously. Then sneaks out, followed by Dave. 
EXT. OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM 
Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness. 
Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl hoots in a near-by tree. 
The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the corral. Both men re-act. 
DAVE My team. 
Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time from another direction entirely -- and from a distance. 
ROCKLIN That's not your team. 
He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave. 
HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY 
and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal is seen, along with the legs of the rider. 
ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS 
And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent toward the deep blackness of the trees. 
Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- Dave close behind. 
Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires. 
The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night. 
Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin has not moved. 
DAVE Come on -- 
ROCKLIN No use -- he's gone. 
DAVE Mebbe we winged him. 
DAVE (glancing back to the cabin) Fer a man who's got a despise fer wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled up with 'em. 
INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT 
Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching the two headed for the corral. 
Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously.

He pokes a finger through the hole in the crown. Harolday's eyes narrow.

Rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying. 
HAROLDAY What's the matter? Don't you think it was him, then? 
ROCKLIN (slowly) I been figgerin'. Don't seem reasonable Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone... Besides -- how could he have known I was up there -- that soon. And -- George Clews ain't the only one I've run contrariwise to in this town. There's that Mexican, for instance.

Clint looks quickly at Harolday and back at Rocklin with frightened eyes. 
CLINT Not me. 
Rocklin makes no reply. 
CLINT You ain't trying to pin it on me? (his courage returning) 'Cause if you are, you're in for a big disappointment. I was over at the Sun-Up playing poker with the Judge and the rest of the boys till early morning. If you don't believe me, ask for yourself. 
ROCKLIN (after a pause) All right. I believe you. But that don't mean you couldn't tell a thing or two as would help -- if you wanted.

Rocklin makes no reply. 
ARLY Pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me. 
Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may have sprained it slightly in the fight.

Miss Martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.

Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his feet as Dave rushes in. 
Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, crowding the room and the hall. 
Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels over Clint.

With that Rocklin starts swinging the team around. 
ON THE WAGON AS IT SWINGS AROUND AND BECOMES LOST IN THE DISTANT NIGHT 
WIPE 
INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT 
Sammy, the China-boy, is nervously knocking on Miss Martin's door. It opens and Miss Martin is seen slipping a robe over her long Mother Hubbard nightgown, with cap to match. 
MISS MARTIN (impatiently) Now -- what is it? 
Sammy points o.s. -- Miss Martin looks and freezes. 
As she moves down the hall, the CAMERA PANS WITH her until it gets two men standing near the entrance door. 
Now the CAMERA MOVES IN TO A THREE SHOT and we recognize George Clews and his brother, Bob. Bob, his wrist bandaged, takes off his hat at Miss Martin's approach, and George noticing, does likewise. 
GEORGE CLEWS The name's Clews, ma'am -- Mr. Garvey sent us out -- 
BOB CLEWS (eagerly) Said you were expectin' trouble with that Rocklin. 
MISS MARTIN I am. (acidly to George) -- But I'm wondering if you're up to it. I noticed you didn't fare so well with him yesterday. 
BOB CLEWS He was drunk -- 
GEORGE CLEWS (quickly) Yeah -- But I'm sober now. 
MISS MARTIN Well, see that you stay that way. 
EXT. ENTRANCE TO KC RANCH - DAWN 
A wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway. On the gate is a crudely printed weather-beaten sign: K.C. RANCH. Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon approaching. 
THE WAGON PULLS UP TO THE GATE 
Rocklin hops out, opens the gate. Dave drives the wagon through. As Rocklin lets go the gate, it swings closed of its own accord. 
EXT. SHED - KC RANCH - DAWN 
The shed is a short distance from the Caldwell house. Bob Clews is standing at a corner of the shed looking o.s. Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon. 
BOB CLEWS (peering into shed) Hey, George -- George, get up. 
EXT. KC RANCH - DAWN 
The wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods, along the drive not far from the house. It stops now, and the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to get Dave and Rocklin as they leave the team and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight in the b.g. 
INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN 
We pick up Clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat in the dim light of a small lamp. She is fully dressed, and once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top coat which she finds in the closet. She takes the coat and starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret near the door. As she bends over to blow it out, her eyes raise and she freezes. 
MISS MARTIN HAS JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND STANDS THERE STARING ICILY FOR A LONG MOMENT 
Now she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from Clara, and starts forward. 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the two. Clara stands as one under an hypnotic spell. 
MISS MARTIN (in a very low tone) You vile, ungrateful strumpet -- running away in the night, like a deceitful sneak-thief -- 
CLARA (unrestrained) Yes -- I'm running away -- and it's all your fault -- you're the one who's been deceitful and sneaking -- and don't think I don't know what you intend doing. 
MISS MARTIN (very controlled) -- And don't think I don't know what you intend doing. 
CLARA (crying, as she moves away) I don't care -- I'm not ashamed of it -- and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me. 
MISS MARTIN (hardly above a whisper) You little fool -- if you go to Garden City with that man -- you stand to lose everything. 
CLARA (stops pacing) But why? -- Why are you being so secretive? -- If you know something, why don't you tell me? 
ON DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING 
DAVE (nods and mumbles to himself) Yeah -- why don't you? -- 
Rocklin quickly shushes Dave. 
ON MISS MARTIN AND CLARA 
MISS MARTIN (Unmindful of the presence of the men) All right, I'll tell you -- Rocklin is a nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell. And, as nearest of kin, he stands to get everything -- according to the will. Because you are not the old man's niece, but only his grand-niece. 
DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING - ROCKLIN SOBERLY - DAVE WILD-EYED 
MISS MARTIN'S VOICE Rocklin turned up unexpectedly -- 
CLARA'S VOICE And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth all the time? 
MISS MARTIN'S VOICE Yes. 
If Dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst. He spins Rocklin around and speaks in his natural voice. 
DAVE -- And you knew the truth all the time, too -- didn't you? -- No wonder you stuck around -- 
From Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that he is right. 
CLARA AND MISS MARTIN 
Both women are staring dumbly toward the window. Now the realization that she has been overheard staggers Miss Martin. She utters a stifled scream and, seeing Rocklin starting through the window, runs from the room. 
ROCKLIN - JUST INSIDE THE ROOM - TURNS TO DAVE 
ROCKLIN Get in here and take care of her. 
Dave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of Miss Martin. Rocklin is at Clara's side. 
EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN 
Bushes near the house. George and Bob Clews are crouched, watching. 
GEORGE CLEWS Come on -- 
They move out. 
EXT. ROAD BETWEEN SANTA INEZ AND THE KC RANCH - DAWN 
The posse riding hard. 
EXT. JAW BONE CANYON - DAWN 
We see Arly and Julio as they descend a steep embankment toward the raging torrent. They both are riding Julio's horse. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Arly and Julio; Arly seated behind Julio, considerably disheveled and sobbing. 
JULIO (comfortingly) You are crying, senorita --? 
ARLY (lying bravely) No. 
JULIO (knows she is) It is too bad we lose your horse. She was good horse, for sure. 
ARLY If only we make it in time. 
As they move away into a longer shot, a huge boulder comes crashing down the canyon side, across their path, and tumbles with a great roar and splash into the torrent. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Arly. 
ARLY Get down from there before I show you. 
INT. OF WAGON - DAWN 
Rocklin has regained consciousness and listens. 
GEORGE CLEWS' VOICE Now listen, Arly -- this ain't your wagon -- 
ARLY'S VOICE Neither is it yours -- Get down out of there -- before I knock you down. 
Rocklin recognizes Arly's voice. Now he raises himself up over the tailboard and falls out. 
EXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN 
The horses tied in back shy as Rocklin falls to the ground. 
EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN 
Arly, as she takes it and starts toward the rear of the wagon. 
BOB CLEWS - STANDING CLOSE TO GEORGE - WHO IS STILL ON THE SEAT - SEES HIS CHANCE TO GET ARLY AND SLOWLY REACHES FOR HIS GUN 
He no more than gets it out when a knife whirls in from o.s., getting him in the small of the back. 
JUAN 
He sits calmly astride his horse, his gun leveled on George Clews. 
EXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN 
Arly is cutting the rope binding Rocklin. 
ARLY -- And they're headed this way and should get here any minute -- 
Rocklin gets to his feet. Arly notices something shining on the ground where Rocklin lay. She picks it up. It is the tobacco pouch with the steer's head of hammered silver. 
ARLY Where'd you get this? 
ROCKLIN (taking the pouch) That belongs to the man who shot at me on Table-Top -- Dave found it. 
INT. OF WAGON - DAWN 
On Dave's Wrapped form, kicking the wagon tailboard. Arly's head appears between the flaps above the tailboard and as Dave groans and kicks, she takes her knife and slits the rope binding him. 
EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN 
Rocklin has come to George clew and we see him wrest the gun from his hand and yank George down from the wagon seat. Once down, he lets him have a hard right that sends him sprawling. 
ON GEORGE CLEWS GETTING UP OFF THE GROUND AND ROCKLIN CLOSING IN 
They start fighting viciously. Arly rushes in crying wildly. 
ARLY (trying to stop Rocklin) You've got to get away -- they'll be here -- they'll catch you -- 
CLOSE SHOT 
Rocklin. There is but one thought in his enraged mind -- Clews. He tears into him again. 
ON ARLY AS DAVE JOINS HER 
ARLY (frantically) You've got to stop him -- he's got to get away. 
THE FIGHT - AS DAVE AND ARLY FUTILELY ATTEMPT TO BREAK IT UP 
ON DAVE AS HE GETS IN THE WAY OF ONE THAT SITS HIM DOWN 
ON THE FIGHT AS ROCKLIN GETS IN A SUNDAY PUNCH THAT SENDS GEORGE BACKWARD INTO A SHALLOW DITCH OUT OF SIGHT 
ON GEORGE CLEWS LYING UNCONSCIOUS IN THE DITCH 
EXT. ROAD NEAR THE KC RANCH - DAWN 
The posse approaching. 
EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN 
Rocklin, Arly, Dave, Rocklin is about done in from the fight. 
DAVE (anxiously) Come on -- let's git goin' -- 
ROCKLIN (as he walks to wagon) Where's the girl? 
DAVE Back at the house -- 
ROCKLIN We've got to get her. 
ARLY You haven't time -- they're coming -- don't you believe me? -- 
ROCKLIN (to Dave) Come on -- 
Arly's plea goes unheeded and he starts away toward the house on the run. 
DAVE (mutters) Stubborn as an ole mule. (shouts) You're puttin' a rope around your neck -- 
Dave runs after Rocklin. 
ARLY AND JUAN - ARLY CLIMBING HURRIEDLY UP ONTO THE WAGON SEAT 
ARLY Get him -- (indicates Bob Clews) -- out of sight, and follow me. 
Clara tiptoes away. 
EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN 
Arly and Juan, as they watch Harolday approach the house and go to the hall window. 
INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN 
Garvey and Miss Martin. Garvey is still pacing very nervously. He is trying to think of his next move. 
MISS MARTIN If you were to ask me, I think the best thing to do is -- 
Garvey stops and glares. 
GARVEY (irritably) I'm not asking you -- and don't bother me with your silly questions -- we've got to do something besides talk. 
MISS MARTIN (drawing herself up) You mean -- you have to do something. 
Garvey stops and looks at her again. 
MISS MARTIN -- This was all your idea, remember. 
GARVEY (tossing it off) My idea -- that's all you know about it. 
THE DOOR TO CLARA'S BEDROOM 
It is open and Rocklin stands there looking o.s. 
ROCKLIN If there's anybody else in on it -- speak up, Judge. 
ON GARVEY AS HE WHIPS AROUND AND STARES AT ROCKLIN 
ON MISS MARTIN - GAPING OPEN-MOUTHED 
MISS MARTIN Well -- I do declare -- 
She can say no more. 
FULL SHOT 
Rocklin steps away from the door, where Dave and Clara now stand. He has Garvey covered. Dave is pointing his gun, and grimacing at Miss Martin. 
EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE -DAWN 
At hall window -- on Harolday watching. 
INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN 
Garvey is stepping back, in a cold sweat, toward Miss Martin, as Rocklin advances toward him. 
ROCKLIN (to Garvey, quite casually) Talk. 
Miss Martin opens her mouth, about to speak. 
FLASH 
of Dave. 
DAVE (blasting, to Miss Martin) Not you. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Miss Martin. Her mouth snaps shut like a trap. 
THREE SHOT 
Garvey, Rocklin, Miss Martin. Rocklin takes the tobacco pouch out of his pocket. 
ROCKLIN (to Garvey) Ever see that before? 
GARVEY (blanches) No -- it's not mine. 
ROCKLIN Tell me whose it is. 
GARVEY (shaking) No -- no -- I don't know -- 
EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN 
Harolday at hall window. He raises his gun -- he is about to fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the window frame, inches from Harolday's head. He spins around and stares wildly here and there at the darkness. 
GROUNDS AND BUSHES NEAR THE FRONT DOOR - FROM HAROLDAY'S ANGLE 
There is no one in evidence. 
ARLY'S VOICE Drop that gun. 
ON HAROLDAY AT THE HALL WINDOW - STARING HARD - TRYING TO LOCATE THE VOICE 
He drops the gun. Arly and Juan come in to him. Arly has him covered. 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a WIDER ANGLE, getting the front door as it is opened by Rocklin, who evidently heard Arly. 
AT FRONT DOOR 
Arly is prodding Harolday into the scene. 
ARLY (to Rocklin) He was just getting ready to finish you off, through that window. 
INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN 
Harolday is herded inside, close to Garvey and Miss Martin. 
ROCKLIN (almost enjoying this) You seem to like to do business through windows, Mr. Harolday.

CRAIG They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac? 
DAY-DAY Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac. 
They walk over to his black BMW 325i on chrome rims. 
CRAIG This you? 
DAY-DAY (proud) Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up. 
CRAIG Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll. 
DAY-DAY Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh? 
CRAIG This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus. 
MISS HO KYM (O.S.) Hi, Day-Day! 
They turn to spot MISS HO KYM (67), the old Korean lady who lives next door.  She's sitting on her porch nursing a cup of coffee. 
DAY-DAY (speaking louder and slower) Hi, Mulan. 
MISS HO KYM Fuck you, Day-Day.  Who's ya boy? 
DAY-DAY This my cousin, Craig.  He just moved out here from L.A.  Craig, this is Miss Ho. 
Day-Day smiles at Craig. 
MISS HO KYM My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it? 
CRAIG Excuse me? 
MISS HO KYM I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy? 
Craig can't believe his ears. 
CRAIG Yeah, I'm 'bout it. 
MISS HO KYM Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity. 
They all look over at the Joker's house. 
CRAIG What kind of activity? 
MISS HO KYM Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me. 
DAY-DAY How do you know for sure? 
MISS HO KYM I know everything, playboy.  Don't hate, congratulate. 
DAY-DAY I don't have time, Miss Ho, I'll see you later. 
Day-Day and Craig start to walk back to the house. 
MISS HO KYM See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you. 
CRAIG Nice to meet you? 
MISS HO KYM Peace out, Craig. 
INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Day-Day and Craig enter the house.  They still have the furniture from the projects.  Craig looks around.  He spots at a few hanging pictures. 
CRAIG Man, this a cool house. 
DAY-DAY (picking up a picture) Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it. 
Mother's picture: she looks like Day-Day with a wig on. She's smiling and holding the winning lotto ticket. 
DAY-DAY Girl, you supposed to be 1000 feet from my house.  What you doing over here? 
D'WANA What it look like I'm doing?  You can't quit me, I'm pregnant! 
DAY-DAY That ain't my baby! 
Day-Day spots the damage.  He loses it. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) (in disbelief) Oh, my God!  What you doing?! 
Now he's a madman. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) Bitch!  You keyed my car!  I'mma kill you! 
Day-Day charges D'Wana.  She has her pepper spray ready. 
D'WANA I got your bitch right here. 
D'Wana sprays his face orange.  He stops in his tracks; grabs his eyes and screams like a woman. 
DAY-DAY Awwwww.... (staggering) Awwwww.... 
D'WANA I expect you to return all phone calls and take me to lunch today.  I'll be back out here on my break.  Nobody quits me. 
D'Wana runs to her car.  She speeds off.  Uncle Elroy goes for the water hose.  Craig grabs Day-Day. 
DAY-DAY I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy! 
CRAIG Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving. 
Craig puts him on the grass. 
DAY-DAY She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me! 
CRAIG I know, be still. 
Before he can say another word, Uncle Elroy nearly drowns him with the water hose. 
UNCLE ELROY Boy, you got you a little fatal attraction, huh?  I had two or three of them in my day. 
Day-Day is drowning. 
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) Craig, I hope you know how to deal with women better than this fool. 
Craig moves the hose. 
CRAIG That's too much water. 
Now Day-Day is blind and choking. 
UNCLE ELROY Help him to his feet.  Let's get him to the bathroom. 
They get him up and into the house. 
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
They rush Day-Day into the shower. 
DAY-DAY (confused) Hold on.  What you doing? 
Uncle Elroy turns on the cold water.  Day-Day screams.  He tries to get out.  They push him back in. 
UNCLE ELROY Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes. 
DAY-DAY 20 minutes? 
UNCLE ELROY Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes. 
Uncle Elroy slams the door.  Day-Day stands in the shower fully dressed and soaking wet. 
EZAL (cont'd) I can't breathe. 
He rolls off of Ezal.  Relief. 
DEBO Get on. 
EZAL Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that. 
DEBO Get on! 
Ezal hops on the handlebars quick.  They start to ride off. 
EZAL Just don't go over the curb. 
Debo rides over the curb and into the street.  The journey begins. 
EZAL (cont'd) Watch my balls! 
INT. DAY-DAY'S ROOM - MORNING 
Day-Day's room is junky.  Clothes are everywhere.  He's putting on his Pinky's Records and Disc T-shirt.  Craig comes in. 
CRAIG You straight? 
DAY-DAY Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you? 
Day-Day's face looks sunburned. 
CRAIG Just a little. 
DAY-DAY I can't taste nothing. 
CRAIG What's the matter with your girlfriend? 
DAY-DAY Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy! 
CRAIG What? 
DAY-DAY Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing. 
CRAIG Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl? 
DAY-DAY I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life. 
CRAIG Damn, you got a stalker. 
DAY-DAY That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too. 
CRAIG You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D? 
DAY-DAY (very serious) You don't know Baby D. 
He looks at his watch. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) I gotta get to Pinky's before I get fired like you. 
Day-Day exits.  Craig is close behind. 
EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
As they walk out the front door, someone catches Craig's eye. It's KARLA (23), the Joker brothers' fine sister.  She's leaning against the lowrider, looking into her purse.  She waves at them. 
KARLA (friendly) Hi! 
Craig and Day-Day are mesmerized. 
BOTH (waving back) HEY! 
Craig and Karla's eyes meet.  She smiles. 
Craig starts to trot over towards Day-Day.  Day-Day is frantically waving Craig to hurry. 
CRAIG (cont'd) What are you worried about? 
Day-Day's eyes get as big as golf balls. 
DAY-DAY Cheeco! 
Craig turns to see the pit bull "Cheeco" running right after him. 
KARLA Cheeco, no! 
Craig runs right towards Day-Day's BMW. 
DAY-DAY Oh shit, jump! 
They both jump on top of Day-Day's BMW with CHEECO coming up fast.  He's BARKING viciously. 
ACROSS STREET 
Joker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street laughing.  Karla is embarrassed. 
ON BMW 
Craig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is terrified. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) Hey, Joker!  Stop playing, man!  Call the dog back! 
They continue to laugh.  Craig pulls his belt off.  He swings it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the buckle.  The DOG CRIES and runs back across the street. 
The Jokers aren't laughing anymore.  Joker stares at Craig. Craig stares back.  You can feel the tension.  Joker kicks the dog. 
JOKER Get yo dumb ass in the back. 
CHEECO HOLLERS.  Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the BMW. 
DAY-DAY Look at my roof. 
Big dents in the roof of his BMW. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) Man, why you do that?  I told you not to talk to that girl. 
CRAIG Why not?  She was cool with it. 
Day-Day gets into the car. 
DAY-DAY So. 
CRAIG What you mean, so? 
DAY-DAY If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that. 
He slams the door, starts the car and backs up.  Leaving Craig standing there.  He sees Karla walking away.  He looks over at the Jokers.  They're still staring hard.  Craig just looks away and walks into the house. 
INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Craig steps into the house. 
UNCLE ELROY Nephew, you got perfect timing... 
Uncle Elroy is sitting on the couch.  He has a Phillies' Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other. 
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) We about to start a little puff, puff give in this mothafucka.  Are you down? 
Suga is sippin' on a glass of wine.  She moves over, making room in the middle. 
SUGA (patting the couch) Come on, Craig.  Sit down right here. 
Craig does.  Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight. Uncle Elroy licks the cigar. 
SUGA Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here. 
Suga takes Elroy's hand. 
UNCLE ELROY Make yourself at home. 
They both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone.  It's too quiet now.  He grabs the remote and TURNS ON the TV.  Flicks a few channels.  He picks up the blunt and the lighter. 
ON TV 
A public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center. It's SMOKEY! 
SMOKEY (V.O.) Hi, my name is Smokey.  And I'm a bud- head.  But here at the King/Drew Rehab Center, they help you curve your crave for marijuana but still let you get your drank on. 
He lifts a 22 oz. bottle of Olde English. 
SMOKEY (cont'd) (V.O.) It's too hard to stop everything all at once.  So some days they let you smoke, but not drank.  And other days you can drank, but not smoke.  And if you're really making progress, the nurses will get fucked up wit you.  Helping you kick the habit by smoking up all yo shit.  So come down to the King/Drew Rehab Center and put down the joint, but B.Y.O.B., man! 
BACK ON COUCH 
Craig is high.  He's looking at the TV with a slight smile on his face.  It seems like the walls are shaking.  He looks over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic Park.  Plaster falls from the ceiling.  He listens, it's Uncle Elroy and Suga making love. 
UNCLE ELROY (O.S.) Oh, baby, right there.  Right there...bite the nipple, baby.  Bite it! Bite it!  Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come on, baby, get busy... 
His eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud KNOCK on the door. Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move.  The KNOCKING gets LOUDER. 
DELIVERY GUY (O.S.) Delivery! 
CRAIG Hold on. 
Craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area.  The KNOCKING CONTINUES. 
DELIVERY GUY (O.S.) Delivery! 
CRAIG I said hold on! 
DELIVERY GUY (O.S.) Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here. 
Craig stops what he's doing and swings the door open. 
ON PORCH 
The DELIVERY GUY, a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts and a buzz cut, is looking into the house. 
CRAIG Can I help you? 
DELIVERY GUY Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for? 
CRAIG I don't play for no team. 
DELIVERY GUY Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you? 
CRAIG (in his face) Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets? 
DELIVERY GUY Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery. 
He hands Craig a letter. 
DELIVERY GUY (cont'd) Sign here. 
Craig signs. 
CRAIG What is it? 
DELIVERY GUY Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course. 
He laughs and walks off singing the "Good Times" jingle. 
DELIVERY GUY (cont'd) '...temporary layoffs?  Good Times...hustling and surviving... Good Times...ain't we lucky we got'em...' Oh shit! 
EZAL What urgent message? 
DEBO If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call. 
EZAL That ain't gonna work. 
Debo slaps him in the back of the head. 
DEBO Just do it. 
EZAL I don't know the number. 
Smack!  Debo slaps him again. 
DEBO It's on the outside of the building, now pick the phone up! 
Ezal picks up the phone.  He starts to dial. 
EZAL Hello...Yeah, I got an urgent message for a nigga named Mr. Willie Jones. 
Debo slaps him again. 
DEBO William. 
EZAL Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call. 
Ezal hangs up the phone. 
EZAL (cont'd) Man, you better stop hittin' on me for I do you like Craig did you. 
DEBO Let's go. 
Debo and Ezal run across the street to the dog truck.  Debo opens the back and lets all the dogs out.  They run for it. 
DEBO (cont'd) After I get in, close the door. 
Debo is a hard fit.  Ezal stuffs him in there. 
EZAL You too big. 
DEBO Keep pushing. 
Finally he's in.  Ezal gets in and slams the door shut.  Just then, Mr. Jones comes running out the joint with a sandwich in hand. 
MR. JONES Oh my God! 
He gets in and speeds off. 
EXT. CUCAMONGA SHOPPING CENTER - AFTERNOON 
Cars pull in and out of this 12 store strip mall where Pinky's is located. 
INT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - AFTERNOON 
Everything is pink inside this mom and pop record store.  The latest RAP HIT PLAYS in the B.G.  A few people exit the store with bags. 
Day-Day is scanning inventory.  A bud-head by the name of ROACH is on top of the counter with his skateboard. 
ROACH Yo, Day-Day!  Check me out. 
He tries to jump off the counter and land perfectly on his board.  Wrong!  Off the board and on his ass. 
DAY-DAY Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me? 
ROACH I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week. (disappointed) I thought that was it. 
An unhappy CUSTOMER walks in holding a CD without the cover. 
CUSTOMER #1 I can't get jiggy with this shit. (getting loud) Where is the damn manager? 
Day-Day opens it.  A PHONE starts to RING. 
ROACH What is it? 
DAY-DAY Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone. 
Roach skateboards over to the phone. 
ROACH Pinky's. 
Day-Day reads on. 
DAY-DAY It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow. 
CRAIG Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery? 
Day-Day goes for his bank book.  He flips a few pages. 
DAY-DAY 
CRAIG Okay, plan B. 
Day-Day is overwhelmed.  Roach skates back over. 
ROACH That was a girl on a cell phone.  She said she's outside in the parking lot waiting for you to take her to lunch. 
Day-Day looks at Craig.  He runs over to the door. 
OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT 
D'Wana sits in her car with her play sister BABY'D (her name does not fit her body). 
DAY-DAY Oh my God.  That's D'Wana.  And she got Baby'D with her. 
Day-Day locks the door and runs into the back.  Craig and Roach follow. 
CRAIG What's the matter? 
DAY-DAY D'Wana brought Baby'D up here. 
ROACH That the big one, huh? 
DAY-DAY You damn right that's the big one. 
The PHONE starts to RING again.  D'Wana and Baby'D are at the door.  D'Wana is on her phone.  Baby'D starts to knock. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) Craig, go out there and tell 'em I'm gone. 
CRAIG I ain't trying to get in it. 
DAY-DAY You already in. 
The knocking gets louder. 
CRAIG No I'm not. 
ROACH I'll do it. 
DAY-DAY No.  You can't handle a girl like D'Wana. It's got to be Craig. 
AT FRONT DOOR 
They observe the "Yes We're Open" sign. 
D'WANA That white boy said he was in there. 
BABY'D Day-Day, don't make me break this window! 
Craig is peeking out.  He hesitates. 
BACK STORAGE AREA 
DAY-DAY Shit. 
Day-Day makes a run for it.  She spots him ducking out the back door. 
D'WANA He's in there! 
INSIDE STORE 
Baby'D knocks Craig out of the way. 
BABY'D Where is he? 
D'WANA He ran out the door. 
Baby'D gives chase with D'Wana, Craig and Roach close behind. 
EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS 
Day-Day runs around the side of Pinky's Records store.  He stops to see if anyone is coming.  It's Baby'D with the three others trailing.  Baby'D is chasing Day-Day all through the parking lot.  Craig, D'Wana and Roach stop to watch. 
ROACH Haul ass, dude.  Don't stop. 
...and he is. 
CRAIG You better stop running from that girl. 
DAY-DAY Fuuuuuuck -- U! 
He runs back towards his BMW.  The chase continues around his car.  Baby'D is starting to tire. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) I'mma shoot yo' big ass. 
D'Wana watches from a distance.  Craig and Roach are close. 
ROACH (smiling) She moves well for a big girl. 
Just then, out of nowhere, Karla appears behind them carrying a couple of bags.  She taps Craig on his shoulder.  He turns around. 
KARLA Hello, remember me? 
CRAIG Hell yeah, I remember you. 
KARLA I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes. 
CRAIG It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys. 
KARLA I just wanted to give you this. 
She hands him a card with her number on it. 
KARLA (cont'd) If my brothers wasn't so over-protective, I'd have you call the house.  But for now just page me when you get a chance. 
CRAIG Most definitely. 
KARLA Better sooner than later. 
She picks up her shopping bags and walks away.  Over at the chase: Baby'D is winded.  She bends over trying to catch her breath. 
DAY-DAY Baby'D, you're not going to catch me as usual.  So what can we do to end it this time?  What you want?  Another Big Pun CD?  'Cause I gotta get back to work. 
Baby'D looks over at Craig. 
BABY'D Okay, I know what I want this time. 
DAY-DAY Anything you need. 
BABY'D Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up. 
ROACH Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day. 
CRAIG Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend. 
ROACH That's fuckin' poetic, Craig. 
Day-Day is still sad. 
ROACH (cont'd) I know how you feeling.  And if I had my bong right now, I'd let you 'toke 'til you choke.'  Dude, right here.  All out. No lungs.  All I got is this. 
Roach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it. 
CRAIG What's the green stuff poking out? 
ROACH That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite? 
CRAIG Naw, I already ate. 
ROACH Come on, Day, try it.  For moms. 
Day-Day shakes his head.  Craig reaches into his fifth pocket. 
CRAIG It ain't a bong but, wa-la! 
He has the joint from this morning. 
ROACH Wo! 
Roach snatches it. 
CRAIG Hey. 
Craig snatches it back. 
ROACH Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that? 
CRAIG Black magic. 
Day-Day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth. 
DAY-DAY Give me dat.  I'm the one with the problem. 
Roach pulls out a mini-skateboard that's actually a lighter. 
ROACH Weed doesn't solve problems.  It eases the mind, and the soul.  Enjoy. 
He lights the joint.  Day-Day takes a hit. 
CRAIG I didn't think you smoked bud that much. 
DAY-DAY (letting out the smoke) I don't. 
ROACH (taking the joint) I do. 
DAY-DAY Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it. 
ROACH (hitting it good) Sorry, dude. 
CRAIG You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out. 
DAY-DAY Ain't no windows in here. 
ROACH I got an idea. 
He hands the joint to Craig.  Gets up and closes the door. Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner. 
ROACH (cont'd) This is a little theory of mine... it should work. 
He plugs in the VACUUM and TURNS it ON.  He puts the nozzle in Day-Day's face. 
MICHAEL JORDAN Don't nobody go in the bathroom for about 35, 40 minutes. 
Mr. Jones is stunned. 
MR. JONES Hey, you that boy? 
Jordan jumps in his car and he's gone.  Mr. Jones is happy he's just seen Michael Jordan. 
MR. JONES (cont'd) (smiling) Ain't that something, Michael Jordan. 
He walks in the bathroom. 
INSIDE 
Reality hits, it stinks up in there.  Mr. Jones fronds. 
MR. JONES (cont'd) Oh, Michael, that boy better check his drawls. 
He starts to spray. 
EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S PORCH - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sitting on the porch thinking. 
DAY-DAY What we gonna do? 
CRAIG I don't know yet. 
ROACH I know what I'mma do.  Go home and face the music.  My dad is gonna kick my ass for getting fired again. 
He gets on his skateboard. 
DAY-DAY Alright, Roach, see you around. 
CRAIG Sorry about today, man. 
ROACH Yeah, me too.  Later. 
He attempts to jump off the porch with his board and lands dead on his ass once again.  His board continues to roll. 
DAY-DAY Man, sit down.  I can't think with you falling everywhere. 
His board continues to roll into the street.  At this same time, Joker's low-rider rolls by and breaks his board in two. Roach runs to pick up the pieces. 
ROACH My board! 
The Joker Bros. back their low-rider into the driveway.  They have no sympathy.  Cheeco (the pitbull) is in the back yard. He's happy to see them. 
They stroll into the house with three Mexican girls with them.  Joker spots our trio looking. 
JOKER What the fuck you looking at? 
DAY-DAY Nothing. 
ROACH You ran over my board! 
JOKER So what?  It shouldn't have been in the street. 
They disappear into the house. 
BACK ON PORCH 
Craig has a twinkle in his eyes and Roach walks over, pissed. 
ROACH Who the fuck is that, Day-Day? 
DAY-DAY Let it go, Roach, trust me. 
ROACH I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board. 
EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sneaking across the street towards Joker's house.  Craig looks calm.  Day-Day looks nervous.  Roach eats on a piece of baloney. 
DAY-DAY This ain't gonna work.  I'm going back. 
Day-Day tries to turn around.  Craig grabs him. 
CRAIG It's about to work, just come on. 
ROACH (about to bite baloney) What about the dog? 
Craig slaps the baloney out of his hand. 
CRAIG That's what the baloney's for! 
All three kneel down next to a parked car.  Day-Day looks sick. 
DAY-DAY Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's. 
CRAIG What's the B-G's? 
DAY-DAY (holding his stomach) The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself. 
ROACH Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together. 
DAY-DAY Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home. 
Craig grabs Day-Day again. 
CRAIG Look, Day-Day.  If we don't go over there and take a look, this might be the last night you got a home.  Now trust me. 
Day-Day realizes that Craig is right. He takes a deep breath. 
CRAIG (cont'd) Now all we gotta do is find out where the little one put that pump.  Take it and see what's in it. 
DAY-DAY You make it sound so easy. 
CRAIG It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look. 
ROACH Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along. 
CRAIG Well get along with this one. (pushing Roach) Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight. 
ROACH Fuck, what's his name? 
CRAIG Cheeco. 
Roach crawls away on his hands and knees. 
EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Roach sneaks past Joker's lowrider.  He slowly approaches the fence.  No sign of Cheeco.  Roach opens the pack of baloney and pulls out a slice. 
ROACH (nervous whisper) Here, Cheeco.  Chee-co, here boy.  That's a good boy. 
It's pitch-black behind the fence, still no Cheeco. 
PARKED CAR - SAME TIME 
Craig makes a move. 
CRAIG Come on, he should have'em by now. 
Day-Day follows. 
DAY-DAY Hurry up.  He didn't have that much baloney. 
They sneak up to the side of the house.  The MUSIC is BLEEDING THROUGH the walls. 
INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The chrome pump is open and filled with money.  Baby Joker's pulling out the money while Joker sits on the bed counting it.  They stop when they hear CHEECO BARKING. 
BABY JOKER Want me to take a look? 
JOKER No, keep working. 
In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the curtain.  The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye looking in. 
Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt off and two half-naked girls on his arms. 
LI'L JOKER Yo, man fuck that shit.  Do it later. It's Friday, time to party, SA. 
JOKER Close the door. 
LI'L JOKER Not until you come party with us, man. 
Baby Joker looks at the girls, then at Joker. 
JOKER Alright, put it in that drawer. 
Joker hands Baby Joker the money.  He puts it away.  They start to exit the room. 
OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS 
Craig is still looking.  Day-Day is scared shitless.  He's looking for Cheeco. 
DAY-DAY (whispering) What you see? 
CRAIG That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it. 
DAY-DAY Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it. 
CRAIG No, man, just wait. 
Craig climbs in the window.  Day-Day holds his stomach. 
DAY-DAY I got the B-G's. 
ROACH 
... his meat supply is almost gone.  He tries to think fast. Cheeco starts to look for more meat.  Roach grabs the smashed brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco.  He swallows it in one big gulp.  He's looking for more.  There is no more.  Roach smiles.  CHEECO GROWLS. 
ROACH Good boy.  Nice dog. 
CHEECO'S STILL GROWLING.  Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his butt and lets out a slight moan. 
CHEECO'S POV 
Cheeco is looking up at Roach.  He's seeing double, even triple.  Cheeco lays down.  It looks like he's faded. 
ROACH No lungs, baby.  No lungs. 
INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Craig is in.  The bedroom door is cracked.  Craig walks over and shuts the door gently.  He locks it.  Then he creeps over to the dresser.  He pulls out the pump and sets it on the bed.  He opens it, revealing all the bundled-up money packed in.  He starts to stuff it in his pockets. 
OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS 
Day-Day is trying to keep his composure. 
INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS 
The SA brothers are having a good time.  Joker is getting nasty with one of the Girls.  He pulls her by the hand. 
GIRL #2 No. 
JOKER Fuck that. 
Day-Day takes off.  He hops the fence in record speed. 
CHEECO 
...is laying on his back looking through the fence.  He's calm and cool now. 
OTHER SIDE 
Roach is on his back looking through the fence.  He hits a joint and blows the smoke into Cheeco's face. 
ROACH ...like I was saying.  A guy like me, and a dog like you, don't need this bullshit. We need to be in Maui renting jet ski to fat funks in flower shirts.  You feel me, C? 
Cheeco is passed out.  Day-Day sneaks around the corner.  He whispers. 
DAY-DAY Roach...Roach, come on. 
ROACH Where's Craig? 
DAY-DAY He's inside the house? 
ROACH Why did he go in the house? 
DAY-DAY Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now. 
INT. KARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Craig is sweating.  Karla is standing in front of him. 
KARLA You did all this for me? 
CRAIG Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation. 
KARLA Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown. 
CRAIG Why didn't she put'em out? 
KARLA Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us. 
CRAIG I'm sorry to hear that. 
Craig walks over to the window. 
CRAIG (cont'd) Can I get out this way? 
Karla walks up behind him, looking very sexy. 
KARLA I thought you came up here to see me. 
Craig turns around. 
CRAIG I did.  Is that door locked? 
KARLA It's locked. 
CRAIG Make sure. 
Karla turns around to check the door. 
KARLA You so nervous, I already locked this door. 
Craig drops a thick roll of money into her purse.  She shakes the knob. 
KARLA (cont'd) See.  All locked. 
She walks over to him.  They're face-to-face. 
KARLA (cont'd) What's your hurry? 
CRAIG I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me. 
MR. JONES Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day? 
UNCLE ELROY I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them. 
EXT. KARLA'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS 
Craig is about to climb out the window. 
KARLA Next time, page me first. 
CRAIG Okay. 
Craig climbs out the window.  He loses his footing and free falls into some bushes. 
KARLA You alright? 
CRAIG Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later. 
He runs past a sleeping Cheeco and hops the fence.  Free at last.  He's about to run back across the street when he sees the dog truck. 
CRAIG (cont'd) What is he doing here? 
Craig ducks back. 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 
Day-Day and Roach are sitting on a couch looking nervous. The Joker brothers hold guns on them.  The three half-dressed Mexican Girls look a bit scared themselves. 
DAY-DAY Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar. 
ROACH And some rolling papers. 
DAY-DAY ...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing. (to the Girls) How y'all doing? 
They answer -- 
GIRLS Fine. 
DAY-DAY That's good.  My name's Day-Day and this is my friend, Roach. 
ROACH (waving) Hey. 
DAY-DAY Ya'll live around here? 
JOKER Shut up!  Both of you right now! 
DAY-DAY (to Roach) Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up. 
JOKER I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right. 
Joker thinks for a moment.  Then he turns to Baby Joker. 
JOKER (cont'd) (in Spanish) Go check on the money. 
Baby Joker obeys the order. 
LI'L JOKER Here comes Karla, put the guns away. 
JOKER Keep your mouth shut. 
Karla walks back in. 
KARLA Hey, what's going on? 
JOKER Nothing.  What you want? 
KARLA Are you going to take me to see Mom? 
JOKER Take your car. 
CRAIG Yup. 
MISS HO KYM Why for?  Them boys are real player haters. 
CRAIG It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'. 
MR. JONES You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home. 
UNCLE ELROY Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes. 
MR. JONES (rolling up his sleeve) Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills. 
SUGA If ya'll don't come back not in ten minutes, I'mma callin' the po'lice. 
Craig, Uncle Elroy and Mr. Jones are about to go on a mission. 
UNCLE ELROY Wait a minute.  I gotta go get my shit. 
Uncle Elroy runs upstairs. 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Li'l Joker is almost finished duct-taping Day-Day and Roach. Baby Joker holds the AK.  Joker paces the floor.  Day-Day and Roach try to make peace by singing an old "War" song.  Day- Day is serious. 
DAY-DAY & ROACH 'Why can't we be friends?  Why can't we be friends?  Why can't we be friends? Why can't we be friends?'... 
DAY-DAY (still singing) 'I hope my cousin call the C.I.A.' 
Joker throws a BOTTLE against the wall.  It SHATTERS into a million pieces. 
JOKER Shut the fuck up! 
The singing stops. 
JOKER (cont'd) If you don't tell me where my money is, I'mma show you how close we can get. 
DAY-DAY Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all. 
ROACH Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday. 
Joker walks over to Roach and kicks him in the mouth. 
JOKER I'm hearing a lot of talking, but I'm not hearing the right words. 
BABY JOKER Maybe the other guy took it. 
DAY-DAY Why would he take it?  He don't even know you. 
JOKER (thinking) Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea? 
EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Uncle Elroy catches up with Craig and Mr. Jones on the side of Joker's house.  He has a big chrome .357 magnum. 
CRAIG That's a nice piece of heat right there. 
UNCLE ELROY Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing. 
MR. JONES Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick. 
CRAIG Come on. 
They sneak over to the fence. 
UNCLE ELROY What about that ugly dog? 
MR. JONES I got my mase. 
CRAIG He's on the other side, sleep. 
BABY JOKER Cheeco!  Cheeco!  Here, boy! 
No Cheeco.  He continues to a shed in the back yard.  He goes inside and picks up a chainsaw.  On his way out the shed, he's slapped in the face with a "Big Ass Stick."  Mr. Jones is working the handle. 
Baby Joker is out cold.  Mr. Jones stands over him. 
MR. JONES Nigga, you got knock the fuck out. 
CRAIG Yeah, pops! 
UNCLE ELROY Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa. 
MR. JONES The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy. 
He does. 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS 
The terror continues. 
JOKER My little brother went out to get my chainsaw.  I'mma show you what happens to fools who don't tell me what I wanna hear.  You ever see Scarface, mothafucka? 
Day-Day starts to cry.  Roach tries to scream through the tape.  Joker turns to Li'l Joker. 
JOKER (cont'd) Go see what's taking him so long. 
Li'l Joker obeys.  We FOLLOW Li'l Joker THROUGH the house and OUT the back door. 
EXT. JOKER'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Li'l Joker stands at the back door. 
LI'L JOKER Junior?!  Junior?! 
No answer.  Suddenly he spots something over by the shed. It's Baby Joker all ties up. 
LI'L JOKER (cont'd) What the... 
He runs to the rescue.  But right before he gets to him, Uncle Elroy jumps out the bushes and takes him.  "Ronnie Lott Style."  Mr. Jones steps in with the stick.  Craig steps in with the rope, and it's over.  Uncle Elroy's hurt.  It's his back. 
UNCLE ELROY (in pain) My back. 
MR. JONES What's the matter? 
UNCLE ELROY I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn. 
Craig goes to assist Uncle Elroy. 
CRAIG Stretch it out. 
UNCLE ELROY Don't move me. 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Joker is pissed. 
JOKER Where are these fucking guys? 
He storms out the room.  Day-Day and Roach try to escape. They flap around on the ground like a fish out of water. 
EXT. JOKER'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
The back door flies open.  Joker appears with the AK-47 in hand.  He spots Uncle Elroy in the middle of the yard bent over.  He lifts the AK. 
JOKER What you doing here? 
UNCLE ELROY I lost something, nigga.  What it look like? 
JOKER Looks like a dead man. 
UNCLE ELROY Wait a minute!  I live across the street! 
SHERIFF LADY You do? 
UNCLE ELROY Yeah.  Paid cash. 
DAY-DAY They the ones you want. 
EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Red and Blue lights flash through the neighborhood.  Everyone is out their door looking at the action.  The suburbs is starting to look like the ghetto for real. 
Uncle Elroy is bent over. 
UNCLE ELROY When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day. 
DAY-DAY I know.  I'm sorry. 
UNCLE ELROY Sorry, my ass. 
Suga and Miss Ho Kym come running. 
SUGA Elroy, what happen? 
UNCLE ELROY I threw my back, again. 
SUGA Aw, no lovin' tonight? 
UNCLE ELROY Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight. 
SUGA Come on, baby, let's go in the house. 
UNCLE ELROY For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow! 
Everyone is sad. 
ROACH Don't worry, bro, you, Suga, Day-Day and Craig can live with me and my parents. 'Til you get back on yo' feet. 
UNCLE ELROY Thanks, Roach, but I can't accept that. We're moving back to Watts where it's safe. 
DAY-DAY Where's Craig? 
UNCLE ELROY I don't know. 
MR. JONES That boy just don't never learn. 
EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Craig steps out of Joker's front door carrying the chrome hydraulic pump. 
CRAIG I love Fridays. 
He walks past the cops and crosses the street. 
ROACH There he go. 
MR. JONES What the hell is he carrying? 
DAY-DAY Property taxes, and a new candy-apple paint job. 
They greet Craig and all start to walk towards the house. 
INT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - NIGHT 
The "Jefferson's" theme song, "Movin' On Up," PLAYS on the TV.  Uncle Elroy is face down on the floor looking at the TV. Miss Ho Kym walks on his back with her shoes off.  He moans in pleasure.  Mr. Jones eats chicken wings. 
MR. JONES Jump up and down on him. 
MISS HO KYM That's next.

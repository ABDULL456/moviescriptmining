ESCAPE FROM L.A. 
Screenplay by John Carpenter 
DARKNESS 
A pounding, metallic beat begins. Twists of sound in a tightrope rhythm. The snap of a military snare drum. 
SUPERIMPOSE: "1998" 
FEMALE NARRATOR Forces hostile to the United States grow strong in the late 20th Century. 
A DARK TABLEAU - CITY STREET - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 
Graffiti-smeared walls. Fires raging. Automatic weapons fire. Shadowy figures dash through the southern California night. 
FEMALE NARRATOR A great moral crisis grips the nation as social revolution and a breakdown of the criminal justice system threaten society. 
A LINE OF POLICEMEN - NIGHT 
They stand like sentinels. Black uniforms. Battle helmets. Gleaming military assault weapons. Bullet-proof shields with large emblems: the American eagle against a red background, and in bold letters underneath, "THE UNITED STATES POLICE FORCE". 
FEMALE NARRATOR To protect and defend its citizens, the United States Police Force is formed. 
A GLOWING HOLOGRAPHIC MAP 
Of Los Angeles, on the coast of southern California. 
SUPERIMPOSE: "1999" 
FEMALE NARRATOR The population of Los Angeles grows to 40 million. The city is ravaged by crime and immorality. A Presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy the city in divine retribution. 
The map of L.A. now glows a dark red. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES SKYLINE - DAY 
A hot summer's day. Heat ripples distorts the towering shadowing buildings in the dense smog. 
FEMALE NARRATOR An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the Richter scale hits at 12:59 p.m., August 23rd, in the year 2000. 
Suddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion you have ever heard. The buildings begin to shake, swaying wildly. The Bonaventure Hotel implodes, collapses inward in the thudding, slamming freight train of an earthquake. The 4-level Interchange as the Santa Monica Freeway shatters, crumbles, pulling exit ramps, cars, trees, and nearby buildings with it. 
SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS 
Buildings shaking. Streets buckling. Cars rolling, crashing. People running. Gas mains exploding. Buildings convulsing and dropping like tinder against an inferno. 
THE SANTA MONICA PIER 
As the tsunami sweeps in from the ocean, smacking into the shoreline like the hammer of God, plunging us into darkness. 
FEMALE NARRATOR After the devastation, the constitution is damned, and the newly elected President accepts a lifetime term of office. 
HOLOGRAPHIC MAP 
Of the United States. A line tracks along the Mexican border, like the Berlin Wall. 
FEMALE NARRATOR Fearing a massive terrorist invasion from South America, the United States prepares for war. The Great Wall is built along the southern border, cutting off the flow of illegal aliens. 
WHAM! 
A TORCH-LIT LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 
The ruins of L.A. Rubble, smoke, a lethal wasteland. An army of terrifying figures climbs atop a mountain of debris. They raise their weapons into the night sky. 
FEMALE NARRATOR Street gangs, South American terrorists and the criminally insane capture Los Angeles, the once-great City of Angels. 
ZOOM INTO A HOLOGRAPHIC MAP OF L.A 
An unrecognizable L.A. After the big one. Surrounded by water, L.A. is now an island off the new western shore, tilting on the edge of the continental plate. 
FEMALE NARRATOR Now an island on the border of civilization, L.A. is a no-man's land of chaos, anarchy and darkness. 
A red line tracks along the mountainous areas surrounding the island, defining the perimeter of the armed fortress. Police firebases and gun emplacements are indicated in the San Gabriel Mountains. 
FEMALE NARRATOR The United States Police Force, like an army, is encamped in the San Gabriel Mountains. 
ZOOM INTO L.A. 
MALLOY An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to Washington. 
The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes... 
INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER 
From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on top. In the other, a machine gun. 
UTOPIA (to the camcorder) To the American people - it is time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror. 
MALLOY At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out. 
Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation. 
INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY 
Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera. She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage. 
UTOPIA Today is Day One of a brand new world. The days of the empire are finished. (beat) To the President - my father, you know what this is. 
She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it at the camcorder. 
UTOPIA You know what it will do. Unless you abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I will use it - on you. 
CONGRESSMAN Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If something should happen - 
UTOPIA It will be in my hands - and the hands of my lover. 
She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can muster. The others are shocked. 
UTOPIA Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man I've ever known. I'm on my way to his arms. 
She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small hatch in the floor, scrambles down... 
WHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in front of him. 
MALLOY Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how. 
BRAZEN Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time. (hits a button) Somebody else was in there with her. 
AN IMAGE APPEARS 
In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around him. 
MALLOY Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A. 
Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome, charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's on a loop. The image disappears. 
The lights in the cell come up. 
BRAZEN Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences, then tried to erase them. She missed this fragment on the end of her last tape. Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank - and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in. 
PLISSKEN Sad story. You got a cigarette? 
MALLOY Shut up, Plissken. 
PLISSKEN What's the little black box do? 
MALLOY Top secret. Only on a need to know. 
PLISSKEN And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood. 
MALLOY That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back. 
PLISSKEN So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free? 
MALLOY That's the deal. 
PLISSKEN Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A. 
After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and Brazen. He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers. 
3RD MAN If you bring out the prototype, you'll receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States. Just like in '97. Remember New York, Plissken? 
PLISSKEN (looks at him) Who are you? 
MALLOY It's the President, for Christ's sake! 
EXT. POLICE COMPLEX - NIGHT 
Plissken suits up. Submachine gun, handguns, six-guns. He, Brazen and Malloy walk quickly across the complex. 
MALLOY L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule. 
BRAZEN Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south. 
MALLOY Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre. 
EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT 
As Brazen's command helicopter takes off... 
INT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
Plissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype. 
PLISSKEN I'll need to know more about this thing. 
MALLOY Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon. 
PLISSKEN Defense against what? 
MALLOY There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know? 
Plissken shrugs. 
MALLOY Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States. 
PLISSKEN So what does this thing do? 
MALLOY All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m. 
EXT. WALL - ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT 
The Command helicopter lands near a large access tunnel inside the containment wall. 
INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Plissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel. Armed guards stand at the ready. A hatch in the tunnel floor stands open. A ladder disappears down into the darkness. 
MALLOY (points to the open hatch) You're going over by submarine. One-man submersible. Nuclear powered. 
Plissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening. 
PLISSKEN Where do I put ashore? 
MALLOY Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there. (beat) Once you go inside, you're on your own. (beat) You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you? (beat) We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason. 
PLISSKEN So you want me to take her out? (Malloy nods) Is that an order from the President? 
MALLOY Let's just say it's what's best for the country. 
PLISSKEN By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin? 
MALLOY A medical team will be standing by. 
PLISSKEN Not you? 
MALLOY No. 
PLISSKEN Good. 
KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no damage. Malloy laughs. 
MALLOY Thought you might try that. First clip is filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken. 
Malloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken. Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut. 
INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT 
Plissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay. Below him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped like a dart. The submarine's hatch is open. Plissken climbs inside. 
INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT 
Plissken seals the hatch behind him. He has to lie flat on his stomach to operate the sub. He quickly hits various switches and buttons, powering up the cockpit. 
INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM 
They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the freeway. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%. 
EXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads: "SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past. 
INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM 
Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status. 
BRAZEN His reactor's starting to overheat. 
MALLOY Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green, moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%. 
MALLOY (V.O.) Plissken...? 
Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT 
The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object. 
KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the Universal Studios Tour. 
The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future, passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean. It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a million pieces. 
The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls - hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit through tiny cracks in the hull. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - MOVING WITH THE SUBMARINE - NIGHT 
The sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface. 
EXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT 
The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside with a hard thump. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide backwards down toward the water. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing. 
A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the antenna. 
MALLOY (V.O.) Plissken...? 
PLISSKEN I'm here. 
MALLOY (V.O.) Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens. 
PLISSKEN It's history. I gotta go. 
Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the hillside when... 
WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying something huge and rounded at the ends. 
Plissken raises his submachine gun... 
... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit. Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder. Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV. 
PIPELINE Too bad about your boat, man. (Plissken doesn't move) Supposed to be some swells out here tonight. Big ones. (beat) You like to surf? 
AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops. 
SPINAL Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken. 
Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the rain... 
SPINAL Hey, what's going down, Snake? 
PLISSKEN I'm looking for somebody. 
SPINAL Who ain't? 
Plissken pulls out his tracer. It is blipping red, just south of the Bowl. 
SPINAL Say, is it true what they say about Cleveland, man? 
Plissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain... 
SPINAL Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can always shift down and mojo with us anytime. 
EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT 
The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the distance, the sound of thumping music. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT 
Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic. Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads: "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES", "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED" 
One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken. 
CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER 
Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises. 
HIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD 
... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through, cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches... 
The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard. 
Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least none that we can see. 
BLONDE HOOKER It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and I do some celebrating? 
PLISSKEN What's going on? 
BLONDE HOOKER You must be new around here. (beat) You look familiar. Have I done you before? 
Plissken grabs the hooker. 
PLISSKEN What's happening? 
BLONDE HOOKER Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang. Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man 'round here tonight. (whispers) He's gonna take down the police and make 'em kiss his fine ass. 
Plissken lets her go, stares... 
HIS POV - A CADILLAC 
... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels. Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of light and flicking them back into the night... 
Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa. 
Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's moved off... 
Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes, Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of the cycle, jumps on. 
ON THE MOTORCYCLE 
The Mescalito biker turns to react... 
WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the bike, hops up on the seat. 
KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan... 
EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT 
As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the corner. 
He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie. After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm handguns, slipping them into their holsters. 
EXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT 
On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant clangs. 
Plissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then Plissken glances at his wrist watch. 
CLOSE - WRIST WATCH 
Three hours gone. 
Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset... 
VOICE (V.O.) Snake Plissken, right? 
He spins around. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE 
Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Wow! Snake Plissken! 
Map To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio, rises, walks over to Plissken. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'? 
PLISSKEN Where'd they go? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake. 
He searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I've been hearing about you ever since that New York deal back in the 90's. You're one smooth operator. (offers pen and paper) Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's Head, one to Slasher Smith...? 
Plissken grabs him by the throat. 
PLISSKEN Where are they? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings. 
Plissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's forehead. 
PLISSKEN Location. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know. 
Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Nice little gizmo you got there. (whispers conspiratorially) Look, Snake. I've got connections in this town. You need something, I'm your man. 
Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard toward Beverly Hills. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't walk through Beverly Hills. 
Plissken's figure disappears... 
EXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT 
The old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red letters: "QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT" 
Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark Sunset Boulevard. 
EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT 
Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now they are dark, ruined. 
CLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION 
As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie... 
SENTRY (into walkie) Specimen moving west on Sunset. 
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT 
Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive. The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his right. He stops, stares down Sunset... 
Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and footfalls of the patients gets closer... 
PENDEJO BOB Those damn patients are coming back. You'd better climb aboard. 
Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT 
The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle. 
PENDEJO BOB I use the eye and the music to scare em off. They're so whacked out, man, it works great. Chased a whole bunch of em right off the edge there a few months ago. 
He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the passage. 
TASLIMA (she peers over the side) How far down does it go? 
PENDEJO BOB Don't know - never do hear em land. Earthquake opened it up. 
The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel... 
INSIDE THE TUNNEL 
Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL" 
INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered with dust and grime. 
Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children, all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked everywhere. 
The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off. 
PENDEJO BOB I own this whole place. Used to work here in the old days. I was right in this room when the big one hit. What a mess. We were waist high in shit. (turns proudly to them) Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought my whole family, my amigos, down here to live with me. 
TASLIMA Gun runners. 
PENDEJO BOB Hey, it's a living, baby. 
PLISSKEN Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? (looks at Taslima) Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay? 
TASLIMA I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave. 
PENDEJO BOB Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place, Snake. We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man. 
Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to Plissken. 
PENDEJO BOB Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours. 
PLISSKEN Yeah. So how do I get to Venice? 
PENDEJO BOB All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there. 
He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other, carrying crates of weapons. 
PENDEJO BOB Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway. Just follow the signs. Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn left. 
Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the ladder, followed by Taslima... 
PENDEJO BOB Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss. You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime at all. 
EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT 
Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate. Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night. 
Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp. 
TASLIMA The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I don't think it's such a good idea. 
Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move. 
TASLIMA The freeways are dangerous. 
He keeps walking. 
TASLIMA Goodbye, Snake. 
Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as close to 'thank you' as he gets. 
And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hop in, Snake! 
THE UNDERGROWTH 
As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke. 
DELGADO 
Takes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH! 
A GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME 
Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves around a corner... 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs into the front seat. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost burned your ass off! 
Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks. Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally, the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows down to a cruise of 70. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you. 
PLISSKEN Delgado? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time. 
EXT. DARK INTERSECTION - NIGHT 
The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old junked cars out of the way. 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear. 
PLISSKEN Stop the damn car. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE No way. 
PLISSKEN I said pull over. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE All right. Anything for you, Snake. (beat) Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place. 
Plissken lowers the gun. 
PLISSKEN Where is it? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Right over there. 
He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a button on the steering wheel with his finger. 
ON THE DASHBOARD 
A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two- inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat. 
PLISSKEN 
Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air. 
Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel closes up over the barrel. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He lets me use it sometimes. (looks at Plissken) Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot with a fun-gun. You feel it? 
Plissken gulps for air. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Pure mesh, man. 100-proof artery choker. 
Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you down to one inch from death, that is living, man. 
PLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG 
Kicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated streets of Venice. 
UTOPIA You said I could hold it. 
He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected. Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken. 
UTOPIA Who's that? 
CUERVO JONES You never heard of Snake Plissken? 
Utopia takes a couple steps closer, squints. 
UTOPIA He doesn't look like his picture. (frown) I bet he's fake. 
CUERVO JONES Now go get dressed. We have things to do. 
UTOPIA Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved. 
Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia. 
UTOPIA Ooww! 
CUERVO JONES Go on now. Do as I say. 
Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal. 
CUERVO JONES I'm going to show her what it means to be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life. (smiles) Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs love. 
He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close. 
CUERVO JONES You want to hook up with us? Join the revolution? We're all getting out of here tomorrow night. (holds up the prototype) We're gonna rule the world. Come with us, Snake. 
Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares. 
CUERVO JONES No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish it later. So guess what? It's later. 
He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away... 
INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT 
The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken is hurled in. The door slams shut. 
Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado. 
DELGADO You're mine now, Snake. All mine. 
Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone. 
PLISSKEN Shit. 
Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor... 
Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet. Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA- CLANG! 
Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the machetes CLANKS to the floor... 
Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises... 
WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws... 
THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at it in horror, then crumbles to the floor. 
EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT 
The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal. 
Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move. 
TOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL 
It's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the side... 
PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD 
Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it. 
Beat. Beat. 
WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the ground, takes his rifle. 
Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (sound of effect of breaking glass) Shot clock! 
The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A." begins playing on the loudspeaker. 
The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players, JAMAAL, notices Plissken. 
JAMAAL Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland. 
The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand, thumping chests, high-fiving each other. 
JAMAAL Welcome aboard, Snake. 
But Plissken pays no attention. He sees: 
CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA 
Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the court. 
CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA 
Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face. Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has a firm grip on the prototype. 
CUERVO JONES The time is now. We are the strongest. If we go together, the others will come. (beat) We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go together. What do you say? 
Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands... 
PLISSKEN 
Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good, cold eye. 
PLISSKEN Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking it out in trade. I need a favor... 
JAMAAL Sure, Snake. Anything. 
PLISSKEN I need to get across the court now... without drawing attention to myself. 
JAMAAL Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's kick some butt! 
The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken. 
JAMAAL (whispers) You play much pick-up ball, Snake? 
Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end. 
JAMAAL Whatever happens, watch the shot clock, man. 
The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the ball. The game is underway. 
Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover. They go into a set play. 
The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full combat. 
The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him flat. No foul. 
Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones. 
UTOPIA It's that weird guy again. 
Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit... 
Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands! 
JAMAAL Snake! Shot clock! 
THE SHOT CLOCK 
Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2... 
A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly... 
Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn sounds just as it leaves his hand... 
THE BASKET 
Swish. Nothing but net. 
Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously, across the face. 
Utopia reacts to the stinging slap. 
UTOPIA Cuervo...? 
CUERVO JONES You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight. 
UTOPIA I tried... 
CUERVO JONES (in her face) Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. (screams) Understand? (shakes her) Understand? 
UTOPIA Yes... 
He shoves her down the tunnel... 
CUERVO JONES Let's go. 
The others follow them... 
EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT 
As Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the sound of hundreds of helicopters rise. 
CUERVO JONES (looks up) Look, baby. They're all mine. 
POV - THE SKY 
Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs. They are on their way southeast, toward Orange County. 
EXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT 
Looking out at L.A. from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign, and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city. 
ANGLE ON THE TWIN TOWERS OF CENTURY CITY 
They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to the sky. Chopper roar overhead. A group of vagrants cluster around a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building - the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away. Desk, furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space. 
EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT 
Pandemonium. Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in urgent motion. A loudspeaker voice blares: 
POLICE VOICE (V.O.) Full stage battle alert. All personnel to battle stations. 
INT. HALLWAY INTO COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert. 
MALLOY A sky full of enemy choppers on radar. Moving over the city to the southeast. 
A COM Officer rushes up to Malloy... 
COM OFFICER Commander - massive vehicle and troop movement on the ground. All major streets leading to the southeast. 
PRESIDENT What're they doing? 
Malloy looks at the President grimly. 
MALLOY Getting ready to invade. 
PRESIDENT (beat) So where's Plissken? 
DARKNESS 
Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air... 
A huge blue eye opens. Looks around. 
DARKNESS 
Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh... 
DARKNESS 
And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness. 
Plissken's eye blinks. 
PIPELINE You feel those pre-shocks, Snake? 
Pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear of the buggy. He lifts one down and slings it under his arm. 
PIPELINE Could be a big one comin' any minute now... 
PLISSKEN Where's... Cuervo Jones...? 
PIPELINE Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake. 
PLISSKEN Where? 
PIPELINE Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man. 
A thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand... 
PLISSKEN Take me there... 
But he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his knees. Pipeline stares at him. 
PIPELINE You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. (bends down, helps Plissken to his feet) You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up. 
PLISSKEN Who? 
PIPELINE Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way. 
Pipeline points down the canyon to the east. 
PIPELINE She's connected with the Black Cowboys, and they don't take shit from nobody... 
Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly. 
PIPELINE Yo', man. It's a big one. 
And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground. 
Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake. Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in. 
Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls. 
And then suddenly it all stops. 
The booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them continues to slosh about violently. 
PIPELINE Tsunami, Snake. 
His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to Plissken. 
PIPELINE Surf's up big time. 
Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on its way... 
Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands. 
PIPELINE Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda ride. 
Plissken looks behind him... 
POV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI 
Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a thunderclap. 
Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over to Pipeline, kneels down... 
PIPELINE Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get on your board till it peaks. 
Behind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for them. 
PIPELINE Don't lose it, man. You slip off your board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know what I mean? 
The roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon barrel. The tsunami is 100 feet away... 75 feet... 50 feet... 25 feet... It rolls up right behind them... 
PIPELINE Hang on, Snake! (yells) YAAAAAAA!!!! 
THE FRONT EDGE 
Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they disappear under the blackness... 
CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN 
Cuervo Jones' image fills the screen. He addresses the camera, holds the prototype in his hands. 
CUERVO JONES Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have the news media standing by for my coronation. I'm arriving in style. 
PULL BACK from the TV screen to reveal we are in... 
INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT 
Malloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and Police Personnel stare silently at their TV screens. 
BRAZEN He must be bouncing the signal from one of our communications satellites. 
PRESIDENT That means CableNet has already picked it up. This thing's going live all over the country. 
CUERVO JONES (on the TV) It's a brand new day comin' up this morning, and I'm just so proud to be leading the parade. See you soon, putos. 
SSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static. 
A grim silence. 
MALLOY The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President. (the President nods grimly) Shall I begin evacuation? 
PRESIDENT Does he know how to activate it? 
MALLOY Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button. 
BRAZEN What about Plissken? He could still be - 
PRESIDENT Forget him. He's dead. 
MALLOY That may not be true, Mr. President. (beat) He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead so many times I can't count. But he never stays down. 
A long beat. 
MALLOY There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait for Plissken, or surrender. It's your decision. 
The President sighs heavily. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT 
Jammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the Big One. 
The van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship. 
INT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT 
The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship. 
INT. DECK OF SHOPS - NIGHT 
They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable dirt. 
INT. LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
They enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There is light in the room beyond. 
INT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT 
Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool. A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over everything. 
At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns. 
Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us. 
Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'? 
The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice. 
SPINAL (eyes brightening) Hershe - it's Snake Plissken. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you. 
Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the transvestite. 
PLISSKEN Yeah. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Me too? 
PLISSKEN (stares at him hard) We'll see. 
HERSHE Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff? 
SPINAL I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money. 
PLISSKEN The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars. 
SPINAL Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them. 
PLISSKEN Uh-uh. Bluebacks. 
This gets everyone's attention. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Aw, come on, Snake. 
PLISSKEN Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God. 
HERSHE I don't know, sounds thin to me. 
PLISSKEN You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world? 
HERSHE (grim) No, that sucks. (beat) How are we getting out? 
PLISSKEN I don't know yet. 
SPINAL Shit. 
HERSHE You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us. 
Smoke has begun to drift into the pool area. 
MOJO DELLASANDRO (a soft voice) Use the air. 
They look at him. 
MOJO DELLASANDRO They're burning. Santa Anas. The night wind. 
SPINAL What're you talking about, Mojo? 
MOJO DELLASANDRO Death from above... 
EXT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT 
Plissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary. Mojo Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig. The wind whips around them. The hillsides in the distance are on fire. 
They look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the deck. The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig. He bumps up and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro brings him back down to the decking. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I don't know about this thing. 
PLISSKEN Don't like it, don't come. 
SPINAL Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack? 
HERSHE My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy? 
As Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs thumping clumsily into each other. Eddie holds up that small, metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I got an idea, Snake. (shows Plissken the radio) This looks like the prototype, right? 
PLISSKEN Yeah, kinda. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo. 
PLISSKEN If he lets you get close enough. 
HERSHE The wind's up. Let's go. 
The men brace themselves. Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he wants to die. 
Hershe looks over at Plissken and grins. 
HERSHE See you in hell, Snake. 
Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes Cuervo Jones and Utopia. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it! I made it! Wait for me... 
KAWHUMP! 
Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food restaurant - KACRUNCH! 
A beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey Cuervo... 
Cuervo Jones turns to Bivouac. 
CUERVO JONES Would you please kill him for me? 
BIVOUAC My pleasure. 
Bivouac raises his machine gun... 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo, wait! I got news. There's about to be an attack. 
Cuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac. Everyone tenses. Map To The Stars Eddie races over... 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken. 
CUERVO JONES You told me he was dead. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I thought he was, but he came back. 
CUERVO JONES Where? 
Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath, looking like he may faint... 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Oh Cuervo... 
CUERVO JONES (long beat) What? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE (stalling) It's so good to see you again. 
CUERVO JONES Where's Plissken? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE He's... near. 
CUERVO JONES You're stalling, Eddie. (grabs him) Talk, you little gringo! 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE (eyes wide) Cuervo, look out behind you! 
Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him, and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand. At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded. 
Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches. 
CUERVO JONES You've lied to me for the very last time. 
Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The Stars Eddie's face... 
KABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street. 
WHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys dive right down across Main Street. 
KABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover. 
Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it... 
BLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere! 
Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead helicopter when... 
Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo, Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap. 
SERIES OF FAST CUTS: 
Chaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping hellfire from his automatic rifle. 
People running. Explosions. 
Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia. 
The helicopter moves fast now - faster - 
LOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS 
As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a foot - 
Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper... 
THE LEAD HELICOPTER 
As it lifts - five feet - climbing... 
The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's sprinting figure. 
POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN 
See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans out the door. 
HERSHE We're not gonna make it over the fuckin' mountain! 
The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15 feet... 10... Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way... 8 feet... 5... 
The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound, and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging half off the ship! 
On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off into the sky. Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off... 
EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT 
An alarm horn sounds. Everyone is on the move. 
INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT 
A crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving over a grid of L.A. 
COM OFFICER Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's passed into restricted space, heading this way. 
Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances. 
PRESIDENT Is it Plissken? 
Nobody knows. 
COM OFFICER Commander, I'm getting radio contact with the aircraft. 
MALLOY Boost it. 
The COM Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice booming through HQ. 
PLISSKEN (V.O.) Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in. 
PRESIDENT Thank God. 
MALLOY (grabs a radio mike) Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype? 
INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
PLISSKEN (into his radio) Yeah, I got it. 
Plissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie. 
PLISSKE (to Map To The Stars Eddie) Now give me the real one. 
Utopia stares into Plissken's eye. 
Map To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't have it. 
Suddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and pulls out the real prototype. She hands it to Plissken 
UTOPIA Now we're even, Snake. 
Map To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks him in the face. His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment, then he slumps in the seat. 
INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT 
Malloy set up in the staging area for landing. 
Plissken rips out the grappling hook... 
AS BOOM! 
Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the water below. 
Plissken jumps back inside the cockpit. 
UTOPIA Snake, look. 
POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN 
Police battle helicopters thunder toward them. In unison, the police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms. Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water. 
It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and rockets spitting blue-white fire. The pound the living hell out of the enemy choppers. In f.g. Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the wall. 
EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT 
Malloy, the President, Brazen and the rest the Firebase watch as Plissken's helicopter approaches, then zooms right over Rotor City and heads for the distant treeline. 
PRESIDENT Where the hell is he going? 
EXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT 
Plissken's helicopter comes in, lower and lower, into a hover five feet above the ground. Inside, Plissken pulls in all the power he's got. 
PLISSKEN It's taking all the power we've got to hover. 
CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE 
Shows 100% plus power. The helicopter is in a trembling hover. Inside... 
PLISSKEN Jump out. Head for the treeline and disappear. 
Utopia stares at him. 
PLISSKEN Go! 
Utopia jumps out of the helicopter... lands on the ground and takes off running into the darkness. Inside... 
PLISSKEN All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me. We're gonna land. 
Plissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll. Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild. The fuselage jumps and twists in a grinding fury. Smoke and debris fly. The blades snap off... 
FROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE 
Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen, barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank. Fire billows into the cockpit, engulfing Plissken... 
Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire. Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball. 
Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded... 
... as Malloy, the President, Brazen, and a squad of police arrive in vehicles. They slowly get out... 
... as Plissken limps toward them... 
PLISSKEN Where's the anti-toxin...? 
PRESIDENT Give me the prototype. 
Plissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President. 
MALLOY Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real one. 
Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken glances at it lying on the ground. 
Nobody moves. Plissken looks at their faces. 
PLISSKEN Give me the goddamn shot! 
Suddenly everyone begins to smirk. A couple cops laugh. 
MALLOY It was all a fake, Plissken. 
Plissken stares at him. More laughter. 
BRAZEN You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.

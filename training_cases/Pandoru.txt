PANDORUM 
Written by 
Travis Milloy 
DEEP SPACE 
A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling. Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape. A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of cockpit windows come into view as we move closer. Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN. 
BOWER (V.0.) Where were you... when Eden was lost? Like every other kid on my block, I was in the middle of a dream, envious of those who were chosen to be part of mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of the unknown and trying to imagine what only the lucky few would encounter. We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and... 
DISSOLVE THRU: 
INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT. 
Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been suddenly evacuated. Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship. 
BOWER.(V.0.) As the entire world watched in wonder, there were only a few, skeptical of the journey's success. 
(BEAT) Only a few... who would be right. The further we move into the ship... signs of violence appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the bright white paneling and several broken computer screens. The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument between men, panicked rage over-lapping. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic. Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER, a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing in commands with a casual and emotionless nature. Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose as he continues to type commands into the flight computer... heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams. 
TRAPPED OFFICER 
(IN FRENCH) 
STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE! 
GOD NO! The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes, taking a breath of relief. 
TRAPPED OFFCIER 
(IN FRENCH) 
STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL 
DO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING 
TO FUCKING KILL US ALL! The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch. 
TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D) 
(IN FRENCH) 
PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT! Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are launched with a ROAR of micro-jets. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT. 
We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship slowly continues its unaffected course. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his own pod. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. OUTER SPACE 
We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space. 
BOWER (P.O.) Where was I... when I heard we'd lost Eden? Just like every other kid on my block... I was dreaming... of being one who would be chosen to follow. As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass. We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and... 
CUT TO: 
M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP. Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms. CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins. Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort, ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT. 
His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges. THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat. He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath him, collapsing. He yells at the floor. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER Burns are red! Bruises... blue- His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet, muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
PAYTON Aren't they suppose to be here... to wake us? 
BOWER Sir... I don't know where anyone is. PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing around at their darkened surroundings. 
PAYTON Hit the lights, will ya? 
BOWER Ah... we're having some power problems- 
PAYTON Who woke you up? 
BOWER Umm, not sure. It had to have been the flight computer. There's no one here... (off his look) .except us. 
PAYTON Cold in here. BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs. 
BOWER There's no power coming off the main grid. Can't fire any of the... (searching for word) Dynos. Can't even open the doors. PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown. 
BOWER (CONT'D) (off his look) Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where he is. It was empty when I woke up. None of the systems are on-line. Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or why it engaged independently- 
PAYTON Bower . 
BOWER Yeah? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
PAYTON Until I have two coffees you're just gonna have to repeat all this shit, so let's just idle here for a bit. 
BOWER Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you awake. i was... a little concerned. I didn't know what to do if- PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under the arm as they stagger into the wall. 
BOWER (CONT`D) Easy... Lieutenant. Easy. 
PAYTON Coffee? 
BOWER I'm on it. 
PAYTON Good man. BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
PAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name- plate reads: LT. PAYTON. 
BOWER This is you, sir. 
PAYTON How do you know that? 
BOWER 1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir. PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory recovery card inside the locker. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER (CONT'D) it says that the memory loss is only suppose to be a momentary loss that's- 
PAYTON Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma the brain into extended REM, sometimes it can take a while to get it back. PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his forearm, partially obscured from view; FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age. 
BOWER I've been awake for at least an hour and I still can't remember my... anything. 
PAYTON Listen, the last time I crawled out of a hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while to get it all back. BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a wedding ring. 
BOWER What was... your last flight, sir? 
PAYTON 
(BEAT) Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey? Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually. PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) I've gone through this before. I just can't remember why I would agree to do it again. PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a serious tone. 
BOWER Sir? I know this is going to sound strange, but do you even know where we're going? I can remember the training, but... not the mission. Know the procedures, not the... destination. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
PAYTON I figured you'd tell me. 
BOWER Didn't even know the ship's name until I saw it-on the console. For all I know this was another damn training exercise- 
PAYTON Trust me, it's not. if this is a simulation... PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR. 
PUSH IN As he stares at the emblem, it seems memories are returning, a frown hardening on his face. Distant THUMPS snap him from his trance and he pans his flashlight towards the wall. 
THUMP... SCRAPE... THUMP. He nervously pans his light slowly up the wall and across the ceiling. A shiver of uneasiness goes through him as he sits, trapped within the room alone. He tries to divert his fears, turning to the control screen, giving the hand-crank a whirl. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - LATER 
Pitch black. Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, struggle, breath. BOWER pauses, digging for his lamp. He's soaked with sweat, eyes nearing desperation. Pipes are cutting through the shaft on both sides, making his crawl space even smaller and much more difficult. 
BOWER 
(GASPING) Payton? Nothing but STATIC. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER (CONT'D) Payton!? Do you copy!? HEY!? Finally... 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) (filled with static) I'm here. You alright? BOWER rubs the sweat from his eyes, anxiety increasing with his heavy breathing. 
BOWER I dunno. I dunno if I can- I can't tell if I'm going in circles or- There's nothing to- Can't breath- 
PAYTON Easy, pal. Breath easy. Listen to me- BOWER squirms, pushing outward against the walls of the shaft with an increasing panic. 
BOWER I just want... to stand up for God's sakes! Can't breath- 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Calm down. Listen, you gave it a shot. Let's get you back here. 
BOWER Back!? Are you kidding- I can't turn around! I can't even- Do you know how far I've gone!? 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Take it easy- BOWER bangs the wall of the shaft with desperation. 
BOWER I just want OUT of this FUCKING THING! 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK 
PAYTON is helpless, listening as BOWER is heard on the radio starting to FREAK OUT. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PAYTON Bower? BOWER!? Stop it. Stop it! Just listen to me. Put it out of your head. Stop moving and breath. Listen to 
MY VOICE- 
BOWER (ON RADIO) I can't... breath! 
PAYTON Put your mind somewhere else- 
BOWER (ON RADIO) Like WHERE!? 
PAYTON Well... this may not be the best time to tell you, but I got the door open. 
I 
CUT TO: 
INT. VENTILATION SHAFT 
BOWER freezes in shock. 
BOWER WHAT!? Are you fucking kidding me!? 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Yeah. I'm kidding you. BOWER lowers his head with exhaustion and a chuckle. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT'D) There ya go. Now just breath. Easy, pal. Easy. We'll get you through this. We'll figure this out together. Hear me? I do remember something. 
BOWER What's that? 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) My dream. On the way out. Real doozy. There I was at the Rose Bowl game. Naked and everyone was drunk but me. Spent two years looking for clothes. Long fucking Rose Bowl game. BOWER chuckles, his breathing growing more steady. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : 
BOWER Dream like that, sounds like you've got some... guilt issues. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Or just... clothing issues. 
NADIA SHOES! I'll gut your ass- 
BOWER Alright, alright! Take it easy! He begins to remove his shoes and the radio on his belt suddenly CRACKLES with activity. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Bower? You there-? BOWER lunges and they go into a violent spin, crashing over a table. Dishes clatter, gasps and grunts... only glimpses of the fight through the flicker of light. CRACK! BOWER'S hit, sent flying and he looks up to see her silhouette approaching, edged weapon in her hand. 
BOWER Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it! she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting off his forearm. 
BOWER (CONT'D) You crazy fucking bitch- He wields the only weapon he can find... his shoe. And her attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright. BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him. A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the kitchen... gone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BOWER (CONT'D) 
SHIT- He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room, carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer like a welder's torch. His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior, scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out anything hidden. 
BOWER (CONT-D) (under his breath) What the hell is- The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us instantly into darkness. BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one. Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of sharpened metal. The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat and gargled CACKLES. On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris, following NADIA'S path. As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds... 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Is that you!? Bower-- BOWER frantically flips it off as one of the HUNTERS suddenly turns back. 
E WEASEL, a small framed hunter searches the area like a hunting dog, sniffing the spot. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) On closer examination, WEASEL is coated with war paint and decorative scars marking his skin. 
BOWER POV The only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows WEASEL'S face, oddly contorted in the rounded reflection. WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into black. We hear... BOWER'S breath, heightened gasps of fear as he begins to crawl away. 
DISSOLVE THRU BLACK: 
I INT. OFFICER'S QUARTERS - LATER 
I Pitch black. Sounds of the ship surround us along with the occasional FLICKER of LIGHT. A whispered conversation between BOWER and the radio slowly comes into ear-shot as we find him, hidden beneath a console. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) (muffled with static) .with that marking, she's got to be part of the passenger manifest. Possibly a glitch in the LFS support system, a breakdown in the main grid must have woken passengers, instead of the flight crew. 
BOWER But, why would she try to kill me!? She was going to slit my throat! And why would they look like that? 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Look like what? 
BOWER You should have seen these guys. They were... a very fucked up looking gang. Why the hell would they be-- Payton, they were hunting. BOWER gives himself a shiver as he fearfully checks over his shoulder, eyes shifting with fear. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Hunting!? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER They sure-as-shit weren't a welcoming party from the Promenade deck! These guys were... looking to do some damage. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Take it easy- 
BOWER We've got to try to contact the bridge. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) You're assuming there is someone on the bridge. 
BOWER You're not!? We're not the only ones awake. Team Four wouldn't go back to sleep without waking us for rotation. Maybe they're on the main deck? 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. 
PAYTON goes to the doors, coated with desperate scrapes and dents. 
PAYTON If they're in there... why haven't they thrown the security hammer into lock down? Seal and freeze it until the emergency units wake? 
BOWER Maybe they can't. With the systems kicking on and off- Maybe they're flying blind, with no control of the LFS? PAYTON eyes the scattered tools across the floor and the ripped open ventilation shaft. 
PAYTON Either way we can't assume help will be coming. On-board or off. Out here, there is no rescue. There is no turning around. This thing wasn't even built... .to return. He pauses off the involuntary memory relapse, looking to the I computer screens, taking in the thought. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER What are you talking about? PAYTON glances across the control console, nodding with more memories returning. 
PAYTON This is no regular transport. We're not out collecting data off the belt or hauling cargo... we are the cargo. It was a single launch trajectory for... That's as far as his memory allows, his words trailing off. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OFFICER'S QUARTERS - CONT. 
ANGLE ON In the foreground, there is a small fish tank, completely dry with a tiny fish skeleton laying on the bottom. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. 
PAYTON spins the hand-crank, allowing the computer screen to glow brighter. He quickly works the keyboard, pulling up a diagram of the ship. 
PAYTON (INTO RADIO) Alright. I'll lay out a path for you and see if we can by-pass the main security doors. 
BOWER (ON RADIO) Guide me to where? 
PAYTON Back toward the flight decks. Back to me. 
BOWER (ON RADIO) I'm not coming back to you. What good would that do? I can't open that door from the other side-- 
PAYTON What chance have you got out there on your own? We'll figure out a way to breach the command bridge- A power surge sends a SHUDDER and FLICKERING LIGHTS past... 
FLICKER CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDOR - CONT. 
The same shudder of FLICKERING LIGHTS passes BOWER as he looks down the endless stretch of corridors, pondering. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Bower...? 
BOWER Listen... if you can get me to the reactor bay. I can... reset the reactor's cycle. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) You know how to do that? 
BOWER 
(MASKING UNCERTAINTY) Yes. If I can... we can take control of the ship. Open the doors, lights, get on the bridge. You got a better suggestion? 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. 
PAYTON'S fingers slide across the blueprints, jotting down hatch numbers and markers leading to the REACTOR BAY. SOUNDS are heard in the walls... THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. PAYTON is too focused on the job at hand to acknowledge them. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDOR INTERSECTION - LATER 
The flashlight emerges from the dark as BOWER reaches an intersection, checking the marker and gasping for breath. 
I BOWER 
(GASPING) Third crossing. Marker D-5381-X. 
PAYTON Okay. Hold up. I don't want you to go too far down that lane. Just catch your 
BREATH AND- 
BOWER 
(GASPING) I don't need a rest. Which way? 
PAYTON I don't know vet. Hold on- BOWER backs to the wall, nervously scanning the corridor, struggling for breath. In the background a SHADOW moves at the end of the corridor. 
I Feeling uneasy, BOWER slowly backs into a nearby compartment. 
I FOLLOW THRU: 
INT. INFIRMARY - CONT. 
BOWER looks across the wreckage of what was once an infirmary, slash marks and battle scars from bladed weapons. Through the wreckage he spots... what appears to be a WINDOW. The haze of outer space and an odd-colored MOON are visible. 
BOWER (under his breath) Eden. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CH.A.MBER/CONTROL DESK 
PAYTON suddenly leans forward in his chair, memory sparked. 
PAYTON What did you say? 
I 
NO! PLEASE!! AAAERRGH! BOWER hits him in the gut, knocking the air from his lungs. SHEPARD crumbles, wheezing for air, going silent. 
BOWER 
(ANGERED WHISPER) I'm not gonna hurt ya! Just shut the hell up! I'm gonna get you out of this thing. But, you have to be quiet, understand? SHEPARD'S gaze is hollow and disturbed, deeply traumatized. BOWER pulls on the wire that's rigged to the hydraulics of a nearby doorway, SHEPARD moans. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) Bower, you sure that's a good idea? He 
COULD BE- SNAP! The wire snare snaps free and SHEPARD goes to the floor gasping. BOWER kneels over him to help, but SHEPARD erupts with a shriek, like a hyper-sensitive rape victim. 
PAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT'D) Watch yourself! BOWER hesitates, the flashlight reveals SHEPARD'S identification tattoo through the ripped uniform and blood- soaked bandages. It reads; FLT//006//017 
BOWER He's... team six. The unit that's suppose to follow us. He's- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) As BOWER tries to wipe away blood, SHEPARD erupts again, trying to scamper away from his touch. 
BOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT'D) Quiet! I'm not gonna hurt you! SHEPA.RD begins to moan, mumbling and weeping as he rubs circulation back into his limbs with nervous laughter. 
BOWER (CONT'D) Hey? You with me? You're gonna be alright. Hear me? Squinting past the glare of the flashlight, SHEPARD notices BOWER'S clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin. He begins to weep, tears of joy and agony. 
SHEPARD Shepard, Thomas L. Team Six. Sector Eight. I think I'm the only one, sir. I knew it. I knew you'd be coming. 
BOWER Huh? 
SHEPARD Where's the rest of your squad? 
BOWER Squad? My Lieutenant and I were the- 
SHEPARD Where's the shuttle? 
BOWER Shuttle? What are you talking about? SHEPARD'S expression drops. 
SHEPARD Aren't you the... retraction team? The 
RESCUE- 
BOWER No, no. Hold on. I'm from this crew. I'm from Team Five. SHEPARD'S face goes pale, eyes going hollow. His demeanor slowly begins to shift. 
SHEPARD You... just woke up? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BOWER six... maybe eight hours ago. I had to crawl all the way from the upper deck 
THROUGH THE- SHEPARD seems bitterly impatient as he quickly begins gathering his tool's off the floor. His eyes watch the end of the corridor, now he's in a hurry. 
SHEPARD So... you don't have a fucking clue to what's happened? Is that it? 
BOWER That's what we're trying to figure out! Tell me- what happened!? 
I SHEPARD (chuckle of disgust) You know as much as I do. 
BOWER I don't know anything. 
SHEPARD You'll fit right in. i SHEPARD feels along the pipes until he finds one leaking oil. He vigorously begins to rub the oil onto his body. 
BOWER What are you doing? 
SHEPARD Get the scent off. 
BOWER What ! ? SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a screwdriver into his hand. 
SHEPARD I can't help you. I'm sorry. 
BOWER Help.me? Wait a second- 
SHEPARD They go off scent and sound as far as I can tell and they're a lot fucking stronger and faster they you'd think. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : (4) 
SHEPARD (CONT'D) When they come... run. Don't look back, no matter what. 
BOWER They- Who the hell are they!? 
SHEPARD I can't wait for you. BOWER is bewildered as SHEPARD poised like a sprinter, preparing to run. 
ANGLE ON HUNTERS step up to the edge of the shaft, looking down to see the flashlight fall from sight... 
ANGLE ON BOWER swings back, grabs the wall and freezes. 
ANGLE ON The HUNTERS hear the flashlight HIT the bottom of the shaft and then slowly double back. Torches fading. 
ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP BOWER'S face fills with blood as he hangs upside down, trying to catch his breath. His grip is weakening as he looks up to see... a shadowed FIGURE crouched with a spear in hand, leering at him from the shadows, approaching. With no time to defend himself and no where to go... 
SCREECH! The cable is violently tugged from above, jerking BOWER upward, pulling him away from the wall. He spins wildly trying to grab back onto the wall as... 
SCREECH! The cable yanks BOWER upwards with enough force to hit the ceiling and swing toward the open shaft. His fingers claw at the wall as he's literally being reeled in like a fish. He sees the FIGURE charging with a bladed spear. He's knows he's done for and... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) SNAP! The wire is slashed, BOWER breaks free hitting the floor as the cable is jerked up and out of sight. 
ANGLE ON The silhouettes of the HUNTERS on the ledge, several levels above, inspect the loose cable and after a HISS, they turn back, fading into the shadows. BOWER lays on his back, squirming in the tangled wire as the FIGURE hovers over him, spinning a bladed weapon in his hand. 
BOWER (CONT' D ) Please... don't- Please, listen- The FIGURE slashes BOWER'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and looks at his identification tattoo. BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the light with a curious frown. TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing. Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full- framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes. 
TANA..KA Japanese- No Subtitles 
BOWER What...? 
TANAKA Japanese- No Subtitles 
BOWER I don't understand. I- I don't speak- TANAKA jabs a finger into the emblems on BOWER'S uniform. 
TANAKA Japanese - No Subtitles 
BOWER I'm sorry. I don't- Do you... speak English? 
TANAKA Japanese- No Subtitles They share a nod and an awkward silence, BOWER still eyeing the razor sharp weapon in his hand and not wanting to move. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BOWER Thanks. Thanks for... that. TANAKA is dead pan. BOWER flinches as TANAKA picks up the energy gun and then... flips it over, handing it back to him. BOWER cautiously accepts as he climbs to his feet. 
TANAKA Japanese- No Subtitles 
BOWER I'm sorry. I don't... 
TANAKA Japanese- No Subtitles 
BOWER I don't know what you- TANAKA jabs the emblem on his uniform and presents his own 
F identification tattoo that reads: AGR//812//673. 
TANAKA (matter of factly) Japanese - No Subtitles. 
BOWER You're with... agriculture!? Jesus... Listen, I'm not- TANAKA jabs the emblem on BOWER'S chest, taps his tattoo. 
TANAKA 
(BLUNTLY) Japanese- No Subtitles 
BOWER Yes! I know! I'm with the flight crew! But, I don't know what's happened! I 
CAN'T- Another jab. 
BOWER (CONT'D) 
(BITTERLY) 
I'M NOT IN CHARGE HERE!! 
I Realizing louder doesn't mean clearer, BOWER sighs at his own idiocy. TANAKA nods, but with obviously no clue what was 1 just said. They stare at one another in silence. TANAKA hands him a flashlight. BOWER does his best charades, gesturing to himself and pointing to the ship. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
BOWER (CONT-D) Listen, I'm going to find out what went wrong... with the ship. 
TAANAKA Shee-ip? 
BOWER Yes, I'm going to the reactor to try to- 
TANAKA Ree-actoh? 
BOWER Right. It doesn't really matter- You should stay put. Or go back to your compartment sector- Wait for the security systems to engage. Okay? We're gonna take care of this problem. Dead pan. 
BOWER (CONT'D) As long as we understand each other. They head out of the room as... NADIA watches from the shadows with a curious frown. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
BOWER and TANAKA head down the corridor, both of them checking their backs as they come to a sealed doorway. TANAKA is still wincing, rubbing his chest with pain. 
TANAKA 
(BITTERLY) Japanese- No Subtitles 
BOWER Yeah... well no sympathy here. She left me with a few sore spots too, pal. They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them with a frown. 
BOWER (CONT'D) Listen, lady. We don't want any- 
NADIA 
(SOBERLY) Who the hell are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER Huh? 
NADIA You're... part of the flight crew? 
BOWER Yeah. I'm... a corporal, I'm- 
NADIA I didn't think there was any flight crew left. What's happened to us? 
BOWER That's what I'm trying to figure out. Malfunction of some sort- 
NADIA Gee, you think? Where are you going? 
BOWER I'm heading for the reactor bay. 
NADIA You just wake up? 
BOWER Just joining the program already in progress, yeah. She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised. 
NADIA You'll never make it. 
BOWER Oh yeah? And why is that? 
NADIA You're going the wrong direction. She grimaces and turns, heading back up the corridor. BOWER and TANAKA exchange a look. BOWER chases after her. 
BOWER Hey? Wait a second- HEY? 
NADIR SSSSH! Keep it down- 
BOWER Hold on. Who are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
NADIA Nobody. 
BOWER Wait- Can't join the team without a name. 
NADIA Team? Why would I want to join? 
BOWER Because I need you to show me the way. 
NADIA To the reactor? No thanks. Don't like going that fax down. No one ever comes back. She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm. She yanks away from his touch, squaring off, weapon in hand. 
BOWER Hold on. Please- There's not much time left before we lose everything onboard. You understand what I'm trying to- 
I NADIA Do you know where this ship is headed? 
BOWER I'm working on it. 
NADIA Can you fly it? 
BOWER Huh? 
NADIA Can you fly it... if you have to? 
BOWER 
(NOT SURE) Sure. NADIA eyes him over, sizing him up. 
NADIA Ecological Development, Embryonic Charter. Livestock and wildlife re- population. The rows of glass tubes are labelled, ranging from mountain goats to octopi, everything a new world would need. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : NADIA checks a few gauges on the wall of tubes and makes adjustments on the monitoring system. He senses her meticulous care for the material. 
BOWER You've been living in here? You're... protecting it? 
NADIR It' seems to be the only living thing left on this ship worth protecting. Regardless of the situation, we still have a mission. We've only lost about thirty percent of the specimens, mostly reptilian class. Never was big into snakes anyway. BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted graph of the new planet, TANIS. 
BOWER (under his breath) Tanis. 
NADIA (off his look) You couldn't remember? 
BOWER No, I- I didn't remember just how far away it is... until now. This was a hundred and twenty-three year flight. NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag. TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination, tapping the tubes to see movement inside. 
BOWER (CONT'D) How could I have forgotten that? 
NADIA It comes only in pieces. Even after a few months. I know everything about this vault and its systems... but I still can't remember where I grew up. Or my brother's name. Only pieces... And the training comes back first. For good reason, I guess. BOWER eyes the darkened computer terminals, portions of the consoles coated in algae. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BOWER How could we have become like this... in only eight years? NADIA ponders the thought, rotating her jaw. She digs into her supplies and tosses him a small block of orange material. 
BOWER (CONT'D) What is this? 
NADIA Dehydrated meatloaf. House special. I save 'em for the weekends. BOWER sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a piece... hard as a rock. 
NADIA (CONT'D) Do you know how long it would take to turn dehydrated meatloaf into that? 
BOWER How long? 
NADIA I don't know, but it takes more then a couple years to turn coal into fucking diamonds. 
BOWER You think we've over slept? 
NADIA This ship was built to outlast our children's children... and any engineer could tell ya the warranty is running out. I think we've been asleep longer then you may think. BOWER tosses the orange brick. to TANAKA and he sniffs it with a grin, breaking off a piece. NADIA finishes gathering tools and she slings the bag over her shoulder, "ready to go". 
BOWER Do you have a radio? 
NADIA (shaking her head) Who the hell is there to call?

INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER 
PAYTON is asleep, seated on the floor, back to the wall. He is awoken by... 
RATTLE... THUMP, THUMP! He instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight. The "SOUNDS" are closer then ever before as something is heard crawling towards the panel in the ventilation shaft. 
ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP A vent panel lightly RATTLES, the metal begins to bend. 
PAYTON You want in? Come and get it you fu- The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor. PAYTON raises the pipe, preparing to fight and... A desperate gasp is heard from inside the shaft. 
GALLO (O.S.) Help... me! PAYTON pauses, angling the light inside to see... GALLO, a young flight officer, boyish innocence, short-cropped hair, heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes. His hair is dark brown, the only person without pure white hair. 
PAYTON Who the hell... are you!? GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl out, trembling with fear and exhaustion. 
GALLO Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew! I'm- Please- HELP ME! PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He digs into the shaft grabbing GALLO'S hand, pulling him out. GALLO collapses onto the floor, crumbling into a fetal position, naked. His hands are locked in claw-like grips, trembling uncontrollably. His gasps are rapid and unsteady. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PAYTON Easy... Easy. You're all right. PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water. As he turns back he notices GALLO'S hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood. PAYTON kneels over him and GALLO spasms from his touch. 
GALLO 
PAAARRRGH ! 
PAYTON EASY! I'm here to help you! PAYTON lifts the bottle to his lips, but the water runs down his face, GALLO is frozen in shock. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) Com'on. Try to drink a little. Here. GALLO is unresponsive, wide eyes locked in a trance. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) What's your name? Huh? Can you hear me? 
PAYTON To make sure you're... alright. You... passed out. You- 
GALLO Who the hell are you? 
PAYTON Payton... Lieutenant Payton. 
GALLO Lieutenant? You're... a lieutenant? 
PAYTON That's right. You're Team Four? You're suppose to be... my predecessor. GALLO deepens his frown, glancing around with disorientation. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) You said... you came from the bridge? GALLO shifts his eyes back on him, a bad topic. 
GALLO 
(LEERY) Yeah. So...? 
PAYTON Where are we? I can't get guidance off this system and I have no idea where- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GALLO I don't know. 
PAYTON Well, what did you see? How did-- 
GALLO Listen, I'm not a navigator. Stars all look alike. I don't know! How the hell would I know!? Sensing GALLO is about to break down again, PAYTON tries a calmer approach. 
PAYTON Easy. I just want to make sure... GALLO'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) .you're okay- GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket, defensively. 
GALLO I'm fine. PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the dried blood still splattered across his legs. 
PAYTON Is this your blood... Corporal? 
GALLO Some of it is... sir. 
PAYTON Whose blood is it? GALLOholds his stare, jaw muscles tightening. 
GALLO They didn't give me any choice. 
PAYTON Who didn't? 
GALLO There was something wrong with them. 
PAYTON i Something was wrong with who? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) Off his stare, he understands the implication. 
PAYTON (CONT' D ) Your crew? 
GALLO It was... Pandorum. (off his look) Of the worst sort. They were- I couldn't even- I had to defend myself. 
PAYTON Pandorum. Both of them-? 
GALLO You don't believe me? 
PAYTON 
(UNCONVINCED) I believe you. PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid case; inside is a pistol-gripped syringe. He turns back and GALLO squares off, clenched fists. 
GALLO What are you doing? What is that? 
PAYTON It's just a sedative. Help you relax- GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture. 
GALLO Then you take it... and relax. PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside. 
PAYTON Take it easy. We're on the same team here. Alright? 
GALLO 
(FLATLY) Sure, Lieutenant. PAYTON turns back to the control console and continues his search across the radio frequencies. He discreetly pulls the pipe weapon closer to his seat. GALLO holds a hollow stare on the back of his head.

BOWER Captain? Where!? 
LELAND Umm, up on B-Deck. Some on C. A few pieces on the promenade and I think his nuts are in the foose-ball game in the rec room. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He smiles, revealing several missing teeth. No one laughs. 
LELAND (CONT'D) Tough crowd. Com'in, com'in. Grab a bunk. Three singles or will a queen do? LELAND laughs to himself, digging through supplies. BOWER scans the walls, seeing no way up to the catwalks. 
BOWER Why don't you come on down so we can meet properly? 
LELAND Oh, no-no. No-can-do. I'm real touchy to the dust bug and who knows where yawl have been. No offense. There's something funky going around. But don't let that spoil the party. Here... LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items, using a wire to drop it to them. TANAKA sniffs it with suspicion. 
I LELAND (CONT'D) It's Kosher. BOWER peeks through one of the valves, turning to NADIA. 
BOWER Where do you think we are? 
NADIA I don't know. Gotta be somewhere below B- deck. 
LELAND Why, where you gotta be? 
BOWER The reactor bay. Know where it is? 
LELAND Reactor? Now why would you want to go down there?

INT. WATER PROCESSOR - LATER 
A small propane flame is lit. LELAND hovers over a make- shift stove, heating a can of water. He pours in some powder and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef preparing fine cuisine. 
LELAND It's tough to properly season with a motor oil base. But if you use your imagination, kinda tastes like... 
(SIP) Herb and garlic dog shit. Below the catwalks, TANAKA has found a spot to rest, NADIR is using water to clean a wound and BOWER is peering through a slit in a vent. 
BOWER How long have you been awake? 
LELAND Mmmm. Lemme think. What's today, Tuesday? That would be about, mmm... He counts in his head and across his fingers, carefully calculating, then a grin. 
LELAND (CONT'D) No idea. He turns back to his make-shift stove, chuckling to himself. 
LELAND (CONT-D) I quit counting after the band broke up, ooooh twenty... thirty years ago. BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The classical music begins to SKIP and without even looking LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music. 
LELAND (CONT-D) Then again, an hour in this place feels more like... one-fifteen, one-twenty. Know whatta I mean? HA-HP_W! 
(SOBERLY) Not naming names but I'm writing a very strongly worded letter to the airline. LELAND chuckles, nodding to TANAKA. TANAKA glares. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LELAND (CONT-D) But I just treat each day like it's Christmas. Festive and violent. Let's eat; Shall we? Who needs a bib? LELAND sets several bowls of soup into the bin and lowers it to them with the cable. T_ANAKA is the only one interested, sniffing the soup with a glare. LELAND winks. BOWER takes a seat, showing exhaustion and defeat. 
BOWER Those things out there. Could it have been something... that crawled out of your lab? Something that- 
NADIA No. That's... not possible. 
BOWER Then something got on board. Some kind of life form. Something that- 
NADIA Or something that was already on board, with us in the hyper-bunks. 
BOWER What does that mean? 
NADIR it could have been the accelerator. 
BOWER What? 
NADIA It's the only theory I can come up with. The synthetic enzyme in our feeding tubes. The accelerator that would help our bodies adjust and adapt to the environmental conditions on Tanis. From what I've seen... these things have adapted... to the ship instead. 
BOWER But, why would- You're saying we'll become like them? Why would they be affected like that and we're not- 
NADIA I don't know. Like I said, it's the only theory I can think of- Unless...

GALLO Wiped away. We ran a full sweep off the grid and they were... gone. One day there, the next... nothing. 
PAYTON In one day... it had to be nuclear or-? 
GALLO Whatever it was, they knew it was coming. Wished us well. We're all that's left. PAYTON sits back in shock, shaking his head in disbelief. 
PAYTON Oh my God... 
GALLO You can see why I was hesitant... to tell even you. My fellow crew members didn't take the news too well. I wanted to wake the primary crew... but my 2nd Lt was already over the edge.

LELAND (CONT`D) Refused to go to bed, stayed up to play in his room. Oh, and what naughty little games he would play with the slumbering prey. Slayer, master, both God and the Devil, some would say. The boy would grow to manhood, a self-proclaimed King, ruler of his vessel, home to his own sin. The sketches show the lone pilot torturing and devouring passengers from their sleep chambers as he grows old. 
LELAND (CONT-D) And then one day the king cast out all those who had behaved, exiled into the barren cargo holds to fend for themselves... scavenging against the others within their own domain. The sketches show tortured victims forced out into the corridors of the ship, the King returns to his sleep chamber. 
LELAND (CONT`D) King Lonely no longer wanted to play... he yearned to see the morning Sun on a Tanis day. He returned to his bed of

NADIA You don't know that for sure! 
BOWER I know... NADIA grabs him with rage, glaring him in the eye. 
NADIA 
DON'T DO THAT! DON'T GIVE UP ON ME! Off her look, BOWER holds his stare, slowly seduced by her will. They look is broken by... LELAND'S stereo system CRACKLES with static, power slowly returning after the power surge, music playing. BOWER snaps out of his daze, turning to LELAND.

BOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT`D) The ship is dying and I think that's why it finally woke us up. The entire system is heading into permanent shutdown and there will be no return. This entire ship will float off into eternity with no way of stopping it. We need to reset it. Are you hearing me? PAYTON and GALLO share a silent stare. 
PAYTON I hear you. How do we get you in there?

A flashlight beams cut into a shaft. It appears as if the gang is crawling backwards toward us, until our perspective realizes they're crawling down a long ladder. They reach the bottom level where a distant RUMBLE has grown louder. They follow the sound through a field of debris to a clear path leading to an open hatchway. BOWER checks the marker over the door and leads them down the corridor, preparing to step through and TANAKA grabs him, pulling him back. 
BOWER What? TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and through a hole, hidden in the paneling.

As they head across a loading dock, the room gradually grows more disturbed and dishevelled. Battle scars and centuries of wear and tear grow more and more evident as they cross. The BLUE GLOW of light can be seen through the passageway and a low RUMBLE grows louder as they approach. They crouch behind a large industrial condensers to catch their breath. I BOWER glances up to the surface of the condenser with a frown and he touches it with his fingers to find an odd-colored algae. He looks up to see it's grown all the way to... Be freezes to see a small shadowed FIGURE in the rafters above them, a smaller gargoyle-type silhouette, possibly some type of guard outside the entrance to the reactor bay.

CONTINUED: They exchange silent gestures and TANAKA heads one direction as BOWER heads the other... to corner it. The FIGURE begins to move across the rafter as TANAKA flushes it out. The FIGURE is forced to climb down, hopping to the floor, BOWER waits with his gun raised. Out of the shadows steps... A ten-year-old CHILD HUNTER. BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow. NADIR lowers her weapon. 
NADIA 
(DEVASTATED) Oh... my... God... The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of I skin. Everyone is too stunned to react except for TANAKA, who instantly raises his weapon, preparing to kill it. 
NADIA (CONT-D) stop it! STOP IT! Are you crazy? It's just a child! 
NADIA What are you doing? What is it? 
BOWER 
(DAZED) These were... family members of flight personnel.

NADIA How do you know for sure? She could be- 
BOWER She's not on this flight. She wouldn't come with me. She wouldn't marry me. (sigh of disgust) That's why I came. There was nothing left for me there. She stayed on Earth. Gone... with everyone else. And I left because of her. His gaze begins to gloss over, taking it all in. 
NADIA Well, then... she saved your life. BOWER frowns on the thought, slowly nodding in agreement. His eyes look to the label of the chamber he was led to, the label reads; M. PAYTON. He mumbles to himself, memory returning. 
BOWER Marianne. 
NADIA you... knew her? 
BOWER I remember her. Payton's wife. 
NADIA Who's... Payton? 
BOWER I remember her. I remember- His eyes pull focus, coming out of his daze, memories returning with confusion.

GALLO I'mï¿½saying... once it's done. We're done. But, we still have a way out of this... before it's too late.

GALLO We can still launch ourselves in the pods. Before the ignition systems are completely dead, sir. 
PAYTON Launching ourselves... into deep space when we don't even know where we are? We wouldn't last more then a few days inside those things. That's suicide-

He follows their eye-line to see the entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them. HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS. BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING one of the HUNTERS directly in the head. TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a hatch, coated with vines and vegetation.

HEFLIN goes limp, dropping to the floor dead as TANAKA gasps... looking down to see the damage has been done, blood flowing heavily. He takes a breath, turns to exit FREEZING to see... the CHILD HUNTER standing alone, sensing the death of HEFLIN with almost an expression of sorrow. TANAKA lowers his weapon and... THWACK! The CHILD stabs TANAKA in the chest with a small bladed weapon. TANAKA gasps with shock, collapsing to his knees, eyes wide before going to the floor. The CHILD begins to feed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR 
BOWER and NADIA climb to a cat-walk only to see HUNTERS are following their trail. They run to a ladder and spot LELAND already climbing above them. 
BOWER Go... GO! GO! Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with HUNTERS close behind. He gives them a look before closing the hatch and latching it. 
NADIA You snake bastard- OPEN IT! 
CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDOR - CONT. 
With the YELLS muffled under the hatch, LELAND runs towards an open door at the far end of the long corridor. 
ANGLE ON Inside the door at the far end... PAYTON is at the control console, quickly typing into the keyboard. He hears the E hatch CRACK open and he spins to see GALLO, out of the pod, with a twisted grin, holding the pistol-gripped syringe. 
GALLO We both know who needs this shot... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PAYTON counters with the bladed weapon. 
PAYTON 
STAY BACK- 
GALLO Who's the one suffering... sir- 
PAYTON 
I MEAN IT! PAYTON lunges with the weapon, RAGE in his EYES as... GALLO jabs with the pistol-syringe, they lock hands, grabbing one anothers wrists... slamming into the wall. Upon IMPACT with the wall, GALLO suddenly appears slightly older, his voice lowering in level. 
GALLO Corporal... PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older. 
GALLO You think God survived? He's gone... with the rest. There's no one left to judge you, Bower. NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of sludge. 
BOWER Judgement will come for you. You think you could cover it? Your victims survived. Evolved. That's your creation out there. Your crime. BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force. 
BOWER (CONT'D) And you thought you'd be able to hide it? Who would ever suspect that? Who would ever remember? I remember. NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the darkness. The time-code display rolls faster, decades into centuries... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
GALLO No world left. No law. No order. Only us. You the law now? You gonna be the one that brings order to what's left? Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best with what I was given. Wanna be King for a day? Give it a whirl, Corporal. I'd like to see how you fare. With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised- A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck. 
GALLO (CONT`D) Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself for five minutes without morality. I'll bet you'd surprise even yourself, kid- 
BOWER Shut-up. 
(TO NADIA) What's out there? NADIA shakes her head, rubbing away the sludge from the glass, squinting harder. 
GALLO Imagine... us both. What's left to stop you? I offer you the kingdom and you- 
BOWER 
SHUT-UP- 
GALLO There's still quite a few sleeping beauties down there... a thousand flavors. You up for a little window shopping? 
BOWER Shut-up! 
GALLO (licking his lips) I wanna see it. I'll bet you'd be a 
REEEEAL TIGER- BOWER suddenly shoves him out of the chair, slamming him to the floor, jabbing the barrel into the back of his neck. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
BOWER There will be law... in whatever world we create. And you'll pay for what you've done. Believe me. GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor. 
GALLO A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo? 
BOWER 
HEAR ME ASSHOLE?! NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit windows, having just seen what's outside. Her expression is ghostly as she back pedals. 
BOWER (CONT'D) What is it? GALLO looks up with a blood-soaked grin. 
BOWER (CONT'D) What do you see!? 
I 
GALLO You ready for the new world, corporal? BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and... SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart past. The shin is underwater. BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to chuckle. 
BOWER 
(DISBELIEF) We've... we've already crashed. We've already... we're... The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop. 
BLIP... BLIP... BLIP. 
BOWER (CONT'D) We've been... down here... all this time!? All this... time- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) BOWER staggers against the console in shock,. the weapon lowering to his side. 
GALLO I guess this thing does land itself. Just doesn't float too well. BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one, quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat. BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade. 
G_ALLO (CONT'D) And you thought you could be King!? He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL of magnetos. He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy gun. She tries to turn the gun towards him and... 
I GALLO lunges toward her just as she's able to FIRE! The BLA..ST of energy goes into the console with a CRACK of 1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel... 
CLOSE UP .sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass. She struggles to crank the lever again as GALLO charges, hitting the gun away. He SLAMS her over the console. 
GALLO (CONT'D) My apologies. Ladies first... of course. 
ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP The crack on the window begins to spiderweb across... 
ANGLE ON GALLO grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade upward, forcing her to take a GASP as... BOSSSH! Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast of black water, sent tumbling. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. 
The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall. BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open hatch, pulling her with.

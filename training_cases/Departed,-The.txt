TITLE: FOUR YEARS LATER 
A test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents. BILLY takes up a Number Two pencil. He is in a room full of trainees, far enough along in their traineeship that their hair has grown in. 
A CLOCK TICKS, sweep hand coming around. 
BILLY'S EYES on it. 
INSTRUCTOR (O.S.) Begin. 
BILLY takes the test, marking multiple choice answers swiftly while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying to read the questions. 
EXT. A TRACK. DAY 
BILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running, alongside BROWN a black trainee with specs. 
BROWN She tells me, you never finish anything. (puff puff) You finish the police course you get taken care of again baby. (puff puff) So after graduation (puff puff) I get a blowjob again. 
BILLY That's great. Your mom must be a wonderful woman. 
BROWN Fuck yourself. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY Look at it this way, you're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked. 
BROWN Ways to get ahead, though, man, ways to get ahead. 
BILLY (exasperated by this) To where. (Yeah) 
BROWN is left thinking about this. 
EXT. TRAINING FIELD. DAY 
BILLY with other trainees is being braced by a DI. 
DRILL INSTRUCTOR This is not the regular police. This is the state police. Your training will illustrate the difference. What's the difference? 
BILLY (sotto voce to BROWN) Rage issues and lower median IQ. 
DRILL INSTRUCTOR You say something? 
BILLY Sir, I was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir. 
DRILL INSTRUCTOR We're not superior, we're the best. 
BILLY Sir, yes sir. 
INT. FIRING RANGE. DAY 
BILLY, in glasses and ear-protectors, waiting for the target. Go from the GUN to 
INT. A CRACKHOUSE. DAY. 
COLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job, on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF SHIT is throwing drugs out a window. 
COLIN (calling to other cops) Douchebag! 
COPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The smartest guy in the room. 
EXT. FIRING RANGE. DAY 
BILLY fires, and changes clips. 
EXT. A STREET IN BOSTON. DAY 
A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses and walks towards the door. 
INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY 
COLIN, in civvies (a very good suit), stands at suave attention before CAPTAIN QUEENAN, a mild and scholarly man who might as well be a Jesuit history-teacher. 
QUEENAN Congratulations on passing the detective exam, and welcome to the Special Investigation Unit. 
DIGNAM (tonelessly) Whoop-di fuckin' do. 
QUEENAN We won't be working directly together, you'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody. (contemplating him) You're a worker, you rise fast. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIGNAM Like a twelve year old's dick. (Alt: Like a turd in the pool.) 
COLIN Thank you, Sergeant. 
DIGNAM My pleasure. 
COLIN (to Queenan) Thank you, sir. 
He turns to go. 
INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM. DAY 
As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues, and walks on. 
QUEENAN'S SECRETARY (whispering, joyful, in love with COLIN) Congratulations. 
COLIN Thanks, hon. 
As COLIN leaves she moderates her expression and: 
QUEENAN'S SECRETARY (coldly) You can go in there now. 
BILLY looks up. He has not seen COLIN, and COLIN has not seen him. He has his interview on his mind. 
INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER 
BILLY stands at attention. The picture of a spit-and-polish trainee. 
QUEENAN You can sit. 
BILLY does. 
BILLY And one priest. Since you seem to know everything. 
DIGNAM I ain't sure about him, either. (ALT: Last I heard he was happily married to a 12 year old boy and living on a beach in Thailand.) Family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Lifers down there. Three decker men at best. You grew up, however, up the North shore. La di (fuckin') da. 
Dignam leans over Billy. 
DIGNAM (CONT'D) You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man. One kid with your mother. Upper middle class in the week, and then dropping your 'r's and hanging in the Southie projects with daddy the donkey on the weekends. I got that right? 
BILLY, opened up expertly and crudely, stares with contained hatred. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SGT. DIGNAM You have different accents? You did, didn't you. (You little fuckin' snake.) You were different fuckin' people. 
BILLY You a psychiatrist? 
SGT. DIGNAM If I was I'd ask you why you're a Statie making thirty grand a year. And I think if I were Sigmund fucking Freud himself I wouldn't get an answer. So tell me, what's a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties? 
BILLY Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right? 
QUEENAN (appreciative, kindly, looking up from his papers) Who said that? 
BILLY Hawthorne. 
SGT. DIGNAM (although he knows perfectly well who Hawthorne is) makes a fart-noise with his mouth. BILLY looks at him with an "I'm going to kill you" expression which is not without wit and which Dignam seems to admire. 
DIGNAM What's the matter, smartass? You don't know any fuckin' Shakespeare? 
QUEENAN We have a question. You want to be a cop, or do you want to appear to be a cop. It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're on TV... 
SGT. DIGNAM A lot of em just want to slam a nigger's head through a plate glass window. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BILLY I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant. 
DIGNAM (after a "we got a live one" glance at Queenan) What the fuck did you say to me, trainee? 
BILLY looks at him, and then looks forward. 
BILLY Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it you want from me? 
DIGNAM Hey asshole, he can't help you. I know what you are, and what you aren't. I'm the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth. I'm gonna help you understand something: You're no fuckin' cop. 
QUEENAN He's right. (Billy looks at Queenan) We deal in deceptions here. But what we don't deal with is self- deception. In five years, you might be anything else in the world, but you won't be a Massachusetts State trooper. 
BILLY You sure of that? 
QUEENAN I'm sure of that. 
DIGNAM Guaranteed. 
QUEENAN (looking up from his papers) You don't have much family. 
CLOSE ON BILLY. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BILLY (deciding this on the spot) I don't have any family. 
EXT. HUNTINGTON AVENUE. LATE DAY 
A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line, is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums. BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry young man at his life's turning point. 
INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER 
BILLY'S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights. A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air. Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her. 
EXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER 
BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not- bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY, hands in the pocket of a good suit. 
WASP UNCLE What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman? 
BILLY You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie? 
UNCLE That Stephanie. 
BILLY Nothing much to it Uncle Edward. 
UNCLE Are you trying to prove something to the family? 
BILLY When you say "family", what do you mean? You? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
UNCLE You always question everything, don't you? 
BILLY Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. "Am I an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?" "Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?" Those are questions. (the UNCLE starts to leave) "Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to be?" (he's stung THE UNCLE) Too late now, right? 
UNCLE Do you need some money for the funeral? 
THE UNCLE moves away, bends to get his overcoat. 
BILLY When my mother dies we don't have any connection. You got it? 
EXT. BOSTON. TWILIGHT 
AERIAL. FLY FROM the HOSPITAL TO: 
THE GOLD DOME ON BEACON HILL 
INT. AN APARTMENT ON BEACON HILL. TWILIGHT 
A REALTOR switches on lights. An empty, flash apartment above the Parisian rooftops of Beacon Hill. A view of the Dome. More than you'd think a cop could afford. We see, as COLIN does, beyond his reflection in the glass, the STATE HOUSE DOME. 
REALTOR This is it. Nice. You've got high ceilings, parquet floors. There's a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues.... Joke...not a very good one. (uneasy) So, you're a policeman? 
SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D) Somebody, as you may already know, stole one hundred microprocessors from the Mass Processor Corp out Route 128. They're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet. That's what they do out there on "America's Technology Highway". Worth a hundred grand apiece. Guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday he gets found in a dumpster. You know where this dirt ball started his life? Southie projects. 
COLIN What was his name? The, ah, departed. 
SGT. DIGNAM Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be in... 
LAZIO South Boston? 
SGT. DIGNAM Who forged your transcript, dickhead? 
COLIN I know that guy. His father runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's. 
ELLERBY We are not here to solve the "Case of the Dead Scumbag". We are here to nail Costello. 
COLIN stands down, embarrassed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SGT. DIGNAM We got a guy says that   he hears Costello is moving the   processors to China...that he set   up the whole fuckin' job and popped   Kennefick. (LAZIO is writing, lawyerish.) You don't want to miss   it if Costello takes a dump. 
ELLERBY We'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the FBI (Bureau)... 
LAZIO Without asking for details, do you have anyone in with Costello presently? 
SGT. DIGNAM Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. You girls have a nice day. 
EXT. A STREET OF TENEMENTS IN SOUTHIE. DAY 
BILLY steps off a bus at a corner. He goes up to a house, and knocks on the door. A Southie hag answers. On an oxygen cylinder, smoking. 
BILLY'S AUNT Billy? 
BILLY nods. 
BILLY Aunt Cathy? 
His aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he is. But he might well love his aunt. 
BILLY'S AUNT Good to see you. Good to see you. 
INT. BILLY'S AUNT'S KITCHEN. DAY 
BILLY is eating soup. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY'S AUNT They said you were in the Staties, I couldn't believe it. 
BILLY I got kicked out about four months ago. 
SEAN It was in the papers. 
Sean is a villain leaning in a doorway. Bad tie: he takes it off. He has been at a funeral. 
BILLY Well. So you know. 
SEAN And why are we graced with your presence? 
BILLY I brought your mother some pictures of my father. 
It's true. They are on the table. 
BILLY (CONT'D) My mother had them. My mother's dead. 
SEAN (reflexively) I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your troubles. 
Sean opens the fridge, opens a beer, and hands it to BILLY. He opens one for himself. 
SEAN (CONT'D) I was at a funeral myself. Myles Kennefick, knew him in school. Beat the fuck out of him seven or eight times as a matter of fact. (affably to Billy) You workin'? 
BILLY No. 
EXT. THE PORCH OF THE THREE-DECKER. LATER 
Sean and BILLY are still drinking beer. 
SEAN When did I see you after that? 
BILLY Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think. 
SEAN Fuck, oh shit. I remember that, dude. I had that fuckin' buck knife, right, and I cut all the brass numbas off the doors at the hotel. I was trippin'...All of them. That was a night. 
Sean looks deflated. 
BILLY Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. Insurance. 
SEAN Yeah? 
BILLY In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back? 
SEAN My line of work... I'm not in that line of work just presently because I don't have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of fact I have never had ten thousand dollars. 
BILLY That's what I'm saying. 
Sean nods, and nods. 
SEAN You know what we usually say at these moments. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin. 
INT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT 
BILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear. 
SEAN Fuckin' Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans. 
He has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer. 
MRS KENNEFICK I mean fuck yourself. 
She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery van. 
COLIN You get that? 
BARRIGAN "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself?" 
COLIN Welcome to the neighborhood. 
EXT. AN INTERSECTION. MOMENTS LATER 
FRENCH pulls up to a light. 
[COSTELLO blows a red light and leaves the tail (including the Surveillance Van which we will see again) behind him in a snarl of traffic.] 
COSTELLO Cut 'em here. 
French steps on it and blows through the light, leaving the follow cars behind. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) Bye, bye. 
INT. THE ELEVATOR AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY 
COLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age, beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation counselling work with "violent offenders" and also sees policemen. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN Making a house call? 
MADOLYN Have I seen you professionally? 
COLIN No, no. I know what you do. I know who you are. 
MADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively) sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted by him. 
COLIN (CONT'D) When guys have to "use their "service revolvers" in the "course of duty" they get to talk to you about their "feelings" and whatnot. 
MADOLYN laughs. 
COLIN (CONT'D) No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional. 
MADOLYN (laughing) I have an appointment on this floor. 
The door opens. 
COLIN That's good. They're all fuckin' crazy on that floor. (points up) I'm one floor up. 
MADOLYN Oh, fancy policeman. 
COLIN That's right. Fancy. 
MADOLYN Are you a Statie? 
After she steps out he prevents the door from closing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
COLIN Yeah, I'm also getting my law degree. 
MADOLYN Suffolk, nights? 
COLIN They don't run Harvard Law at night, last time I checked. 
MADOLYN When was the last time you checked? 
COLIN Before I went to fucking Suffolk. 
MADOLYN I went to U Mass. I wasn't insulting you. 
COLIN Well I thought you were, and for that you have to take me to dinner. 
MADOLYN Maybe you could shoot someone and I'd have to see you professionally. 
COLIN Whatever it takes. I'll stab someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you. 
MADOLYN hands him a card. 
COLIN (CONT'D) I don't need a card, I'm a detective. 
She hesitates. He takes the card. 
COLIN (CONT'D) I'm only joking. Nice to meet you... "Madolyn". 
The doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open, the signal bars light up, and the phone rings. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
COLIN (CONT'D) (walking, voice low) I didn't know about your tail until I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I had the other guy with me. Blue sedan and a white delivery van, fucked up with graffiti on the side. The van is audio surveillance. OK, have a nice day. 
INT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING 
The same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN, all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog on separate document]. 
Billy is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over.... 
BILLY You guys from Providence? 
The GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene. BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy breaks his left hand--a "boxer's fracture". BILLY stands over his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand. 
PROPRIETOR What have you done to my place! Get out of here. 
BILLY goes. 
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT 
BILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might have dated her. Not in this one. 
INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT 
COSTELLO No. (a beat) Come with me. (As BILLY hesitates) I'm not the cops. I'm not askin' you. 
BILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO, and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO: 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence, and this can cause problems for me. 
INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BAR. CONTINUOUS. 
COSTELLO Those guys you tuned up are connected down Providence. What they're going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them? 
BILLY Is it something I can't do personally? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COSTELLO appreciates the balls of this. He looks at Mister French. Then back at Billy, smiling. 
COSTELLO I'm going to have my associate search you. 
BILLY tenses. Exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire. 
BILLY Search me? Search me for what? 
MISTER FRENCH and COSTELLO look at each other. 
MISTER FRENCH C'm here. 
COSTELLO Contra-fucking-band.    Take your fuckin' shoes off. 
MISTER FRENCH Shoes off. 
BILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes. COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a table. 
COSTELLO I knew your father. 
BILLY Yeah. He's dead. 
COSTELLO I'm sorry.     How did he go? 
BILLY He didn't complain. 
COSTELLO That was his problem. 
BILLY Who said he had a fuckin' problem. 
COSTELLO I just said he had a fuckin' problem. There's a man could have been anything. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BILLY Are you saying he was nothing? 
COSTELLO I'm saying he worked at the airport. 
COSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH. 
MISTER FRENCH He's clean. 
COSTELLO The arm. 
With amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain. MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs: "such a fuckin' pussy." 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) (holding Billy by the collar) It makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. Regressing. And, if I can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some cop prick like fucking Queenan to pull you out of the Staties, and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in...that department, anyway. 
He grabs Billy's broken right hand. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) Are you still a cop? 
BILLY No. 
COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand. 
COSTELLO You swear on your mother's grave that you're not a cop. 
BILLY I am not a cop. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
COSTELLO You stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off cousin? 
BILLY Yes! 
COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit. 
COSTELLO Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence...let's not cry over spilled guineas. 
INT. THE MAIN PART OF THE BAR. MOMENTS LATER 
COSTELLO, the visiting king, points at a group of drinkers, including a BLOND WOMAN (1st), GWEN. 
COSTELLO What's this IRA motherfucker doing in my bar? 
The IRA MOTHERFUCKER is terrified. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) (slapping him on the back) Only kidding. How's your mother? 
JIMMY Ah, she's on her way out. 
COSTELLO We all are. (straightens suit and tie) Act accordingly. 
Costello exits. 
INT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT 
MISTER FRENCH is methodically shelling and eating peanuts. 
COSTELLO Do you trust him? 
MISTER FRENCH These days, who's reliable? 
(CONTINUED) 
The wire falls into the water. 
INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS. 
Queenan reacts mildly to the loss of the signal. He removes his headphones. 
DIGNAM That was quick. He dead already? 
EXT. "ACROPOLIS RESTAURANT". DAY 
A GREEK GUY (JIMMY PAPPAS) in chef's whites is cuffed and stuffed by TACTICAL OFFICERS. He has no idea what is going on. COLIN and BARRIGAN follow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN This will get Captain Ellerby on the six o'clock news. 
BARRIGAN No wonder you get ahead. 
EXT. A STREET BY THE HARBOR. DAY 
BILLY walking and talking on the phone. 
BILLY I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like. (listens) Micro what? 
INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Queenan on the phone. 
QUEENAN Microprocessors. We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in twenty- odd years and Costello is selling them military technology. Microprocessors, chips, computer parts. Anybody says anything about anything like that, you let us know. 
EXT. POLICE BUILDING. DAY. TELEVISION IMAGE. 
ELLERBY is before a thicket of microphones. 
REPORTER Did you have a tip from an informant? 
ELLERBY No, it was tireless police activity that ah effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #1. DAY 
COLIN is rolling a quarter across the backs of his fingers. BROWN (last seen as Billy's friend) and BARRIGAN, new plainclothes recruits to Colin's special squad, sit across from him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN I've been put in charge of this unit. It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly. 
Through glass we see ELLERBY, preening. ELLERBY gives the thumbs up. 
COLIN (CONT'D) Hi, Captain. And our primary target is obviously Frank Costello. But we don't communicate with anyone else in this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It's the right thing to do, personally I don't trust these fucking troopers either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the State Police. 
BROWN Really? 
COLIN Yeah.   Really. 
BROWN Do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers? 
COLIN (not happy about this) No. Ah...not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things...reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don't disappoint me. 
BROWN and BARRIGAN leave.       Colin leaves as well. 
BARRIGAN (to Brown) I know why I'm here. I made him feel guilty. Why are you here? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BROWN Intelligence and aptitude. 
BARRIGAN That's new. 
COLIN opens his cell phone. 
COLIN Hello Dad. I have a new job. (ALT: I got a promotion.) 
INT. A BOOKIE SHOP. DAY 
MISTER FRENCH backhands a guy into a table of betting slips. 
MISTER FRENCH Where's your fucking license? I don't see no fucking license. 
BOOKIE What license. 
BILLY, who is not wearing a cast anymore, watches. 
MISTER FRENCH There's no such thing as a license, of course, but you definitely have to have one. (grabs the bookie by the ear) If you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else, which means you will have let undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area. 
A HARD GUY sitting reaches inside his coat. BILLY in a flash breaks his jaw with a pistol barrel and then covers the sprawled HARD GUY with the gun. 
HARD GUY (spitting teeth) I was going for my fucking cigarettes... 
He was. They fall from his fingers. 
MISTER FRENCH Hey, that's Jimmy Bags. What the fuck you doin'? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY What the fuck. I didn't know.... 
BOOKIE There's no profit if I pay him two grand a week. I'm in the hole if I pay him two grand a week. 
MISTER FRENCH Then make more money or go out of business. This is America. If you don't make money you're a fucking douchebag. What are you going to do? 
BOOKIE Make more money. 
MISTER FRENCH That's the spirit. 
EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE BOOKIE SHOP. LATER 
BILLY and MISTER FRENCH emerge. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) How is Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers. 
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT 
FITZY beats up a guy with a pipe.   Billy watches from the background. 
EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT 
FITZY and the Costello gang blow up a car as Billy watches. Laughing, they hop in their vehicles and drive off. 
INT. ELLERBY'S OFFICE. MORNING 
OFFICE decorated with golf implements. ELLERBY has a hangover. Sunglasses. Eating baby aspirin by the small fistful. 
COLIN I'm not making enough progress with Costello? 
ELLERBY "Progress" is hard to define. I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up. 
He has a bowl of ice water on his desk. 
ELLERBY (CONT'D) Objectives get lost sight of: fair enough. Who did the two guys from Providence? 
COLIN Jimmy Pappas. 
ELLERBY And what happened to Jimmy Pappas? 
COLIN He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers. 
ELLERBY stares at COLIN. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ELLERBY Are you happy with this result? 
COLIN It's a result. 
ELLERBY Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits. 
COLIN Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on it. 
ELLERBY (with true appreciation) I think you are a cop, my son. 
He drops his face into the bowl of ice water. 
INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING 
A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped. Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper. BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the photographs in different ways. 
NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT. 
FRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated at his dining room table. He throws a child's toy at them. FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the cheek. 
FRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other way. 
BRIAN No, please... 
FRENCH Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He fires, using a soda bottle as a silencer. BRIAN drops to the floor. FRENCH approaches him assessing his victim. 
He turns to leave, passing BILLY.     He give him a slap. 
FRENCH (CONT'D) Wake the fuck up. 
They leave. 
EXT. A BEACH NEAR A POWERPLANT. DAY 
BILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated. Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it. In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy. 
QUEENAN Hey.   Let's go through the routine. 
DIGNAM You think you can pop someone. There's no special card to play. The guy whose jaw you broke was Boston Police Department. 
BILLY I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day. 
DIGNAM Most of the people in the world do it every day. What's the big deal? 
Dignam is drinking coffee. 
BILLY I'm not them. 
DIGNAM You're nobody. You signed the paper. We're the only people in the world who know that you're a cop. Maybe we'll just erase your file. 
This is Billy's deepest fear. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIGNAM (CONT'D) And zip, you're a soldier for Costello, open to arrest for how many felonies? Maybe we'll do that. 
BILLY Maybe I'll fucking kill you. 
He gets free of DIGNAM and punches him. 
QUEENAN Easy now.    That was a joke, Billy. 
DIGNAM Just because you play a fucking tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy. 
The fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the wall. 
QUEENAN (gently, like a man calming a wild animal) Be smart. If someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest you? 
BILLY looks desperately inland. 
REVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate. 
QUEENAN (CONT'D) Get in the car. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS. 
FITZY closes the cellphone. He puts it into COLIN'S hand. 
INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS 
MISTER FRENCH Everybody out. Move. 
The DRUGS are swept up instantly, in sheets laid over the tables. MISTER FRENCH lights a cigarette with his ZIPPO, and then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as BILLY watches. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS. 
COLIN takes the cellphone and puts it in his pocket. 
FITZY Who are you? When do I get out of here? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day. 
INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE.CONTINUOUS 
COLIN comes out and hands BROWN the CELLPHONE. 
COLIN Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra. 
BROWN Why'd you use my phone? 
COLIN Because you didn't go in there. 
INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - DAY 
COLIN, hung-over, sits at the breakfast table.     Madolyn looks at him. 
MADOLYN The light's nice here in the morning. 
COLIN doesn't respond. 
MADOLYN (CONT'D) It's all right. Guys tend to make a big deal out of it. It's actually quite common. 
COLIN I gotta go to work. 
COLIN simply gets up and walks away. 
INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. DAY 
A clock ticking. Madolyn is looking across at ...Billy. Madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. But no one's more guarded than Billy. 
BILLY It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A beat. 
BILLY (CONT'D) People make things up in confession. You know that? 
MADOLYN I know they do. 
BILLY People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films. 
MADOLYN That's an interesting observation. 
BILLY Do you lie? 
MADOLYN Why do you? 
BILLY I'm asking if you lie. 
MADOLYN Honesty isn't synonymous with truth. 
BILLY You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it? 
MADOLYN I expect sometimes...people...do it to keep things...on an even keel. 
BILLY So, you had a parent who was a drunk? 
MADOLYN looks up at him, transpierced. Tables turned on the psychiatrist. BILLY smiles at her. 
MADOLYN (flustered) Did you? 
BILLY (simply) No. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MADOLYN Let's keep this with you. 
BILLY (abruptly) There was a cop leaving when I came in. 
MADOLYN How do you know he was a cop? 
BILLY Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops? 
MADOLYN That's part of what I do. Although, I don't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy. 
BILLY You should get a better job... 
BILLY (CONT'D) Do they all come in and cry...your cops? 
MADOLYN Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to...use their weapons. 
BILLY Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV. 
MADOLYN I looked through your file and I see you have a record of assault. What was it like for you in jail? 
BILLY You want to hear about the showers? 
MADOLYN Did something happen to you? 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLERBY (CONT'D) We've been after this son of a bitch for a long time, and we're getting him tonight. Get to work. 
COLIN (to team) Go find out what we're doing and get on it. 
COLIN wanders off in the mill of officers. He is taking out his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him. 
ELLERBY Sorry to get you at the last minute. But things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy. 
ELLERBY walks on to a COFFEE STATION, a yard away. 
COLIN (into cell) Dad? 
COSTELLO (O.S.) (on phone) Yes? 
COLIN is completely normal on the phone. 
COLIN I'm not going to make dinner. Something big has come up. 
INT. COSTELLO'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS 
COSTELLO is on the phone. 
COSTELLO Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamned day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN turns away from the activity. 
COLIN Oh, my friends are still coming. 
COLIN sees QUEENAN staring at him. 
COLIN (CONT'D) We'll just say lunch tomorrow.   All right, bye. 
COLIN ends the call. QUEENAN is there. 
QUEENAN The readiness is all. You know the players, call the game. 
COLIN Thank you, Captain. 
He gives him the clipboard, Colin goes to the work area. 
LATER 
COLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his hand. 
GEEK COP Piece of cake. I'll operate the cameras. You ID the guys and log them. 
COLIN nods. QUEENAN comes up. 
QUEENAN All cellphone signals are under surveillance through the courtesy of our Federal friends over there... 
COLIN looks: sees LAZIO and two others. 
ELLERBY (as if on coke and he probably is) Patriot Act. Love it. Love it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN, using his left hand, not looking, opens his cellphone, autodials, and then taps an instant message into it, pushes "Send." 
DETAIL OF IM: "No Phones" 
ONSCREEN, CARS PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE TARGET BUILDING. 
COLIN All right. That's Costello right there. Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy...Time is 10.46. 
BROWN Who are they meeting? 
ELLERBY (leaning over screens) I don't know. Some Chinamen from points unknown. They're already inside. 
DETAIL OF COLIN'S PHONE. COLIN hits "send", sending the message "No phones". THE SCREEN then reads "Erasing Sent Message". 
EXT. TARGET BUILDING. NIGHT 
COSTELLO and the boys go into the building, moving past TWO IDLING CARS. We see Costello look casually at his phone. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS 
Watching images. COSTELLO'S GUYS move through pillars and disappear. 
CAMERA GEEK COP We have a blind spot. 
ELLERBY Why do you have a blind spot? 
CAMERA GEEK COP We had two hour's notice. Two hours. What the fuck you think this is, NASA? 
ELLERBY It never crossed my mind. You get a camera in the back? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TECH COP IN DOWN VEST What back? 
Ellerby blows his nose. He is on coke. COLIN sends another TEXT MESSAGE: "Blind spot inside door." 
INT. TARGET BUILDING. CONTINUOUS - REVISED 6/8-9/05 
COSTELLO looks at his IM screen and turns to his guys. 
COSTELLO Turn off your cell phones. 
FITZY and some others mutter. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) Check your weapons...Fitzy has the chicken... 
Everyone turns off their phones, including BILLY (but we know Billy has TWO phones). 
BILLY looks around at the pillared distances. He sees: 
A GROUP OF THREE MEN waiting and FIVE OTHER MEN spreading out through the pillars. Armed. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS 
CHINESE GANGSTER Du ne. [Fuck you.] 
The deal is done. 
COSTELLO The expedition continues this way. 
To Billy's surprise both Costello's men and the Chinese head out through the back industrial windows onto a canal-side pier. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS 
The CARS of the CHINESE GUYS are driven away, passing a van full of... 
Startled TACTICAL COPS. TWO TACTICAL UNITS are hidden outside. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS 
ELLERBY is staring at the screens. 
ELLERBY Don't tell me those cars were empty. Please don't tell me those Chinamen's cars were empty. (to Camera Tech Cop) Do you have a camera in the back. 
An IMAGE comes up. Nothing. 
ELLERBY (CONT'D) Can I talk to you a minute? 
As the Camera Technician gets up, Ellerby pounces on him. 
EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING. CONTINUOUS 
Tied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel (random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI, and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy. 
COSTELLO See, no surveillance here. They didn't figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners. What with everything all dug up, you can't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don't approve of orientals driving to begin with. 
BILLY What about us, Frank?   What're we gonna do? 
COSTELLO We depart. We didn't commit no illegalities. 
BILLY is stunned. Admiring. 
MISTER FRENCH Except sell the ching chongs a bunch of fuckin' plastic. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in the lobster boat. BILLY watches COSTELLO go, admiringly, and then follows him. 
EXT. STREET NEAR TARGET BUILDING - NIGHT          103A 
A few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers approach the cars they realize they are empty except for hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the command center. 
INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY 
Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS. 
MADOLYN Good Morning. 
MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy. 
COLIN Good morning. 
MADOLYN I beat the movers. 
COLIN How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment? 
MADOLYN (putting the box on the kitchen counter) Lonely. 
COLIN I'm glad to hear that.   It sucked here, too. 
They kiss.    MADOLYN takes in the apartment. 
MADOLYN I'm gonna thank your Uncle Alphonsus for the square footage. 
COLIN Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.   So am I. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MADOLYN unpacks food.       Coffee.   Croissants. 
MADOLYN French donut? 
COLIN (re: box of stuff) Yeah. Hey, can I... 
MADOLYN Sure yeah. 
He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures, breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum. 
COLIN Well, we're not having this out. 
MADOLYN What? 
MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated. 
COLIN You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company. 
MADOLYN Company? 
She laughs.    COLIN looks at a diploma.     Veritas. 
COLIN Why work for the state? 
MADOLYN Why not?   You do. 
COLIN Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees...you're a hot shit... I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance counselor? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MADOLYN (deadpan, over her coffee cup) I believe in public service. 
COLIN stares at her. 
COLIN Now you're just being ridiculous. 
DIGNAM I can't wait to wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face. 
COSTELLO (to Dignam) Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me? 
QUEENAN I will get you, Frank. 
COSTELLO If you could've you would've but I guess you like to go at your own pace. 
From off-stage we hear a young, angelic GIRLS CHOIR begin to sing. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) Excuse me, I've got a date with some angels. 
As Costello walks away: 
QUEENAN Sooner than you think, Francis. 
INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN, looking worried, folding his phone away, comes into the apartment. MADOLYN is staring at him. 
COLIN What? 
MADOLYN You have a boss that has a laryngectomy? 
COLIN No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MADOLYN You're lying to me. 
COLIN Not exactly. (the charming Colin:) There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation. (Or your own life.) (more seriously, after a long beat) There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about. 
MADOLYN (after a beat) Okay, then say that. 
COLIN looks at her steadily:         if she's serious, she's pure gold. 
COLIN I will.    Thank you. 
He kisses her.       The DOORBELL RINGS. 
MADOLYN That's the movers. 
COLIN You still wanna stay? 
MADOLYN I do. 
The doorbell safely ringing, Colin kisses Madolyn. 
COLIN (re: doorbell) All right. All right.       I'm coming. 
INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS 
DIGNAM is alone. We see Queenan's empty desk in a fall of light. We see Dignam's arm, wrist, phone, an expensive heavy watch. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY (O.S.) I'm gonna get on a plane unless you put Queenan on the phone. 
DIGNAM Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down. 
INT. IM PEI TYPE FOOTBRIDGE WITH A PEDESTRIAN CONVEYOR. DAY (INTERCUT) 
BILLY is talking on the phone, in a fury. 
BILLY Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan? 
DIGNAM He's not here. 
BILLY They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out. 
DIGNAM And how do we do that Mr... fucking genius who didn't even graduate the academy? 
BILLY Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan. 
DIGNAM Are you deaf? He's not here. Call me when you get something real. 
BILLY is in a full-on panic attack. He takes a pill, leans back against a wall, closes his eyes. The second phone rings. He stares at it: opens it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY It's me. 
INT. DESERTED CAFE -     DAY 
Madolyn and Billy sit at a table. Talking like friends now, emphatically non-clinical. Billy is zoned out, preoccupied, nervous. 
MADOLYN I'm assuming you want to change things, you know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change everything, anything. Too many choices can see like no choice at all... 
BILLY Confucius say that? 
MADOLYN So you do...something radical. 
BILLY "Something radical," huh? 
MADOLYN ...yeah, you do... Sometimes it's just a matter of picking a thing and doing it... 
BILLY So how long you been with this guy? 
MADOLYN Oh, four months. About four months. 
BILLY You love this guy? 
MADOLYN It's pretty serious, yeah, it is. 
BILLY A head case or anything?    I'm just curious... 
MADOLYN No more than I am. 
(CONTINUED) 
INT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER 
BILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along the hall. 
QUEENAN My wife's asleep. She left supper out. Come and have something to eat. 
BILLY shakes his head. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY No, I... 
QUEENAN We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and have something to eat. 
BILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door. 
EXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY) 
COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well. 
ELLERBY Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy like you since me. You'll be transferred to Internal Investigations but you will continue to work right where you are in the Special Investigation Unit. 
COLIN I don't get it. 
ELLERBY We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit. 
COLIN Right. 
ELLERBY You'll investigate. Everybody. Anybody. 
COLIN Well, that's just a dream job for a cop. 
ELLERBY We have considered all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do. (a beat) I have an immaculate record. 
ELLERBY hits a drive. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ELLERBY (CONT'D) Play golf? 
COLIN No. 
ELLERBY That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form relationships. (a beat) How's the wedding coming along? 
COLIN Everything's great. On schedule. She's a doctor. 
ELLERBY Outstanding. That's good. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. You don't want anyone thinking you're a homo. Married guy seems stable. People look at a wedding ring and think: someone can stand the son of a bitch. Ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works. 
COLIN Oh, it's working. Overtime. 
ELLERBY I'm glad to hear that. 
Hits a drive. Ponk. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY 
HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings. BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway, and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door is unlocked by: DELAHUNT. 
INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY 
It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around. Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO. DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MISTER FRENCH Boss wants your real name, your social, your license number, all your bank account numbers. 
BILLY I don't have a bank account. 
MISTER FRENCH I'm a cash business myself. 
BILLY What's he doing, setting up IRAs? 
MISTER FRENCH You fill in the papers, real name, all your numbers, no fucking around, and then we all wait here. 
MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D) No, I ain't. 
MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope on the bar. 
DELAHUNT Put the forms in there. 
FITZY I don't know if this is how you spell Citizens'. 
BILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST. 
BILLY No, no, no. Jesus Christ. 
He takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS. 
FITZY What are you, retarded? That ain't right. 
BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an envelope. BILLY gets up. 
DELAHUNT Billy, he said to stay here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BILLY I'm not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot. I'm not staying. 
MISTER FRENCH Where you going? 
BILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written. 
EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY 
BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone vibrates and he takes it out. 
ONSCREEN Follow the envelope. 
COSTELLO leaves. 
INT. COSTELLO'S KITCHEN. DAY/INTERCUT: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE 
COSTELLO is on the phone. MISTER FRENCH is sitting on a stool, smoking. OPERA playing on sound. 
COSTELLO You heard nothing? 
COLIN No. 
COSTELLO Nothing about drugs. Nothing about new guys, nothing about Gloucester? 
COLIN No, Frank, not a thing. And I promise you I would have heard about it. 
COSTELLO hangs up and turns to MISTER FRENCH. 
COSTELLO You're sure. No other departments, no codes, like that... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN'S VOICE Frank.   You can relax on this one. 
COSTELLO Okay, Collie. I will. 
Costello hangs up and turns to Mr. French. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) (emotionally) It ain't Bill. No way, he says. Thank God for Billy. 
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY 
Everybody is busy in the office. It's COLIN's first day of Internal Investigations. COLIN'S moving through the bullpen. COPS stare at him with resentment. 
COLIN Morning. 
He comes up to Queenan's door just as Dignam comes out. DIGNAM faces COLIN down. 
COLIN (CONT'D) A problem? 
DIGNAM Yeah, I run rat fucks like you.   I don't like them. 
COLIN The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know. And I wouldn't even have a job if you did yours. 
DIGNAM Fuck yourself. 
COLIN I need to know the identity of your undercovers. 
DIGNAM Blow me. Not literally, there's no promotion in it for ya. 
He walks away. 
COLIN goes into Queenan's office. 
INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER 
QUEENAN puts the cig into a cup of water, and throws it into the trash. 
COLIN Morning, Captain. 
QUEENAN Look who's here. The Queen of the prom. 
COLIN They are not happy with me. Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam. 
QUEENAN What do you expect? Everybody knows you're assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do. What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat. 
COLIN sits uneasily. 
COLIN Fair enough. Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right? 
QUEENAN Two days ago, my undercover guy in Costello's organization---- 
COLIN Who is that? 
QUEENAN Lots of luck. (Not a chance.) You can go over my head, high as you like. You still won't get an answer. 
COLIN Fair enough. 
QUEENAN As I said, two days ago, my guy nearly found out who Costello's rat is. He lost him in the street. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN Really?   Did he get a look at him? 
QUEENAN ...No. 
COLIN Nothing that could help us? 
QUEENAN Nah. 
COLIN (swallows) (Too bad.) Any advice?   Generally? 
QUEENAN Costello can't do (much) business without coordinating with his source... (gestures out window) Who is here. In SIU. Follow Costello and you'll find his rat. 
COLIN realizes: Just follow Queenan and you'll find his rat. 
QUEENAN (CONT'D) (turns away) You're going to be looking at my people. Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records. Don't expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses. Let me get you a coffee. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. DAY 
COLIN is sitting in his office alone, remembering what Queenan has just told him: 
QUEENAN (V.O.) Follow Costello and you'll find his informer. 
In the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then another. The result is always: "Person not found". He types in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: "Person not found". COLIN keeps working. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER 
MUGSHOTS of all of Costello's guys. He looks at them desperately...no one squares up with the blurred, impossible, images he saw on the CCTV screen (which he has printed out).COLIN closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger), locks his door. He picks up the phone. 
VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.) Internal Investigations. 
COLIN This is Sullivan. I need constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now. 
COLIN (angrily) I have to follow every lead, however unlikely, however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibilities. 
DETECTIVE 1 Who says I have delicate sensibilities? 
COLIN I have reason to believe that Queenan is Costello's informer. Follow him, and don't get made. 
DETECTIVE 1 Copy that, Sarge 
The detectives in the car get alert and start their car as QUEENAN comes out of the building. 
DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D) We got him. 
DETECTIVE 2 Sarge, we got the target. 
EXT. TREMONT STREET/FINANCIAL DISTRICT. DAY 
DETECTIVE 1 trails Captain Queenan through the crowds of people heading towards work. 
INT. PARK ST. SUBWAY STATION. MORNING 
QUEENAN begins to light a cigarette and then gives it up. A TRAIN comes in, and Queenan boards. DETECTIVE 1 boards the next car. 
INT. DETECTIVE 1'S SUBWAY CAR. MOMENTS LATER 
Looking through smeared glass into the next car as the train begins to move DETECTIVE 1 sees QUEENAN answer a cell call. 
INT. QUEENAN'S SUBWAY CAR. CONTINUOUS 
QUEENAN is on his cell. 
QUEENAN Where are you now? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY Look down the car. 
QUEENAN looks up mildly as the car rocks. 
BILLY (CONT'D) Got me? 
QUEENAN'S POV: 
BILLY is slumped in a seat at the far end, not looking towards QUEENAN. 
BILLY (CONT'D) Any reason you'd have a tail? 
QUEENAN No...Of course not. 
BILLY (on the verge of hyperventilating) I'm watching a guy... 
QUEENAN I don't have a tail, Billy. 
Through the glass we see DETECTIVE 1 watching Queenan. 
BILLY Okay. Get off at South Station. You wait there for ten minutes. After I leave I'll text message you the address where we'll meet. I'll make sure you don't have a tail. 
QUEENAN South Station. Wait ten minutes. 
As the train stops BILLY vaults off of it. On the platform he walks along, texting. 
EXT. SOUTH STATION SUBWAY EXIT. LATE MORNING 
QUEENAN, mild in his specs, chewing gum with his dentures, comes out of the station, and looks at the TEXT MESSAGE on his phone. 
EXT. A STREET SOUTH OF FT. POINT CHANNEL. MOMENTS LATER 
A building under rehab, covered with scaffolding, but still functioning as a corporate building. QUEENAN goes along to the entrance, and in. 
DETECTIVE 1 comes along after him. We see the Internal Investigations car up the street. DETECTIVE 1 dials his cellphone. 
DETECTIVE 1 He went into a building on the waterfront. Address is 344 Wash... 
INT. THE LOBBY. MOMENTS LATER 
DETECTIVE 1 looks at the elevator-indicator, and the building directory. 
DETECTIVE 1 He went to the top floor. It's empty. No tenants. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN, listening, playing with a COIN. 
EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER 
DETECTIVE 1 emerges from the building and joins other detectives in the car. 
DETECTIVE 1 I don't know what we're doing here. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/BRASSERIE. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN, after fumbling between cell phones, dials the correct one. 
COLIN (to COSTELLO) I think I've got him. I think Queenan is meeting with him right now. 
EXT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. MOMENTS LATER 
FITZY and DELAHUNT'S phones ring simultaneously. 
DELAHUNT Get the van. Get the boys. 
EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. CONTINUOUS 
BILLY is waiting on the roof as QUEENAN finally arrives. 
QUEENAN I assume these premises do not have an anti-smoking ordinance. So, what's going on? 
BILLY I told you, he's got dope coming in, I don't know where. He's getting spooky, Captain... 
QUEENAN What do you mean? 
BILLY He's crazy. I just saw the man. He had blood all over him. I can't get any more information for you. I can't trust it. He's not including his regular guys... I'm telling you, he's gonna find out who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill me, I know it. 
QUEENAN All right, all right. I hear you. I'm sorry for you trouble. Look, I'm not gonna jeopardize your safety any longer. I'll get you out. I can't do it overnight but I'll do it. We can bust him for what we have. At least I think we can...I hope. You're out of there ASAP. 
EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. CONTINUOUS 
FITZY, DELAHUNT and boys come out. The crew has seen the UNMARKED COP CAR. FITZY grabs BILLY. 
FITZY You're fuckin' late. Where the fuck were you? Get in the fuckin' van. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY What the fuck happened?    I came to meet you. 
They start piling into a van. 
INT. THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS 
DETECTIVE 2 is yelling both at his partner and into the mic. 
DETECTIVE 1 Stay in the fucking car. Stay in the fucking car. This is a surveillance unit. (into mic to Colin) Do I pursue. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN is sitting very calmly. 
COLIN No. Stay where you are. I need some fucking information here. What came off the building? 
DETECTIVE 1 I'm not sure. 
INT./EXT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR/ THE STREET. CONTINUOUS 
DETECTIVE 1 No pursuit. No pursuit. 
DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D) Fuck that. 
DETECTIVE 1 gets out of the car and runs towards the fleeing men, gun drawn. 
FITZY turns on DETECTIVE 1 with a pistol drawn. DETECTIVE 1 fires and DELAHUNT is hit in the stomach. FITZY shoots the detective (he is wounded in the hand, not killed). The VAN takes off. 
DETECTIVE 4 Thirty-two X to CP. Thirty-two X to CP. We're being fired upon. I repeat. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS 
ON RADIO. "Officer down", etc. COLIN has never felt more guilty in his life. 
DETECTIVE 4 (V.O.) We have an officer down. An officer has been shot. Request immediate assistance. 
He switches off the light and sits in the dark as the afternoon gathers. 
INT. THE DEAD BAR. NIGHT 
FITZY, BILLY, and the BOYS are drinking. Dirty, paranoid, guilty, frightened, smoking. DELAHUNT has been shot, is dying, on a dirty couch. 
FITZY sits down and looks at Billy. 
FITZY And where the fuck were you? 
BILLY Boss told me to go home. 
FITZY Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. At any rate you weren't fuckin' home. 
BILLY I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want. Was I there or was I not there? Huh? 
FITZY walks away. 
DELAHUNT (OS) Billy. Billy (Billy goes over to him) 
BILLY (re: his wounds) Jesus Christ. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DELAHUNT Two days...two days ago the Boss says to me, it's been ten years already, and you've never done me wrong. He asked me, if one of the other guys is a rat, would I take him out. I told him I would but I don't know if I would. Now I know I can't. I've done a lot of bad things but I've never been a murderer. 
BILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying. 
DELAHUNT (CONT'D) Hey Billy, I don't want no one to put me in a dumpster. Just don't put me in a dumpster. 
BILLY When you're dead it makes no difference where they put you. 
BILLY lights him a cigarette. 
DELAHUNT You know what I thought today? 
BILLY What's that? 
DELAHUNT Who didn't show up today is the rat. 
BILLY Yeah, so? 
DELAHUNT You never been late in your life. And when I called you... I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong address. But you showed up at the right one. 
DELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified. 
DELAHUNT (CONT'D) Tell me why I didn't say anything. Tell me why. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
He waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him. 
FITZY (drinking) That cop was tough. We were excessive with the cop. 
BILLY walks past the table. 
BILLY He's dead. I'm going home. 
BILLY leaves by the front door. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT 
All hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage. 
ELLERBY Do you know why Queenan went to that building? 
GWEN (CONT'D) Let me straighten you out. 
COLIN looks out into the bullpen. People working. On a table he sees PLASTIC BAGS which contains Queenan's bloodstained effects-- broken glasses, smashed wristwatch, and CELLPHONE. He glances around, and picks up the CELLPHONE. Blood gets on his fingers. He moves into the office, and seen through the glass, he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches up the last incoming number. 
INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT KITCHEN. NIGHT 
BILLY is looking at a chipped SANTA MUG from his childhood and is eating something--sheer maintenance, and drinking wine from the bottle. His phone rings. He looks at the ID and is stunned. Queenan's number! He picks up the call but remains silent. The caller is also doing the same. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN hears that the other side has hung up the phone. He sees: ELLERBY looking at him through the glass. But Ellerby hasn't seen the phone. 
INTERCUT BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT/COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS 
BILLY is agitated. Exhausted. Frightened. He paces, and looks at the phone. He begins to pack, assembling clothes, money. Finally, like a man committing suicide--it's that intense-- he dials the number. INTERCUT. 
COLIN Yeah. 
BILLY You called this number on a dead guy's phone. Who are you? 
COLIN So it is you. Thank God you're all right. We were very worried. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY Who are you? 
COLIN You're talking to Sergeant Sullivan. I'm taking over Queenan's unit. 
BILLY Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it. 
COLIN Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a leave of absence. He's very upset. We're all very upset. The best thing would be for your to come in. We need you to come in. 
BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His other phone rings. 
COLIN dumps out the box of Queenan's belongings. In the diary he sees an entry showing undercover suspects Costello is FBI informant. 
BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His other phone rings. 
INT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. DAY 
COSTELLO is sitting with his key guys, including FRENCH and FITZY. A TV station plays above the zinc bar. BILLY is drinking, hitting it heavily. 
NEWS ANCHOR State Police have confirmed that the body of the man found dead in the Fenway marshes yesterday afternoon is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the City of Boston.. This was the scene today.... If you have any information about this murder, you are urged to call the Boston Police. 
The TV shows DELAHUNT'S BODY being loaded into an ambulance. A crime scene. COSTELLO's eyes have widened slightly. But he is strangely undisturbed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FITZY Fuck.   I can't believe it. 
MISTER FRENCH Don't believe what? 
FITZY I'm embarrassed. How the fuck did they find him so fast? I spent all fuckin' night out there, dragged the poor bastard.... I must have been there seven hours. In three feet of mud. What the fuck is a marsh? And who walks their dog in a fuckin' marsh? In three feet of water? I don't believe it. I still don't believe he's a fuckin' cop. 
COSTELLO The cops are saying he's a cop so I won't look for the cop. (to FITZY) Are you soft? The next time I tell you to dump a body in the marshes, put it in the fuckin' marshes, not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday to get a blowjob! 
He makes a move for the door. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) Proceed. 
They get up to leave, following him. 
EXT. SOUTHEAST EXPRESSWAY. NIGHT 
Two cars carrying Costello and his men are speeding down the highway. Behind them, two SIU CARS are trailing. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CAR. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN closes his door and punches in a number. 
IN COSTELLO'S CAR, his cell phone rings. 
COSTELLO Jesus Christ. 
He answers it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) What? 
COLIN Don't go. You've got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They won't be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to tell you. 
COSTELLO Get rid of them. 
COLIN There's no need to go yourself, Frank. 
COSTELLO Get rid of the fuckin' tail! 
CLOSE on COLIN as what he has to do crystallizes. 
COLIN I will.   All right. 
A cold look in his eye, Colin leaves his office and goes down the hall. 
IN THE CAR 
Costello remarks to French -- 
COSTELLO Tails. Fuckin' rats. This rat shit is wearing me thin. 
FRENCH Francis, they're all rats. Women are rats... cunts...Yeah, we're becoming a nation of rats. 
INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER 
BROWN is there. BARRIGAN. ELLERBY. Others. 
COLIN Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off. Tell your team to stop following Costello. We don't need to surveil him. 
COLIN stands in the door like a gunfighter. Everyone looks at him. 
MADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE DIALOGUE.] 
COLIN (CONT'D) Your guys shouldn't have done that. 
COSTELLO One of us was going to have to die. It tends to be the other guy. 
COLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a possibility. 
COLIN I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
COSTELLO So Dignam's the only one with the keys to the kingdom. 
COLIN He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking. 
COSTELLO Give me his location. Tonight. 
COLIN and MADOLYN stare at each other. 
MADOLYN I thought I was the liar. 
COLIN I can explain. 
She goes into the bedroom. COLIN'S PHONE RINGS. He answers it. 
EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY 
BILLY is walking, on the phone, happy, and twisting the knife. 
BILLY Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried. 
INT. MADOLYN AND COLIN'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS 
COLIN closes a door to speak privately. 
COLIN What do you want? 
BILLY I want my identity, you two-faced rat prick. 
COLIN Where are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on. 
COLIN goes to the bedroom door and tries it. Locked. He knocks. No answer. 
COLIN Did we not talk about this?   This is my job. 
It's over. He starts to punch the door, and then does not. 
EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY 
COLIN comes along and walks into the lobby. He is not looking for a tail... 
EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY 
COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his skull. 
BILLY Get your hands up.   Hands.   Hands. 
COLIN Put the fuckin' gun down. 
BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams "hands!" at Colin every time he makes a move). 
COLIN (CONT'D) I came here to talk some fucking sense to you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and I can get you your money. 
BILLY (turning him around) What did you say? 
COLIN I can get you your... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY cracks him across the jaw with the gun. COLIN goes down. COLIN is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open. Billy throws away Colin's ankle gun. 
COLIN (CONT'D) (spitting teeth) Fuck, shit... 
BILLY (going for Colin's cuffs) You didn't come here to talk, you fuckin' maggot, you came here to get arrested. 
COLIN Arrested? Arrested for what. (as BILLY cuffs him) So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant. 
BILLY Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth. 
COLIN What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are. 
BILLY Would you shut the fuck up. 
COLIN I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State Police. Who the fuck are you? Nobody. I ERASED YOU. 
BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head. 
BILLY You erased me? 
COLIN Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein. See what happens. 
BILLY What would happen is the bullet would go right through your fuckin' head. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
COLIN Watch what happens. 
BILLY What, you think you're gonna get the parade? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you. (safeties the gun) I'm arresting you. 
COLIN That's the stupidest thing you could do. 
BILLY Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. (hits him) I don't give a fuck if these charges don't stick. (whaling him in the beats) But I'm still fucking arresting you.

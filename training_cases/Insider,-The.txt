All we can see is black filling the screen...  Black on black... 
INT. A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY 
And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP...  Two men in front, shouldering assault rifles.  HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...  And there are three MEN in the back.  A middle-aged Man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  And on either side of him, two Men, blindfolded.  The man on one side is in his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled black-leather jacket...  A stocky man, with the edge of a J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once. But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here, turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music that disappears behind him...  He's LOWELL BERGMAN.  On the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN. 
EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY 
The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese village.  It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...  And in the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening Lebanese soldiers.  And as the speeding convoy passes a captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...  And, suddenly the convoy skids to a stop...  And blindfolded Lowell and Norman are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the cloud of dust without sight...  The lanky cameraman is stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men guarding a small stone house, and inside... 
INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY 
A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table... It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls.  A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner.  A torn poster of the Seychelles is on one wall.  Another Gunman stands by a window.  Lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table... 
THE SHEIKH Coffee? 
LOWELL Yeah...  Thank you. 
THE SHEIKH How have you liked your stay? 
LOWELL (droll) What I've seen...I've liked. 
The Sheikh smiles.  And the smile passes as quickly as it came.  A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse is put down. 
THE SHEIKH Please to explain, why I should agree to interview...with pro-Zionist American media? 
LOWELL Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America.  And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face. (confident) That's why. 
And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come here voluntarily. 
THE SHEIKH Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first.  Then I decide if I grant the interview. 
LOWELL (blunt) No.  We don't do that. (beat) You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace.  So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity.  You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America. 
The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying him.  And Lowell "closes": 
LOWELL (cont'd) So.  Mr. Wallace.  Should he get on a plane or not? 
The Sheikh thinks it over and then... 
THE SHEIKH Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow. 
LOWELL That's good.  That works. (after a beat) Uh, you know, I want to ask you something...I know it sounds odd...but... 
It's quiet...too quiet... 
LOWELL (CONT'D) Hello, Sheikh...? (no answer) Hello, Sheikh...? 
Silence.  He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  He lifts it.  And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone. The house empty.  Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left there, standing by the door still in his blindfold... 
LOWELL (CONT'D) Norman. 
NORMAN What?  What? 
LOWELL Take your blindfold off. 
The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian- American. 
LOWELL (CONT'D) (sarcastic) Welcome to the world. 
Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local current at an electrical outlet. 
NORMAN Fluctuating all over the place.  Anywhere we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable gennies and we'll run cable... 
Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding height.  Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed mosques.  A moment of triumph.  He dials his cell phone... 
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) Hello? 
LOWELL (into phone) Mike, it's me.  We're on... 
Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.  Now she takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey. Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver. 
WIGAND (cont'd) Okay, baby? 
INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING 
Jeffrey, Liane and the two Girls silently eating dinner, Deborah in a bathrobe. 
DEBORAH Can I go to dance tomorrow?  I'm better... 
LIANE ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after... 
WIGAND I can take her. 
LIANE Don't you have to be at the office? 
WIGAND (instead, getting up) Is there any more rice...? 
LIANE (nods) Yes, it's on the stove... 
He goes into the kitchen, to the stove, seeing... 
LIANE (cont'd) Do you want more rice? 
DEBORAH Maybe later. 
LIANE How about you? 
BARBARA I'll take some. 
WIGAND Instant rice...? 
BARBARA Can I go over to Janeane's house? 
LIANE I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...? 
WIGAND Try the car. 
And Liane going outside... 
EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - EVENING 
She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup holders.  She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take... 
LIANE Uh, what are those boxes? 
WIGAND I'm going to the store.  You need anything? 
LIANE What do you need at the store? 
WIGAND Soy sauce... 
LIANE Right now? 
WIGAND (meaning in the car) That's my stuff from the office... 
LIANE Why did you take your stuff from the office? 
WIGAND (simply) I didn't want to leave it there... 
LIANE (confused) I don't understand. 
WIGAND (matter of fact) I got fired this morning...  Where else am I gonna take it? 
LIANE Why?  Who said? 
WIGAND (specifically) Thomas Sandefur... 
LIANE (stunned, fearful) What are we supposed to do...?  What about our medical coverage; what about our health?  What about our car payments? The payments on this house? 
He looks at her.  There's an unspoken moment when it seems he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...  But she doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes... 
WIGAND (a beat, specific) There's a severance agreement...  It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... (beat) Sure you don't need anything? 
LIANE No, thank you. 
She's stunned.  He leaves.  And as Liane's completely still, her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns into CAMERA towards him to do that.  But he's driven off down the street. 
LIANE (cont'd) Jeffrey...! 
INT. ANOTHER HOUSE IN BAALBEK - DAY 
LOWELL ...everyone thinks Canadian Mounties ride horses and rescue ladies from rapids, Mike.  They backed locals in Oka in a fight with Mohawks over building a golf course on their burial site.  They beat up protesters at Kanasake... (pause) Where'd you hear that? 
The other phone on a nightstand rings...  A Woman in her forties, SHARON TILLER, enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her teeth.  She answers it... 
LOWELL (cont'd) (droll) Oh, someone took a poll?  "Are all things Canadian boring...?" 
SHARON (to Lowell) It's Stuart...he's in Mexico City... 
LOWELL Let me call you back... 
He takes up the line...listening... 
LOWELL (CONT'D) Yeah, Stuart...  What New York bank? 
A young Man in his early twenties wanders in... 
JAKE Hey Dad...Sharon... 
Lowell waves at JAKE, his son. 
SHARON (to Jake) No classes this morning? 
LOWELL Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch? 
JAKE I don't have to be there until ten- thirty. 
Lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper. And another young Man, in his early twenties, with long hair comes strolling in, Sharon's son, JOSIAH. 
JOSIAH Hi Mom, Lowell... 
Lowell, still on the phone, waves to him. 
SHARON Hi, sweetheart... 
Josiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports section Jake is reading...  Another line rings, Sharon getting it.  The Boys, used to them, get up, and leave... 
LOWELL (into phone) Will independent sources corroborate that? 
SHARON Hello?  Yeah... 
EXT. THE BERKELEY HOUSE - MORNING 
The Boys coming out of the house together...  And seeing the BOX by the door... 
LOWELL'S SON (shouts back inside) Dad, you got a box out here... 
And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the Berkeley street.  The box left waiting by the door. 
LOWELL (looking at her itinerary) Let me see this...  No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times. 
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - MORNING 
SHARON (into phone) I can't...  I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow. 
Lowell comes with the box back to bed.  He's already unwrapped it.  Inside are stacks of papers...  He looks at the box cover.  No return address.  An anonymous sender; not unusual for him.  He casually looks through the papers. 
SHARON (CONT'D) Two p.m.  Great.  Bye-bye. (hangs up) 
LOWELL (reading) ..."ignition propensity?" (to Sharon) ...you understand any of this...? 
He gives her some papers.  We see formulas...scientific data in tables... 
SHARON ...no...this looks like a table of temperatures...  Who's this from? 
LOWELL (shrugs) ...it's anonymous.  References to "P.M." (motions) It's got to be Philip Morris, huh? 
SHARON I have to take a shower. 
As he looks at the papers, Sharon goes into the bathroom... 
INT. THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION AGENCY, CAFETERIA, WASHINGTON - DAY 
We see a MAN in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting paged in a crowded cafeteria.  An old 1930's WPA mural on the wall...  His pager goes off... 
Doug Oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay phones and dials. 
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, DEN - BERKELEY - MORNING 
The phone rings.  Lowell picks it up... 
LOWELL Yeah. 
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) (to the Lawyers) Jeff's a premiere golfer...  What are you, a two handicap? 
WIGAND (precise) Seven... 
THOMAS SANDEFUR (to lawyer) And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us.  He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met.  It's spooky how he can concentrate. 
WIGAND I'd rather play than talk about it. (beat) What did you want to see me about?  I don't like being back here. 
Sandefur smiles, used to him. 
THOMAS SANDEFUR Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying...social skills...  Jeffrey just charges right ahead. (smiles, after a beat) Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff... 
WIGAND Chapter and verse. 
THOMAS SANDEFUR (nods) Yeah, I know you do... (beat) You know, I came up through sales.  One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep. (beat) I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence... 
And there's a warning behind it... 
WIGAND (contained) Is that a threat? 
THOMAS SANDEFUR ...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny...any more than are one's family matters... 
WIGAND (quietly) You threatening my family, now, too? 
THOMAS SANDEFUR Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff. (a beat) About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion... 
WIGAND "Research..." (smile + scorn) You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil... 
THOMAS SANDEFUR That's why we hire scientists... 
WIGAND (interrupts, direct) Okay. (a beat, honest) I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements.  I was paid well for my work.  The health and welfare benefits are good.  The severance package is fair.  I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't. 
THOMAS SANDEFUR I appreciate all that, Jeff.  But, upon reflection...we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you. 
And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room... 
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) So we've drafted a supplement to your agreement...it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is "confidential."  Nobody will be able to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I didn't know that was a secret..." (beat) We're very serious about protecting our interests. (a beat) We'd like you to sign it. 
And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it... 
WIGAND (a beat) And if I don't? 
A LAWYER (speaking for Sandefur) If we "arrive" at the conclusion you're acting in bad faith?  We would terminate, right now, payouts under your severance package.  You and your family's medical benefits.  And initiate litigation against you, Mr. Wigand. 
WIGAND Dr. Wigand. 
A LAWYER (a beat) Dr. Wigand...after you've examined the document, you will see it is in your own best interest and you'll sign it. 
Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.  And we see on his face the true nature of this man. 
WIGAND So, what you are saying is:  it isn't enough that you fired me.  For no good reason!  Now you question my integrity? On top of the humiliation of being fired? You threaten me?!  You threaten my family?! (beat) It never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement... (turning, to Sandefur) But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and Brown & Williamson, too...  Fuck me? (a beat) Well, fuck you!! 
And with that he gets up, and leaves...  And it's quiet... 
A LAWYER I'm not sure he got the message... 
THOMAS SANDEFUR (with total confidence) Oh, I think he did. 
EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY 
Wigand picks up the phone and dials. 
INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY 
They've finished lunch.  Wallace and Hewitt are turned to talk to Sam Cohn and an older writer as suddenly Lowell's cell phone rings. 
LOWELL (answering) Yeah... 
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) ...you fucked me! 
LOWELL Who is this? 
EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY 
WIGAND (crazed) ...protect your sources...!  You screwed me!  You sold me out! 
INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY 
LOWELL What are you talking about?  Where are you? 
EXT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY 
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) ...and my little girl has acute asthma... Deborah.  My eldest daughter. 
INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUISVILLE - REAR TWO SHOT - MORNING 
The Girls are gone.  We enter mid-scene.  Lowell's still in the back seat... 
WIGAND (CONT'D) And, I'm unemployed.  So I have to protect my medical coverage. (the bottom line; turning to look at Lowell in the rear seat) ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it. 
LOWELL They're afraid of you, aren't they? 
WIGAND They should be. 
The sound of the rain... 
LOWELL (after a beat, trying to make it easier for him) Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement? 
WIGAND (guarded) Like what? 
LOWELL Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson? 
WIGAND (a beat) Johnson & Johnson.  Union Carbide in Japan.  I was general manager and director of new products.  I speak Japanese.  I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer.  All health- related. (wry) What else?  Outside the "zone"...? 
LOWELL I don't know...you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi-finals? 
Wigand smiles...as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror. A subtle connection...  It passes... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. WIGAND'S CAR - WIDE FRONTAL - DAY 
Jeff's car in the field, the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock behind.  The rain stopped.  Steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot.  Lowell's in the front seat.  And we get the feeling they've been talking for hours... 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Just give me an example... 
WIGAND For example.  James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson...when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA...  He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him.  He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America.  Instantly.  And then he developed the safety cap...  Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right?  But he's also a man of science.  He's not going to allow his company...to put on the shelf...a product that might hurt people. (sarcastic) Not like the Seven Dwarfs... 
LOWELL Seven dwarfs? 
WIGAND The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...they got up in front of Congress that time...it was on television... 
LOWELL ...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease... 
WIGAND It was on C-SPAN.  Yeah. 
LOWELL Okay, so, here you are...you go to work for tobacco. (after beat) You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values.  You go to tobacco...  Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume.  Go to a lot of golf tournaments.  The hell with everything else. (beat) What are you doing?  Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place? 
WIGAND (deadly honest) I can't talk about it.  The work I was supposed to do...might have had some positive effect.  I don't know...it could have been beneficial. (bitterness there) Mostly, I got paid a lot.  I took the money.  My wife was happy.  My kids had good medical.  Good schools.  Got a great house. (simply) I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...? 
He looks at Lowell, as if needing validation... 
LOWELL Nothing's wrong with that.  That's it; you're making money...you're providing for your family?  What could be wrong with that? 
It's quiet.  After some moments... 
WIGAND I've always thought of myself...as a man of science.  That's what's wrong with it. 
LOWELL Then...you're in a state of conflict, Jeff. 
Jeffrey doesn't say anything. 
LOWELL (CONT'D) Because, look, here's how it lays out: if you got vital, insider stuff the American people for their welfare really do need to know...and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing.  On the other hand, if you want to honor this agreement, then that's simple.  You do so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing. There's only one guy who can figure that out for you.  And that's you.  All by yourself. 
Lowell's evenhanded...is it too evenhanded?  As Wigand contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.  Then Wigand sees the time... 
WIGAND I've got to go pick up the girls.  They only had half a day... 
Lowell nods.  Jeffrey starts the car.  The windshield wipers screech on a dry window.  Their eyes meet.  As they drive off...we HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock. 
INT. A KITCHEN AREA, CBS OFFICES, NEW YORK - DAY 
We've entered mid-scene...  A monitor on a cart plays a 1/2- inch VCR of a C-SPAN broadcast.  Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... in front of a bas relief of the American eagle.  Each in turn swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not, etc.... 
LOWELL (OVER) He referred to this...the Seven Dwarfs... 
MIKE WALLACE (OVER) What "Seven Dwarfs?" 
LOWELL (OVER) The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this...  Said they should be afraid of him...  I assume, afraid of what he could reveal. (to Staff Lawyers) Now, you tell me.  What does this guy have to say that threatens these people? 
And, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with two staff Lawyers, MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS, sitting around a workstation used as an improvised eating area. 
Beyond them are the "60 MINUTES" offices, workstations, piles of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling, all tuned to CBS programming... 
WIGAND ...okay. 
LOWELL (after a beat) Makes you feel good?  Putting what you know to use? 
Jeffrey's impressed by Lowell's perceptivity... 
WIGAND How'd you know that, Lowell? 
LOWELL It's obvious, isn't it? 
He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep. 
LOWELL (CONT'D) Hello.  You there 
WIGAND Yeah...  Look, thanks for talking.  I'm sorry I woke you up. 
LOWELL It's okay. 
Jeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up...but the phone RINGS right away. 
WIGAND Lowell...? 
But there's thick silence. 
WIGAND (CONT'D) Who is this?  Do not call here!  Do not... 
They hang up.  And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE. He hangs up.  And as he sits in the patch of light from a street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all night guarding his family... 
INT.  THEIR BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
And past Liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the trapezoid of light.  And as we DOLLY along her side, we come upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction to his raging on the phone.  She's far from "OKAY." 
INT. A JAPANESE RESTAURANT, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 
And we see Lowell and Wigand sitting in their stocking feet at a traditional Japanese table in a private screened room... A traditionally-dressed Japanese Waitress waiting to take their order...  Wigand conversing with her in Japanese... 
The Waitress formally nods, and leaves... 
LOWELL What did you get us? 
WIGAND Tempura... 
And Wigand drinks some more saki. 
WIGAND (cont'd) The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor...Marcus? 
LOWELL Marcuse.  Yeah.  He was my mentor.  He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s...and on me, personally. 
WIGAND Next to your father? 
LOWELL My father?  What the hell's that got to do with my father? 
WIGAND Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions? 
LOWELL You charge by the hour? 
WIGAND My father was a mechanical engineer...most ingenious man I ever knew. 
LOWELL Well, my father left us when I was five- years old.  He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew...  Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.  If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired. 
WIGAND Why? 
LOWELL They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you.  I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand? 
WIGAND (concedes) I drink.  A couple of occasions more than I should have. (thinks) I was cited for shoplifting once.  But it was a mistake... (hesitant, after a beat) I pushed Liane one time.  We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. (out of the blue) I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself.  And I don't like to be pushed around! 
LOWELL I'm not pushing you around! (after a beat) I'm asking you questions. 
WIGAND I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?  I could be anything.  Right?  Anything worth putting on between commercials... 
LOWELL (honest) ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities. (beat) To me?  You are not a commodity.  What you are is important. 
And he's begun to consciously or unconsciously "sell"... 
LOWELL (cont'd) You go public and thirty-million people hear what you got to say, nothing, I mean nothing, will ever be the same again. 
Wigand doesn't react. 
LOWELL (cont'd) You believe that? 
WIGAND (skeptical) No. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER) Richard Scruggs... 
LOWELL ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not? 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (nods) That's right... 
LOWELL (after a beat) Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman? 
LOWELL Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection. 
MOTLEY It could work.  If it's public record, it's public record. 
LOWELL Yeah, and he's going to need legal representation. 
MOTLEY He sure as hell will. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (a beat) Has he decided to go public?  Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know...  Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him.  So, is your man truly committed? 
LOWELL Well, actually, no.  Well, he's on the fence.  That's the point. 
Scruggs and Motley exchange a look...  Motley shrugs... 
RICHARD SCRUGGS Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do... 
LOWELL Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him?  How do you want to do it? 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (no nonsense) It would be better if he called us. 
LOWELL Yeah. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS Alright? 
LOWELL Okay.  Thank you. 
At this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the prospect of Jeffrey Wigand.  Scruggs disconnects. 
LOWELL (cont'd) Shit... 
INT. CBS EDITING SUITE, NEW YORK - DAY 
LOWELL (contemplating phone; to Debbie re:  show) Oh, we need cops on the street.  We don't need them on horses. 
DEBBIE DELUCA I don't know what he was thinking. 
LOWELL Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish? 
DEBBIE DELUCA Alright, alright. 
LOWELL Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself! 
TIGHTEN on mounted New Orleans police at crime scene, herding crowd. 
INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, KITCHEN - TWILIGHT 
Liane cooking dinner, making pasta.  Ingredients, diced tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.  She's waiting for water to boil.  The kids are doing homework on the round table in the kitchenette.  It's an idle moment.  She's dazed-out watching them. 
DEBORAH What are you cooking? 
LIANE I'm cooking pasta primavera. 
DEBORAH Oh, I love that stuff. 
And now she hears from the basement the BELL RING on Jeffrey's computer.  It's a tiny bell, incessant...  She crosses to the basement stairs. 
LIANE I'm going to have to go downstairs. 
INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT 
Liane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer.  And she SEES an incoming E-mail icon - a large letter with wings - flying repetitively across the screen. 
The bell RINGING is louder.  She calls-up the E-mail...  On the screen in large RED letters: 
WE WILL KILL YOU.  WE WILL KILL ALL OF YOU.  SHUT THE FUCK UP. 
And now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and... 
LIANE Debbie, Barbara...  Debbie! 
EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING 
WIGAND Yes.  Yes, I do. (beat) Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...! 
And we hear Liane's voice from downstairs... 
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) (upset) I didn't tell you that so you could just pick it up and take it away.  Jeffrey! 
And we see Liane following FBI Agent #3, coming up the stairs from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's computer... 
WIGAND What's going on? 
LIANE I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you... 
Agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed by #2.  Jeffrey runs out after them. 
EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
WIGAND (outraged) You can't take that...  It's personal property...! 
FBI AGENT #2 (OR #3) We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat. 
WIGAND (after him) ...my files!  Personal correspondence... 
Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of their car.  And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie, comes out of the house. 
WIGAND (CONT'D) ...letters to my brother...my will. 
His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.  And the FBI are getting into their car.  And NEIGHBORS have come out, watching them.  Liane and the girls, standing halfway down the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.  She and Jeffrey look at each other.  Will she go to him or not?  She goes to him as he rises... 
WIGAND (cont'd) That computer has everything... 
FBI AGENT #2 You alright, Mr. Wigand? 
FBI AGENT #1 We need to take a look at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand. 
EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT 
LOWELL (interrupts) I'm telling you, your agents in that office are acting improperly!  Now, who are they trying to protect? 
And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the Bureau (FBI).  BILL ROBERTSON.  He's completely distracted, focused on agent travel orders... 
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) Let me tell you something, Lowell.  Look, look, look.  You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville.  I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX!  I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright?  When I get a chance, I'll give it a look... 
LOWELL (heated) You better take a good look!  Because I'm getting two things:  pissed off and curious!  Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire?  Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak? 
INT. BILL ROBERTSON'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON - NIGHT 
BILL ROBERTSON (beat) I'll give it a look. 
LOWELL You're getting my drift? 
BILL ROBERTSON I'll give it a look. 
He hangs up. 
INT. DINING ROOM, THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT 
And we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotel's dining room, having ordered dinner. 
LOWELL So, is everything okay? 
MIKE WALLACE How are the rooms?  Comfortable? 
LIANE (to Mike) Yes, very.  You know, I enjoy your work so much...when you're talking to somebody, I always feel like I'm right there. 
And she laughs... 
MIKE WALLACE Thank you got saying that... 
LOWELL Do you think we could talk about the taping?  Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order... 
MIKE WALLACE Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal... 
LIANE (not sure she quite heard) ...taping? (beat) What are you taping? 
WIGAND I'm doing an interview. 
LIANE (whispers) An interview!  Do you know what they will do to us...!  I thought...  Sorry. 
But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the dining room.  And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move. 
LOWELL (trying to intervene) Liane, this is a preliminary... (after a beat) You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for? 
INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE 
Scruggs' office is decorated with watercolors of Phantom jets and A-6s as Scruggs takes off his glasses... 
CHARLENE He's on line three. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR 
Jeffrey Wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with students... 
RICHARD SCRUGGS Hello. 
WIGAND Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand.  Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call... 
INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE 
RICHARD SCRUGGS My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness. (beat) If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you... 
WIGAND When should we do this? 
EXT. WIGAND'S HOUSE #2, LOUISVILLE - TWILIGHT 
Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.  Seeing a MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.  But the front door's open.  So instead of chasing after, he runs inside... 
INT. THE WIGAND'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY/TWILIGHT 
And he sees another Man is in the living room... 
WIGAND Who the hell are you?!  What are you doing in my house?! 
And he sees Lowell enter from the dining room... 
LOWELL It's okay, Jeff. 
SECURITY GUARD Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to... 
LOWELL (wry) It's okay.  You got your own security now... 
Wigand catches his breath. 
WIGAND Lowell, I can't afford -- 
LOWELL ...they "volunteered."  A friend owns a large security company. 
TALIFARO How are you doing, Mr. Wigand?  I'm Jon Talifaro.  There'll be three of us on detail. 
LIANE (crossing through) I'm going to the store.  Please explain our new "houseguests" to your children. 
And Wigand looks at Lowell...  Barbara comes into the living room and holds onto her father's leg. 
WIGAND I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi... 
LOWELL I heard. 
WIGAND I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation.  So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition... 
LOWELL I know.  I'm going to go there tonight... 
WIGAND Did you have a good day? 
DEBORAH Yes, I did.  I had a great day. 
WIGAND Coffee, Lowell? 
LOWELL Yeah. (to kids) Want to play that game we were playing before?  You know, I think you got it up to five.  I was ahead of you. 
She goes over and holds his hand.  And as he holds her hand, seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance connects with Lowell... 
INT. THE KITCHEN, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking by.  And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes, silently wiping off the sink.  There's a pall you could cut with a knife.  A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden...  He stops to wash his hands in the sink. 
LIANE Please don't wash your hands in the sink. 
WIGAND Where should I wash them? 
LIANE Use the bathroom. 
WIGAND What's the difference... 
LIANE That's for food. 
WIGAND (smiles, wry) Yeah, great. 
LOWELL I heard about the Kentucky gag order... 
WIGAND I don't know what to do. 
And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their coats...  He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship passing by.  He watches its slow progress... 
And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  And Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside Lowell... 
EXT. COURTHOUSE, CANTY STREET, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing Canty Street to intercept him.  And we SEE the lot is jammed with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.  Some hang out by their cars, killing time.  It's a tailgate party.  Beyond them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the media circus.  They're all here for Jeff's deposition.  The scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign "Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"...into which Motley enters... 
EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Jeffrey contemplating. 
INT. COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
One TOBACCO LAWYER, an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is on his cell phone... 
TOBACCO LAWYER (into phone) Hold on a second... (seeing Motley enter; to Jr. Lawyer) Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he expects his witness to appear or not...? 
JR. LAWYER crosses to Motley. 
EXT. SCRUGGS' HOUSE, DOCK - DAY 
Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  Trying to decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  A moment.  He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.  Then. it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  Time seems to slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally and historically... 
WIGAND (severely conflicted) I can't seem to find...the criteria to decide.  It's too big a decision to make without being resolved...in my own mind. 
They're quiet.  Jeffrey, getting nowhere.  Lowell offers... 
LOWELL Maybe things have changed... 
Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  And something just got resolved.  He asks Lowell, rhetorically... 
WIGAND What's changed? 
LOWELL (unsure) You mean...since this morning? 
WIGAND No.  I mean since whenever... 
Nothing's changed.  Wigand looks at them.  He found his own answer. 
WIGAND (CONT'D) Fuck it.  Let's go to court. 
And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat flawed, very courageous man... 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (to unseen staff) Dr. Wigand would like to leave now. 
And there's a sudden flurry of activity.  Jeffrey and Scruggs walk to a Mississippi State Police car.  Lowell gets into his car and drives away, separately.  Police, State Officials, run to their cars.  Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's car pulls into position. 
INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY 
in the back seat with Scruggs.  The driver's a State Policeman.  Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.  It's all heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.  And he exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus... 
EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging across Canty Street by their cars.  And now they see the police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards the courthouse.  The caravan stops.  First, Scruggs gets out. A moment, then Jeffrey appears.  And the Reporters pounce on Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him through the crowd...  Moore appears at courtroom door (already there).  And as he's whisked away into the courtroom. 
INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  Cell phones are hung up.  Newspapers are put away.  Jackets are donned.  This is now very serious business.  Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on him. 
MOTLEY Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at that table over there.  I'm going to start as fast as possible.  I don't want to give them a chance to get another restraining order, okay?  Let's go. 
MICHAEL MOORE Good luck, Doc. 
Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.  He settles in. 
STENOGRAPHER Please stand.  Raise your right hand... Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
WIGAND I do. 
STENOGRAPHER You may be seated. 
MOTLEY You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under oath.  This is a sworn deposition. There's no judge.  It's not a trial. (understatement of the century) Will you state your name for the record. 
WIGAND (after a beat) Jeffrey S. Wigand. 
Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence.  And we SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT. 
Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states "I believe that nicotine is not addictive."  Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states "I believe he perjured himself."  Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "...the whole line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all swearing that."  And Wigand says off-screen with great emphasis "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT"...and it cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "FELT" resound and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew. We're a nicotine delivery business."  We see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity that's stirring and beautiful... 
EXT. LOUISVILLE - DUSK 
We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown Louisville. 
INT. THE RENTAL CAR - NIGHT 
It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security men.  He's coming home under the cover of darkness.  They pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder.  Jeffrey turns to stare at it.  They turn off onto city streets and stop at a light.  Jeffrey's nervous.  Jeffrey instinctively turns.  A Police Car stops alongside.  The Policeman looks at him. Eyes meet.  Jeffrey looks away.  The signal takes forever. It changes.  And as the Police Car moves off... 
EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
The car's stopped at the curb.  Jeffrey gets out.  He starts up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses the lawn to intercept him... 
And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home... 
INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
The house is quiet, dark.  Too quiet.  Too dark.  Something isn't right.  He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the master bedroom.  The lights are on.  Both rooms are empty. He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for him...  He opens it.  He sits heavily in a chair, reading the note.  The Security Guard peers...  And as Jeffrey sits in the silent house, the hero come home... 
INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM, CBS - DAY 
We're at a table.  Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while HELEN CAPERELLI, CBS GENERAL COUNSEL, enters with the President of CBS News, ERIC KLUSTER. 
HELEN CAPERELLI Shall I send for coffee?  Sorry I'm late. 
MIKE WALLACE No, no, we're fine... 
HELEN CAPERELLI Are you sure? 
Also there is Don Hewitt.  Caperelli is too well put together, too practiced, too polished. 
They nod.  They don't need coffee. 
HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D) Alright, I thought we'd get together because there's a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently, "tortious interference." (beat) If two people have an agreement, like a confidentiality agreement, and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party can be sued for damages for interfering...hence, "tortious interference." 
DON HEWITT Interfering?  That's what we do. 
LOWELL I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time.  This is a news organization.  People are always telling us things they shouldn't.  We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest...  And if it is, we air it. 
MIKE WALLACE After we corroborate it.  That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. (impatient, now) Anything else? 
HELEN CAPERELLI And "60 Minutes'" verification is exact. And precise.  And I don't think it would hurt to make sure you're right...on this one. 
DON HEWITT Why?  You think we have liability? What's the CBS News' position, Eric? 
ERIC KLUSTER There's a possibility, it's rather remote... 
HELEN CAPERELLI But one we have to check on, Mike.  I've retained outside counsel to do exactly that.  On a segment, I might add, that's already rife with problems... 
LOWELL What does that mean?  "Rife with -- ?" 
HELEN CAPERELLI I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand. 
LOWELL No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him... 
HELEN CAPERELLI (cuts in) And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity. 
LOWELL (trying to control his anger) His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi. 
HELEN CAPERELLI (historic) Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard...for everyone else... 
Whatever that means... 
LOWELL (wry) Well, as a "standard"...I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?" 
HELEN CAPERELLI Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid...the greater the truth, the greater the damage. 
LOWELL Come again? 
HELEN CAPERELLI They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them.  If he lied, he didn't disclose their information.  And the damages are smaller. 
LOWELL Is this "Alice in Wonderland"? 
MIKE WALLACE You said "on this one."  What about "this one"? 
And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice.  After a beat. 
HELEN CAPERELLI (familiar, seductive) If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike...but, if it did.  And we aired this segment?  And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson?  I think we could be at grave risk. 
DON HEWITT CBS does not do that.  And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?! 
LOWELL No, I'm questioning your hearing!  You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference."  I hear...  "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse."  I hear...  "Shut the segment down.  Cut Wigand loose.  Obey orders.  And fuck off...!"  That's what I hear. 
DON HEWITT You're exaggerating! 
LOWELL I am?  You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out.  To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do.  I deliver him.  He sits.  He talks.  He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement.  And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history.  And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth?  Yes. Is it newsworthy?  Yes.  Are we gonna air it?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he's not telling the truth?  No.  Because he is telling the truth.  That's why we're not going to air it.  And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets! 
DON HEWITT You are a fanatic.  An anarchist.  You know that?  If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show.  But oh, no, not you.  You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk! 
LOWELL C'mon, what are you?  And are you a businessman?  Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living... 
MIKE WALLACE Lowell. 
LOWELL (runs on) "Put the corporation at risk"...?  Give me a fucking break! 
MIKE WALLACE Lowell. 
LOWELL These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do...on the line! 
MIKE WALLACE Lowell! 
LOWELL What? 
MIKE WALLACE I'm with Don on this. 
And there it is. 
EXT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - AFTERNOON 
We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard... She turns, seeing him standing behind her... 
After a moment.  She knows. 
SHARON What's wrong? 
LOWELL They're killing the Wigand interview... 
SHARON What?! 
LOWELL They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone. 
SHARON (beat) What are you and Mike going to do? 
LOWELL I'm alone on this... 
SHARON (beat) Oh, baby... 
And the phone RINGS...  Sharon goes in the house to get it... She comes back out... 
SHARON (CONT'D) (after a beat) Jeffrey Wigand... 
INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON 
LOWELL Jeffrey... 
INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
And we see Wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch in a hotel room.  And we see his belongings, clothing, some boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his world, are around the room. 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Jeffrey, how are you?  How's the family, okay? 
WIGAND There is - there is no family. 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What do you mean there is no family? 
WIGAND Liane has filed for divorce... 
INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON 
And Lowell's dead quiet. 
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
WIGAND And, so, I moved out...  I see the girls a couple of days a week... 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (concerned) Where you staying now? 
WIGAND (sarcastic) Our favorite hotel, honey...  I checked into Room 930.  Odd choice?  Huh? 
And we don't know what he means by that... 
CLOSE on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.  He comes upon a rugged-featured man, JIM COOPER from The New York Times, sitting next to Charlie. 
JIM COOPER Hey, Lowell. 
LOWELL How are you, Jim? 
JIM COOPER Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there. 
Lowell looks at Cooper quizzically. 
LOWELL Really?  Hi, Joan. 
Just then Jim's wife enters.  They exchange greetings. 
JIM COOPER Hi, baby. 
LOWELL Catch you later. 
Cooper and his wife leave.  Charlie and Lowell are alone in the crowded bar. 
LOWELL (CONT'D) When's your deadline? 
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Monday. 
LOWELL Push it. 
CHARLIE PHILLIPS What?  Forget it. 
LOWELL It's a smear campaign, Charlie. 
CHARLIE PHILLIPS It's drawn from a selectively circulated... 
LOWELL (cuts in) Oh, it's real selective...about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book. 
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented. 
LOWELL And it's bullshit.  And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face? 
CHARLIE PHILLIPS I'll take a look at what you got.  But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so. 
That's the way it lays.  In a different, personal tone... 
CHARLIE PHILLIPS (cont'd) Are you all right? 
LOWELL Yeah.  Catch you later. 
INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY 
And we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of coffee... 
SANDRA SUTHERLAND Officer Murabchick? 
He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left of him. 
SANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd) Officer Muravchick.  How are you?  I'm Sandra Sutherland. 
POLICEMAN How do you do? 
SANDRA SUTHERLAND Fine, thank you.  I'm doing a background check.  Mind if I sit down? 
INT. COURTROOM, LOUISVILLE - LATE AFTERNOON 
An older Man is on the bench.  He's just recessed his court. As everybody streams out, going against the tide is Jack Palladino.  He approaches the judge, crossing to a side door... 
PALLADINO Your honor, could I have a word with you? You presided in a dispute over support payments... 
INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY 
POLICEMAN Jeffrey Wigand?  Yeah, I cited him. 
INT. EDITING ROOM, CBS - DAY 
DAN RATHER (on monitor) CBS is under criticism, because the CBS News program "60 Minutes" will not be presenting an interview... 
Lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.  Tony gets a call as Hewitt enters. 
DON HEWITT What the hell are you doing? 
LOWELL What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm editing. 
DON HEWITT No, not that.  I'm talking about the Associated Press.  They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I.  Did you tell them that we were lying? 
INT. A BAR, LOUISVILLE - DAY 
And we see Jeffrey in a quiet Bar.  The television's on, the sound low, the midday news.  As Jeffrey looks up and sees his photograph on TELEVISION.  In his LOCAL WORLD the impact is: 
LOCAL NEWSCASTER And in local news, WLKO Louisville has gained access to a five-hundred-page dossier on former Brown & Williamson research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing charges of spousal abuse, shoplifting... 
And Jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of him. 
WE'RE LOOKING AT MIKE WALLACE SITTING IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP ON "60 MINUTES," ON A TELEVISION... 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
And Jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel, watching the show... 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "...thousands of documents from inside the tobacco industry have surfaced over the past year, documents that appear to confirm what a former..." 
And as we look at Jeffrey's face, set in stone... 
INT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "...US Surgeon General and the current head of the Food and Drug Administration have been saying.  We learned of..." 
INT. DON HEWITT'S HOUSE, THE HAMPTONS - NIGHT 
And Don Hewitt in his house in the Hamptons, alone in his bedroom, watching the show... 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "...a tobacco insider who could tell us whether or not the tobacco industry has been leveling with the public..." 
INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "...that insider was formerly a highly- placed executive with a tobacco company..." 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "...but we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco, addiction and public health he might be able to offer. Why?  Because he had to sign a confidentiality agreement with the tobacco company he worked for..." 
INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT 
Mike Wallace is in his study, watching the show alone.  As we slowly move in on Mike, seeing himself on television... 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "The management of CBS has told us that knowing he had that agreement..." 
And the look on his face says:  HE DOES NOT LIKE THIS. 
INT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT 
Lowell silently watching the broadcast... 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "...if were to broadcast an interview with him, CBS could be faced with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit..." 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
Jeffrey, watching the show... 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes," from the interview with Wigand...) "The fact is, we are not allowed even to mention his name or the name of the company he worked for and, of course, we cannot show you his face...  '...and your confidentiality agreement with...(blip) is still in force?'" 
And all we can hear is an ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE and the BLANKED-OUT image of a man... 
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) "Yes, it is." 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "So, what are they gonna do?  Sue you for making this appearance?" 
WIGAND "I would bet on it." 
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes") "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..." 
Jeffrey, motionless...  A man, no longer with a face or a voice...  And as he gets up, and quietly turns off the television... 
INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT, LATER 
Wallace, hasn't moved, still in his chair.  He stares, ignoring the CBS programming, on the phone, making a call... 
EXT. THE CARIBBEAN BEACH - NIGHT 
Lowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings. 
LOWELL Yeah. 
MIKE WALLACE You disappeared on me.  How long you staying? 
LOWELL (absurd) I disappeared on you? 
LOWELL No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone! 
INT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
THE HOTEL MANAGER (at the door, to Jeffrey, loud) He told me to tell you, to get on...the fucking phone...! 
And even he's surprised by his language.  And suddenly Jeffrey gets up, unlatches the door, grabs the phone from the Hotel Manager.  Wigand in the hotel corridor, Lowell standing knee-deep in the water... 
WIGAND (on the phone, angry) You manipulated me into this...! 
LOWELL That's bullshit, Jeff! 
WIGAND You greased the rails! 
LOWELL I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes.  I helped him to say yes. Alright.  You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all.  You got a mind of your own, don't you? 
WIGAND (running on) "Up to you, Jeffrey.  That's the power you have, Jeffrey.  Vital insider information the American public need to know."  Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around. 
LOWELL (running on) I fought for you...and I still fight for you. 
WIGAND You fought for me...?! (running on) ...you manipulated me...into where I am now...staring at the Brown & Williamson Building.  It's all dark.  Except the 10th floor!  That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life! 
LOWELL (beat) Jeffrey, where you going with this?  So where you goin'? (quiet) You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey.  You think about that.  You think about them. 
CLOSE ON JEFFREY:  standing in the room with the blowing curtains... 
LOWELL (CONT'D) I'm running out of heroes, man... (after a beat) Guys like you are in short supply. 
And for the first time, Wigand smiles. 
WIGAND (a beat, wry) Yeah, guys like you, too. 
And the grave situation passes. 
WIGAND (CONT'D) (after a beat) Where are you, anyway? 
LOWELL I'm on a leave of absence.  Forced vacation. 
WIGAND (a rare laugh, his sarcasm) You try and have a good time. 
LOWELL (droll) Yeah.  Yeah, I will. 
INT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT 
Sharon's cooking across the room...  And there's just the sound of the ceiling fan turning. 
LOWELL "I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'"  You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call.  Maybe Wigand's right.  Maybe I'm hooked.  What am I hooked on?  The rush?  "60 Minutes"? What the hell for?  Infotainment.  It's so fucking useless, all of it. 
SHARON (a beat) So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else. 
LOWELL Free press?  Press is free...for anyone who owns one.  Larry Tisch has a free press. 
SHARON Get some perspective, Lowell. 
LOWELL I got perspective. 
SHARON No, you do not. 
LOWELL From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures. 
SHARON You're not listening. (beat) Really know what you're going to do before you do it. 
And as the fan squeaks, turning...  Lowell stares at Sharon. 
WE SEE SNOW IS ON THE GROUND. 
EXT. LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY 
Between two curved colonnades of SNOW-covered trees drives a rental car.  CLOSER, it's Lowell.  His POV spots a dirty SUV and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out- of-context mountain town.  His pager beeps.  He looks at it. He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner of the Moose Lodge. 
DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone... 
LOWELL Patch him through. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER) Well, Lowell, you are not going to believe this... 
INT. A COURTROOM + ROTUNDA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
And we see the back of a crowded courtroom.  Richard Scruggs is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses, talking on his own cell phone. 
RICAHRD SCRUGGS The Governor of Mississippi is suing his own Attorney General...to abandon litigation against Big Tobacco... 
WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) "All of us did...there was this whole like of people, the whole line of CEOs up there, all swearing that." 
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT..." 
And the PAUSE after the word makes "FELT" resound, and as it CUTS TO Jeffrey ON CAMERA saying... 
WIGAND (CONT'D) "...that their representation..." 
And Lowell FREEZES after the image...  He gets up, looking out the window through the curtain with the spill from the neon motel sign.  Outside are horse trailers.  He goes back to watching the show...standing there...in touch with his own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him. Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with... 
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Hello? 
LOWELL Jim, it's Lowell. 
INT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT 
JIM COOPER Hey!  Where are you? 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (doesn't answer) Remember that night at P.J.'s?  You asked me if we were sitting on something "explosive"? (beat) Well, we're not "sitting on" it. (beat) CBS corporate leaned on CBS News which yanked an interview we did with a top- ranking tobacco scientist.  A corporate officer.  They are trying to close down the story. 
JIM COOPER (sarcastic) You mean, "60 Minutes" is letting CBS corporate decide what is or is not news? (beat) What's Wallace think about this, or Hewitt, or...? 
LOWELL How prominent?  What kind of placement? 
JIM COOPER Oh, c'mon, Lowell.  This is The New York Times.  I don't know... 
LOWELL Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know...they will not air an interview. 
JIM COOPER Call me back in ten. 
Lowell hangs up.  Re-dials. 
INT. DEBBIE DELUCA'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK - LATE NIGHT 
Debbie answers, intercutting with above... 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Debbie.  It's me... 
DEBBIE DELUCA Hi.  What time is it? 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Oh, it's late. 
DEBBIE DELUCA That I know.  When are you coming back? 
LOWELL I can't get out of here til mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night... (beat) Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi... 
DEBBIE DELUCA Okay.  Hold on a second...  What is it? 
INT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT 
Jim Cooper's workstation.  His phone rings.  He grabs it. 
JIM COOPER Hello? (beat) 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Lowell. 
JIM COOPER Alright, Lowell.  Page one.  Editorial's interested.  Let's talk. 
INT. MOTEL, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT 
LOWELL Here's how it works.  You ask me questions.  I tell you if you're wrong. 
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Okay. (pause) Lowell? 
LOWELL Yeah? 
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) You're sure you want to do this? 
LOWELL Why? 
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Hey, it doesn't work?  You've burned your bridges, man. 
LOWELL You ready...? 
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Okay...  About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision? 
No answer. 
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)(cont'd) Lowell? 
LOWELL Did I tell you you were wrong? 
DEBBIE DELUCA ...front page.  There's a picture of Wigand.  Article's entitled, "Getting Personal," by-lined to Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.  Wait, hold on a second, Lowell. 
Debbie hits "call waiting." 
DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd) Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I'll see if I can find him.  Hold on... (beat; to Lowell) Yeah, Don's looking for you... 
LOWELL Good. 
DEBBIE DELUCA The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower." 
INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING 
EXTREMELY CLOSE Lowell. 
DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) "...a close look at the file, and independent research by this newspaper into its key claims, indicates that many of the serious allegations against Mr. Wigand are backed by scant or contradictory evidence..." 
EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - MORNING 
As Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us, jumping into the cab... 
INT. DON HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY 
DON HEWITT The news division has been vilified in The New York Times, in print, on television, for caving to corporate interests! 
We PULL BACK and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's office... 
DON HEWITT (CONT'D) The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us! 
LOWELL (shouting) No, you fucked you!  Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it.  The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti- capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination!  And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else...do you need? 
And Hewitt, looking around. 
DON HEWITT Mike, you tell him... 
MIKE WALLACE (simply) You fucked up, Don. 
And Don's taken off stride... 
DON HEWITT (recovers fast) Hey, it's old news!  Stick with me.  Like always, we'll be okay.  These things have a half-life of fifteen minutes... 
MIKE WALLACE No, that's fame.  Fame has a fifteen- minute half-life... (droll) Infamy...lasts a little longer. 
Lowell looks at Wallace. 
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) We caved.  It's foolish.  It's simply dead wrong. (in his face, so there's no doubt) Now, this is what we're going to do. We're going over to Black Rock... 
INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON 
Jeff is in front of his class, teaching... 
WIGAND Okay, so let's get back to it.  Alright, now, what we saw there was... 
INT. LAX - ECU:  LOWELL - NIGHT 
Tired, his suitcase at his feet.  We don't know if he's coming or going.  He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted- than-not airport. 
LOWELL (into phone) They cancelled the six o'clock. (beat) I don't know why.  I'm on the 8:10.  I should be home...9:30.  I'll see you then.  Love ya'.  Bye... 
He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers sitting in it. 
MIKE WALLACE "CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast our original story and our interview with Wigand because they were worried about the possibility of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against us for tortious interference...  But now things have changed." 
INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S APARTMENT, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
A small apartment.  Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara.  And now we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing "60 Minutes" and... 
MICHAEL MOORE (on television) "...in my opinion, is an industry that has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the American public in history." 
Deborah looks proudly at her father. 
Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette.  He has stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway.  His kids can't see him.  We can.  And he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear.  And as he stands there, watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about most... 
INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE 
And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60 Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard and cane.  An airport cleaner stops to watch, too.  Lowell glances at him... 
Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually among them, watching his work. 
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, BERKELEY - NIGHT 
Sharon sits at the kitchen table.  She watches in a far corner a small countertop television.  It's "60 Minutes," the full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D." and on the top right, "PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN."  As Sharon continues watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional currents within her remaining unrevealed...

THE INFORMANT 
Written by

Based on the book by 
Kurt Eichenwald 
A SERIES OF GREEN/GOLD VERTICAL STREAKS Moving across the screen from right to left. We hear a happy and informative man's voice.. .We will come to know this voice as MARK WHITACRE'S... 
WHITACRE (V-0-) You know that orange juice you have every morning? You know what's in that? FREEZE on one of the green/gold streaks as it racks into to focus. We have been dollying through... 
1 EXTERIOR CORN FIELD 1 Hold on a single stalk of corn in the center of frame. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Corn. And we are off again, dollying past the green/gold streaks of 
HARVEST HIGH SEPTEMBER CORN. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) r And you know what's in the maple syrup you put on your pancakes? You know what makes it taste so good? 
FREEZE AGAIN ON A SINGLE STALK OF CORN 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Corn. Again, the dolly is on the move-- the corn plants strobe past. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) When you get grass stains on your good pants, you know why the detergent mom uses can get them clean again? 
FREEZE ON CORN STALK 
WHITACRE (V.0.) That's right. C2rn. A HUGE COMBINE enters frame and turns down a row. The camera follows it. We are in the middle of a massive corn field in SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. The wind creates swells in the corn like a great green and gold sea. The farm equipment accelerates as does Whitacre... 
Draft: 1/15/03 2. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) There's corn syrup in the capsules you takes for your allergies, com starch in my beer, even corn oil in the paint we're putting on the barn... Corn flies through the air and into the collecting bin. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) .Bacon and eggs is really just corn and corn when you think about what they feed the chickens and the pigs. And when you're good and help with the trash, you know what makes the big green bags biodegradeable? We reach the end of a row. The combine turns to harvest another row REVEALING... A PORSCHE 911 speeding down US HIGHWAY 36... 
2 INTERIOR PORSCHE 911- CONTINUOUS 2 WHITACRE, 33, drives his young son ALEXANDER, 6, to school. Whitacre is as happy as God makes creatures. Alexander sips his half-pint carton of ORANGE JUICE. 
WHITACRE Do you? Alexander hazards a guess. 
ALEXANDER Uh-huh. Corn. 
WHITACRE Corn starch. But, Daddy's company didn't come up with that one-- DuPont did... Whitacre tussles his hair. They drive by a GAS STATION in the middle of the cornfields. He continues his ode to corn in his head... 
WHITACRE (V.O.) Ethanol is made of corn; that's ADM. Car corn. Like gasoline. But they also use it for scotch, gin and vodka ...Corn and tonic... corn gimlet...corn on the rocks. 
Draft: 1/15/03 3. The car accelerates to pass a tanker truck with ADM: SUPERMARKET TO THE WORLD emblazoned on the side. The 911 is warped in the reflection... 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Porsche or Porsh-a. I've heard it both ways. Three years in Germany, I should know that. What's the German word for corn? The word I really like saying is "kugelschreiber." That's "pen"-- all those syllables just for "pen." 
A PEN SIGNS A LEDGER Whitacre signs in with the security gate at ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND headquarters in Decatur. A sprawling industrial facility that makes most of what America eats. Grain elevators, cooling towers, processing plants, loading docks and a six story concrete bunker of an office building. He parks his car in a monogrammed space. 
3 INTERIOR ADM HEADQUARTERS-CONTINUOUS 3 Whitacre walks across the open trading floor where soy and corn futures from around the world are displayed on a tote board and into his glass walled office. He has a kind word for everyone. Smile flashing like a casino sign. He sees his pal Kirk Schmidt from accounting... 
WHITACRE Hey there, howdy. Hey, Kirk, we got to get out and hit some balls ...Morning...Guten Tag... Whitacre scans the room full of busy co-workers. His secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, 35, wears earrings that are EARS OF CORN made of gold. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) What do they pay Kirk. . .What does a guy like that get...100K...I bet he gets a 100. He's just going to sit behind that desk and ride it into the future... 
LIZ TAYLOR Morning Mark...They have lysine results... She hands him a folder. He opens it and scans the data. He nods. 
Draft: 1/15/03 4.

4 INTERIOR LYSINE PLANT- A FEW MINUTES LATER 4 Whitacre walks among the giant fermenters-- he's joined by a DISCOURAGED FOREMAN. They check various gauges and dials showing proof of failure. 
DISCOURAGED FOREMAN We adjusted the dextrose again, but the vrus keeps showing up-Thought we had it surrounded this time. We're starting a new set of cultures... 
WHITACRE We'll Vet it. We just gotta stay after it. The things eat sugar and that's what we're giving them-- a warm place filled with sugar. They walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak. Each flask is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS. Whitacre watches. He focuses on one worker-- she's ASIAN. She adds some nutrients to the feed line. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) A positive mental attitude is a real important thing. They've done studies where heart patients who have people praying for them actually do better than ones who don't. There's science for you. The cheerleaders might make a difference in the game after all...How do you know what the electrical energy of a thought actually does when it's out there in the world? It's gotta go somewhere...so you might as well smile. Takes less muscles than frowning... Whitacre closes the door on the very loud room. 
5 INTERIOR ADM BOARDROOM- LATER 5 Whitacre sits with MICK ANDREAS, Vice Chairman, 45, and TERRY WILSON, 55, President. An overhead projector displays the desultory performance of Whitacre's division. 
AN DREAS The fucking thing is supposed to produce 113 thousand tons annually.

Draft: 1/15/03 5. 
WHITACRE Uh, um, well I met him a few weeks ago when he came over. And then, he called a couple of times... 
ANDREAS So, not very well? 
Draft: 1/15/03 10. 
R 
WHITACRE Very well? No, I can't really say that. Andreas ponders the situation. 
ANDREAS Okay, if you hear from him again-- talk him down on the price. I want you to find out the least amount of money he'd settle for. If we can get a bug that's resistant to the virus, it might be worth it...But, I want you to keep this quiet, if there is a mole, we don't want him to know we're onto him. 
10 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- EVENING 10 Whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light, looking at the foundation for the NEW HORSE STABLES being built across the road from the main house. There is not another home anywhere nearby. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) 
R This'd be a great place for some outlet stores... People would come from all over Southern Illinois and probably Missouri, too. Famous name brand labels and appliances at savings of up to fifty per cent every day. Maybe a food court with a Mexican place. . .After the stables, maybe a tennis court or a little pitch and putt by the pool-- that adds to resale value like nobody's business... Whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street light... 
WHITACRE (V.O.) The birds eat the bugs, the cars eat the birds, the rust eats the cars and the new construction eats the rust... Ginger interrupts Whitacre's grand plan from across the street... 
GINGER Corky, Alexander says there's a bat in his room.

11 INTERIOR ADM- MICK ANDREAS' OFFICE 11 Whitacre shakes his head in disbelief. He paces nervously. Stunned by the news. 
WHITACRE The FBI! God, no. Andreas and MARK CHEVIRON, 38, tell Whitacre of his upcoming FBI interview. Cheviron is a barrel chested, linebacker of a man. A former Decatur cop who is now Private Industry's version of a bouncer. 
WHITACRE I thought I was supposed to be getting him down on the price. That's what you told me to do and I was doing it. 
ANDREAS We're not gonna sit back and let the Japs fuck us sideways. 
WHITACRE 
(OFF CHEVIRON) I just don't understand, we weren't going to mention it and now he's in on it? 
ANDREAS Of course he's in. If we got a mole then it's a security issue... 
CHEVIRON I'll be sitting in with the FBI. 
WHITACRE But, I already told you guys everything I know. What's the point? Cheviron is annoyed by Whitacre's histrionics. 
CHEVIRON We don't like the idea of talking to the FBI anymore than you do. Look, they're just going to tape the guy's calls-- and ask you a few questions. No big deal. Whitacre shakes his head, even more upset. 
WHITACRE Questions, Jesus. 
Draft: 1/15/03 12. 
ANDREAS We know how the FBI works.. .We can control this. Whitacre has his doubts. 
12 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- DAY 12 GINGER is putting away groceries when the phone rings. 
GINGER 
(ANSWERING PHONE) Hello, Whitacres. 
13 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S OFFICE 13 Whitacre is on the phone-- pacing like a caged animal. 
WHITACRE Now, they've got the FBI in on it. First they tell me they're going to pay and be done with it, now they want me to talk to the FBI. 
14 INTERIOR KITCHEN-CONTINUOUS 14 She sits down-- uneasy. This isn't like him to be so upset. 
GINGER The FBI? Why do you need to talk to the FBI? It's their factory. Let them talk to the FBI. 
WHITACRE (O.S.) I'm really uncomfortable about this, baby. There are a lot of things going on here. 
GINGER What does that mean, "things?" 
WHITACRE I just mean we have to be careful. 
GINGER Whatever you do, Corky, no matter what's going on, just be honest with them and tell the truth. Tell the truth no matter what the truth is. 
Draft: 1/15/03 13. He considers her advice and hangs up the phone. Whitacre looks out the window at the cold, gray Autumn day and weighs his options. Leaves blow across the ADM parking lot. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) (he seems angry) It's spring time in Nigeria-- you can bet they're loving that. Sitting around watching the days get longer; watching the afternoon go by on their Rolexes and Cartiers. Everyone's just waiting on the mailman... while the poachers make the elephants extinct. 
ANGLE ON FBI FORM 302 The name "Mark Whitacre" is written across the top. 
15 INTERIOR ADM CONFERENCE ROOM- EVENING 15 SPECIAL AGENT BRIAN SHEPARD, 43, sits with Cheviron and a very anxious Mark Whitacre. Shepard wears a rumpled dark suit and tie from the day Jay Edgar Hoover set a dress code. He has been stationed in Decatur where the odd dead body in a river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state lines have made up the last fifteen years of his life. Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat. Cheviron on the other hand is an old hand at this. He watches Whitacre and says nothing. Shepard writes down everything. 
ANDREAS I want her to tell the FBI what they said. Andreas moves toward the phone. 
WHITACRE I don't want her talking to the FBI, definitely not. 
CHEVIRON Why not, Mark? Come on, if she's really in danger. 
ANDREAS Then I'll talk to her. Andreas picks up the phone. Whitacre doesn't want that either. 
WHITACRE She's scared enough. 
ANDREAS If someone's threatening her... A beat. Whitacre collapses-- there's more to this. 
WHITACRE Don't call her...No one's threatening. I, uh... A long painful beat. 
WHITACRE I made it up. I lied. There wasn't any threat. Cheviron shakes his head in disgust. 
CHEVIRON Christ, what a waste of time. Andreas lowers his gaze at Whitacre-- he wants an explanation. 
Draft: 1/15/03 18. 
WHITACRE I'm no good at this. The FBI guy really got to me last night. He's twisting in the wind. 
WHITACRE I figured if you guys thought my daughter was in danger you'd just pay Fujiwara and all this FBI stuff would go away. It was a stupid move on my part. Whitacre's ashamed. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Stupid, stupid move. He gets up and leaves in humiliation. He wanders through the lobby of ADM in a daze. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) What am I supposed to do? I didn't get the FBI involved-- I was told we were paying the money. It's like, `Whitacre go out for a long pass,' and then we run the ball. Look, I admitted I made a mistake, that's more than I can say for most people. Hey, when they found out that Mick's Dad, Dwayne, wrote a check to the Watergate Burglars-- did he admit it? Besides these guys probably own the FBI with the money they have. They probably wanted me to move into Dwayne's old house-- because they've got it wired like in a Crichton novel... He wanders into his office. 
LIZ TAYLOR Sid Hulse wants to know if you can have dinner at seven instead of seven-thirty and Marty Allison called... 
ANGLE ON A SHRIMP COCKTAIL Jump shrimp on shaved ice. 
Draft: 1/15/03 19. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) We're into shrimp now, fish, too. Tilapia, it's like Orange Roughie but lighter-they're growing out there next to the corn... 
20 INTERIOR COUNTRY CLUB OF DECATUR- NIGHT 20 Whitacre and a very done-up Ginger dine with SID HULSE, 35, the used car version of a lysine salesman at the Club. Mauve draped tables, botanical drawings of the state flower on the wall. Bow-tied wait staff patrol the diners with pitchers of ice water. Sid and Ginger chit-chat-- Mark is distracted. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) Someone told me they bugged the dining room-- the John, too. Might be paying off the waitresses here at the club. That's how business get done. Clients go to relieve themselves. ADM knows... 
GINGER (off her earrings) Mark got them abroad. 
SID HULSE Nigeria? Whitacre shoots him a look. 
WHITACRE Not funny, Sid. 
SID HULSE You're telling me. Sid laughs. Ginger doesn't get the joke. 
GINGER Mark's never been to Nigeria. 
ANGLE ON WHITACRE'S HAND UNDER THE TALE He covertly slides a business card into Ginger's hand. 
WHITACRE (O.S.) So, where are you off to tomorrow? 
GINGER'S POV OF THE CARD On the back is scribbled, "The FBI is coming at 10 PM." 
Draft: 1/15/03 20. 
SID HULSE West coast swing-- I gotta get out there and kick some Japanese butt. 
WHITACRE So, I'll see you in a couple of weeks. She's still digesting what's on the card-- trying to act natural. 
GINGER Then you guys can maybe have a chance to play some golf. Whitacre throws an arm around her. 
21 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S LINCOLN TOWN CAR- LATER 21 Ginger and Mark drive home in silence. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) There should be a TV show about a guy who calls home one day-- and he's there. He answers-- he's talking to himself only it's someone else. He's somehow divided into two and the second one of him drives away and the rest of the show is about him trying to find the guy... 
GINGER Should I get Alexander out of the house? 
WHITACRE It's not like that-- it'll be OK. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) What do they do in school to the kids who can't keep a secret-- no BMW for those boys. 
22 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- LATER 22 Ginger and Whitacre. Whitacre tries to plead his position to his wife-- it's not as black and white as she assumes. 
GINGER Just tell them everything. We'll leave. I don't like what this company is doing to you. 
(MORE) 
Draft: 1/15/03 21. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) It involves price fixing in the lysine business. I've been in several meetings with our Japanese and Korean competitors in the past few months where the sole purpose has been to fix prices. ADM made me go to these meetings. Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark. 
Draft: 1/15/03 25. 
WHITACRE That's why they wanted me to lie. Fujiwara's calling on my home line. But, so are the people we fix prices with. They didn't want you to hear those conversations so they told me to say the Fujiwara calls came in on the ADM line. But, I knew if you guys ever started looking at the records you'd see all these calls I have to Japan. And that's what scared me. Nobody has more calls than me. If you ever figured out about the price fixing, I'd be the fall guy. Shepard considers the explanation. 
SHEPARD Who told you to participate in these price fixing talks? Whitacre pauses, summons his conviction. 
WHITACRE I'm operating under the direction of Mick and Dwayne Andreas. 
26 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- ALEXANDER'S ROOM Ginger checks on her son. 
ALEXANDER Who's Dad talking to? 
GINGER A friend who needs his help. She walks down the hall pausing by a window. She can see the two men talking in the car. She turns off the light and gets into bed-- staring at the ceiling. 
27 INTERIOR SHEPARD'S CAR- LATER Shepard writes down everything. 
WHITACRE Mick and Cheviron had me call Fujiwara today and tell him to stop calling until things cool off. 
SHEPARD They told you to tell him to stop calling? 
Draft: 1/15/03 26. 
R- 
WHITACRE They're afraid of what you guys might find out. Can you give me a tape recorder? I can prove this if you give me a tape recorder. I'll take a polygraph if that helps. Shepard is out of pages in his notebook. 
SHEPARD I want to thank you for being honest with me tonight. 
WHITACRE You're not going to ask questions at ADM about all this? It'd be my job for sure. 
SHEPARD No, what was said here was confidential. I'm going to speak to my superiors Mark, and then we'll be in touch. Whitacre goes back inside his dark house and heads upstairs-- he seems unburdened. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) He seems like a real good guy...I mean just a straight shooter. I think we really got along-- I bet he wouldn't mind if I called him "Brian" instead of "Agent Shepard." "Bri." "Hey, Bri..." This must be very different for him. Talking to a guy like me instead of a bank robber or a drug dealer... 
ANGLE ON SHEPARD Struggling to read his notes in the car. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) I could see us fishing or whatever. What a good listener-- you don't meet one of those everyday. Shepard takes out his cell phone. We hear ringing on the other end. A sleepy voice answers. 
PAISLEY (O.S.) Yeah, hello. Paisley. 
Draft: 1/15/03 27. 
I 
SHEPARD It's Brian. I just got done talking to Whitacre, there's something much bigger going on here. 
28 INTERIOR ADM- THE NEXT MORNING 28 Whitacre tries to look natural as he walks to his office, his first day as a whistle blower. No sooner does he take his seat, than Cheviron appears baring down on him though his glass walled office. Cheviron enters. 
CHEVIRON What happened last night? 
WHITACRE They put a recorder on my line. 
CHEVIRON And that's it? 
WHITACRE Yeah, and I was instructed that when Fujiwara calls, I'm to record the conversation. Whitacre gets buzzed by his secretary. 
LIZ TAYLOR Your wife on two. 
CHEVIRON Well, make sure you do it because they have ways of checking to see if you're going to or not. Whitacre picks up the call and the big bully goes away. We hear Ginger very excited on the other end of the phone... 
WHITACRE OK...0K...slow down... tell me what happened... Whitacre listens, leafs through his mail. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Does anyone win that Publisher's Clearing House thing? Someone must, right? Otherwise it's against the law...Someone gets a million dollars or someone goes to jail... 
Draft: 1/15/03 28. 
29 INTERIOR FBI SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS- MORNING 29 A small conference room with bad green wall paper and a view of the Illinois Capital Building. Shepard briefs AGENT DEAN PAISLEY and AGENT IN CHARGE KATE MEDFORD. He searches through his large pile of notes for the most shocking of last night's revelations. Medford eats her morning yogurt. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) 60 minutes or someone would come after Ed MacMahon. You can't use the US mail that way...And a guy like Ed MacMahon would never get involved... 
SHEPARD .a pound of bacon, a peanut butter sandwich, some vitamins- anything that ADM has a hand in-- it's all fixed, that's what he's telling me. Basically, everyone in this country is the victim of corporate crime by the time they finish breakfast... Medford studies the ingredients of her yogurt. 
PAISLEY So, what do we have? Anti-trust violations, providing false information... 
30 INTERIOR ADM WHITACRE'S OFFICE- CONTINUOUS 30 Whitacre is still on the phone-- pacing-- the person at the other end of the line is doing most of the talking. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Who can you trust? Your government? Your employer? Your wife? You trust your wife ...OK, but what's the divorce rate? 
31 INTERIOR FBI SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS- CONTINUOUS 31 
CHEVIRON I told Shepard we're done working with them as of now. 
ANDREAS Damn right. Whitacre picks up the phone. It's not Sweden. 
SHEPARD (O.S.) Mark, it's Brian can you talk? Whitacre shifts uncomfortably and tries to cover in front of Mick and Cheviron-- he puts on a phony cheerful voice. 
Draft: 1/15/03 33. 
WHITACRE (over the phone) Yeah, hey it's good to hear from you. 
SHEPARD (O.S.) I'd like to bring my Supervisor by later, around six. 
WHITACRE Great. Hey, I got Mr. Andreas in here right now. OK, I'll talk to you soon. He hangs up the phone and turns back to Mick and Terry. Whitacre smiles warmly, and then lies through his teeth. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) So, what do I do if this Shepard guy calls? 
ANDREAS You let me know and I'll pass it on to my Dad. But, you're done talking to them... 
37 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S BARN- EVENING 37 Whitacre sits with FBI agents Shepard and Paisley in the converted barn. A large open room looking more like a theme restaurant than anything that might have once involved agriculture. Outside, RUSTY the gardener, fishes leaves from the pool. Shepard explains the misunderstanding with the phones. 
PAISLEY The only listening device was the recorder, Mark. 
SHEPARD We had a trap and trace device on the home line-- but we can't listen in with that. 
PAISLEY However, the phone company calling people and telling them about our Intel gathering is, well, our face is red on that one. 
SHEPARD Did you bring the expense reports we talked about? Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork. 
Draft: 1/15/03 34. 
WHITACRE It's all there-- Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris and Mexico City. And under...Whitacre thinks about one thing while discussing another with the agents. He is a gifted man in this capacity. His thoughts take precedence here. 
WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.O.) Just last week Mick and Terry I read in the Geographic that were in Florida with the Corn the skin in ears grows from Refiner's Association. They the inside out-- conveyor would have their regular belt style. That's how they meetings during the day and stay clean. You could make a then at night they'd get dot with a felt tip inside together and work out the and watch it move down your price fixing... neck. 
WHITACRE .Six months later a liter of Pepsi costs five cents more. 
SHEPARD When's the next meeting? 
WHITACRE January-- somewhere in Asia. Paisley takes it all in. He cozies up to Whitacre. 
AGENT PAISLEY Mark, I gotta ask you, why are you doing this? We know you lied to us about the phone line and you're afraid of that. But, now you're telling us all this other stuff out of the blue. I gotta ask you why? The light disappears from Whitacre's eyes. 
WHITACRE Things are going on I don't approve of. I mean, I'm a biochemist-- But, they pulled me into the business side and they're doing things that are illegal. They said... 
ANGLE ON RUSTY He takes the net for cleaning the pool and walks around the barn to the attached six car garage filled with a Range Rover, Ferrari, Mercedes Coupe, BMW, and a Lincoln Town Car. 
Draft: 1/15/03 35. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) (CONT'D) . if I was going to grow with ADM I had to be a part of the business side of things. Rusty pulls the garage down on the cars. 
38 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S BARN- CONTINUOUS 
WHITACRE When they told me to lie, I had to lie. I lied to you guys and I feel real bad about it. This explains the bind Whitacre finds himself in. 
SHEPARD You look at yourself as wearing a white hat and they're wearing black hats. 
WHITACRE That's a good way to put it. You know, when I was a kid my folks died in an automobile accident. I was maybe six at the time and this wealthy man in Ohio adopted me. He owned amusement parks and he did real well for himself, real well. I got a big break-- went to a good school and all-- I adopted two kids of my own. I just want to do the right thing. 
PAISLEY Well, Mark, do you think you'd be willing to go a few steps further in helping us? 
WHITACRE What do you mean? 
SHEPARD Would you be willing to wear a wire? We don't have any other sources at this time. We need your help. Whitacre considers the request-- a chance to be a hero. 
Draft: 1/15/03 36. 
PAISLEY Now you realize that by doing this, sometime down the line you could be the guy who has to testify against your fellow executives, people you've worked with now for years. That won't be easy. He looks around at the good life Whitacre has amassed. 
SHEPARD I'll use my beeper to signal you when it's time to set up a meeting. Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button- "BEEEEP." 
SHEPARD When you hear this-- you call me. Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model. He gives it to Whitacre. 
PAISLEY You'll be risking a lot. Whitacre picks up the recorder. The idea of being a White Knight only becomes real when they hand you a sword. 
39 EXTERIOR COORS BREWERY- GOLDEN, COLORADO 39 Whitacre, Wilson and Andreas get out of a Town Car in front of Coors Corporate headquarters. The Rockies loom in the background. The men walk toward the doors. 
WHITACRE I was up in Wisconsin last week-- and the guy who is running for Governor... 
AN DREAS Tommy Thompson. 
WILSON The Republican guy. 
43 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- EVENING 43 The Whitacre family checks out the new car. 
SHEPARD (V.O.) You gotta feel for the guy, he tells us the truth one day and wakes up the next with two lives instead of one. 
44 INTERIOR MEXICO CITY AIRPORT- DAY 44 Whitacre checks his messages from a pay phone in the Admiral's Club in the International Terminal. 
MARTY ALLISON (O.S.) Hey, Mark it's Marty calling again and... 
COMPUTER VOICE Message deleted. . .Next message. 
BEEEEEP. Whitacre punches a button. 
COMPUTER VOICE (CONT'D) Message deleted. Whitacre punches the buttons on his cell phone angrily. 
Draft: 1/15/03 41. 
L 
SHEPARD (O.S.) 
FBI. 
WHITACRE It's Mark, Brian. It's been hard for me to return a page. I'm out of the country. 
SHEPARD (O.S.) We need to know if you had any further contact from Fujiwara? 
WHITACRE I told you, the guy has stopped calling. 
SHEPARD (O.S.) What about the price fixing? Have you been able to make any tapes. 
WHITACRE I think you guys hanging around has really scared ADM straight, too-- word is we're going to do things by the book. Mick said it's over. No more price fixing. A pause. Shepard is confused. 
SHEPARD (0.S.) What? When did this happen? This conversation. 
WHITACRE Mick sat me down and said 'Mark, we're going to start doing things your way.' 
SHEPARD (0. S. ) Mark, the FBI knows about these crimes-- we're gonna investigate either way. You told us yourself. 
WHITACRE Either way? What does "either way" mean? 
SHEPARD (O.S.) We really need to get together. Both Shepard and Whitacre are losing their patience. 
WHITACRE I told you, it's a different attitude now, a different approach. 
Draft: 1/15/03 42. Whitacre hangs up-- frustrated. He walks over to a table in the club where a middle aged German man is waiting-- REINHART RICHTER, 40. There are papers spread out in piles around the men-- stacks of loss, gain and opportunity. 
RICHTER Everything OK? 
WHITACRE Yeah, fine. Kids. Where we're we? Whitacre reaches underneath his suit coat into his shirt pocket and pulls out his pen. 
RICHTER Uh, Mark... Whitacre's FOUNTAIN PEN has exploded in his shirt-- leaving a Rorschach across his chest. Richter gestures toward the stain. Whitacre stares at the STAIN. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) One of the Japanese guys told me a story-- this lysine salesman is in a meeting with someone from Conagra or some other company, I don't know-and the client leans forward and says, `I have the same tie as you... only the pattern is reversed."-- and then he drops dead. Face down on the 
TABLE-ALIVE AND then... Dead... Brain aneurism... 
45 INTERIOR HAMPTON INN, DECATUR- EVENING 45 Shepard and Herndon are waiting in the most generic of hotel rooms for Whitacre. They check their watches and peak out the drapes at a sparsely populated parking lot. They've been there awhile. Herndon eats a Granola bar and reads the side of the package. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) .Maybe everyone has a sentence like that; a little time bomb..."I have the same tie as you... only the patterns reversed." 
HERNDON There it is, "High Fructose Corn Syrup." Shepard isn't giving up on Whitacre, yet. 
Draft: 1/15/03 43. 
SHEPARD He said Andreas called him into a marketing meeting. 
HERNDON The government ought to charge him for the room. Shepard's cell phone rings. Herndon sighs-- 
HERNDON Here it comes. 
SHEPARD FBI... .Uh...huh. You're being honest with me, here... It's been months Mark-- we need some tapes. 
46 INTERIOR WHITACRE BMW- NIGHT 46 Whitacre sits alone in the Hampton Hotel parking lot next to the mall, staring up at at a the lights of a room. 
WHITACRE I gotta go Bri, Andreas is coming. Whitacre opens his brief case and takes out the micro cassette recorder. He looks at it like it's a murder weapon. 
SHEPARD (O.S.) (over the phone) Mark, we could be tracing this phone call... 
WHITACRE I can't live two lives. They just gave me a hundred thousand dollar raise. I can't risk my job for you guys. I've got a family. I'm building stables across the road. 
SHEPARD But, you told us... 
49 INTERIOR HOLIDAY INN HOTEL ROOM- CONTINUOUS 49 Whitacre buttons his shirt and puts his tie back on. He looks out the hotel room window at the snow. In the parking lot a high school kid drinks a beer while trying to write his name in urine in the snowbank. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) They're all different. Every flake is it's own one-of-a-kind version of itself. And some people still don't believe in God. I mean what more proof do you need than that-- Herndon and Shepard re-enter. 
WHITACRE Hey, how'd I do? 
SHEPARD Mark, we have some problems... 
WHITACRE Wait a minute, I watched the machine, I didn't see any changes... 
SHEPARD Mark, you don't know how to read a polygraph. 
WHITACRE I've heard these things, they're not always 100 per cent accurate. I've been telling the truth. Definitely. Herndon plays the bad cop. 
HERNDON Mark, you splattered the walls with ink. Come on now, extortionists don't just leave their name and number then go away. 
Draft; 1/15/03 48. 
Whitacre nods-- his eyes water, He sighs. 
SHEPARD (CONT'D) I know it's tough keeping it all bottled up inside, keeping it a secret. But, there's only one good choice for you. That's all there's ever been. There's something you're hiding, something you're keeping from us. But, the only way to protect yourself is to be completely honest. 
WHITACRE Okay. Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic 302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION. 
SHEPARD You realize this document can be used against you in a court of law. Whitacre nods grimly. 
HERNDON What happened with Fujiwara and the saboteur? A beat. 
WHITACRE I made it up. I had to... Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf. The floodgates open. Shepard transcribes the confession. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) .We've had problems at the plant with viruses, we're way behind projections. Dwayne was thinking about shutting us down and everyone was on me to fix it. 'Let's just blame it all on Whitacre.' That's how it is there. It was my job they were talking about. We just moved here from Europe-they made me VP. 
SHEPARD And the reason you agreed to help ADM purchase a new bug? 
Draft: 1/15/03 49. 
WHITACRE I wanted to be part of the team. I thought it would help my relationship with Mick if he thought I would do something like that. 
HERNDON And what about the price fixing? It isn't over is it? There's no "new attitude." 
WHITACRE 
(DEFEATED) There's been meetings all along-- in the past three weeks even. Nothing's changed... Again, Whitacre's mind allows him to be two places at once... 
WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.O.) 
(UNDER) (OVER) .and not just in Lysine-- Mick Andreas or his Dad? citric acid, gluconate. One They'd never lie for me. They guy, he was forced to leave say we're in it together. the company because he What a joke. Team building wouldn't do it-- the off-site meetings at the some gluconate guy...he's out of a lake in Wisconsin-- I can't job now. They had me go to protect these guys if they're Chicago and meet with the breaking the law. Hey, I guys from Ajinomoto to try tried. Anybody could see the and set volume levels for choices I had. I did my best lysine production. It's a for ADM. You don't see them matter of dividing up the here in the electric chair. market between the producers It's all "Make us lysine, and then setting a workable Mark." "Handle the FBI, price. There's another Mark." "Crap us out some meeting in about a month. money, Mark." 
SHEPARD If there's anything else you want to add, now's the time. You need to tell us. 
WHITACRE No, that's the full story. 
HERNDON We want tapes, mark. He slides the confession across to Whitacre who nods and signs. He gives both agents Christmas cards and smiles. 
Draft: 1/15/03 50. 
WHITACRE I'll give you all the tapes you want. Merry Christmas you guys. 
50 INTERIOR PARKING GARAGE ADM- MORNING 50 Whitacre aims the FERRARI into his designated parking space and gets out of the car. 
STEADICAM FOLLOWING WHITACRE He walks toward the building. As the camera arcs around to lead him we see that he is actually speaking out loud-- NOT IN VO. To nobody... 
WHITACRE Seven thirty A.M., Wednesday, March seventeenth, 1994. I have just parked my car and am now entering the office... Whitacre gets on the elevator with Terry Wilson. Whitacre's a little off this morning... s-- WHITACRE (CONT'D) Terrance Wilson, President of our corn businesses, did you speak with our friends in Japan? 
TERRY WILSON He wasn't in. 
WHITACRE I heard from Mimoto last night-- he is pissed. He said there's not going to be any peace in lysine until we bring production down like we promised. Theelevator doors opens. 
TERRY WILSON In 92 we did exactly what we told them we would do in terms of volume. Exactly. Right now, there's no promise. 
WHITACRE He said he'd like to talk to you at some point... 
Draft: 1/15/03 51. 
L 
TERRY WILSON Be right there lookin' at him. Say, "listen here you little mousy motherfucker." Wilson peels off into his office. Whitacre continues on across the open trading floor toward his office. He speaks under his breath to nobody-- smiling at the world. 
WHITACRE That was Terry Wilson talking about setting volume and price levels with our Japanese competitor-- Ajinomoto Corporation. Whitacre enters his own office--- talking to himself. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) By the way, there was no discussion with Mimoto last night. That was all for illustration purposes only. I wanna make that clear- no discussion with Mimoto last night. He turns off the tape recorder. 
SHEPARD (loud because of the 
HEADPHONES) We need to improve the quality of the recordings... 
WHITACRE Why don't you guys just bug the building? 
SHEPARD It's not that easy, Mark. There're a lot legal issues... 
Draft: 1/15/03 56. A beat. Herndon thinks. He has an idea. 
HERNDON Give me your pants. Whitacre undoes the pants of his SAGE GREEN SUIT. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Being able to do two things at once is a big part of success. I try and do abdominal exercises... isometrics... even when I'm at a meeting. Tensing. Holding. And then releasing. And there are leg ones I do in the car. I'll even floss in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair. During the part where you're just supposed to leave it in. Those things can really add up to a significant time savings. 
56 EXTERIOR WHITACRE DRIVEWAY- MORNING 56 Rusty the Gardener blows leaves off the driveway. Whitacre pulls out of the six car garage in a Lincoln Town Car. He yells at Rusty over the leaf blower. 
WHITACRE Hey, Rusty, check this out. Whitacre gets out of the car and places his briefcase on the hood. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) What do you think? 
RUSTY THE GARDENER It's a nice briefcase. 
WHITACRE But, wait. Whitacre opens the briefcase and pulls a secret panel to reveal a TAPE RECORDER. He couldn't be more proud. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) That's a Nagra model number 34-A, right there. The bureau had that custom made for me-- Mark Whitacre secret agent double 0, fourteen. 
RUSTY THE GARDENER Why double 0 fourteen? 
Draft: 1/15/03 57. 
WHITACRE Cuz I'm twice as smart as double 0 seven. 
57 INTERIOR ADM CORPORATE JET- DAY 57 Whitacre, wearing the SAGE COLORED SUIT he gave Herndon, sits with Andreas and some ADM SUITS on the COMPANY PLANE. Andreas chats with one CO-WORKER and then turns to Whitacre. 
ANDREAS Whatever happened to that girl who was working for us-- didn't she move to California? What's her name, Tina? 
WHITACRE She's getting married. 
ANDREAS My Tina is getting married? 
WHITACRE Two or three weekends from now. 
ANDREAS That won't last for very long. She's kind of a do-do head, you know? She'll be back. I just hope she doesn't get pregnant. Fuck up her body. 
WHITACRE Uh. 
ANDREAS Nice body. It'd ruin her tits. She's got the greatest tits in the world... He leans in to Whitacre. 
ANDREAS In the world. Whitacre looks out the window at white billowing clouds. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) When polar bears hunt, they crouch down by a hole in the ice and wait for a seal to pop up. They keep one paw over their nose so that they blend in. Cuz' they've got those black noses. They'd blend in perfectly if not for the nose... 
Draft: 1/15/03 58. 
58 EXTERIOR JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, ORANGE COUNTY- DAY 58 Whitacre descends the steps of the jet followed by Andreas and some other SUITS. Whitacre peels off the group. 
WHITACRE I'm just gonna hit the head here. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) So the question is. How do they know their noses are black? From looking at other polar bears? Do they see their reflections in the water? And think, "I'd be invisible if not for that." That seems like a lot of thinking for a bear. 
59 INTERIOR AIRPORT MEN'S ROOM- CONTINUOUS 59 An AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN, 30's, stands at the sink. Other than that the room is empty. 
AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN Mr. Whitacre, could you follow me? 
? P - The two men enter a stall. 
AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN Can I ask you to remove your shirt? Whitacre obliges. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) There's something great about walking into a conference room when there's a pad of paper and a pencil in front of every chair. . .Most guys with a science background don't get to see what goes on... 
60 INTERIOR MARRIOTT HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM 60 A UNIFORMED HOTEL WORKER arranges the orange juice, coffee, croissants, melon plate. A pen and pad of paper is put in front of every seat. A FLIP CHART stands ready in the corner. The meticulous worker makes everything perfect, pausing for a moment to adjust A LAMP. 
Draft: 1/15/03 59. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Usually the hotel's name is embossed on the pencils and they have someone who sharpens them to perfect points like collie dog noses-- that's what they remind me of. Maybe they come from the factory that way. And there's always a plate of danish...danishes?-- an almond thing-- or a cheese danish with a big cherry blob in the middle... 
61 INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM- CONTINUOUS 61 The AFRICAN AMERICAN AGENT finishes shaving Whitacre's chest. He takes out a roll of surgical tape and attaches a small NAGRA RECORDER to WHITACRE. Small wires attach to switches sewn into Whitacre's pants pockets. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) The almond thing makes a lot of crumbs and I usually use my pencil to sweep them away like one of those tools professional waiters use at the Decatur Club... 
AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN You want to try it? Whitacre flips the pocket switch. 
95 INTERIOR DEPT OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO 95 Shepard and Herndon have been playing the new tape for Robin Mann and US ANTITRUST ATTORNEY JAMES MUTCHNIK. Shepard and Herndon beam with pride. 
SHEPARD Agreement... you heard it. He hits rewind and plays it again. 
MUTCHNIK ROBIN MANN A jury's gonna love that. Congratulations. 
MUTCHNIK Christ, how about this guy Whitacre? What's his story? 
SHEPARD What do you mean? 
MUTCHNIK What's his agenda? The guy's making 350 grand a year, he's moving up the ladder and he turns informer. When does that happen? Is the money going up his nose? Some woman somewhere with a kid that he's seeing on one of these business trips? What's his story? Shepard and Herndon are offended on behalf of Mark. Herndon reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a GREETING CARD. 
HERNDON I wanted everyone to see this. This is Mark Whitacre and his family. The group passes it around. A photo of Whitacre Family smiling in front of their Christmas Tree. 
HERNDON I carry this picture with me all the time as a constant reminder that he is a real person with a real family depending on him. The only reason we have these tapes is because of this man. 
(MORE) 
Draft: 1/15/03 87. 
HERNDON (CONT'D) We want to know that when the time comes, if he loses his job, the government is going to stand behind him. 
ROBIN MANN What's he looking for? 
SHEPARD About eighteen grand a month. He hands her a folder of Whitacre's expenses. 
96 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- NIGHT 96 Whitacre rides down the shoulder of the two lane, past the towers of the grain elevators-- to a railroad crossing and rumbling out of the darkness, comes another 100 box cars of what America needs for tomorrow and each one of those cars says: ADM. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) We took the kids one year to the Renaissance festival in Indiana.. .You get to be the White Knight.. .The kids get to ride in the joust against the forces of darkness with a helmet on. And the White Knight always wins, the forces of darkness fall onto an old mattress...It was maybe ninety degrees out and the heat and humidity index-- I can't even remember what the radio said. 
97 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MASTER BEDROOM- NIGHT 97 Ginger lies alone in bed, eyes open, train whistles in the night. It's 4 a.m. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) We were next in line and the mare collapsed-- went down in a heap. Ginger was eating ye olde drumstick and she dropped it in the dirt. The kids were crying and I remember this farmer saying he had a gun in his truck... Just like that. From the White Knight to a gun in the truck-How do you get that back? How does that get to be fair? 
Draft: 1/15/03 88. 
98 EXTERIOR ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL- DECATUR 98 Whitacre pulls into the parking lot in a brand new PORSCHE 911. Shepard gets out of a black sedan and crosses the lot. He climbs into the shiny red car. 
WHITACRE (off the Porsche) Hey, Brian, how do you like it? Shepard takes in the car. 
SHEPARD It's a beauty. How was Hong Kong? 
WHITACRE Real good-- we're going to be taking the lysine prices up again. He hands Shepard an envelope. 
SHEPARD We're gonna wanna hear how the company responds when we move in. Shepard hands him some tapes and batteries. He grabs the BRIEF CASE off the backseat. 
SHEPARD You want me to load you up right now? 
WHITACRE That's okay, Brian. It's kind of packed with work anyway. Whitacre stops Shepard from opening the case-- he takes the tapes and puts them in his lap. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) I'll see you at the briefing. Whitacre watches Shepard walk away then opens the briefcase. 
ANGLE ON THE BRIEFCASE It's filled with TENS OF THOUSANDS IN CASH. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) Marty Allison, Sid Hulse, and the other guys will understand-- they've worked with me. 
(MORE) 
Draft: 1/15/03 89. WHITACRE (V.0.) (cont'd) They saw what I was trying to do for everyone... Those guys know me-They'd back me up all the way-- family and friends are the most important thing. That's the lesson. 
99 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MASTER BEDROOM- MORNING 99 Whitacre picks a tie to go with his TAPE RECORDER SUIT. He sees good things on the horizon. But, Ginger's got another point of view. 
GINGER Mark, are you an idiot? 
WHITACRE I'm gonna be the only one left. Dwayne will be gone. Mick will be gone. Terry will be gone. I'm going to be the only one who can run ADM. 
GINGER That's totally illogical. How can you possibly stay there when you've dust taken down the company? You think they're going to pat you on the back? 
WHITACRE I'm next in line. 
GINGER It's the FBI, right? They're brainwashing you. Brian Shepard put these ideas in your head to keep you working for him. She storms out-- Whitacre checks his hair in the mirror. 
WHITACRE I'm telling you, they're gonna make me president. 
SHEPARD 
(PRE-LAP) How's your family doing? 
100 INTERIOR HAMPTON INN- EVENING 100 Shepard, Herndon, Whitacre, Mann, Mutchnik and A HOST OF OTHER AGENTS prepare for the raid. The cheap hotel room has been transformed into a COMMAND CENTER. 
Draft: 1/15/03 90. There's a MAP OF DECATUR on the wall with push-pins at various locations and A CHART of which agent will contact which ADM executive. 
Draft: 1/15/03 94. 
L 
106 INTERIOR ARCHER, DANIELS HEADQUARTERS- NIGHT 106 FBI agents flash badges and warrants to a night security guard and fan out down the corridors-- entering offices, seizing documents. 
HERNDON (V.0.) There are going to be indictments. Search warrants have been issued... 
107 EXTERIOR NICE NEIGHBORHOOD DECATUR, ILLINOIS- NIGHT 107 FBI agents roll up the drive way and approach A MIDDLE AGED MAN watering his plants. 
HERNDON (V.0.) and some people, people you know and work with will be going to jail. The MIDDLE AGED MAN drops the hose and goes inside with the FBI agent. Pull back to reveal TWO OTHER HOUSES on the street have FBI CRUISERS parked in their driveways. 
HERNDON (V.0.) (CONT'D) We're giving you a chance... 
108 INTERIOR DECATUR CLUB-CONTINUOUS 108 Wilson sits motionless cradling his High Ball. Out the window, Whitacre and Shepard are just shapes in the Dodge. 
HERNDON A chance to be able to look your grandchildren in the eye someday and tell them you did the right thing... 
WILSON'S POV Wilson looks out the window and sees Whitacre in the FBI cruiser. 
109 INTERIOR SHEPARD'S CAR- NIGHT 109 Whitacre and Shepard watch Herndon and Wilson in the foyer. Whitacre is in the middle of an adrenaline rush two-and-a- half years in the making. 
Draft: 1/15/03 95. 
WHITACRE Look at that, look at Bob and Terry. Man, I'd love to be a fly on the wall for that one. I was good wasn't I? I seemed scared. Shepard tries to calm him down, get him to focus. 
SHEPARD Remember what we told you, Mark: tell them that you're cooperating first thing and whatever you do, do not take one of their lawyers. 
110 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S MERCEDES BENZ COUPE- NIGHT Whitacre and Wilson. Whitacre is in a feigned panic. 
WHITACRE What did you say to your guy? 
TERRY WILSON Nothing. I told him nothing. Slow down. 
WHITACRE Me, too. 
TERRY WILSON He said he had tapes-- that he'd heard price fixing tapes. . .What the fuck is that? I can't believe they would pull this shit on Dwayne Andreas... The car skids into a turn up a very long drive toward the kind of mansion that comes from price fixing. 
WHITACRE I bet they tapped the phones-- I always said that about them. I bet it's phone calls. 
TERRY WILSON Maybe, but what's that? 
WHITACRE You know, I get phone calls from time to time, Terry. 
TERRY WILSON I know, I know. 
Draft: 1/15/03 96. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Terry never liked me...He's a dinosaur. A fossil. The Andreas' bully, is all he ever was. He was never going to run the place. Those guys never do, they just use them to find the land mines... MICK ANDREAS, Mid 40's appears in the headlights-- shirt un- tucked, holding a drink. 
111 EXTERIOR ANDREAS MANSION DRIVEWAY- CONTINUOUS Gnats swarm around the yard lights-- crickets chirp out the temperature. 
ANDREAS We're going to the lawyers-- I don't want to use the phones. 
WHITACRE See, the phones. 
ANDREAS They hit everyone-- my Dad, Schmidt, Randall... 
WILSON Fuck me. 
ANDREAS They played me a tape-- of me-- some meeting with the fucking japs. I called the lawyers.. .They want us to go there. 
TERRY WILSON They played a fucking tape! 
ANDREAS I really don't think they've got that much and when you factor in everything we've ever done for them .It'll be a ten year thing for the lawyers then there'll be some deal, maybe a fine.. .That's all it'll ever be. Wilson and Andreas get in one car-- Whitacre gets in another. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Mick should've been more of a friend to me. 
(MORE) 
Draft: 1/15/03 97. WHITACRE (V.O.) (cont'd) Taken me into his confidence more just about different kinds of things...I could've kept some of the tapes out of it...The ones about girls or whatever-- those are gonna be tough to hear on the nightly news... 
112 INTERIOR FBI OFFICE, DECATUR- LATER 112 The small room is abuzz with agents reporting in. A successful raid. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) .I could've turned the tape recorder off and told Brian and Bob I ran out of batteries... 
SHEPARD Do you think it went well? 
HERNDON I don't think I would change a thing. A phone rings somewhere-- an agent answers. 
PHONE AGENT I got Agent Temples for Attorney Mutchnik. Mutchnik-- sharing in the joy of the success takes the phone. 
DWAYNE ANDREAS Aubrey defended Lt. Calley after the My Lai massacre in Viet Nam... So this ought to be a cake walk for him. 
AUBREY DANIEL We thought you might take some time and talk to John here. 
MICK ANDREAS ADM's going to stand behind you on this, Mark. Dad and I want the key people to know we'll be paying their legal fees. 
WHITACRE Great, that's great. 
DWAYNE ANDREAS Then we'll let you fellas get acquainted. Everyone leaves except for Dowd and Whitacre. Dowd gives Whitacre a warm, knowing look. 
JOHN DOWD How you holding up, Mark? 
Draft: 1/15/03 102. 
WHITACRE Uh, can I ask you something? 
JOHN DOWD Sure. Anything. 
WHITACRE If I tell you something are you allowed to say anything to Mick or Dwayne? 
ANGLE ON WHITACRE'S OFFICE From the trading floor. Dowd gets up and pulls the curtains shut. Through a crack in the drapes we see Whitacre and Dowd talk. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) It feels good to talk, to clear the air-- you get to be like a balloon after a while. A balloon looking for a pin to bump into and relieve the pressure. You could get sick from keeping it inside and get a tumor or something..I didn't ask for that. Why should I pay for my own legal fees when I'm not the one who started the price fixing. 
117 INTERIOR FBI OFFICE DECATUR- EVENING 117 Herndon and Shepard stand over a similar sea of documents-- exhausted. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) People get their live's earnings wiped out by these legal entanglements ... I'm gonna pay for that? That's not right, I have kids and Ginger and horses... 
118 EXTERIOR ADM- LATER 118 Twilight. From the parking lot you can see two men still talking in the fluorescent light of Whitacre's office. 
Draft: 1/15/03 103. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) I have a friend from school who has a law practice and he's always telling me how they can't talk about their cases-Like in The Firm... You can tell them anything and they have to keep to themselves or they get in a lot of trouble-They're boxed. That's what they say, "boxed." 
119 INTERIOR ADM TRADING FLOOR- LATER 119 A GROUP OF LAWYERS sit among boxes of pizza and beer. The drapes finally open in Whitacre's office. Dowd and Whitacre emerge. Dowd looks stunned, Whitacre solemn. Wilson, Daniel, Mick and the other lawyers stop what their doing and look up. 
WHITACRE I need to tell you that I'm cooperating with the government. The FBI has hundreds of tapes. They know all about lysine. John here agrees I should be getting another lawyer. 
JOHN DOWD No question about it. Dowd and Daniel share a knowing look. An uncomfortable silence follows. 
WHITACRE I'm sorry for what's happened. 
ANDREAS Sorry? What's that? Whitacre shakes Mick Andreas' hand and walks away. The men are all stunned, they watch him leave. 
AUBREY DANIEL John, I bet that SOB was wearing a wire on you tonight, too. 
120 INTERIOR ADM- THE NEXT MORNING 120 Whitacre crosses the room; the object of cold stares and hard silence. 
WHITACRE Hey. . .Good morning. 
Draft: 1/15/03 104. To nobody in particular and nobody responds. He enters his office and closes the drapes. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) 
(NERVOUS) There are perfectly good ties on sale and nobody is buying them. Paisleys and yellow and red Rep ones with little crests and what have you. Two for one. You just have to take the time and look, there are plenty of good ones... But, when he looks up AUBREY DANIEL is standing there--- all arrogance and anger concentrated into a very intense beam of language. 
AUBREY DANIEL Mark, we'd like you off the premises. 
WHITACRE Uh, Mr. Daniel, can't we... 
AUBREY DANIEL Management wants you out... 
WHITACRE But, I'm a VP here... And with that MARK CHEVIRON picks up his briefcase and car keys. 
CHEVIRON Let's go. 
ANGLE ON BRIAN SHEPARD AND HIS ADOPTED SON Seen through the front window of a car baring down on them as they work on an OLD FORD MUSTANG MACH ONE. Shepard reacts to the camera-- he can't believe what he sees. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) (bitter little boy rant) How would Brian Shepard like it if he was thrown out of his job? If he was humiliated in front of his secretary? If he even had a secretary. Not very much I'm willing to wager. 
(MORE) 
Draft: 1/15/03 105. WHITACRE (V.0.) (cont'd) It's like, "Hey, Mark we'll lead the parade in these bright red suits while you walk behind the elephants with a shovel and some rubber gloves in case it gets messy... ." 
121 EXTERIOR BRIAN SHEPARD'S HOME- DAY 121 A modest Midwestern home on a tree lined street. Whitacre brings his TOWN CAR to a screeching halt in front of Shepard. 
SHEPARD Mark, you can't be here. 
WHITACRE They threw me out, Brian. 
SHEPARD You're jeopardizing everything. 
GINGER Mark? He left. You can come back. Whitacre emerges from among the tall stalks of corn where he's been watching. 
127 INTERIOR BLUE BIRD DINER- EARLY MORNING 127 Whitacre is strung out on martyrdom and insomnia. He stares at his coffee. 
LIZ TAYLOR They turned the place upside down. 
Draft: 1/15/03 110. His loyal secretary gives him a pile of mail. 
LIZ TAYLOR They went though all of this, too. 
WHITACRE I'm sorry you got dragged into this. 
LIZ TAYLOR And then they started asking me for the access code to your voice mail. Whitacre panics. 
WHITACRE Did you tell them? I don't think you have to tell them that. 
LIZ TAYLOR well, according to them I do-- but I didn't. And about two hours later Peterson told me to clean out my desk. He said I've been transferred out of Bioproducts. 
WHITACRE But, you didn't tell them? 
128 EXTERIOR ADM PLANT- DAY 128 Whitacre is parked in his MERCEDES across the road staring through the chain link fence. Trucks rumble by. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) Abe Lincoln was born 45 minutes from here and I've never been to his log cabin. I've seen post cards and I sent the kids there on a field trip. But, I've never gone. I'm sure it's very well preserved. Original beds and dining room tables and the doorways are probably smaller from when people were shorter...It's only 45 minutes away... CU on Whitacre as a sound builds in the car...A small outboard motor we've heard before. Getting LOUDER...And then a voice competes. 
COMPETING VOICE (PRE-LAP) 
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH 
WITH YOU FOR DAYS...

129 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- DAY 129 Whitacre stands with the leaf blower-- but the driveway is spotless. He shuts it off. Behind him is SCOTT KILMAN. 
KILMAN I'd like to talk to you about what's been going on at ADM. A beat. He hands Whitacre a card. 
KILMAN I'm interested in hearing your side of things. Whitacre takes a paranoid look around. 
WHITACRE We better go inside. We can't talk out here. 
130 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MORNING 130 Whitacre makes himself a bowl of cereal and talks on the phone. He's fully caffeinated and ready to go. 
WHITACRE They kept coming back Brian, and they only had ADM's side of things. 
SHEPARD (O.S.) Did you talk to them, Mark? What did you say? It's real important that you not talk to the press. 
WHITACRE Me? I told him I had no comment. But, they already had the story. A beat. On the counter is a NEWSPAPER. Whitacre hangs up the phone. 
ANGLE ON WSJ Headline: SEEDS OF DOUBT: AN EXECUTIVE BECOMES INFORMANT FOR

131 INTERIOR CTA COMMUTER TRAIN- MORNING 131 Jim Epstein reads the Journal. Pull back to reveal it's in the hands of almost EVERY OTHER EXECUTIVE on the train. 
EPSTEIN Shit. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) .Is Brian Shepard gonna lose his job for that? His standard of living? I've gone to the local junior high school on career day and talked to kids about biochemistry and the kind of career opportunities available... 
132 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION KITCHEN- CONTINUOUS 132 Whitacre's son, Alexander, runs, screaming into the kitchen. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Can Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon say that, I'm the white hat... 
ALEXANDER Dad, Dad, you're on TV! Whitacre turns on the TV. A strange light blows out the windows of the kitchen. On the TV screen appears the image of: WHITACRE'S HOUSE. 
TV ANNCR: A Vice President in the Bio- products division of Fortune Five Hundred ADM, Whitacre was working as a spy for the FBI for over two years... 
WHITACRE (V.0.) I did enough for Brain Shepard. Who's gonna take care of me? 
WHITACRE Baby, you gotta come see this we're on TV. 
Draft: 1/15/03 113. 
133 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MORNING 133 A crowd of reporters and ENG CREWS have sprouted up among the corn fields. They press in on the gates. America has questions for Mark Whitacre. The door opens and Whitacre emerges. Expecting rock star exaltation-- he gets something else. 
AUBREY DANIEL (O.S.) Hello, Mark? It's Aubrey Daniel. I think you forgot something? Whitacre pulls over onto the shoulder. He looks at the cell phone in dismay and stares at a Polaroid of himself from the Fortune Magazine photo shoot-- he's smiling in the picture. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) One of the things I've learned in business is that you should always use a person's name in conversation if you want them to feel important... Sid Hulse and Marty Allison think that and they're very successful salesman... 
143 EXTERIOR CHINESE RESTAURANT, TAYLORVILLE- DAY 143 Whitacre gets out of an FBI cruiser with Herndon and Shepard and the three men walk toward the restaurant in rural Illinois. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) It makes people feel like they're definitely being told something they can use... They enter and the HOSTESS gives them a table up front. 
WHITACRE You got anything open in the back? 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Just by putting their name in there at the beginning or the end. The men sit at a table in the back. A beat. 
WHITACRE Brian, Bob, my attorney's telling me not to say anything, but there's something I've wanted to talk about for awhile. 
HERNDON Don't tell us anything. You have an attorney now. This isn't like before. Let's just talk. Shepard tries to change the subject. 
Draft: 1/15/03 118. 
SHEPARD You been playing any golf? Whitacre doesn't want to "just talk." 
WHITACRE They want to talk to me at ADM. 
HERNDON Mark, you understand your lawyer has advised you not to discuss this matter? 
SHEPARD We're not asking you. 
WHITACRE Let me throw out some "hypotheticals." I'll talk about some financial situations and you tell me if they're wrong or how serious they might be, OK? For instance, suppose a company gave an executive a car, you know, a corporate car. But instead of driving it to work he drove his personal car and gave the company car to his daughter. Would that be a problem? 
HERNDON That's it? That's the hypothetical? The agents try not to laugh. After what Whitacre has given the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing. 
SHEPARD That shouldn't be a problem. 
WHITACRE What about if an executive used a corporate plane for personal use? 
HERNDON Basically, it's the same thing. 
SHEPARD There may be some IRS issues but... 
WHITACRE What if, hypothetically, the activity involved kickbacks by corporate executives? 
Draft: 1/15/03 119. 
I 
HERNDON There are plenty of ways companies try and attract business. Dinners for clients, tickets for sporting events... 
SHEPARD It's not ethical but it's done. A beat. Then Whitacre goes on. 
WHITACRE Uh, is this conversation on or off the record? 
SHEPARD On. Definitely. Whitacre exhales. 
WHITACRE What if the company regularly accepted kickbacks to executives in the form of cash? Shepard drops his fork. Hold on Shepard. 
SHEPARD How much money are we talking about Mark? Whitacre pauses, clears his throat. 
WHITACRE Five hundred thousand. 
HERNDON How much??? Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just crapped on the rug. 
WHITACRE It's how things were done there. 
SHEPARD When did this start, Mark? 
WHITACRE December of 1991. Shepard can't believe it. 
SHEPARD You, You... And how were you paid? 
Draft: 1/15/03 120. 
E 
WHITACRE By check. They we're deposited in various accounts. And always under 10,000 dollars. 
SHEPARD And did any of these checks come in after we met? Whitacre pauses. 
WHITACRE Maybe a couple. The agents try and control their anger. 
SHEPARD Who else knows about this? 
WHITACRE Nobody. Herndon loses it. 
Draft: 1/15/03 125. 
150 INTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE ELEVATOR- CHICAGO 150 Whitacre, Epstein and Zaideman- on the way into battle. Whitacre is strangely placid. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) That's really the truth about that-- I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was kid-- I raised chickens and rabbits ...Biochem was my advisor's idea... 
WHITACRE Listen, I haven't been telling you the whole truth. I'll clear it up in there today. 
ZAIDEMAN What? OH, SHIT. Epstein starts desperately hitting elevator buttons to stop the approaching doom. 
EPSTEIN We got to get you out of here. But, it's too late the doors open. Whitacre steps out. 
WHITACRE No. I want to tell them. Hold on Epstein. 
151 INTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO 151 Whitacre surrounded by Epstein and Zaideman who can only imagine which way their loose cannon will roll. Across from the DOJ lawyers as far as the eye can see. 
ROBIN MANN Mr. Whitacre's conduct constitutes a breach of his agreement with the US government. He is no longer a cooperating witness. 
EPSTEIN My client has given you years of his life, clearly he made mistakes, but he made your case. 
ROBIN MANN We're not here to discuss the case against ADM. 
A Draft: 1/15/03 126. 
I ED HERBST, early 50's, and MARY SPEARING, 40's, take over-- they take no prisoners. 
HERBST Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst and I'm with the FBI Economic Crimes Unit. I'd like you to tell me when your criminal conduct at ADM began. 
WHITACRE In early 1992. I learned how things were done there from Mick Andreas. He's the one who taught me how to use embezzlement and kickbacks to make money tax free. Epstein tries to do some damage control. 
EPSTEIN My client is... 
WHITACRE I know the frauds I committed are wrong, and I accept responsibility for them. 
HERBST How did you receive the money? 
WHITACRE Primarily by check. I deposited them in my bank account in Decatur. This seems unlikely. Spearing gets angry-- 
MARY SPEARING They paid kickbacks in checks? What company would pay kickbacks in checks? Come on... No one from the government has ever been aggressive toward Whitacre before-- he's thrown. 
WHITACRE I don't really remember the exact name... something like AgriConsulting and Trading, something like that... 
MARY SPEARING You don't remember the name of the company that paid you checks? 
Draft: 1/15/03 127. 
WHITACRE I. .I've got a lot going on in my life. It's hard to remember. 
EPSTEIN Hey, we're coming to you guys. We're cooperating here and we're going to get the money back. Epstein looks at Whitacre-- this last part might be hard. 
HERBST This might help your memory. He slides the forged ABP documents toward Whitacre. 
WHITACRE Where did you get that? 
HERBST These are ADM records showing the forging of signatures. Whitacre smiles and shakes his head. He sees the conspiracy plainly. 
WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.0.) See, that's how they keep Didn't these people see The people in the fold-- they Firm-- or read the book. tell you to take the money It's all there. Everything and then they use it against they did to me they did to you if you talk. It's how Tom Cruise... I'm not the one they control us. You gotta they should be mad at... realize who these people are... 
MARY SPEARING Is there anything else you have a hard time remembering? Whitacre looks at Epstein. Epstein shakes his head "no" but Whitacre has other plans. 
WHITACRE Umm...I have a few other things to tell you about. Epstein sighs. 
WHITACRE There were some things I did in Mexico... 
Draft: 1/15/03 128. 
PULL BACK FROM CONFERENCE ROOM As Whitacre spills his guts the lawyers look on in bewilderment ... The man is unhinged. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) I raised white mice, too. Chickens and goats and white mice in little cages. They couldn't come in the house. I took care of them-- that was my job outside. One got in one time, I don't know how, and he was found dead by my Mother. This had nothing to do with anything I had done-- he just had died and it was up to me to bring him back to life. I wanted to do the right thing and wear the white hat and that's why I tried to make it all right so he wouldn't have to be dead. All the things I did were for that-- but I couldn't. 
152 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- NIGHT 152 Shepard, Herndon, Ginger and Whitacre. Mark looks used up-- his hair seems to be graying around the edges. In front of him are a pile of newspapers-- Washington Post, WSJ, Chicago Tribune, etc. Each with a banner announcement of his sins. 
HERNDON We can't see you anymore and if you call us and start to talk about it, we'll have to hang up... 
SHEPARD You can talk to us about your feelings, but that's it. Shepard puts his coffee cup down near the newspapers. 
ANGLE ON WSJ 7/13/95 Headline reads: YOU DIRTY RAT, SAYS DECATUR ILLINOIS- 
PEOPLE THINK MARK WHITACRE BETRAYED THEM AND ASR WHY HE 
TURNED TO THE FBI. Whitacre nods-- he can't play with his friends any more. 
RUSTY Mark just tried to kill himself and... Ginger's piercing scream comes down the phone line. Whitacre is fetal in the backseat-- moaning. Ginger and HER MOTHER come flying out of the house screaming. They pull Mark out of the car toward the open air as he stumbles, coughing, the family picture clatters across the garage floor. Whitacre jumps on it like a grenade. 
Draft: 1/15/03 133. Whitacre's kids come out of the house and stand clustered at a distance confused and terrified. Helpless in the face of a fallen parent. 
ALEXANDER Dad? Ginger turns to her MOTHER. 
GINGER That Goddam Dwayne Andreas did this to him, Mom. He ought to be killed. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) 
(PRE-LAP) Sometimes I'd leave the country with a big suitcase full of cash. Walk right through customs... 
158 INTERIOR PSYCHIATRISTS OFFICE, CHICAGO- THE NEXT DAY 158 Whitacre lies on the couch talking to DOCTOR MILLER, 60's, genial, soft-spoken. This is not internal, it's therapy. 
WHITACRE .Walk back in with a bag full of jewelry. 
MILLER You never thought you'd get caught? 
WHITACRE That never occurred to me. I mean, I look respectable. Why would they search me? And now they're saying I stole 5 Million dollars. That's what I've been accused of. 
MILLER Did you? 
WHITACRE Yeah. They were paying me 500 grand, but it wasn't enough, I was spending more like eight. So, I took kickbacks. Like I said, it's just what you did if you wanted to be part of the gang at ADM. 
MILLER Is that how it was when you were a kid; you wanted to be part of the gang? 
Draft: 1/15/03 134. Whitacre nods. 
WHITACRE One time I got a brand new, top of the line bicycle. And I bragged to everyone about it. I told everybody how much it cost. A beat. Then proudly. 
WHITACRE It cost ninety dollars. 
MILLER How did you come to work for the 
FBI? 
WHITACRE They approached me. This doesn't make much sense to Miller. 
MILLER How is it that they came to you? Did they know about the price fixing? 
WHITACRE This agent, Brian Shepard came to a number of junior executives at ADM... That's why they approached me. The price fixing hadn't even started yet... Miller is confused by this. 
MILLER But, uh, if no crime was, then-Mark, I'd like to have you checked into the hospital. Whitacre looks over at a file cabinet. 
WHITACRE Is thatwhereyou keep your files? Is thatsafe?I'm the main witness againstthesepeople. You don't know whoyou're dealing with-- they'lldo anything to win. 
159 INTERIOR CAT SCAN FACILITY 159 Whitacre-- in his hospital gown-- vanishes slowly, head first into the MRI tube. 
Draft: 1/15/03 135. 
GINGER (V.0.) Over the last few years he's really changed. 
MILLER (V.0.) How's that? 
160 INTERIOR HOSPITAL CAFETERIA- DAY Ginger and Miller have a cup of coffee. 
GINGER He just kept buying things. We have eight cars-- three of them we never even use. 
MILLER Anything else? 
GINGER I was always the one with the temper and Corky was the happy one-- but that's changed too. Since he said he'd cooperate with the FBI-- he's become so intolerant of everyone... 
MILLER Why do you call him Corky? 
GINGER He's had that name since high school. He was like a champagne cork always flying off somewhere. 
161 INTERIOR DOCTOR MILLER'S OFFICE- ANOTHER DAY Whitacre looks beaten. His voice is cracking-- he's distracted. Not very "Corky" right now. 
WHITACRE There's one in Hong Kong. And then there's the bank accounts in Switzerland and Grand Cayman...Other things-There's a lawyer in New York who has a million dollars of mine. 
MILLER And have you told your attorney the truth about all of these accounts? 
Draft: 1/15/03 136. 
WHITACRE No, but I don't need to. The other assets are legal-- definitely. 
MILLER You need to tell your attorney... 
WHITACRE I don't know if I can trust him. 
MILLER Mark, has anybody in your family ever been diagnosed as bipolar or manic-depressive? Whitacre nods and leans in. 
169 FLASHBACK- ADM, 1990- DAY 169 The office as we've seen it-- bustling with business. Allison walks down the hall and is stopped by Whitacre. 
WHITACRE Hey, Marty, got a minute. He takes a seat across the desk from Whitacre. Whitacre shows him THE NIGERIAN LETTER. 
Draft: 1/15/03 140. 
ALLISON (V.0.) He told me he'd been in touch with certain parties in Nigeria. Businessmen who had overbilled the government there for millions-- but now needed bogus invoices from legitimate US business men to make it all look above board. You put in ten grand you get a hundred back. 
WHITACRE I know people who have made millions on this. My step-father cleaned up. 
170 INTERIOR US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE CHICAGO- CONTINUOUS 170 Basset and Allison. 
AGENT BASSET He'd never heard of the Nigerian scam? 
MARTY ALLISON Not until a couple years later when sixty minutes ran a piece on it showing how people had lost a fortune on the con. 
AGENT BASSET And the kickbacks? 
MARTY ALLISON He had me set up a company in Germany and send fake invoices. I'd get a check for like 200 grand and most of it would go back to Mark. 
AGENT BASSET You kept the rest. 
MARTY ALLISON He told me management knew about it. But, it seemed to me that he was doing the same thing to ADM, that the Nigerians had done to us. 
171 INTERIOR EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN CONFERENCE ROOM- LATER 171 Whitacre has laid out an amazing litany of theft and deception. 
Draft: 1/15/03 141. 
D' ANGELO How much money did you receive through all your illegal activities? Whitacre takes a moment-- does the math in his head, mouthing to himself the various sources of his massive fraud. 
WHITACRE Uh...7.7 Million dollars. But, Mick knew. Like I said, he endorsed these things. 
D' ANGELO He endorsed you stealing 7.7 Million dollars? 
WHITACRE He might have though that was a bit much. 
D' ANGELO Is there anything else you want to tell us? 
WHITACRE Well, I think you did a real good job today-- I do know that ADM has been stealing microbes from the Japanese for years and that they use prostitutes to get information from the competition's facility in Iowa. I know that Mick Andreas uses cocaine and I have that on tape-- and there are illegal campaign contributions to both American and foreign politicians... And under... 
172 EXTERIOR GRANT PARK, CHICAGO- DAY 172 An empty band shell by Lake Michigan. Whitacre sits by himself wearing dark glasses holding an envelope. Waiting... 
EPSTEIN (V.0.) When agents go under cover for the FBI, they get trained for the stresses of living a secret life... 
173 INTERIOR DOJ CHAMBERS- DAY 173 Epstein addresses the standard assortment of lawyers-- Mann, Mutchnik, Spearing, Spratling, etc. 
Draft: 1/15/03 142. 
EPSTEIN We hear this all the time from you guys, how easy it is for trained agents to crack. And here is Mark...A civilian with no training. 
174 EXTERIOR GRANT PARK- CONTINUOUS Whitacre gets up and walks toward a black sedan. He looks around, paranoid. He wouldn't make a good spy. 
EPSTEIN (V.O.) But, you guys shove him in there, you tell him 'go for it,' without anything to make sure he doesn't crack under pressure. You have to ask yourself, was the US government taken in by Mark Whitacre, or did it help create him? Whitacre leans into the car and hands off the envelope. He speaks to some HOODLUM we can't see. 
WHITACRE Tomorrow, 3 O'clock... where we talked about. 
175 INTERIOR DOJ CHAMBERS- CONTINUOUS Epstein's plea is moving-- he's reaching these people. 
EPSTEIN Mark committed a crime. He stole nine million dollars. It's indefensible. But these guys from ADM stole hundreds of millions of dollars from innocent people all over the world. Mark showed you that four white guys in suits getting together in the middle of the day, isn't a business meeting. It's a crime scene. And not only did he tell you about it, he got you the evidence to prove it. Now, we're not looking for the moon and stars. We're looking for something in the area of three years.. .Or we can take it to trial. And in that trial I'll lay out everything Mark Whitacre did-- good and bad... 
Draft: 1/15/03 143. 
176 EXTERIOR SHOPPING MALL- DECATUR 176 Whitacre stands in the parking lot reading the paper on a cool autumn day. No black sedan. The big clock outside the bank in the mall says: 4:25. Whitacre walks over to a trash can and removes a BOTTLE OF MEDICATION from his pocket. He empties it into the trash. 
EPSTEIN (V.O.) And somewhere a future whistle blower is going to pick up the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and read what Mark's life has become because he decided to cooperate. Whitacre gives up, gets in his car and drives away. 
177 INTERIOR DOJ CHAMBERS- CONTINUOUS 177 He drives his point home. A brilliant performance. 
EPSTEIN Because he decided to take on a powerful company-And then, you'll never have one of these white collar guys pick up a phone and call you ever again. 
178 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- A LITTLE LATER 178 Whitacre comes flying through the door-- his jacket is now ripped, his glasses are bent, he's holding his arm. He looks like he's been through hell ...he's frantic. 
WHITACRE Baby. . .Ginger. They grabbed me. There were two of them. Ginger rushes through the house to the aid of her husband. 
GINGER Oh my God... 
WHITACRE They wouldn't let me out of the car. 
GINGER Look at your shirt.. .what happened? As she embraces him we are close on Whitacre... 
Draft: 1/15/03 144. 
WHITACRE It's true. Definitely-- it's on his letterhead, he signed it... 
SHEPARD The area code ...Mark... He puts the letter in the middle of the table. 
SHEPARD (CONT'D) .Area code 847. It says the letter was written in November 1995- - that area code didn't exist then. 
WHITACRE Well, everybody knew the area code change was coming. Lot's of people ordered new stationery early. 
SHEPARD I thought about that. So I asked the phone company. This is the press release announcing the 847 area code... He puts the release on the table. 
Draft: 1/15/03 149. 
SHEPARD It's dated six days after your letter was written-- Doctor Miller couldn't have known about it. Whitacre stares at it-- then looks up. 
THE MACHINE IN HIS HEAD THAT RECONSTITUTES REALITY GRINDS AND 
SEIZES. HE'S FINALLY TRAPPED. THE INTERIOR MONOLOGUE IS THE 
SAME AS THE DIALOGUE IN THE SCENE-- BUT PRECEDES WHAT 
WHITACRE IS SAYING OUT LOUD BY AN INSTANT. THERE IS AN ECHO 
ONLY WHITACRE CAN HEAR. 
WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.0.) Ron Henkoff from Fortune Ron Henkoff from Fortune called Doctor Miller and called Doctor Miller and Miller confirmed the Miller confirmed the letter... letter... 
SHEPARD I called Miller, Mark. Ginger quietly starts to cry-- picks up the letter. 
WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.0.) He can't talk to you.-That's He can't talk to you... That's a violation of doctor patient a violation of doctor patient confidentiality... confidentiality... 
SHEPARD Doctor patient confidentiality doesn't apply to forgeries. Ginger cries harder. Whitacre tries again. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) WHITACRE Then why did Fortune Magazine Then why did Fortune Magazine run the story... run the story... Ginger has had it, she breaks down. 
GINGER Stop it... 
WHITACRE SHEPARD Call Henkoff... He never wrote the letter. 
GINGER Stop it, Mark. You have to stop doing this to yourself, please stop. Whitacre is done. 
Draft: 1/15/03 150. 
F 
WHITACRE I think maybe I should go back to the hospital. 
187 INTERIOR FEDERAL COURT, URBANA ILLINOIS 187 Whitacre looks like shit. He sits with Walker in JUDGE HAROLD BAKER'S courtroom. 
SUPER: OCTOBER, 10TH, 1997 
CLERK Case 97-2001 United states of America versus Mark Whitacre. 
JUDGE BAKER You have the right to make a statement if you wish? Whitacre nods and stands. 
WHITACRE I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words, it's been a long five years. I apologize to a lot of people in this room... 
ANGLE ON SHEPARD AND HERNDON They sit together in the back row. 
WHITACRE And to a lot of them who are not in this room for my actions. I realize I hurt a lot of people and I apologize greatly...I am here to accept my punishment. That's all. 
JUDGE BAKER To observe that Mr. Whitacre is the usual felon is a gross understatement. He is well educated, has a loving wife and family, is respected in the community. It is not inconceivable that in due course he may have become CEO of Archer Daniels Midland... 
ANGLE ON WHITACRE He smiles. He knew he could be CEO someday. . .We hear Whitacre in a calmer time. 
Draft: 1/15/03 151. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) I like jail. I think it's been good for me... But, the judge isn't done with him. 
JUDGE BAKER However, the court can find no clear connection between Mr. Whitacre's bipolar disorder and the 45 counts of criminal misconduct he has been charged with-- just garden variety greed. It is very difficult to tell when Mr. Whitacre is telling the truth... 
188 INTERIOR ANOTHER COURTROOM- DAY 188 A larger courtroom. Mick and Terry stand for sentencing, surrounded by Aubrey Daniel and others. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) But, I don't think what happened is fair when you look at what happened to me compared to Mick and Terry. I mean, if you go and hold up your local grocery store you might get five years... 
SUPER: FIVE YEARS LATER 
ANGLE ON WHITACRE 
FULL SCREEN VIDEO 
WHITACRE Mick and Terry held up every grocery store in the world and they only got three... So you tell me how it makes sense that I get nine. I think that's something you should consider, Mr. President, when reviewing my request for pardon.

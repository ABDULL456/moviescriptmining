EXT. TITLE SEQUENCE P                                         1 Painted images of the Elizabethan age - 
CAPTION 
A world divided by religious hatred. 
The new Protestant faith is spreading. 
Bodies burned on a pyre - men writhing under torture - a momentary half-recognisable face, gaunt and staring - FATHER ROBERT RESTON. 
CAPTION The most powerful ruler in Christendom, Philip of Spain, has sworn to return all Europe to the Catholic faith. 
Images of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court paintings: stiff, formal, imperious. 
CAPTION Only England stands in his way: a weak impoverished nation ruled by a woman. 
Finally images of God in judgement, as if speaking to his chosen servant. 
CAPTION Philip prepares to obey the will 2             of his God. 
INT. PRIVATE CHAPEL, ESCORIAL PALACE, SPAIN - DAY             2 
Bn ascetic-looking man dressed in black kneels in a small plain chapel, in virtual darkness. PHILIP II, King of Spain bows his head low, abasing himself before his God. T S/I CAPTION: 
scorial Palace, Spain, 1585. 
Now, slowly, he raises his head. His eyes open, and we see there the glow of a new certainty. God has spoken to him. 
PHILIP (I hear. I obey. My Lord and my God.) 
May 1 Blue Draft--p.2 
INT. HALLWAY/SALON, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered; among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he enters, all kneel. 
His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling, heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all. 
PHILIP (God has made his will known to me. The time for our great enterprise has come.) 
The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself. 
RESTON At last. 
Cathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard through the open windows. 
The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony. 
EXT. BALCONY, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him. Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's power. 
Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his people's adoration. 
EXT. THAMES - DAY A ripple of light on the water. A blur of approaching colour. 
May 1 Blue Draft--p.3 The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape: its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting bright shards of shining water in the sunlight. P eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling, cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out. 
Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the Queen. 
They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE. 
Over this an insistent voice: 
Tom Babington stands unobtrusively at the back of the crowd. He carries a bag which may or may not contain a gun. A bustle of activity, a ripple of anticipation - `She's coming!' - and the palace doors open. 
BABINGTON'S POV: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS, the cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst, Elizabeth, almost completely masked as she passes by. Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham. 
The people cheer, call out to the Queen, reach to touch her, fall to their knees. 
CROWD God bless your majesty - God love you! - See her sweet face! 
Others in the crowd are shouting more militant sentiments. 
CROWD 
Hang the Papists! - Look out for traitors, Elizabeth! Mary Stuart is the whore of Rome! Babington moves forward, easing his way to the front of the crowd. Nearby there stands another young man who is watching, not cheering: RAMSAY. 
A WOMAN WTH A BABY pushes her way almost to the Queen, 
holding her baby before her. 
WOMAN WITH BABY 
Your blessing, majesty. My little one, your blessing. BABINGTON'S POV- The Queen stopping to bless the little baby, smiling, putting out her hand to touch the baby's head. The mother bobs a curtsey. The Queen moves on, with her entourage. A sudden scuffle in the crowd. Babington turns to look. 
A CLOAK SWEEPS THROUGH FRAME - dropping down to the ground - revealing as it passes the handsome smiling face of Raleigh, directly in R the path of the Queen. 
ALEIGH A puddle in the way, majesty. 
Elizabeth signs to the guards to stay calm. She stares at Raleigh, then she looks down at the cloak. No sign of any puddles. Bess Throckmorton watches, suppressing a smile. 
E 
May 1 Blue Draft - p.16 
Elizabeth looks back up, meets Raleigh's eyes with a cool appraising gaze. Then she walks on over the cloak, shaking her head. 
ELIZABETH A puddle... The guards take up their positions once more. Bess throws Raleigh a quick smile as she follows the royal party. His answering shrug says: I tried. He picks up the cloak, and stands gazing after the Queen. 
lizabeth goes into the chapel, and the doors close behind her. 
ROYAL SERVANT The Queen is at her prayers! 
INT. CHAPEL ROYAL - DAY 18A                                                                 18A The Queen at her prayers, her mind elsewhere; privately amused. 
ELIZABETH A puddle... 
18B                                                                 18B EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY 
Raleigh puts an arm round Calley. 
RALEIGH She spoke to me. You have to give me that. 
CALLEY Oh, I do. The Queen spoke to you. One word - but she spoke. 
RALEIGH Two words. 
CALLEY You're made. A dukedom at the very least. 
RALEIGH Did you see the girl behind her? I've been at sea too long. 
INT. GREAT HALL, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY The Great Hall is crowded with competing factions. A group of Spaniards, led by their Ambassador, DON GUERAU DE SPES, stand watching everyone else with haughty disdain. 
W 
Yellow Revision May 22--p.17 An architect waits to present details of a building project. Petitioners wait vainly, in the hope of catching the Queen's eye. Howard and Hatton are in attendance. Walsingham stands by the Queen's side, briefing her in a low murmur for her ears only. ALSINGHAM Thousands are dying every day of famine in Ireland. Another rebellion is a distinct possibility. A courtier is holding a portrait which he shows to the Queen. COURTIER Francis of Valois, majesty. 
HATTON 
Brother to the king of France, majesty. WALSINGHAM 
France is in religious turmoil. It would be unwise to engage with their instability. ELIZABETH (to Lord Howard) You have the plans for the new docks? 
R 
Yellow Revision May 22 - p.20 One of the Spaniards recognises him and murmurs to the Ambassador; who speaks angrily to the Queen. 
DON GUERAU Majesty, this man is a notorious pirate. 
ELIZABETH Indeed? 
Don Guerau points to the hampers. 
DON GUERAU Spanish treasure, stolen from Spanish ships. You will see. R aleigh kneels before the Queen. Elizabeth gestures for him to rise. 
ELIZABETH Well, sir. Who are you? 
RALEIGH Walter Raleigh, your majesty. 
ELIZABETH 
Ah, yes. Raleigh. I've heard of your voyage. What's your rank? RALEIGH A gentleman of Devon. 
ELIZABETH What do you want? 
RALEIGH The honour to be in the presence of my Queen, whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the English people. 
ELIZABETH Yes, well, here you are. 
ALEIGH I'm just returned from the New World, majesty. I have claimed the fertile coast in your name, and called it Virginia, in honour of our Virgin Queen. 
Elizabeth raises her eyebrows. 
ELIZABETH Virginia? And if I marry? Will you change the name to Conjugia? 
A royal joke. Her entourage laughs dutifully. 
Yellow Revision May 22 -p.21 
RALEIGH I ask for your gracious permission, majesty, to return to the New World with your royal warrant, to found a colony under the laws and protections of England. E lizabeth's eye has fallen on the native Americans. 
ELIZABETH Who are they? 
RALEIGH Americans, majesty. They long to be your newest subjects. 
He beckons Calley to lead Wanchese and Manteo forward. 
ELIZABETH Have they no ruler of their own? 
RALEIGH None to match England's Queen. 
Elizabeth gazes at the natives. She holds out her hand. Unaware that he's meant to kiss the Queen's hand, Manteo, takes it and shakes it. A gasp from the watching courtiers. But Elizabeth accepts the courtesy. 
ELIZABETH These gentlemen are welcome. See that they're treated well. 
Calley hurries them away before worse happens. 
RALEIGH I also come bearing gifts for your majesty, from the New World. 
He beckons to the servants to bring the baskets. Don Guerau steps forward. 
DON GUERAU The fruits of piracy, majesty. The true property of the realm of Spain. 
ELIZABETH Let's see, shall we? to Raleigh) What do you bring me? 
RALEIGH Mud, and leaves.

Members of the court share suppressed smiles. 
EXT. WOOD - DUSK 
Young Savage stands alone among trees, shivering, white- faced, half-mumbling, half-singing an endless prayer. He holds a pistol with which he means to kill himself. But he can't do it.         S AVAGE (singing) Salve regina, mater misericordiae, vita dulcedo et spes nostra salve... 
In a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. They are young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and FRANCIS THROCKMORTON. A fourth man stands before them, his back to us, watching Savage. At first we don't see who he is. 
May 1 Blue Draft - p.25 
RESTON (O.O.V.) His weakness endangers us all. He can't go on with us. And we can't leave him behind. 
Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a priest. 
RESTON Who will help him? 
Babington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a little behind. 
SAVAGE singing) Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii Evae. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle - 
He sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from his hand. 
BABINGTON Make your peace with God. 
Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means to do. Terror overwhelms him. 
SAVAGE No, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't want to die! 
Now he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this, and can't shoot. 
Reston begins to pray aloud. 
RESTON Si ambulam in medio umbrae mortis, non timebo mala - 
The others join in with the words of the well-known psalm. Babington too joins in, now weeping. 
RESTON AND OTHERS Quoniam tu mecum es, Domine. Virga tua et baculus tuus, ipsa me consolata sunt - B ANG! Savage falls dead.

INT. WALSINGHAM'S HOUSE - EVENING Walsingham enters his private home, and gives his hat and cloak to his servant. 
SERVANT Visitor waiting, sir. 
Walsingham frowns. He climbs the stairs to the door of his study. There, pacing nervously, is his younger brother WILLIAM, a middle-aged student. Walsingham's scowl disappears. He opens his arms wide. WALSINGHAM 
William! 
WILLIAM 
Hello, Francis. 
They embrace. Then Walsingham pushes him back to take a good look at him. WALSINGHAM You look terrible. Don't they feed you in Paris? How are your studies? Learned the secrets of the universe yet? 
WILLIAM Not yet. 
WALSINGHAM These are dangerous times to be questioning the ways of God. You must take care of yourself. 
WILLIAM My needs are simple. 
WALSINGHAM You'll dine with us? You'll lodge with us? 
is daughter MARY appears at the top of the next flight. 
MARY WALSINGHAM William! 
She comes tumbling down and into his arms. She's an eager innocent 20-year-old, much loved by her father. 
WILLIAM Look at you! All grown up. 
be joined in love. But now that I am bathed in the radiance of your glory, I am overwhelmed. I am 
conquered. I die. Only your love, great Elizabeth, can restore me to life. C ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts. The Spaniards sneer openly. But Elizabeth takes the charade with due gravity. 
LIZABETH Your highness does me great honour. Shall we eat our dinner? It should prove almost as restorative as my love. 
Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing pranks on the guests. 
Green Revision May 25 - p.29A 
Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He catches Bess's eye and they share a smile. 
COURT LADY So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship? You shoot holes in its sides, I suppose. 
May 1 Blue Draft - p.30 
RALEIGH No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no value. The object is to capture and command. 
COURT LADY And how do you do that? 
RALEIGH Surprise. Speed. Irresistible violence. 
Calley, listening, rolls his eyes. 
Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side, glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has hardly touched his food. 
ELIZABETH I think you're not as accustomed as I am to eating in public. I have a secret. lowering her voice) I pretend there's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them. S he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also Raleigh. 
ELIZABETH They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. You should try it. 
She beckons to Bess. 
ELIZABETH Bess. 
Bess comes forward. 
ELIZABETH (low) He interests me. Talk to him. 
BESS Him, my lady? 
ELIZABETH Him. 
Bess turns and looks across towards Raleigh, as he flirts with the court ladies. 
Green Revision May 25 - p.31 
Elizabeth turns back to her guest. 
ELIZABETH His highness is tired after his journey. 
The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply. 
ARCHDUKE CHARLES No man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a Queen. E lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German. 
ELIZABETH (You play the game very well, my young friend. But don't you 
sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really thinking?) The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile. 
ARCHDUKE CHARLES (I daren't even think what I'm really thinking.) ELIZABETH (You're thinking, perhaps, that 
you would far rather be home.) 
ARCHDUKE CHARLES (You're very wise, madame.) 
He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it. 
Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies. COURT LADY I adore the natives you brought back with you. I don't suppose you could get one for me? They're not dangerous, are they? RALEIGH That depends what you propose to do with them. COURT LADY I'd dress him up in mulberry- coloured silk and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak.

Their eyes meet, both aware of the current of mutual attraction.

Bess hurries after the Queen. The Austrian entourage is just leaving as the Queen turns. 
ELIZABETH Mr. Raleigh. 
INT QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY 35A                                                              35A Elizabeth and Raleigh walk together around the perimeter hallway, dwarfed by vast murals. 
ELIZABETH I like your immensities. Your ocean is an image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us? 
RALEIGH You speak like a true explorer. 
ELIZABETH I like you, Mr Raleigh. 
RALEIGH And I like you. 
She stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes. She's not used to such direct replies. Bess is watching them. 
ELIZABETH You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him. 
ALEIGH I have heard that. 
ELIZABETH And what have you to say about it?       R ALEIGH Reward my mission, majesty, not me. 
ELIZABETH Is the mission not the man? RALEIGH Leave me free to like you in return. That can be my reward. 
ELIZABETH Go on. RALEIGH I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself. 
Elizabeth stares. This is a little too close to the truth. 
ELIZABETH Now you become dull.

Horses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying - Two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride, neck and neck- 
Elizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other, faces glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the moment. 
Raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length. At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk. 
RALEIGH Mine! 
Elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak. 
ELIZABETH (out of breath) You have - the stronger horse. 
Y         RALEIGH ours carries the lighter load. 
ELIZABETH The Queen does not give way to others. Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse springs forward, ahead of her. RALEIGH Whoa! Whoa! (at Elizabeth, reigning in the horse) Forgive me, majesty. My horse doesn't know his place yet Elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued. 
43A 
ELIZABETH Have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh? She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I'm surprised you're not married yet. RALEIGH I'm a sailor, majesty. ELIZABETH And can sailors not be lovers? RALEIGH (with a smile) 
Must lovers be husbands? 
ELIZABETH Ah, I see. You like love better 
than marriage. That I understand. 
RALEIGH 
Your majesty is not eager to be married? 
BESS Majesty? RALEIGH I'm afraid that's not possible. Women bring bad luck on board ship. 
ELIZABETH Oh, do they? 
RALEIGH Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room, for months at a time - Men have needs. A beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad. 
ELIZABETH (amused) Men have needs? 
nce again Elizabeth meets Raleigh's eyes. Then she breaks away, feeling the contact is dangerous. 
ELIZABETH Then let them stay on land and see to their needs. (to Bess) Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony, Bess. We must persuade him to stay a little longer, mustn't we? 
INT. HALLWAY, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY 42A                                                                 42A Raleigh is leaving. Walsingham has been waiting for him. He falls into step beside him. WALSINGHAM Mr Raleigh. A word of advice. The Queen chooses to show you favour. You naturally wish to take advantage of that. (Beat) Don't ask for too much. RALEIGH You think all I want is money. WALSINGHAM I hope all you want is money. 
Buff Revision 6th June - p.44A 
RALEIGH You think I'm a cynical adventurer, with little breeding and less education. You're wrong. I'm a cynical adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education. WALSINGHAM I begin to see why the Queen likes you. 
INT/EXT. LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT A soft knock on the door. Francis Throckmorton goes to the window and looks out. 
THROCKMORTON'S POV - In the street outside, a woman with her head covered. 
He unbolts the door. T 
HROCKMORTON Bess? 
Two men burst in and seize him. They are Agents 4 and 5. Beyond, the woman - not Bess - is hurrying away. 
Throckmorton struggles. A single sharp blow, and he folds to the ground.

INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY Multiple images of Elizabeth, naked. Strange misty refracted glimpses of her face, her body. 
A bath of steaming hot water has been placed in the Queen's private quarters, and screened by mirrors. The Queen is in the bath, being washed by her ladies. B ess Throckmorton has the job of holding the Queen's hair out of the water as she's washed. She strokes the soft tresses as she holds them, unaware that Elizabeth can see her in the mirror. 
Then she looks up and catches Elizabeth's eyes, and stops in confusion. 
ELIZABETH No, don't stop. I like it. 
Bess returns to her gentle caresses, and Elizabeth to her thoughts. 
ELIZABETH Is it true, Bess? That I've never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself? 
BESS I hope you believe that I like you for yourself, my lady. ELIZABETH Is anybody ever liked just for themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you're pretty. And because you have the ear of the Queen. 
E 
May 1 Blue Draft - p. 50 
BESS No doubt, my lady. 
ELIZABETH Him too. He likes you because he wants my favour. You do realise that? 
BESS Yes, my lady. 
ELIZABETH And the other thing too, of course. But all men want that. Male desire confers no B         distinction. 
ess strokes Elizabeth's hair in silence. Then she sees Elizabeth gazing at her in the mirror. 
LIZABETH I envy you, Bess. You're free to have - what I can't have. You're my adventurer. Don't be afraid. It's all over so soon. 
INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY 
A man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick lunch. He's the TORTURER. Nearby on a blood-stained bench lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably. It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary. 
Walsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet. Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business. 
A knife at his throat. A quick slash. 
The killer, Agent 3, waits one more moment, to be sure the job is done. The torturer slumps, still standing, against the wall. 
Agent 3 slips away. 
On the flag stones, blood trickles down to mingle with the urine. 
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Now there are guards everywhere. The whole palace is on heightened alert. 
lizabeth sweeps out of the Privy Chamber into the Great Hall, accompanied by the Spanish Ambassador on one side and Walsingham on the other. Her entourage scuttles behind. 
ELIZABETH What do you know of the Enterprise of England, Ambassador? 
DON GUERAU The Enterprise...? Forgive me, your majesty... 
ELIZABETH It's a plan for the invasion of my country. Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and - 
WALSINGHAM Norfolk. 
ELIZABETH And Norfolk. Mary Stuart is to be set free, and placed on the English throne. 
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 54 ELIZABETH(cont'd) I am to be assassinated. Does any of this sound familiar? 
DON GUERAU I know nothing of any invasion plans. 
ELIZABETH I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England. It should more accurately be called `la Empresa di Inglaterra', because it's a Spanish plan. The plan of your king, my one-time brother-in- law, Philip II, to attack my country. 
The Ambassador decides the best form of defence is attack. D ON GUERAU Attack? It is my country that is under attack! Your so-called pirates attack our merchant ships daily! Do you think we don't know where their orders come from? The whole world knows that pirates sail up the Thames all the way to the royal bed! 
ELIZABETH (exploding) You will leave my presence, sir! Go back to Spain! Tell Philip that I don't fear him, or his priests, or his armies. Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets. 
Don Guerau sees no point in further pretence. He speaks with pride and contempt. 
DON GUERAU You see a leaf fall, and you think you know which way the wind blows. But a wind is coming, madam, that will sweep away your pride. H e bows and turns to go. Elizabeth's words blaze after him. 
ELIZABETH I too can command the wind, sir. I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare, if you dare to try me! 
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 55 
Shivering with rage she turns round, and there's Raleigh. Her fury overflows onto him. 
ELIZABETH What are you staring at? Lower your eyes! I am the Queen! 
She sweeps past him without a further glance. 
ON RALEIGH - Watching Elizabeth go. A shake of his head. Enough. 
EXT. SHIPYARD, SPAIN - DAY Immense stacks of cut timber as far as the eye can see. Skeletons of new ships, big ships, rising in the great yard. Hundreds of ship-builders at work. T his is what the forests were felled for: a brand-new fleet is being built. 
Tiny figures in the wide scene: the royal party appears. Philip has come to see progress for himself. As he and his entourage tour the construction site, one of his ministers briefs him on the latest developments in England. 
SPANISH MINISTER (It can't be denied that we've lost the advantage of surprise. A large part of our plans has come into their hands.) 
PHILIP (The Jesuit is still at liberty?) 
SPANISH MINISTER (We understand so, majesty.) 
PHILIP (He knows his business. We've lost nothing.) 
The workmen kneel to Philip as he passes. 
PHILIP (Tell the carpenters to go on working. No one is to stop for me. The fleet must be ready to sail in a month.) 
SPANISH MINISTER (Impossible, majesty!) 
PHILIP (If this is God's work, God will make it possible.)

EXT. GALLOWS - DAY CLOSE ON Throckmorton as the noose is tightened round his neck. His face is ravaged by the tortures he's endured, but he holds his head high, ready for death. Round him an unseen crowd bays for blood. 
CROWD (O.S.) Hang! Hang! Hang! 
RESTON (V.O.) Lord have mercy on the soul of your servant, who gives his life for your eternal truth...

Reston puts his hands on Babington's shoulders and gently but irresistibly forces him down to pray with them. RESTON Lord, be with us as the end approaches. 
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 60 RESTON(cont'd) We will not fail in our duty. We look beyond death, to eternity.

bowed in prayer. 
Raleigh enters through the rear doors. He stands in 
silence, watching her as she prays. He hears her sigh. 
He takes a step towards her. She hears, startled. Turns and sees him. BESS Oh! It's you! 
RALEIGH I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. 
BESS My prayer's done. 
She rises to her feet. 
RALEIGH Something has distressed you. 
BESS And I thought I prayed in silence. 
RALEIGH So you did. 
She turns away, unable to look him in the eyes. 
BESS A man was hanged today. A Papist. I knew him well. He was my cousin. He died because I gave information. I gave information to prove my loyalty. Because I was afraid.

RALEIGH That's necessity. That's the world we live in. BESS He told me he wanted to change. Become part of the new England. I was afraid that he was lying to me. But what if - what if it was true? He sees the horror in her eyes, at the thought that she has sent an innocent man to his death. Tears rise to her eyes. BESS 
What if I was his last hope? What if I was the one person he thought he could trust? RALEIGH If you knew him well, you will have sensed the truth. BESS I thought so. RALEIGH He was hoping to use you. You did 
what you had to do. 
She can no longer hold back the tears. RALEIGH There, now. He wipes away a tear from her cheek. In desperate need of comfort, she throws herself into his arms. He holds her 
close as she sobs. 
RALEIGH We're all mortal, Bess. We do what we can. He strokes her cheek. She meets his eyes, filled with gratitude. She takes the hand that touches her face and moves it to her lips. She kisses it, still holding his eyes. He draws her back into his arms, and they kiss. Suddenly they're kissing eagerly, greedily, their long pent- up passion released at last.

Walsingham has been idly examining the scientific instruments. He speaks now as if his question is casual. 
WALSINGHAM Nothing more, Dr Dee? No more specific calamities that we can guard against? 
ELIZABETH He means, Will I be assassinated? 
WALSINGHAM Queens are mortal. 
Dr Dee smiles as he gently contradicts him.

ELIZABETH And the private life of this prince of the female gender, Dr Dee? What do the stars foretell there? Or is this too a mystery?

But as he looks, he finds something more that disturbs him. DEE But you doubt yourself, my child... I've not seen fear in 
your face before. 
ELIZABETH 
Have I reason to fear? 
DEE Something has weakened you... 
There is danger, yes... Your strength lies in your spirit. Nothing else matters. There are 
hard days coming. You must trust the power of your spirit. 
Elizabeth is shaken by these words. Dee turns to look out once more at the night sky.

The dance begins again. Bess jumps, and Raleigh swings her round and round, finding the knack after an awkward start. Elizabeth watches, smiling, nodding to the beat. She can see the faces of the dancers; and so long as she controls the intimacy between them, she's excited by it.

loath to die so bloody a death. 
RALEIGH Since when were you so afraid? 
Now she looks at him. 
ELIZABETH Yes, I am afraid. I am always afraid. 
Raleigh looks back at her in silence for a long moment. Then -

DEE The forces that shape the world are greater than all of us, majesty. How can I promise you that they'll conspire in your favour, even though you are the Queen? But this much I know. When the storm breaks, each man acts in accordance with his own nature. Some are dumb with terror. Some flee. Some hide. And some spread their wings like eagles and soar on the wind.

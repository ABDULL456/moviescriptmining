FADE IN: 
EXT. THE STAPLES CENTER - PRESENT DAY 
We hear the faint sounds of a crowd cheering on Kobe Bryant. The real Bob Costas does narration. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) Before the NBA was the NBA, there was another basketball league in America... DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of great plays are made by ABA stars. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) .From 1967 to 1976, there was the American Basketball Association. A maverick minor-league that would change the game forever. The ABA made the fast break FAST... Invented the three point shot... And introduced the world to something called the Slam Dunk Contest. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and dunks in the world's first dunk contest. David Thompson finishes an Alley Oop. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland Oaks. Wilt Chambelain coached the Conquistadors. I myself was the young voice of the St. Louis Spirits. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A young Bob Costas broadcasts from St. Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket. 
BOB COSTAS (V.O.) Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George Gervin and Moses Malone were as entertaining as they come. But despite the league's flair, convincing fans to show up for games was often a struggle. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy Lewis wins a 'race horse.' Footage of 'Dime Beer Night.' Footage of the Kentucky Colonials fielding a cheerleader as one of their starting five. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0. ) For owners, promotional ideas became an art form all to themselves. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The Miami Ball Girls dance in bikinis (In truth, some of the girls were still in high school). 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) One night, the Nets went as far as to give a free gerbil to it's first fifty fans... There were plenty of punches too, giving the National Hockey League a run for it's money. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns and punches the guy in the face. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) Yes, the ABA had a style all it's own. The hair was big, the shorts were short and the ball was red, white and blue. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) In 1976, rumors of a merger spread throughout the league. In the end, only four teams would join the NBA and survive. 
QUICK CUTS: THE PACERS. THE NUGGETS. THE NETS. THE SPURS. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) Teams like the Kentucky Colonels and the Virginia Squires would disappear forever. But their spirit still lives on to this day. 
EXT. A BASKETBALL STADIUM - 1976 
We hear a crowd going crazy. 
BOB COSTAS (V.0.) Here, we present the legend of the ABA... Exactly as it happened. Some FUNKY MUSIC plays. 
BOB COSTAS (V_O_) Except, this Flint Michigan team never existed. 
(BEAT) And, well, everything in this movie is completely fake. 
INT. AMIGO STADIUM - DAY 
TITLE CARD: ANAHEIM AMIGO STADIUM, 1976. CLOSE ON: A logo of a basketball with a sombrero on it. 
"LET'S GO AMIGOS!" Welcome to the American Basketball Association. A fan chugs his beer and throws some guacamole. The crowd screams and curses at MONIX, mid 40'S -- talented, but past his prime. (There are three leading characters in this movie. This is the old rock. Think Nolte in 48 hours. Cosner in Durham. Newman in Slap Shot). 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) The Amigos are up by one here. They'll need to find a way to stop Monix. He checks the clock, waits... And now drives the lane... MONIX suddenly takes a HUGE HIT, TOTALLY SLAMMED by a big asshole, PETRELLI. He flies into the crowd -- everyone erupts, screaming with glee. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Ooh, Monix gets taken out hard. Some tough love from Patrelli. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0.) WHAT!? Where's the foul on that? That was all ball. (covering mic, screaming) Jesus Christ Leonard! Let them play for once! This ain't fuckin' Greenpeace! 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Some might say that was a close call, but these referees have done a nice job tonight. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0.) 'Oh please. These refs SUCK. Still stuck in the crowd. Monix struggles to get back on the court. The crowd shoves him around, twisting his ankle, slapping him. The crowd is nuts. 
DRUNK LADY Hey Monix, want a sip? Monix is confused, until the woman throws the beer in his face. 
DRUNK LADY (smart ass) Oops. She and her friends laugh. Monix says nothing. Instead, he holds his aching back and limps up to the foul line, annoyed. 
PATRELLI 
(SMILING) Sorry, Monix, I got pushed. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Well, it looks like the Amigos are in trouble here. Monix is a ninety percent shooter, if he can hit both of these free throws, it's over. Monix performs his ancient free throw ritual: Three dribbles and a quick spin of the ball. But he MISSES. 
DRUNK LADY 
HA. NICE SHOT MONIX! YOU FUCKIN' 
SUCK, MAN! YOU SUCK DONKEY DICK. Again, Monix ignores the drunk lady. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) They dodged a bullet there. But Monix still has one last chance to tie it up. Monix focuses on his ritual again. 
CLARENCE 'Cause I changed my name, that's why. 
CUSTOMER WOMAN (reading his name tag) Downtown Funky-Stuff Malone? 
CLARENCE You like it? 
CUSTOMER WOMAN I guess it's fine. 
CLARENCE It ain't fine. (as in smooth) It's fine... 
A large woman, QUINCY -- Clarence's Mom -- yells from the kitchen. 
QUINCY 
HEY CLARENCE! 
CLARENCE 
DOWNTOWN! 
MS. QUINCY 
I NEVER NAMED NO SON OF MINE 
DOWNTOWN! 
CLARENCE 
THEN I CAN'T HEAR A GOD DAMN THING. 
MS. QUINCY 
IT'S SEVEN FORTY-FIVE, YOU BETTER 
GET YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE. 
CLARENCE Shit. (to the customers) It's been a pleasure serving you. Clarence tosses his note pad on the table and his Mother tosses him his duffle bag. 
MS. QUINCY And don't think I didn't see those cotton briefs of yours in there. 
CLARENCE Stay outta my stuff! 
MS. QUINCY Don't you know our ancestors had to pick that cotton? Get yourself some silk underpants. Have some respect. 
CLARENCE Panties are silk. Briefs are cotton. I'm out of here. 
JACKIE MOON (O.S.) Ladies and gentleman, please rise... 
EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT 
Welcome to Flint Michigan Fairgrounds Coliseum, basketball's end of the world. This is more like a shitty airplane hanger than a stadium. 
JACKIE MOON (O.S. ) .For the National Anthem... Of your Flint Michigan Tropics. 
MUSIC CUE: SOME SERIOUS DISCO BOOGIE 
INT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
WE PAN SOME STILL PHOTOS OF JACKIE MOON IN THE LOBBY. PICTURE 1: The one-hit-wonder, Jackie moon is on an album cover, shirtless, petting a white leopard. 
JACKIE MOON (V.0.) Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby, are you ready to; lick me sexy. PICTURE 2: Jackie Moon in Reno, singing with Pat Boone. He holds up his only hit single. PICTURE 3: Jackie is getting married to LUCY MOON. She's the hottest girl in the world. 
JACKIE MOON (V.0.) Take off your shoes and; suck me sexy. Baby, we're naked and we're; humping sexy-- PICTURE 4: Jackie hands over a giant check, PURCHASING THE 
FLINT TROPICS. 
EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT 
Center court, we finally see JACKIE MOON. He sports a perm, lamb chop sideburns and black frame glasses. He continues to sing this song of his own creation... 
JACKIE MOON 
(SINGING) Oh yeah, Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby, are you ready to; lick me sexy. Jackie Moon is a sight to see. His one-hit-wonder is ridiculous. But you have to admit it's catchy. 
QUICK CUTS: THE RETARDED WORLD OF THE FLINT TROPICS: THE CROWD: Under 100 people are in the stands, but they're high energy. Lots of drinking and dancing. 
JACKIE MOON (V.0. ) Take off your shoes and; suck me sexy. THE BALL GIRLS: They bounce around in shiny-funky hot pants -- dancing cool, but not in sync. When it comes to ball girls, Flint delivers. THE TROPICAL AISLE: A rowdy bunch is decked out in Hawaiian shirts and packed in behind the visiter's bench, looking for trouble. THE SCOREBOARD: The Magnovox has been sold. The Tropics now do it by hand. 
Jackie dribbles hard to the hoop, tossing up a high arcing baby hook. AIRBALL. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. ) Airball. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0. ) Yep, a Polish swish. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Scootsie Double-Day gets the offensive rebound and Jackie calls for it again, trying to establish the low post early. Jackie holds the ball, preparing for another 'Tear Drop from Hades'... But now he suddenly gets distracted by something up in the stands. 
JACKIE MOON (into the stands) 
HEY! RAVI! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU 
DOING, MAN? IN THE STANDS: A Pakistani vendor, RAVI, IS POURING CHEESE ON 
SOME NACHOS. 
RAVI What? 
JACKIE MOON Enough with the cheese already. More chips, less cheese, how many times do I have to tell you? WHISTLE! Jackie's been walking with the ball. FATHER PAT THE REF wears a holy collar with pin strips over it. 
FATHER PAT THE. REF Traveling. 
JACKIE MOON Traveling!?... On who? 
FATHER PAT THE REF On you. 
JACKIE MOON That's bullshit, Father Pat! Jackie, furious, SLAMS THE BALL down on the floor. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. ) Jackie Moon. The most passionate man in sports. 
EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MEANWHILE 
Some hot girls in shorts hold up a sign that says 'ALL STAR PARKING.' Ms. Quincy's BBQ delivery truck rips into the lot. Clarence skids to a stop. 
INT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS 
The crowd looks off camera and suddenly erupts. CLARENCE enters out of the tunnel, he takes a bite of a Hershey bar, then gestures to the crowd, giving the international symbol for 'Let's get funky.' 
BOBBY DEE (V.0.) Ladies and gentleman, put your hands together for Downtown Funky- Stuff Malone! Clarence tosses the half eaten candy bar, wipes his hands off on his jersey and jogs right out onto the court during the game, TAGGING HIS TEAMMATE OUT as if it were pick up. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Downtown, wastes no time entering the game -- tagging out Vakidis Roscovenski. 
.CLAWS COACH (to the ref) C'mon Father Pat, he's got to check into the game doesn't he? The ref just shrugs. Downtown calls for the ball and gets it. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Downtown dribbles left, then right a little shake and bake through the legs -- double teamed now, he's got Twiggy Munson open under the basket. Downtown, still with the ball, dribbles behind his back, they triple him, he's got Munson and Ellis wide open under the hoop, but look at these moves! The entire other team leaves their men and guards Clarence five on one, but Clarence never passes. His four teammates watch from under the basket. 
Despite his selfish attitude, it's clear Clarence actually has some serious talent. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. ) Downtown has all five guys on him -- He sprints to the corner and forces up a fade away three... YES! Wow. You think this league's going bankrupt? Well, think again. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0.) People call him selfish. I call him the greatest show in shorts. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME 
CLOSE ON: An old-timey photo of a man with a handle-bar moustache. It's been autographed by the inventor of basketball: 'Go Tropics! -James Naismith' The team enters the locker room happy, even though they're losing badly at half time. 
JACKIE MOON Yes! Nice first half guys! That's what I call Flint Tropic's basketball! 
(BEAT) I've been telling you all season, we're about to make a run. Flint Michigan is destined for greatness. (at the chalkboard) Twiggy, enough with the bounce passes, let's show some zip. Bee Bee, try not to get fouled so much, free throws take too long. Scootsie, what did I tell you about catching with two hands.? God gave you one hand for a reason: To look awesome. Jackie points to the chalkboard. Where one of his catchy slogans is spelled out. 
JACKIE MOON Let's stay focused on the four 
'D'S' (pointing to the board) Dangerous, Dangerous, Dangerous, Dunks. Remember: This isn't just a basketball team. It's a lifestyle. 
Everyone claps. Meanwhile, Clarence grabs a bunch of hair products and goes to work. But he notices something. 
CLARENCE Yo, Jackie, is the washing machine broken? ANGLE ON: A few workers are taking out the washing machine. 
JACKIE MOON Listen up guys: I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is, we're getting rid of that piece of shit washing machine. The bad news is, everyone does their laundry at home from now on. Towels too. Everyone complains. Boo etc. Jackie turns to BOBBY DEE a 'front office' guy. 
JACKIE MOON And Bobby Dee, I need you to clean out your desk. 
BOBBY DEE No. I have kids. 
JACKIE MOON You're not fired. I sold your desk. 
BOBBY DEE Oh. 
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS THING! 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR DUKES! 
INT. LYNN'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE 
A beautiful, down to earth woman, LYNN, 30's, is reading a book. In the background, her boyfriend, KYLE, is listening to the Tropics game on the RADIO. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Monix was an All-American at Michigan State, but then went on to a disappointing journeyman career in the NBA. But he did manage to sit on the bench with the world champion Boston Celtics years ago and won a ring. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0. ) (on radio) I should hire his agent. Kyle listens to this and yells to the other room. 
KYLE Hey honey, guess who got traded to Flint? 
LYNN I don't know, who? 
KYLE Monix. The word Monix stops her in her tracks. 
LYNN Monix? 
KYLE Yeah! He's already got an NBA ring, but he's still playing... In Flint. Can you believe it? 
LYNN No, I can't. Lynn closes her book, fidgety... 
KYLE They say he asked to be traded. Who the Hell leaves California to come here? I love this guy. 
MUSIC CUE: THE BROTHERS JOHNSON 'GET THE FUNK OUTTA MY FACE.' 
EXT./INT. JACKIE'S MONTE CARLO - NIGHT 
Jackie cruises the streets of Flint in a pimped out Monte Carlo. He's got chrome rims and a gold grill. The interior is wall to wall carpeting. He swigs a beer as he turns. 
JACKIE MOON (singing with car stereo) Get the funk outta-of-my-face... A SIGN SAYS: THE KREMLIN. Jackie rolls up and parks in a reserved parking space. He rolls up the windows and locks the doors by hand and exits. 
REVEAL: JACKIE HAS GIANT ICE PACKS TAPED TO HIS KNEES, Patrick Ewing style, right over his slacks. A police officer drinks, in uniform, outside. 
COP What's up Jackie? 
JACKIE MOON Not much. 
COP (re: the big ice packs) Your knees okay? 
JACKIE MOON Oh yeah. Just icing them down. 
INT. THE KREMLIN - NIGHT 
'The Kremlin' is rocking. The beer is served in cans only. 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE (O.S.) Hey Jackie! 
JACKIE MOON Well look at you! You look beautiful. What's different? 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE I dyed my hair. 
JACKIE MOON No, that's not it... Did your tits get bigger? 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE No. 
JACKIE MOON Don't lie to me. Those things got bigger. 
BALL GIRL MAGGIE No, they're the same. 
JACKIE MOON Well, good job. Jackie keeps walking, bumping into MS. QUINCY, Clarence's mother. 
MS. QUINCY Yo Jackie. You know, that wife of yours has been making out with that Mark Spitz lookin' motherfucker all night. She gestures to a guy who's lip-locked with Jackie's wife. LUCY MOON unbuttons her fur coat. 
JACKIE MOON Oh. It's okay, Lucy and I've got an open relationship. 
MS. QUINCY I know that. But he's about to suck on her Damn tits, right here in front of all these people. 
JACKIE MOON She's hot right? What can I say, we're freedom lovers. (calling off to his wife) Hey honey! Lucy Moon ignores him, only making out harder. 
JACKIE MOON (to his wife) Right on! (to Quincy) I'm not jealous. It's a sweet deal for both of us. 
MS. QUINCY Have you ever slept with another woman? 
JACKIE MOON I could. That's the beauty of it. No ball and chain here. 
Jackie and Dukes are next to the bus, discussing the check. 
DUKES I tried Jackie. They won't take it. They said it's 'symbolic.' 
JACKIE MOON What does symbolic mean? 
DUKES I don't know. But they said I need a real check. 
JACKIE MOON I don't know what your bank is talking about. That is a real check. I signed it myself. 
DUKES It's written in glitter, dude. Can't you just give me, like, a regular sized one? 
JACKIE MOON I don't get it. People are usually able to cash these. Maybe you should try another bank. (trying to wrap it up) If you run into any more trouble, let me know. 
DUKES Okay Jackie, thanks man. 
JACKIE MOON Any time, congratulations. Jackie turns away from Dukes and exhales, walking back to the bus. 
MUSIC CUE: 'SHORT PEOPLE' BY RANDY NEWMAN. 
EXT. THE HIGHWAY - DAY 
We're flying down the highway. 
INT. THE JET - DAY 
Kong, the small Asian player, is driving, singing along with Jackie to the radio... 
JACKIE MOON & KONG (singing Randy Newman) 
SHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON... 
SHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON... 
SHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON TO LIVE Jackie reaches up into a special bin and takes out some beef jerky, then yells out the window. 
JACKIE (out the window at a car) 
YOU IN-THE-GREEN-CAR GOT, NO REASON 
TO LIVE... Pan back to see the whole team crammed into tiny seats. Vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the ceiling. Twiggy Munson is reading '70's pornography. Clarence is sewing a new name onto his jersey. The rest of the guys are eating their hot dish. 
MONIX So, Clarence, what's in this 'hot dish' anyway? 
CLARENCE My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn meal, why you gotta go asking what's in it? 
MONIX It's a compliment. It's good. 
CLARENCE If it's good, then it's good. Why do you gotta know what's in it? What's in hot dish? Hot dish is in hot dish, asshole. BEE BEE and SCOOTSIE look over the seat, facing them. 
BEE BEE ELLIS Hey Monix, what were the Celtics like? 
MONIX They were fast. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Fast? No one's faster than me. I should be on the Celtics. 
MONIX (pointing to his mind) Fast up here. 
BEE BEE ELLIS You're supposed to be Mr. Smartball. Why'd you get bounced? 
MONIX Well, you have to be able to jump too. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Hey, let us see that ring again. 
MONIX Not right now, okay Twiggy? 
CLARENCE Isn't it a little embarrassing wearing that thing everyday? 
MONIX Embarrassing? 
CLARENCE You call yourself a Celtic? You sat through every single playoff game. You didn't see action once. And now you walk around wearing the ice like you're Bill Russel. Well you ain't. 
BEE BEE ELLIS Oh, you're just jealous. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Yeah, Monix played solid minutes, for lots of teams. He's played in the NBA, that's more than you can say. 
CLARENCE Whatever. At least I never sat on the bench and then called myself a champion. You didn't do shit for that Celtic team. If I was Dave Cowens, I'd yank that ring right off your neck. That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he's got something to say, but he doesn't. Clarence has the last word. 
Two twin beds in a crap-box motel room. Monix has the phone to his ear, but it just keeps ringing. He'd leave a message for Lynn, but answering machines haven't been invented yet. He hangs up, looks in the mirror, and now takes his Championship ring necklace off. He looks at the ring in his hand... And shoves it into his duffle bag. 
CLARENCE (O.S.) I brought us some ice. Monix is startled. Clarence, his roommate for the night, enters. 
MONIX Ice? What for? 
CLARENCE I don't know, it's free. Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts crunching. 
CLARENCE Want some? 
MONIX No thanks. Now BEE BEE enters, yet another player in the small room. 
BEE BEE ELLIS That Root Beer machine took my fucking change, man. White people are assholes. Monix ignores this. Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE CELTICS are playing. Their trapping defense is a thing of beauty. Clarence walks over and flicks the channels, until he stops at 'Love American Style.' 
MONIX You turned off the Celtics? 
CLARENCE I don't watch people play basketball. They watch me. With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it. 
MONIX (re: the marijuana) What the Hell is that? 
CLARENCE (as he inhales) It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin. Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his face. JACKIE EXITS the bathroom, having just taken a shower. He's wearing a very small robe. This is now the fourth player who's sleeping in this tiny room. 
MONIX Why don't you shower in your room? 
JACKIE MOON My wife is using it. I'll be crashing with you guys tonight. 
(NOTICING) Ice? Awesome. (as he eats ice, re: TV) Love American Style? Turn it up. 
Jackie doesn't say a word about the pot. Instead he keeps his eyes glued to the TV, then reaches for the joint and SMOKES 
IT. 
MONIX Jackie, have you ever even slept with your wife? 
JACKIE MOON 
(LYING) What? Are you kidding? Try, like, every weekend. She's so hot. 
MONIX Sounds like a great arrangement. 
JACKIE MOON You guys need to wake up. Quit living like it's the 1950's, man. Live it up. (showing off) Hey Clarence, let's have some of that smoke, bro. 
MONIX I'm pretty sure we have a game tomorrow. 
JACKIE MOON (as he inhales) This stuff won't affect you. It's premium. Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates. 
MONIX Well, if this is really going to be my life, I might as well be stoned like everyone else. 
JACKIE MOON Well said. Monix takes the stupid joint. The instant Monix inhales he 
COUGHS LIKE CRAZY. 
MONIX What the Hell is this? 
CLARENCE What do you mean? 
MONIX It's harsh. 
CLARENCE Take that back. 
MONIX Take what back? 
JACKIE MOON His Mom grows it. 
CLARENCE Yeah, in the yard. 
MONIX Your Mom grew this? 
CLARENCE It's sweet grass. 
MONIX Well, I'm finished, thanks. 
CLARENCE What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't good enough for you? 
MONIX I guess not. 
JACKIE MOON C'mon man, have some respect for his Mom's weed. 
MONIX What about commercials? 
JACKIE MOON What? 
MONIX Commercials, what about commercials? Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea.' 
JACKIE MOON I like it. Time out Ref! 
ANNOUNCER (V.0. ) A time out on the floor, 5:20 left before the half, the Amigos 45, the Tropics 19, we'll be right back after this message from Shasta. The camera's on air' red light turns off. 
CAMERA MAN (rooting them on) And... You're clear. 
JACKIE MOON 
SOMEBODY HIT SOMEBODY! 
BAM! MONIX CLOCKS PETRELLI. 
BAM! JACKIE MOON PUNCHES ANOTHER GUY. 
PETRELLI TAKES THE HIT AND TACKLES MONIX. 
BOTH BENCHES CLEAR. THE CROWD GOES NUTS. 
INT. THE COMMISSIONER'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE 
The commissioner relaxes at home with his two kids... A Shasta commercial is on TV. 
SHASTA COMMERCIAL (V.0.) (on TV) I want a pop... I want a -- Shasta... 
INT. AMIGO STADIUM - CONTINUOUS 
MAYHEM. JACKIE MOON IS YANKING A FAN'S HAIR. 
A TALL GUY IS ABOUT TO POUND SHORT LITTLE KONG. BUT NOW KONG 
JUMPS IN THE AIR AND DOES A SWEET ROUND-HOUSE JUDO KICK, 
KNOCKING THE TALL GUY TO THE FLOOR. 
KONG Hi-Ya! 
MEANWHILE: MONIX AND PETRELLI ARE TRADING HOCKEY PUNCHES... 
CAMERA MAN And we're back in -5- (Monix punches Petrelli) 
(Petrelli punches Monix) 
(Monix punches Petrelli) 
(Monix ducks and punches) (cuing the announcers) 
AND WE'RE ON. 
THE 'RED LIGHT' GLOWS. 
ON A DIME: EVERYONE STOPS PUNCHING, STANDS UP STRAIGHT AND 
SMILES. 
ANNOUNCER (V.0.) Welcome back to the ABA game of the week... Players hold their heads in pain. Others limp back to the bench. 
ANNOUNCER (V.0.) .The camaraderie and spirit of this league is on full display here tonight... Off camera, Monix delivers a secret punch to Patrelli's spleen. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME 
Jackie runs the half time talk, standing in front of the chalk board. 
JACKIE MOON Okay, solid first half guys, but we're going to have to make some 
ADJ-- Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses the team, stepping in front of Jackie Moon. 
MONIX --This is bullshit guys. They're kicking our ass in basketball and they're kicking our ass during the commercials, too. Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll? Because they're going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the Damn ball... 
JACKIE MOON Yeah! C'mon guys! Rotate the ball. Monix looks at this group and gets even madder. 
MONIX Does anyone in this room have any pride? Don't you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play?Is thishow we're really going togo out?You'd think we'd want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball. Boxing out under the boards. Setting picks for our teammates. But we haven't done shit out there. Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads. 
JACKIE MOON This is practice, okay Clarence? We need to get two thousand people in here! Our intro dance has to blow people's minds. He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever... 
JACKIE MOON From now on, I want our afros bigger... And shinier ... . I want our shorts shorter... And tighter... We're going to pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before. The team seems to be looking off screen. 
JACKIE MOON What's wrong? 
REVEAL: Monix has been watching this whole thing. With Monix on the court, everyone feels kind of stupid. 
JACKIE MOON Hey, you're back! Listen, you should probably chalk your hands up for this number. 
CLARENCE Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us. 
JACKIE MOON Coach? Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the team. Clearly, a decision has been made. 
JACKIE MOON What do you mean, coach? (truly hurt) What is this? What's going on? (staring his team down) It's a Mutiny. 
CLARENCE Jackie. Don't be like that. 
JACKIE MOON Hold on a second. Last time I checked, we didn't live in Flint, Russia. We live in Flint, America. I'm coach until a new one is elected. 
CLARENCE Don't make us elect Monix, man. (Jackie Moon holds firm) Alright, show of hands. Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach? Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands. 
JACKIE MOON Please God No. 
TWIGGY MUNSON Sorry Jackie. 
JACKIE MOON (starting to cry) It's cool. I get it. I'm a big boy, I can handle it. 
Jackie cries harder. 
CLARENCE Don't take it so hard, Jackie. You're a great owner. We all know that. 
JACKIE MOON Woah. Hold on. Did you just say 'great owner?' 
CLARENCE Yeah. Everyone thinks so. 
JACKIE MOON Now, when you said great owner, were you just saying that? Because it's not cool to mess with me about this. 
CLARENCE We mean it. For real. Monix is just more of an X's and O's kind of guy, that's all. Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle. 
JACKIE MOON (re: The whistle) Here. You may need this. Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen. The pages look insane. 
JACKIE MOON (handing him papers) And here are some ideas for plays I've jotted down. Just thoughts. 
MONIX Thanks Jackie. (to the team) The way I see it, any team in this league can put together a run. Most of our opponents are all flash. If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games. 
JACKIE MOON I like it. Unselfish, guys. 
MONIX Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning tough team defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team rebound. 
(BEAT) Unselfish means sprinting up the floor on every fast break NOT because you can get a DUNK -- and get your DICK SUCKED after the game -- but because if you sprint up the floor you might pull the defense out of position and free a teammate up for a high percentage shot. 
JACKIE MOON Wait, so, what's going on with the blow jobs? 
BEE BEE ELLIS I vote we keep the blow jobs. 
JACKIE MOON (raising his hand) All in favor? Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs. 
CLARENCE Would everyone let the man talk please? Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up. 
INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER 
The starters have gotten into position, guarded by the scout team, in blue jerseys. 
MONIX The most important work we do on the court is away from the basketball. Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL, deflating it. This gets everyone's attention. 
MONIX (re: deflated ball) Until you start moving like a real team, you practice without a ball. 
He flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the knife closed. 
MONIX Alright, Clarence, run the offense. 
CLARENCE I don't get it. 
MONIX Set a pick for somebody. Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent. 
MONIX Okay, that's kind of a pick, I guess. Try standing on the other side of Scootsie's man, so you free him up to cut into the lane. Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him to stand. 
MONIX 
MOVE MOVE MOVE! FOURTH QUARTER NOW! 
FOURTH QUARTER! 
JACKIE MOON You're fired! 
MONIX Fuck you. 
JACKIE MOON Fuck you. 
MONIX Get up and run. You're going to puke like everybody else. 
JACKIE MOON Monix, I need to talk to you. 
MONIX We'll. talk after you puke. GO! 
Jackie can't get up, but he crawls, dying... 
JACKIE MOON I can't puke Monix! 
MONIX Yes you can. Go. Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood. 
JACKIE MOON Monix! You don't understand. I've never thrown up in my life. 
MONIX What are you talking about? 
JACKIE MOON I've never puked. Ever. 
MONIX That makes no sense. Everyone has thrown up before. 
JACKIE MOON I haven't. I swear to God. I can eat anything. I can drink anything. I've been sick, but I've never puked. I swear to God. 
MONIX That's bullshit. Keep moving, you're going to puke. 
JACKIE MOON I don't puke. I can't do it! It's the truth! I swear on my Mother's grave. At this point, Monix can't help but be intrigued. 
MONIX What about when you were a baby? Babies throw up all the time. 
JACKIE MOON My Mom said I never did. I swear. She said I was fascinating. 
MONIX No way. 
JACKIE MOON You can call my Dad! I've never puked. When Jackie looks up at Monix, it's clear he is not lying. 
MONIX Isn't that kind of dangerous? 
JACKIE MOON What do you mean? 
MONIX What happens if you swallow poison? 
JACKIE MOON I don't know. I ate bad sausage before. But nothing happened. 
MONIX Stand up. Jackie manages to stand up. 
MONIX Have you ever been punched in the Jejunum? 
JACKIE MOON I don't know. What's a Jejunum? 
MONIX It's part of your small intestine. 
JACKIE MOON I don't know. I doubt-- 
BOOM. 
MONIX'S POWERFUL FIST LIFTS JACKIE'S TORSO IN THE AIR. ECU: Monix's knowing fist digs deep under Jackie's rib cage. It's the hardest punch ever filmed. ON JACKIE'S REACTION: He stands, beyond pain, empty of any possible air. The blood leaves his face andhis eyesbecome confused, watering strangely. Part of Jackie's brain wants tospeak,buthe feelsunhuman-- his lips separate only slightly. He wanders out of frame. 
EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLESIUM - LATER - DAY 
A SIDE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. JACKIE STUMBLES OUT INTO DAYLIGHT, 
INTO THE GRASS. HE PAUSES, THEN SUDDENLY STARTS RUNNING, BUT 
STOPS, CONFUSED, LIKE A WOUNDED GAZELLE... 
JACKIE STAGGERS FURTHER, USING A TREE TO KEEP HIS BALANCE AS 
JACKIE MOON 
VAKIDIS! NO!!! 
VAKIDIS TAKES THE BALL AND GOES FOR A DUNK -- 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Vakidis takes it up strong to the basket... 
BAM! JACKIE MOON TACKLES VAKIDIS INTO THE STANDS. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Ooh. He gets taken out hard by the coach. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0.) Nice! The ball bounces into the air, rolls around the rim... And 
DROPS IN. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) And the basket is... GOOD! 
BUZZER! FINAL SCORE. TROPICS 100 PRO STARS 91. 
JACKIE MOON Shit. 
INT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - LATER 
The daiquiri room is crowded with guys. JACKIE is having a team meeting. 
JACKIE MOON I asked you up to the Daiquiri room, because this is a private matter. (everyone looks around) As you know, I threw up recently. 
It was the first time in my life. And, well, it's made me feel... I guess you could say I've got a new clarity in life. (Everyone stares back) Since vomiting on Wednesday, I've been facing my demons. I'm not going to be an imposter any more. 
(BEAT) And I want you to know, I just mailed out 562 corn dog coupons. 
(BEAT) And I'd like to bring somebody special in... DUKES! Dukes walks in. He is still shirtless. Jackie hands him a duffel bag. 
JACKIE MOON In this bag, is ten thousand dollars. 
DUKES No way. Really? 
JACKIE MOON Actually, it's twenty three hundred. But I'm going to pay you the rest. The Tropics will not let you down. From now on, I want my conscience clear. 
DUKES Wow. Thanks Jackie. 
JACKIE MOON Can I confess something to everyone? It's something I've never told anybody. 
CLARENCE What is it? 
JACKIE MOON You know my song 'Love Me Sexy?' 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Everyone knows that song. 
JACKIE MOON I stole it. 
TWIGGY MUNSON No. 
JACKIE MOON It's true. (turns away, dramatic) My Mom wrote it. Three weeks before she died. And I stole it. Even Monix is fascinated by this. 
BEE BEE ELLIS Wait, your Mom wrote that? Was she a singer? 
JACKIE MOON No, she wrote it on a napkin. I duped the whole world. I'm nothing but a fraud. 
(BEAT) It's true, I'm a famous singer. And I've landed the hottest wife in the world. But, to be honest, we usually only sleep together once a year. On VJ day. 
CLARENCE Damn. VJ day? That's cold. 
JACKIE MOON (ignoring Kong) And even on that day, I don't feel like it's me who's sleeping with her. 
BEE BEE ELLIS What does that mean? 
JACKIE MOON She married me because of my song, but I didn't write it. So sometimes I feel like it's not even me who's with her. (more emotional) Deep down, I feel like it's really my Mom who is making love to her. When I hold Lucy's supple breasts in my hands, they are my Mom's hands. When I eat a pair of edible panties off of her, they are my Mom's teeth. 
DUKES That's pretty weird. 
JACKIE MOON I'm living in a prison, Dukes. 
CLARENCE Why don't you write a song yourself? Then you wouldn't feel like a fake any more. 
JACKIE MOON Oh please! I could never write anything as brilliant as 'Love Me Sexy!' (standing tall) Listen to me, Tropics. Today is a new day. I am going to be the greatest basketball owner you've ever seen. And we're going to make it to fourth place. MUSIC CUE: HOT CHOCOLATE 'EVERY 1's A WINNER.' MEGA-MONTAGE: THE TROPICAL FEVER SEQUENCE. (Note: The music fades in and out throughout as needed). -PRE GAME: The Tropics do their 'intro dance.' They perform the waterfall down into.a cool pose. The crowd loves it. -TROPIC HIGHLIGHTS: They run a fast break weave, Monix makes the layup. Clarence penetrates and dishes to Jackie for a pull up jumper. -THE TROPICAL AISLE: Fat people in Hawaiian shirts go crazy. A lady chucks her nachos at the other team. -RESULTS: The scoreboard shows a Tropics win. -ATTENDANCE: A clicker counts up to 182 fans. -MORE INTRO EXCITEMENT: Jackie introduces his starting five. 
COMMISH Listen, my office has been getting your numbers. You claim you've had over two thousand people at every home game this month. 
JACKIE MOON (dead pan) That's correct. The commissioner looks around, skeptical. As we scan the stands, it's clear the crowd is still not big enough. 
COMMISH Well, we've counted only nine hundred and eighty three here tonight. 
JACKIE MOON What, you don't think people go to the bathroom? (Commish isn't buying it) Saturdays can be a little slow. You should have been here the other night, it was SO PACKED. 
COMMISH Don't bullshit me, Jackie. The commish waves over a little bald man in a suit. PEEKSKILL carries a brief case and never talks. 
COMMISH From now on, Peekskill here will be attending every Tropics home game. You're going to have to get a real crowd here if you want to qualify for the merger. 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY 
Jackie Moon is being interviewed on a local talk show. 
INTERVIEWER So, the Tropics will be at a size disadvantage against the Americans. How do you intend to match up with their strong inside game? 
JACKIE MOON Tomorrow, at half time, I, Jackie Moon, will wrestle a bear. 
INTERVIEWER Oh, well there's something. But, defensively, as a team, do you 
THINK-- 
JACKIE MOON --That's tomorrow! One night only! See Dewie the wrestling bear attack me. He's killed people in public before. 
INTERVIEWER Okay, well, that's some half time show. 
JACKIE MOON 
I'M TELLING YOU, NOBODY CAN MISS 
THIS! IF YOU'RE A CHILD, TAKE MONEY 
OUT OF YOUR MOTHER'S PURSE AND WALK 
TO FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS 
COLISEUM! EIGHT O'CLOCK! 
INTERVIEWER Well, there you have it. Jackie Moon, thanks for stopping by. From channel 5, this is Mick Kenterman, signing off. Good night. 
JACKIE MOON 
DEWIE IS INSANE. HE COULD RIP MY 
HEAD OFF! 
EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
LYNN carries the garbage out. As she closes the lid, she notices something. REVEAL: Monix is standing in the yard. 
LYNN Well, if it isn't the toast of Flint Michigan. Shouldn't you be out signing autographs? Monix doesn't speak... He stares into her eyes for a moment. 
MONIX Will you marry me? 
LYNN What? 
MONIX You heard me. 
LYNN Technically, we're still married right now, Monix. 
MONIX You know what I mean. 
LYNN Do I? 
MONIX Do you love me? 
LYNN Probably. 
MONIX Then let's do it. For real this time. I need you. 
LYNN Shit. I know you need me, Monix. The question is, do I need you? 
KYLE (O.S.) 
WHAT'S UP MONIX!? Kyle pokes his head out of the screen door. He wears a Flint Jersey with Monix on the back. 
KYLE Hey, I'm the victim here. I'm allowed to do as I please. This was an honor. 
LYNN What? Monix stands up, wrapping a sheet around him. 
MONIX I'm outta here. 
KYLE Oh, c'mon man. Don't be like that. It's all cool. 
MONIX Believe me, this is not all cool.' Monix grabs his shit and walks out of the bedroom. 
MONIX I'll call you. 
KYLE Okay. 
LYNN Not you, asshole. He was talking to me. 
EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NEXT NIGHT 
There's a real buzz in the air. People are pouring into the stadium tonight. Clarence is right outside the locker room, eating a Bit-o-Honey, watching with amazement. 
OFFICER MILLER Hey is that Coffee Black? I'm officer Miller, State Correctional, I'm a big fan, you can call me Jimmy. 
CLARENCE Nice to meet you. 
OFFICER MILLER Jackie Moon ordered up a bus full of prisoners. Any idea where we all should sit? 
INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS 
PAN: The PRISONERS are all packed into the stands. Next to them is a huge group of ladies from an OLD FOLKS HOME... Next to a bus load of SICK KIDS from the hospital. 
ON PEEKSKILL trying to count. There's no use analyzing it, the place is sold out and the fans are going nuts. CENTER COURT: In a wrestling ring, Jackie is in a wrestling singlet, wearing head gear, drinking from a squirt bottle. PAN TO DEWIE THE BEAR, ready to go. CLARENCE, DRESSED AS A REF, is standing in front of JACKIE, messaging his shoulders. 
CLARENCE THE REF We sold out, man. You did good. 
JACKIE MOON I'm scared of bears, Clarence. 
CLARENCE THE REF What? 
JACKIE MOON I hate these things. I'm freaking out right now. 
CLARENCE THE REF If you're scared of bears, why the Hell are you wrestling one then? 
JACKIE MOON Look at this place. We're packed. It was a good idea. 
CLARENCE THE REF Well, don't worry, you'll pin him easy. It'll be fine. 
JACKIE MOON You don't understand. I don't like bears. I'm feeling dizzy. Jackie is seriously petrified. Clarence adjusts the collar of his ref jersey and looks around, worried about his friend. 
CLARENCE THE REF Maybe we should call it off. 
JACKIE MOON NO. Look into my eyes. (Clarence does) You're the ref tonight. No matter what happens in there, do not stop the fight, okay? 
These people came to see a show. I've got to make it through at least one round. 
CLARENCE THE REF Okay, until you finish the first round, I won't call it. Hey, how bad can three minutes be, right? 
BEAR HANDLER (O.S.) Are you guys ready? The bear handler is a large frizzy haired woman. 
CLARENCE THE REF I don't know, are we ready? 
JACKIE MOON Yeah, let's do it. 
BEAR HANDLER You guys want to give me a safe word? 
CLARENCE THE REF What's a safe word? 
BEAR HANDLER It's a word for you to yell to the Ref, so he can stop the match. 
JACKIE MOON I don't need a safe word. 
BEAR HANDLER Tell you what, if you get injured or you really feel like you're in danger, yell, um, I don't know... Spumoni. Once I get a signal from the ref, I'll come in. 
CLARENCE THE REF What's Spumoni? 
JACKIE MOON It's an Italian Gelato, sort of like Almond flavored ice cream. 
CLARENCE THE REF Is it good? 
PLEASE GOD, SOMEONE SPUMONI! I'M 
BEGGING YOU, CLARENCE. 
CLARENCE THE REF 
LOOKING GOOD, BOSS. 
JACKIE IS HANGING HALF WAY OUT OF THE RING. HE'S NOSE TO NOSE.: 
WITH THE BEAR HANDLER. 
JACKIE MOON (screaming at the bear 
HANDLER) 
GELATO! ALMOND ICE CREAM! (in Italian) Asta zittu'sto parcnuso spumoni! 
BEAR HANDLER (to Clarence) 
WE HAVE TO STOP IT! 
CLARENCE THE REF 
NO WAY! I'M THE REF! 
BEAR HANDLER (climbing in) Screw this, I'm stopping it. The bear handler tries to get into the ring with a stick and loop. But CLARENCE TRIES TO PUSH THE BEAR HANDLER back out of the ring. 
DEWIE TURNS TO FIND HIS HANDLER IN DANGER. 
LIKE LIGHTENING, THE BEAR MAULS CLARENCE. 
CLARENCE THE REF 
AAAHHHHH!!! I'M THE REF!!! 
SPUMONI!!! DING! The first round is over, but the bear does not return to his corner. 
CLARENCE THE REF 
THE BELL RANG! SPUMONI!!!

But nothing is ever easy against the first place San Antonio Spurs. As Jackie does a victory dance, the commissioner approaches. 
COMMISH Jackie. 
JACKIE MOON Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And a packed house too. 
COMMISH I need to talk to you... And the rest of your team. Alone. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 
The whole team stands solemnly. 
CLARENCE So, that's just it then? 
MONIX That's just it. Clarence shakes his head and walks out. 
EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - MORNING 
The morning sun shines down on the sad town of Flint. Monix walks home in the street. He stops and TAKES A LEAK right in the middle of the road. A car honks at him to get out of the way, then skids to a stop. Lynn pokes her head out of the car. 
LYNN What the fuck are you doing? 
MONIX Oh. Hey Lynn. 
INT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY 
Monix is on the couch, drunk. He gazes at the TV and swigs his beer. Now LYNN walks in. 
LYNN I thought the deal was, you were going to sleep. 
MONIX Pshh. Relax. 
LYNN So, you're just going to sit here in my house and drink for the entire day? 
MONIX You got a problem with that? 
LYNN Yeah, I do. Maybe you could put some pants on and go piss off somebody else. 
MONIX Fine, maybe I will! 
(STANDING) Where are my pants? 
LYNN Tell me something, Monix- 
MONIX No. 
LYNN Whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear?You never really gave a shitaboutthat NBA merger, did you? Monix doesn't say anything. 
LYNN The merger, Monix, did you ever care about it? Monix still stays quiet. 
LYNN Tell me, if you didn't care about the merger, what the Hell were you playing for!? 
MONIX I wanted fourth place! Okay? That was the whole fucking thing! 
LYNN Well, guess what! Fourth place is still sitting there, waiting for you to win it! Monix doesn't look at her. 
LYNN Think about it. 
EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - DAY 
A wide shot of an alley. We hear a familiar voice off screen. 
JACKIE MOON (O.S.) (singing bizarre) Baby, who wants to- love me sexy! baby, Ugh, are you ready to; lick me sexy!!!? Yeah yeah!! HA! INSIDE A DUMPSTER, REVEAL: Jackie lays in garbage and sings up to the sky. It's official, he has lost his mind. 
JACKIE MOON (tweaking the lyrics) I'm a big faker and I stole this; Song-ly sexy. I'm the biggest failure in the; world-ly sexy. I'm going to kill my; self-y sexy. 
BEE BEE ELLIS (O.S.) Jackie? Bee Bee Ellis hears Jackie voice and discovers him in laying the garbage. Jackie ignores his teammate. 
JACKIE MOON I'm going to hang myself with an extension; cord-y sexy. 
BEE BEE ELLIS Jackie! What the Hell are you doing in a dumpster? 
JACKIE MOON (ignoring Bee Bee) I am urinating in my pants right now. 
BEE BEE ELLIS You gotta get it together, man. Monix called a team meeting. 
INT. THE KREMLIN - LATER DAY 
The entire team has gathered. Monix addresses them. 
MONIX Listen up. We all know that Clarence has been traded. And we all know that this game doesn't matter anymore, right? 
BEE BEE ELLIS Right. 
MONIX Well I've got news for you. This game does matter. It matters because this is the last real basketball game any of us is ever going to play. Ever. The guys nod, solemn. 
MONIX Tomorrow night, I say we leave it all out there on the floor. Because there's nothing else for us to save it for. Clarence or no Clarence. NBA or no NBA. Merger or no merger. We decided we are going to win fourth place. And that's what we're going to do. Jackie is moved. The guys look at each other and nod. 
MONIX Over the past five weeks, we've become a team. And that is no small thing. Jackie, have you ever been on a real team before? 
THE MEGA BOWL TROPHY HIGH ABOVE OUR 
HEADS. WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO 
FINISH IN FOURTH, WE'RE GOING TO 
TAKE HOME THE MEGA BOWL TROPHY. 
TOMORROW NIGHT AT 8 O'CLOCK! 
EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - MORNING 
The sun rises above the city. In the morning light, Flint looks almost electric. 
EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - FRIDAY NIGHT 
The parking lot is rocking. The whole town is jazzed for the big event. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) if the commissioner is listening, I recommend he stay out of the city of Flint tonight. He's not too popular in this town. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.O.) i will stab him in the stomach with an eight inch hunting knife. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) There were many wild protests in Flint this week. But it seems like the whole city is now focused on beating the San Antonio Spurs. This team seems to have captured every heart in this town of underdogs. People have poured in from around the state to support this drive toward their first mega-bowl championship. 
INT. SPURS LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 
Clarence is getting dressed in the visitor's locker room. He holds up a Spurs Jersey and now pulls the strange colors over his head. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.O.) The Flint Tropics will be playing without their number one scorer, Coffee Black tonight. The Spurs have signed several new players from around the ABA, locking them in before they hit the free market in next year's expansion draft. The .big man, Pete Petrelli has been sent over from the dismantled Anaheim Amigos. Now Petrelli enters frame. The guy we hate has been traded to the Spurs too. 
PETRELLI We may be teammates, but I still think you're a dick. 
CLARENCE Thanks Petrelli. 
INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS 
WHEELCHAIR DARREN and JODY take their positions next to the court. DUKES sits in the stands. QUINCY wears a new fur coat, sitting center court. The TROPICAL AISLE cheers, rowdy. The BALL GIRLS look almost nervous. You can feel the excitement. And now entering, by herself, standing in the back, is LYNN. She takes a deep breath. 
INT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Monix addresses the team. 
MONIX You want to know what I love? This. The eleven of us right here, right now, waiting for the biggest game of our lives to begin. 
(BEAT) I want you to remember something. I want you to remember what this feels like, to be here in this locker room together, one last time, shoulder to shoulder with these men. Because we are not ourselves tonight. We are one. This is what I love. 
(BEAT) Let's play basketball. 
INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER 
The game is well under way. It's full tilt action. It's immediately clear that the Tropics are being over powered. QUICK CUTS: PETRELLI knocks over Monix and scores. -The Tropics offense is getting shut down. -Jackie gets a rebound, but then dribbles off his ankle. -The fans are disappointed. The guys in the Tropical Aisle are all bummed out. Wheelchair Jody looks pissed. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Not a good first half for the Tropics so far. They're already down by ten. ON CLARENCE: He sits on the Spurs bench. 
SPURS COACH Coffee Black, you're going in. 
CLARENCE I can't. I've got back spasms. The coach stares him down, then picks another player. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) This is easily the worst half of basketball the Tropics have ever played. And that's saying something. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0.) Yep. It's a shit fucking sandwich. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Let's watch the F-bomb, Lou. We're live. 
LOU REDWOOD (V.0.) Oh, please, this is our last game. I can say whatever I want. Watch this: I hope Gerald Ford gets ass raped. 
LIVE TROPICS RADIO Okay then. We've got just fifteen seconds left in the first half... Here's Monix with a no-look to Jackie... He goes up strong-- 
SLO MO: PETRELLI FLIES IN AND ELBOWS JACKIE HARD IN THE HEAD. 
SLO MO: JACKIE'S HEAD SNAPS BACK... 
SLO MO: JACKIE FALLS TO THE HARDWOOD, UNCONSCIOUS, HE BOUNCES 
OFF THE FLOOR. 
LYNN Oh my God. Everyone in the stadium watches as Jackie lays out cold. 
JACKIE MOON Oh. I am? That's bad isn't it? 
(BEAT) Can you make time go backwards? 
JACKIE'S DREAM MOM Not really. Now hurry up. And don't forget what I said. Jackie walks into the clouds, then turns back. 
JACKIE MOON Hey Mom, I threw up. 
JACKIE'S DREAM MOM I know you did, sweetie. 
INT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jackie wakes from his dream. Confused. JACKIE'S POV: Bee Bee Ellis, Twiggy Munson, Scootsie Double- Day and Kong Yi look down at camera. 
BEE BEE ELLIS He's awake. 
INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER 
We're back with Live ABA radio. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) This just in. It sounds like Jackie Moon is up and around the locker room. That's good news for the Tropics. 
INT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Monix coaches the team. Jackie rubs his head, not listening. 
MONIX And I don't care how quick their defense is, we need to move the ball and-- 
JACKIE MOON --Hold on you guys. I have something to tell you. 
MONIX What is it? Jackie seems very serious... 
JACKIE MOON I had a dream. I had a dream, I was in heaven and my Mother spoke to me... She was wearing a flowing white gown... And she showed me a whole new way to score a basket. She spoke to me and said with this gift, you will win fourth place.' 
BEE BEE ELLIS He's lost his mind. 
TWIGGY MUNSON We need to figure out what we're going to do in the second half. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Yeah, we don't have time for any ghost baskets. 
JACKIE MOON 
YOU WILL NOT SPEAK OF MY MOTHER 
THIS WAY! THIS SHOT IS MAGICAL! 
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? Jackie's eyes are intense and he's breathing way too hard. This dream was real. Monix tries to pacify him. 
MONIX Alright Jackie, relax, okay? 
JACKIE MOON 
I WILL NOT RELAX! WE HAVE TO USE 
THIS! IT'S A GIFT FROM THE 
OTHERWORLD! Monix and Clarence shoot each other a look. Clearly, Jackie is not going to take no for an answer. 
CLARENCE Okay Jackie, so what's the play? 
INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLESIUM - NIGHT 
The second half is underway. Clarence and Jackie are both playing for the Tropics. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) We're back in action here at the Mega Bowl. Coffee Black is playing for the Tropics... And Jackie Moon makes the start... In fact, it looks like he's trying to run the offense here... Jackie dribbles at the top of the key, doing a lot of pointing along with multiple hand signals. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) This is a new offense for the Tropics. Jackie dribbles to the top of the key... And... Jackie makes eye contact with Clarence. Clarence cuts to the basket and Jackie throws him a lob. SLO MO: As Clarence leaps, we hear Jackie's voice over from the locker room... 
JACKIE (V.0.) I had a dream. And in my dream, my mother jumped... Her gown flowing in the wind... And she caught a pass in the air and dunked it, without ever touching the ground... SLO MO: Clarence catches it and slams it hard. 
JACKIE MOON (V.0.) .She lifted her veil and said 'I call this the Alley Oop.' Everyone stands there, astonished. The other team is frozen. The fans are confused. The ref has no idea what to do. 
JACKIE MOON (V.0.) .And she said it would change the game forever... The other players are starting to appreciate what they've just seen. 
SPUR #1 Damn, bro. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Woah. I'm sorry, I don't know what just happened. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) In all my years of radio, I've never seen anything like this. The Tropics have fought their way back from a twenty nine point deficit. With twelve seconds left to play, they're down by one point. A basket here could win it. IT'S THE FINAL PLAY: The fans pray. Monix takes a deep breath, then in bounds the ball-- SLO MO: Jackie dribbles, looks up and lofts a perfect pass to Clarence... SLO MO: Clarence flies up for the alley oop slam dunk... SLO MO: At the last second, Petrelli flies into frame and swats it away! 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Petrelli with the rejection! It's out of bounds -- The Tropics keep the ball, with seven seconds on the clock. I'll tell you Lou, the Spurs were looking for that one. IN THE HUDDLE: Monix is yelling above the noise. 
MONIX (in the huddle) Okay, listen up: They've made adjustments out there. We can't just keep running the Alley Oop, okay? They're keying on Clarence. Everyone looks at each other, worried. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY We're not going to run the alley oop? 
BEE BEE ELLIS What are we going to run? 
MONIX We're going to run The Puke. 
BEE BEE ELLIS The Puke? 
MONIX Don't tell me you've forgotten it. Everyone smiles at each other. They haven't. 
MONIX We're going to pick away from the ball. We're going to move to the open space. I won't in bound the ball until someone has a good look. (beat). The Puke. 
CLARENCE Amen. 
JACKIE MOON Bring it in! One two three-- 
EVERYONE 
LET'S GET TROPICAL! THE TROPICS RUN THE PUKE: A flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Monix, looking to inbound... SLO MO: Clarence sets a pick for Scootsie- Everyone rotates. Jackie picks and rolls to the basket, open... Monix zips Jackie a no-look pass... 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Jackie goes up strong... 
BUT PETRELLI ELBOWS HIM IN THE HEAD AGAIN! WHISTLE! 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) No Good! But Petrelli fouls him! 
JACKIE IS ABLE TO SHAKE OFF THE HEAD INJURY. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) Jackie Moon will shoot two free throws here, his team down by one, with two seconds on the clock. One will tie it. He needs both to win it. The ref hands Jackie the ball. The players take their places along the lane. Jackie steps to the line. The whole arena is on pins and needles. 
JACKIE MOON (to his team) Don't worry you guys, I got this... (to the ball girls) I am awesome at free throws. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) I'll tell you, I don't remember the last time I've ever seen Jackie attempt a free throw... 
JACKIE MOON (Louder now, to the fans) 
IT'S OKAY EVERYBODY. SERIOUSLY. 
FREE THROWS ARE, LIKE, MY BEST 
THING. Now Jackie sets up for the shot... 
BUT, AS JACKIE PREPARES, HE SETS UP TO SHOOT GRANNY STYLE, 
TOSSING UNDERHANDED FROM BETWEEN HIS KNEES. 
MONIX What the Hell are you doing? 
JACKIE MOON What, you've never seen me shoot free throws before? 
CLARENCE He shoots them Granny style. 
BEE BEE ELLIS Always has. 
MONIX (to himself) Shit. Jackie's ritual is insane. He breathes, spins the ball, turns around 360, deep knee bends, touches his left shoulder four times, then SUDDENLY WINGS THE BALL HIGH IN THE AIR. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) The first attempt is... GOOD! 
IT SWISHES. THE CROWD GOES NUTS... 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) The game is tied. One more and the Tropics win. Jackie does the same ritual. But this time a bead of sweat rolls over his forehead. He is nervous. But he tosses anyway... SLO MO: The Ball floats toward the basket. Flash bulbs pop. SLO MO: The ball bounces off the rim, away from the basket. SLO MO: Monix elbows his way into position for a rebound. 
LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.) No Good -- Monix with the put back! SLO MO: Monix catches the ball in the air and re-shoots a fade-away jumper. Swish!

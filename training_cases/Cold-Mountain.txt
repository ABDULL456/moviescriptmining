EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY 
ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits. 
A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMERS) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE. 
A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack. 
Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack. 
A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, the blood pouring from his nose. 
His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge. 
A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and its two exotic passengers passes by. 
The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self- conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by her. An angel in this wild place. 
Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to translate into English: 
SWIMMERS VOICE (V.O.) You will be lonely. You will howl like a dog as you walk alone. You will carry dog shit cupped in your hands. You will be smeared with dog shit. Your spirit will wane and dwindle to blue, the colour of despair... 
As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, sticks and fists flailing. 
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT 
A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a gash in Inmans cheek as he continues to translate: 
SWIMMER ...This is your path. There is no other. That's a curse you can use on the Yankee before battle. 
INMAN And that works? 
SWIMMER You have to say it in Cherokee. 
INMAN You said it to me in Cherokee. 
During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, and winces with pain. 
SWIMMER So keep your head still. 
Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe pluckily follows suit. 
INMAN (to Swimmer) Anyway, there won't be any war. And if there is, they say it won't last a week. 
END OF CREDITS AND FADE TO: 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN 
CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR. 
A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty. 
A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches. 
IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling. 
INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN. 
A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose. 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN. 
Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. Oakley keeps his head low as he serves. 
ROURKE Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys keep store hours. They ain't open yet. 
INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN 
Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels. 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN 
A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher. 
BUTCHER That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him! 
INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT 
Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, groans. 
OAKLEY I'd like to hear some music while I go. 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT 
Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. It's Stobrod. 
Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an instruction, the turns and walks away. 
INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT 
Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman. 
STOBROD What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's one I play. 
OAKLEY Play me something sweet. Like a girl's waiting for me. 
Stobrod looks at Inman, confused. 
OAKLEY Play me something like there's nothing to fear from a merciful Lord. 
INMAN (to Stobrod) You heard him. 
STOBROD (nervous) I only know a couple of tunes. 
OAKLEY Like when you're thirsty up at Bishop's Creek and the water is so cool. 
Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play. 
Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in. 
OAKLEY I'm reaching Cold Mountain before you. 
Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away. 
INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT 
A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches Inman, who makes a stand. 
OFFICER Don't get up, soldier. You are mentioned tonight in my report. You are a credit to the Highlands, to North Carolina and to the Cause. 
INMAN (tight) Do you have news, sir, on my application for transfer? 
OFFICER I know. A bloody day. It's what our General said: Good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it too much. 
INMAN Sir. It was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers. 
OFFICER Right now, soldier, it's me who is in need of volunteers. There's a dozen Yankees in that stand of trees between us. Stuck there from the retreat. Come daylight they can shoot us down for sport. 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT 
A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses. 
He slithers over them. 
They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep. 
As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another. 
The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from the trees. 
A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him. 
Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK. 
He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black, all sound fading with them. 
EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY 
A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around and Oakley, barely a teenager. 
Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as Sally Swanger approaches. 
SALLY (to Ada, as Monroe moves off) Ada, how are you settling in? Are you liking the farm? 
ADA Very much. It's beautiful country. 
SALLY So listen -- if you would say hello to one of these fools, I'll get a field cleared this weekend. 
ADA Anyone? Like a forfeit? 
SALLY (pointing at Inman who immediately looks away) No. Him in particular, up in the rafters. Been pressing me all morning. 
UP ON THE ROOFBEAMS OF THE CHAPEL, the men are preoccupied with talk of secession from the Union. 
ADA I've been missing it. 
SALLY Thank you, by the way. (from Ada's quizzical look) Inman's down in the bottom field, clearing his debt. 
ADA Oh dear. And then he had nothing to say. 
SALLY He was happy. 
ADA Really? 
SALLY Are men so different in Charleston? 
ADA Men? I don't know. I don't even know what a woman should be like. In Charleston I was called a thistle, twice, by two different men. Both of them -- they were hunting for a simile, what was I like -- and thistle came right to them. 
SALLY If you're saying you might like him, why not go down and say hello. 
EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY 
Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles off down the track. 
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
It's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO. 
Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window to Inman, who stands, watching, listening. 
INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE, might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm. 
MONROE Esco, our friends there -- (indicating Teague and co.) -- they helped build the Chapel? 
ESCO That's Teague and his boys. I'd recommend you kick them out except a man don't kick a snake. One time the Teague family owned the whole of Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm, all belonged to his grand-daddy. Teague wanted this place bad. You got it. He's here sniffing out an advantage. 
MONROE There's no advantage here, but to celebrate a job well done. Cheers -- (he raises his glass) -- and thank you. 
And Teague raises his glass across the room. 
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
Ada appears at the door opening it onto the porch. She's carrying a tray with drinks. Acknowledges Inman. 
ADA Were you planning to come inside? 
INMAN I'm wetter than a fish. 
ADA There's a good fire going. 
INMAN I'm all right. 
ADA Somebody said you were enlisting. (no response) Are you? 
INMAN If there's a war we'll all fight. 
ADA (unimpressed) If there's a mountain we'll all climb, if there's an ocean we'll all drown. 
INMAN Call a thing a war makes it a challenge to some men. 
ADA Did you get a picture made? 
INMAN Say again. 
ADA A tintype, with your gun and your courage on display. 
INMAN You're laughing at me. 
ADA I don't know you. 
INMAN You're always carrying a tray. 
ADA I'm taking a drink over to the negroes in the barn. 
INMAN (takes the tray) I'll do that. I can't get much wetter. 
He goes into the night rain. She watches him. 
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
A beautiful day, the farm peaceful. Inman walks up the path to the farmhouse, its borders flowering and pretty, a slave woman weeding. He knocks on the door. Monroe answers. 
MONROE Mr. Inman. 
INMAN Reverend. 
MONROE What can I do for you? 
Inman hovers, awkward. Ada appears, awkward. 
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold Mountain General Store. Monroe lets Ada down. 
MONROE (of his appointment) I'll daresay Dr. O'Brien'll want to do a test or two. 
ADA And then there'll be a coffee or two, a brandy or two... 
Monroe smiles in acknowledgement, gets back in the trap. Ada heads into the store. 
INT. BEDROOM. ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
INMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed. 
He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door. 
He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her. 
INT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward. 
ADA I found you this book. William Bartram. They tell me it's good. I think he writes about these parts, the author, so... 
Inman takes it. 
She has something else. Wrapped in paper. 
ADA And this... (hands it to him) I'm not smiling in it. I don't know how to do that, hold a smile, so now I'm solemn... 
INMAN Ada... 
ADA What? 
HE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist. 
Below them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs. 
Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front door. 
ROURKE Let's go! 
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd. THE DRUMMERS DRUM, THE CROWD CHEERS, THE RECRUITS MARCH UP THE HILL -- 
EXT. BEHIND CONFEDERATE LINES, VIRGINIA. DAY 
-- AND THE WOUNDED AND THE WRETCHED STRAGGLE ALONG THE RAILROAD. 
A TRAIN with the seriously injured snakes past the back of the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving and departing troops -- and into peaceful country. FIDDLE PLAYS, THEN A BANJO. 
INT. BOX CAR. DAY 
A CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE, neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace. The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle away. His voice is a croak, spoiled. 
INMAN I'm not dying. 
STOBROD (to Pangle) What'd he say? 
PANGLE Says he ain't about to die. 
STOBROD (to Inman) Truth to tell they say you are, Soldier. We'll meet again, in the better world. 
He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering sound... 
EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
-- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to mount. It's a memorial service without bodies. 
Riders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young, intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. Somehow sinister. 
TEAGUE My condolences to you all. (he considers the slave) Keep an eye on the negro. They want what the white man got -- all of you watch out your brave boys give their lives to war and meantime your slaves carry murder, rape and arson to your firesides. 
MONROE The only slaves within twenty miles labor on my farm. They're good Christians and I'll vouchsafe for them. 
EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Cold Mountain at its loveliest. The CABRIOLET with Monroe and his daughter heads towards the farm. At a bend they meet a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them thunder past before continuing on their way home. Monroe is intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before. 
ADA What? 
MONROE You're looking -- at this moment, I don't know why -- you're looking exactly like your mother. 
ADA Every time you see the doctor you get melancholy. 
MONROE He listens to my heart and I get emotional. 
ADA I'm not sorry, but I don't know how we'll get through another winter. 
MONROE Will you play me something? Something peaceful while I look over my sermon. 
Ada takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen and ink. 
INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK 
ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour is open and the music floats over to him as he works. 
Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then the steady drumming of a summer shower. 
ADA (still playing) Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with you! 
She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes on to the window.. 
ADA Daddy, come inside before you drown! 
After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO 
ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER. 
He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down the lane. 
ADA (V.O.) Dear Mr. Inman... 
INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT 
INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs. Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run. 
MRS. MORGAN It's come to you by way of Virginia. 
There are various dates, which she decodes. 
MRS. MORGAN It's not too recent -- written this past winter. I'm afraid I can't read who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman, 
INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT 
Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room. 
ADA (V.O.) -- I'm still waiting, as I promised I would, but I find myself alone and at the end of my wits -- 
INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT 
Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter: 
MRS. MORGAN -- at the end of my wits, so now I say to you, plain as I can, come back to me. Come back to me is my request. (can't read the next bit) Then something I can't read, something, come back to me. 
Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination, gives a TINY NOD. 
OFFICIAL (O.S.) By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor of this great state of North Carolina: any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason and shall be hunted down like a dog. 
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a document. 
OFFICIAL -- Any man takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason. 
The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter the store. 
OFFICIAL The Home Guard is powered to enter any place it sees fit, without notice or constraint. Names of all deserters will be posted in every town, published in every newspaper. 
INT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches Mrs Castlereagh, the owner. 
ADA Is there a letter for me? 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH Nothing -- we're getting no post through at all -- although if you slip out back the material you ordered has arrived. 
They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area. Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books. 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH If folks knew I was taking deliveries from the North. 
ADA I know. Thank you so much. 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH The sooner we lose this war the better. Already one boy gone, another with his leg took off at the knee. That's enough. 
ADA What do you hear? 
MRS. CASTLEREAGH All I know is they say not one boy in ten from these mountains is coming home again and most of them are deserters. 
EXT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY 
Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past him, tries to make her package invisible. 
EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY 
EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the packed dirt. 
Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the chickens, and knock at the door. 
SALLY Ada! Ada, It's Sally. 
They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed. 
ESCO Will you look at the state of this place! 
SALLY Poor soul. She's got nobody and nothing and three hundred acres of misery. 
During this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house. 
INT. ADA'S BEDROOM BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket for something less dirty. 
INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments. 
Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image swings into -- 
EXT. GATES OF HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY 
-- the figure of Inman walking, frail, grey. A kind of lurching walk, as if his balance isn't guaranteed. He gets close to the gate and interests a Guard, on the lookout for would-be deserters. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he roasts over a small fire. He's always singing. Inman approaches. When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak. 
BLIND MAN Getting better all the time. 
INMAN Seems that way. 
BLIND MAN I wouldn't hurry. War's almost done. 
INMAN Where'd you take your wound? 
BLIND MAN Before I was born. Never saw a thing in this world, not a tree a gun or a woman. Though I put my hand on all three. Couple of things I felt back there I'd sure liked to have had a long look at. 
He's shoveling some peanuts into a twist of paper. 
INMAN What would you give for that? To have your eyeballs back for ten minutes? 
BLIND MAN Ten minutes! Wouldn't give an Indian head cent. I fear it might turn me hateful. 
INMAN That's sure what seeing's done to me. 
BLIND MAN That ain't the way I meant it. You said ten minutes. It's having a thing and then the loss I'm talking about. 
INMAN Then we don't agree. There's not much I wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace. 
BLIND MAN Someplace or someone. 
INMAN Same difference. 
BLIND MAN You watch yourself. They're shooting men who take themselves a walk. 
EXT. TREE PROMENADE, CHARLESTON. DAY 
Inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way, under supervision, towards the town. The grandeur of the approach, the carriages. The sorry state of the soldiers. 
INT. COURTHOUSE, CHARLESTON. DAY 
TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out, AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand and gives him an apple from the barrel. 
EXT. TEMPORARY BARBERSHOP, CHARLESTON. DAY 
Inman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the Courthouse. Two barbers, two chairs. A VERY ELEGANT SQUARE, SOME STUCCO-FRONTED BUILDINGS, A GLIMPSE OF THE MONEYED SOUTH IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MODEST TOWN OF COLD MOUNTAIN. AN AUCTION HOUSE OPPOSITE ADVERTISES SLAVES, CATTLE, LAND... 
BARBER Next. 
Inman settles in the seat. The Barber contemplates his scraggy beard, the livid, scabbed wound on his neck. 
BARBER (nervous) I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about to shave you. That thing opens up, your head's liable to falloff. 
INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. PREDAWN 
It is almost dawn. The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving onto the still dark world. The Night Guard passes by on its patrol of the perimeter. A CLEAN-SHAVEN INMAN IS FULLY DRESSED UNDER THE COVERS. He gets his hat, pushes his book into his knapsack and, with one step up, WALKS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND INTO THE WORLD. 
EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAWN 
Inman, his footprints in the sand, as he hurries along by the edge of the ocean, away from the hospital... 
EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY 
-- as Ada walks, the wind kicking up around her, past the Swanger place. She's bent and curiously dressed in her father's coat. 
SALLY (V.O.) Ada... 
RUBY What's the rake for? 
ADA The rake? 
RUBY Ain't for gardening, that's for sure. Number one -- you got a horse I can plow all day. I'm a worker. Number two there's no man better than me cause there's no man around who ain't old or full of mischief. I know your plight. 
ADA My plight? 
RUBY Am I hard to hear cause you keep repeating everything. I'm not looking for money, never cared for it and now it ain't worth nothing. I expect to board and eat at the same table. I'm not a servant. Do you get my meaning? 
ADA You're not a servant. 
RUBY People'll have to empty their own night jars, that's my point. 
ADA Right. 
RUBY And I'm not planning to work while you watch neither. 
ADA Right. 
RUBY Is that a yes or a no? 
ADA (looks at Ruby) Yes. 
RUBY There's half the day yet. Let's make a start. My name's Ruby. I know your name. 
ADA The rake: there's a rooster devil, I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself. I go near him he's at me with his spurs. 
RUBY I despise a flogging rooster. Where is he? 
Ada gets up, nods to the corner of the yard. Ruby goes over. 
The Rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent. 
IN ONE MOVEMENT SHE PICKS UP THE BIRD AND TWISTS OFF ITS HEAD. 
RUBY Let's put him in a pot. 
EXT. CORNFIELDS. DAWN 
Inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, the crop high and thick around him. He stops, hearing something. Riders. He wades into the field, seeking cover in the tall crop, lying in the dirt. Horses appear. HOME GUARD MEN ON PATROL, A CHAIN GANG OF PRISONERS: SLAVES, DESERTERS IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have dogs, which sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the Home Guard. 
Inman waits until they're well out of sight. AS HE GETS TO HIS FEET IN THE GREAT FIELDS, ANOTHER BODY APPEARS, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, ALL SLAVES ON THE RUN DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD. He walks to the road, paying no heed to them. They assemble, paying no heed to him and move off in the opposite direction. Inman turns, looks at them. 
INMAN Hey! (they stop, turn) I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece of cheese. 
They look at him, then continue on their way. 
INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN 
Ada wakes up to persistent knocking. 
RUBY Ada? Ada? You up? 
ADA Yes. (opening her eyes) It's still dark. 
RUBY Tell the cows that. It's late. 
INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN 
Ada enters blearily, clutching her novel. Ruby already busy. 
ADA I have to eat something. 
RUBY Then you have to get up earlier. (at Ada's book) What's that? 
ADA A novel. 
RUBY (heading outside) You want to carry a book carry one you can write in -- 
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN 
Ruby emerges, followed by Ada, chewing on a tomato. 
RUBY -- we got our own story. Called Black Cove Farm: a catastrophe. 
She looks back at Ada for a reaction. 
RUBY I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o- phe. Learned the same place you did, in the schoolroom. That's one of the first words they taught me. Ruby Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h- e... 
They're heading for the stable. 
INT. STABLE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Ruby's already pitching hay. Turns to Ada. 
RUBY You mucking out? 
VEASEY She's got my bastard in her belly. What kind of pistol is that I never saw the like of it? 
EXT. VEASEY TOWN. NIGHT 
Inman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied behind his back, desperate for a reprieve. 
VEASEY I'm begging you. It's better you blowout my brains than return me to this place. 
INMAN Where does she live? 
VEASEY In our house. She sleeps in our kitchen. You don't know me, friend, but the good Lord punished me with want. I am all appetite. That's all I do all day is want: food, the female parts... 
INMAN Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon every time I ask a question. 
They're in the town's main drag now. There's a Chapel and next to it, a small house. 
INMAN This your place? 
VEASEY Dear God of misery. 
INMAN You're going to put her back where she sleeps. 
VEASEY I do that the Members will lynch me. Consorting with a nigger, adultery, siring a bastard while serving as their preacher. We're a strict congregation we've churched men for picking up a fiddle on the sabbath. 
INMAN So you reckoned to kill her. 
Disgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house. 
VEASEY There's a back door. Have pity. 
And he leads Inman down a side path. 
INT. VEASEY HOUSE. NIGHT 
Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind, the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire. 
VEASEY (whispering) Thank you. I was going to do a grievous wrong. 
He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around her shoulders. He turns to Inman. 
VESEY You tasted dark meat? Sweet as liquorice. I think I should go back up to my wife. She wakes at the slightest noise. 
Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed... 
INMAN You find me some paper and a pen. 
EXT. CHAPEL, VEASEY TOWN. DAWN 
INMAN HAS TIED A VERY DISTRAUGHT VEASEY TO A TREE IN FRONT OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above Veasey's head. It's covered in handwriting. A dog barks. 
VEASEY You're not entitled to judge me! You're nothing but an outlier, plain as daylight! 
Inman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket. He stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short. And then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing through the handkerchief. 
INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN 
Ada asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm. 
RUBY Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in the woods? 
ADA No. What? No. We bought our hams. 
RUBY There's a world more to a hog than the two hams! Lard, for example, we'll need plenty -- 
She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the overflowing laundry basket. 
RUBY The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's laundry. (marching out) I can feel you shutting your eyes. 
EXT. BOTTOM FIELD. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Ada and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings of A SPLIT RAIL FENCE. As they struggle with a heavy rail, Ruby is testing Ada. 
RUBY What's this wood? 
ADA I don't know. Locust? 
RUBY Where's North? 
ADA North is, North is -- 
RUBY Name me three herbs growing wild on this farm. 
ADA (frustrated with Ruby and with herself) I can't! I can't! All right? I can talk about farming in Latin. Will that do? I can read French. I know Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my Bible. I can name the principal rivers of Europe, but don't ask me to name one stream in this county. I can embroider, but I can't darn, I can arrange cut flowers, but I can't grow them. If a thing has a function, if I might do something with it, it wasn't considered suitable. 
RUBY Why? 
ADA Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty much everything to do with me. 
JUNIOR -- In the clover 
VEASEY One good fart -- that'll tip over! 
They guffaw, delighted in the alcohol haze. Veasey suddenly exclaims, hand in the air, rushes into the bushes. 
VEASEY Oh God of my God! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
JUNIOR What's up? 
VEASEY The Israelites! The tribes of Israel are about to flee from the banks of Egypt! Hallelujah! 
INMAN (explaining to Junior) He's got a shit coming on. It's overdue. 
JUNIOR (bewildered) And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian? 
INMAN Like a Christian. 
JUNIOR Good God. 
EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK 
The three men arrive at the yard. DOGS AND CHILDREN MILL AROUND THE VISITORS. FOUR WOMEN COME OUT, one after the other each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their voluptuousness, or so it seems to Veasey. They freely stare. 
JUNIOR These two boys is stopping for supper. They're on the road to Atonement. 
The women consider the men, then disappear back inside. 
VEASEY Atonement is not a place. 
JUNIOR So what is it when it's at home? 
VEASEY Those are fine examples of the female. 
JUNIOR Take them all and leave the saw. Be a sight more use. 
SHYLA (reappearing) If they want to get in a tub there's an hour before food. 
JUNIOR They love to scrub a man. (to Shyla) Put the water on the boil. (back to the men) It's my liquor, gets their titties swinging. 
VEASEY (excited) God damn! (to Inman) I was right about sheep droppings those stools -- like rock hard. Quite astonishing. 
INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK 
No real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the door. 
Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely sexual. 
SHYLA That's battered flesh. (of his neck wound) I could work a finger in there. 
VEASEY He's a hero. Took that wound at Petersburg. 
INMAN He doesn't know what I am. (uncomfortable with her stare) Thanks. 
SHYLA (to Veasey) He's shy, ain't he? 
VEASEY Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in that tub, then we'll see who's a shy one. 
SHYLA I want to poke my thumb in his holes. 
A second woman comes to the door. Dolly. 
DOLLY Lila says supper's up. 
INT. JUNIOR'S CABIN, NIGHT 
LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks. Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away. 
LILA Hey! 
Junior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey. 
JUNIOR He's gone now. Look! His eyes have gone. 
INMAN (vaguely, drunk) What? 
VEASEY Dolly? 
DOLLY S'me. 
VEASEY Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a poem. That's a poem. 
He begins to recite, has a verse in his mind. 
VEASEY Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae (but he can' t summon it) Da-da da-da da-da dae... (vague) ...there's a poem there. 
JUNIOR I'm leaving soon as I'm full. 
SALLY Like a coupla scarecrows after a thunderstorm. 
RUBY We need a scarecrow, birds eating up half our winter garden. 
ADA Sally's right. We should both stop toiling and stand a while with our arms stretch out. I'll volunteer. 
RUBY We got something for you. 
ADA For all your kindness. Coffee. And a pie. 
RUBY That's real coffee. It ain't hickory and dirt. 
SALLY (taking the gifts) Thank you both. (of the pie) Ruby, I look forward to this. We all do. Esco and me. 
RUBY (grinning at Ada) She made it. 
ADA I made it. 
SALLY Good God in Heaven. 
RUBY (by way of recommendation) I'm still alive. 
Sally's strangely awkward, lingering at the door, staring at the gifts... 
RUBY We'll be getting along. 
SALLY (nodding) I know Esco's going to be real sorry he missed you. You all take care. 
They all kiss, then the girls walk back down the path. Ruby is vexed. 
RUBY That strike you as odd? 
ADA What? 
RUBY Stood at her front door? 
ADA Sally? 
RUBY Number one -- I know that woman all my life. I never stood outside her house -- she'd invite a wolf inside if it knocked on the door. 
ADA Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she was busy. 
RUBY Number two -- Old Man Swanger was inside that house: I could smell his pipe burning. Number three -- look at these fields. 
ADA What about them? 
She contemplated the stubble fields they're passing. 
RUBY We came by here a week ago, they were waist high in hay. 
EXT. A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT 
The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey among them. Veasey has grown some beard. 
AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving. 
There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He doesn't move. 
INMAN He's dead. 
The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader. 
INMAN This man's dead! 
Nobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body. 
EXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY 
THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH. 
More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the prisoners to a horse rail. 
Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise Veasey. 
VEASEY Am I so altered that they don't see me? 
Somebody walks by with a young child. 
Veasey looks at Inman. 
VEASEY I christened that child. 
The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low. 
SHEFFIELD I'm looking to get out of this. They drag us back to fight -- we're just target practice for the Federal boys. 
INMAN You run, we're all running with you, the lame and the stupid, of which we number both. 
RUBY I can't get this damn thing off her. 
ADA (at the well, looking down) Dear Lord in heaven. 
RUBY Ada, I can't get this off her! 
Ada runs over. They struggle, can't lift it. Sally's lips are moving. 
RUBY What darling? What? 
She bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada. 
RUBY She's saying don't bother. 
ADA Wait! 
She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt. 
Ruby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well. 
ADA There's someone down there. I think it's Esco. 
Ruby looks over at the well, then at Ada. 
RUBY This world won't stand long. God won't let it stand this way long. 
INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY 
An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot, wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know where he is or how long he's been there. 
EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY 
Maddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady. 
INMAN How long have I been sleeping? 
MADDY Not long enough. 
INMAN I can't stop here. I'm a deserter. They find me here things could be bad for you. 
MADDY What they going to do? Cut short my young life? Sit down before you fall down. 
She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil. 
INMAN How long you been up here? 
MADDY What year are we? '63? 
INMAN Last time I checked it was '64. 
MADDY I'd say twenty six years. 
INMAN Twenty six years! 
MADDY I could move on anytime. I've seen most of the world anyway, Richmond in the North, south almost to Charleston. You're going somewhere or you are somewhere, what's the difference? 
She's still stroking the goat. It looks as if it's asleep. 
MADDY I've learned a person can survive off pretty much of a goat. I can't abide a chicken, but a goat gives you company and milk and cheese and then, when you need it, good meat. 
In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as if it were only surprised and not dying. 
MADDY So you've been fighting? 
INMAN (as if he might break) I could be at killing for days sometimes, in the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and I always killed him and he never killed me. 
MADDY He gave it a try, to look at you. 
INMAN I guess he did. 
MADDY See I think there's a plan. There's a design. For each and every one of us. 
During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the authority of someone who's done this a thousand times. 
MADDY You look at nature, a bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, shits the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's got a job, seed's got a job. 
And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of meat. 
INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING 
A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling in a pan. 
INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in thanks, but -- doesn't look up. 
She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs. 
MADDY Take one of these now with your food. 
RUBY Just so's you know -- you're not eating inside. Number One -- they hang people round here for taking in deserters. Number two -- even if they gave out prizes -- you'd still eat outside. 
STOBROD You're scarred. 
RUBY I'm what? 
STOBROD Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to you. 
RUBY You'd be scarred. You'd be really scarred if I hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sacking. Which was her idea. 
STOBROD I hurt you. 
RUBY Good God! 
STOBROD I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind. Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the eyes that sparkle. 
RUBY Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you abandoned me, you ignored me, you beat me some more -- all of that is better than Ruby with the eyes that sparkle! 
STOBROD I'm changed. People change. War changes people something terrible. (to Ada) Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt -- I wasn't always the best... 
RUBY You were an asshole. 
STOBROD I can't disagree with that. I was. 
RUBY Get him out of here! 
STOBROD Music's changed me. I'm full of music, darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's got a little snake's rattle in the body -- took it off a dead federal in Virginia. That's a beautiful fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby. Don't know if it's from that little rattle locked up in it, or from something untied my heart. 
Ruby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth. 
RUBY You're all set. 
STOBROD (sincerely) Bless you both. 
He goes to the door. 
RUBY Ain't you got a proper coat? 
STOBROD Darling, I'm fine. And you just say the word, I won't come back neither. I don't want to put either you or your mistress here in any bother. 
ADA I'm not Ruby's employer. 
STOBROD Oh, okay, who is? 
RUBY Nobody. (Stobrod digests this) I'll make up food for you, you come Sundays before it's light, I'll leave it behind the Old Frazier Mill. 
STOBROD Do you know who really needs a coat, darling, is my partner, fat boy name of Pangle. We're hiding up in the caves and he feels the cold like a thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit him. (leaving) I love you, Ruby. In case the sky falls on our head. You're a good girl. 
And he's gone. Ruby scowls. FIDDLE MUSIC BEGINS. 
RUBY He is so full of manure, that man, we could lay him on the dirt and grow another one just like him. 
ADA So that's Stobrod Thewes. 
RUBY It is and that's the last you'll see of him. 
EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DUSK 
THE FIDDLE CONTINUES, A BANJO JOINS IN. 
Maddy is loading up Inman for his journey. She hands him a bulging goatskin satchel. 
MADDY That's medicine and goatmeat. You're sick of both. 
INMAN I have a deal to thank you for. 
She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol. 
MADDY And that's just for show, or -- if you can get close enough -- a wild turkey. 
She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods, knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan. 
EXT. WOODS. DAY 
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again. 
JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call. 
Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND. 
EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY 
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes straight into the Smoke House. 
INT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY 
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing. 
ADA That's Taurus the bull, and that's Gemini and that's Orion's big dog, Canis Major. 
RUBY Listen to her, Sal. She's turned into a highland girl. 
ADA I could always name the stars, Ruby, that was never my problem. 
They all three have linked arms. Ada imitates Stobrod. 
ADA I love you darling. In case that big old sky falls on our heads. And I love you, too. Sal. 
RUBY It's sad, Sal. It's a c-a-t-a-s-t-r- o-p-h-e. 
INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. MORNING 
Ada at the window as, outside, SNOW FLAKES BEGIN TO FALL. 
EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING 
Stobrod opens the door of the Mill. The SNOW FLAKES dissuade him from venturing further. He goes back inside. 
STOBROD (O.S.) No sense setting off in snow. 
THE DOOR SHUTS, FIDDLE MUSIC LEAKS THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED BY BANJO AND HARMONICA. 
INT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY 
Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining -- is urgently shaking Inman. Hissing at him: 
SARA Get out of here, quick! 
Inman surfaces from deep sleep. 
SARA Federals are coming. They find you here it'll go bad on all of us. 
Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun. 
INMAN I can try and fight them. 
SARA No, my baby. Please no! Just get. 
She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on, but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down onto the frosty ground. 
EXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY 
Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look round until he's sheltered by the trees. 
FEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his shirt, shivering, then his boots. 
Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles with him, is again knocked down. 
INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD. 
Then Sara starts to scream. 
Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall. 
PISTOL We got all day. 
SARA My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's shaking! Have some pity. 
A third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers them up. 
SARA I got nothing. I swear. 
Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest. 
NYM That ain't necessarily so. 
SARA Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go inside! Take my baby inside and then we'll do whatever you want. 
Nym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now leads it towards the horses. 
SARA (screaming) There's nothing! You take that hog I'm as good as dead. Cover up my boy! 
She's wailing, an unbearable ululation. NYM SLAPS HER, TWICE, HARD. 
INT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY 
The door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT. 
EXT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY 
Bardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby. 
BARDOLPH This is ready to get a fit going. It's shuddering. It's gone blue. 
PISTOL (to Nym) How long does he want? Hey! Leave some for the rest of us. 
SOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints. 
Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks. 
EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING 
A CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire. 
Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK, frozen and covered with snow. 
GEORGIA What d'you reckon? Think we could eat this? 
STOBROD You cook something long enough you can eat anything. 
PANGLE (prodding it) It's frozen. How long it been there for? 
STOBROD You hungry? 
PANGLE Yeah. 
STOBROD Not very long. 
EXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING 
Teague examines the snow's imprinted silhouette of Pangle. 
EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
STOBROD SINGS AND COOKS. PANGLE ACCOMPANIES HIM ON BANJO, Georgia joins in the chorus. Stobrod pulls one of the hickory stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells, smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite. Chews. 
STOBROD Edible. 
Pangle takes another stick, burns his fingers. 
PANGLE Ow! 
GEORGIA (takes a bite from his skewer) Don't taste much like venison. 
PANGLE It's good. I think it's good. 
EXT. THE KILLING GROUND. COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
The three men are asleep. The fire still burning. They're lying like petals of a flower around it. Suddenly Georgia sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid sounds of violent nausea. 
EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
GEORGIA IS KNEELING IN THE SNOW, his head in the snow, when he A HALF DOZEN RIDERS TROT PAST approaching the sleeping Stobrod and Pangle. Georgia has to vomit again. 
EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
Teague rides up to the fire, the other riders with him -- Mo, Jo, Bosie, Grayling. Stobrod wakes, sits up, Pangle sleeps. 
TEAGUE Evening. Hope we didn't disturb you. 
STOBROD You're all right. 
TEAGUE Name's Teague. Do I know you? 
STOBROD Thewes. 
Teague slides off his horse, approaches the fire. 
TEAGUE You a deserter? -- don't mind if I just warm up at your fire. (of the sleeping Pangle) That your wife? 
STOBROD Who? That's a he! 
TEAGUE He your wife? 
STOBROD We're musicians. He picks the banjo, I got a fiddle. 
TEAGUE (to his men) Look pretty romantic by the fire. Don't they? (to Stobrod) Your boyfriend's got a nice bit of flesh on him. Close your eyes slip inside that shirt get two good handfuls -- dark enough I'd be willing. I'm just kidding. (to his men) Tell him, I'm just kidding. 
BOSIE He's just kidding. 
EXT. TREES NEAR KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
Georgia squints through the trees. Doesn't know what to do. 
EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
TEAGUE Did you answer my question -- about your military status? 
STOBROD Discharged. Took a wound at Petersburg. 
TEAGUE Oh, so like a hero's discharge. 
STOBROD I guess. 
PANGLE What'd you make of that? 
BOSIE Heartbreaking. 
TEAGUE Stand over by that tree. 
STOBROD Me? 
TEAGUE Over by that tree. Over there. Take your boyfriend. 
Stobrod gets up, carrying his fiddle, heads over to a big old poplar. Nods at Pangle. 
STOBROD Come on. 
Pangle gets up, banjo in his hand. Puts his arm around Stobrod as if they were about to be photographed. The Home Guard gather around them. From the trees Georgia watches, helpless. Pangle grins at Teague. 
TEAGUE Don't smile. 
PANGLE What? 
TEAGUE Quit smiling. 
STOBROD He always smiles. He don't mean nothing by it. I told him this world's got nothing worth a smile. 
TEAGUE Put your hat over your face. 
PANGLE What do you mean? 
TEAGUE Cover your face with your hat. 
PANGLE TALES OFF HIS HAT, HOLDS IT OVER HIS FACE. THE MOMENT HE OBLIGIES, TEAGUE'S CARBINE SPRINGS UP IN HIS HAND AND BLOWS THE HAT AWAY SEVERAL OTHER SHOTS FOLLOW. STOBROD FALLS UNDER PANGLE, THE BULLETS FLYING. 
EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
Georgia lies prostrate in the snow, shuddering under the report of each bullet. 
EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Ruby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's feet, the animal on its back between Ruby's knees. She looks up to see GEORGIA RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARDS HER, calling out her name. From the kitchen window, Ada looks on as he reaches Ruby, the story pouring from him. Ada emerges from the house, walks towards the bad news. 
INT. STOREROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Ruby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets. Ada comes in doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion. 
ADA I told Georgia he can stop here, sleep in the barn. He's got nothing inside him. He'd walk out of here and die in the snow. 
RUBY He can milk the cows. I was worrying about that. It'll be dark in a couple of hours. I's ten hours climb from here. He's drawn a map. 
ADA Okay. 
RUBY (boiling) You know these fools stayed the night in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he can't do one good thing without adding the bad. Left tracks in the snow all the way up for them Home Guards to follow. That's a sign says shoot me! 
ADA Ruby, I'm so sorry. 
Ada moves towards her, puts her arms around her. Ruby is rigid. Ada stops embracing her. 
RUBY We should get going. 
She's tying up the kit. She doesn't know how to grieve. 
RUBY Every piece of this is a man's bullshit. They call this a war a cloud over the land, but they made the weather. Then they stand in the rain and say: shit! It's raining! (tears welling) If I cry one tear for my Daddy I stole it off a crocodile. 
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING 
THE SNOW IS FALLING HEAVILY. RUBY AND ADA TRUDGE UP THE 
MOUNTAIN, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down, leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies. A choice of paths. They start up one, then Ruby decides against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the horse back and then yanking it up the other path. 
EXT. PI STRUCTURE, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT 
Ruby and Ada have made a fire. They sleep under a stone structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the entrance, the snow caught in its light. 
EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING 
Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder. 
Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him. Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him. 
Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head. 
ADA I don't understand. 
RUBY Maybe Teague's took him. They did that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, they? -- dragged them into town, then strung them up as warning... it's snowed since, so I can't read the story on the ground. 
Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and the strings hang slack. 
RUBY Let's dig. 
After all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the ghost. 
INMAN Then I believe I made a mistake. 
He turns, walks heavily away from her. Then he turns again, completely lost, without compass. 
INMAN If I knew where to go I'd go there. 
ADA (finally recognising him) Inman? 
He nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in their throats. Eventually -- 
ADA You'd better come with me. 
And with that, she starts to sob, and sob. 
VERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada. They embrace. 
INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING 
Ada enters, Inman behind her. Ruby looks up from Stobrod. 
ADA Ruby, this is Inman. 
Ruby digests this. Considers this ghost of a man. 
RUBY Congratulations, I should send you out with a shotgun more often. He looks as he needs sleep. 
INMAN I may need to. 
RUBY Be my guest. You shot or something? 
INMAN Not lately. 
RUBY Hungry? (Inman nods, Ruby to Ada) He woke up. 
ADA Stobrod? 
RUBY Said -- your mommy's name was Grace then closed his eyes again. 
EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY 
Ada comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping out. The snow has stopped. Ada stands in the door, watches Ruby. Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable. 
ADA He's asleep. They both are. 
RUBY I'm not surprised. Your man looks played out. 
ADA I saw him. I realize now. 
RUBY Saw him when? 
ADA In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of trees. The man like a black smudge in the snow, the sun behind him. 
RUBY Well there you are. 
ADA Funny thing is it wasn't the same. The image. It wasn't snowing. And in the well, he was, as if he were falling. 
RUBY You probably don't remember it right. 
ADA I remember it exactly. There were crows, these black crows flying towards me. I thought I was seeing him fall. Instead I was seeing him come back to me. All this while I've been packing ice around my heart. How will I make it melt? 
RUBY Better get a fire going. (goes to the fireplace) I've got big plans for that farm. Got a vision in my mind of how that Cove needs to be. 
ADA I know you have. 
RUBY There's not a thing we can't do ourselves. 
INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT 
THE FIRE BURNS. Ada lies awake. Ruby sleeping. Ada gets up, steps out into the snow, her blanket around her. 
EXT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT 
Inman is outside his cabin. Only the light escaping from the cabin, fire lights them, almost silhouettes. 
INMAN I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet. 
ADA I couldn't sleep. 
INMAN -- I got no appetite left to be in a room with wounded men. 
ADA I can't see your face. 
INMAN It's not a face you recognised. 
ADA Did you get my letters? 
EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING 
A crisp, cold beautiful morning. They're packing up, all their clothes in layers. Inman prepares the horse. Ruby and Ada carrying bundles out of the huts. Inman approaches Ruby. 
INMAN You go ahead. I'll follow with the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate. 
ADA We can all go together. 
INMAN It's safer this way. No one has quarrel with you. 
RUBY He's right. 
INMAN (to Ruby) I gather I need permission if I reckon on living at Black Cove. 
Ruby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut. Inman gets close to Ada. 
INMAN We'll get to you by nightfall. 
ADA You be safe. 
She puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile. 
INMAN Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some category of fly born on the hide of a cow. It flies up into a tree and waits and waits until it smells cow. It can wait a year, two years, I don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow comes along and it wakes up, flies down, lays its eggs on the cow. There's purpose for you. 
ADA And am I the fly in this story, or the cow? 
INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY 
Ruby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey. 
STOBROD You come up the mountain for me, darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead and gone. 
RUBY You'd have found some other fool to rescue you. 
STOBROD He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy. 
He coughs for a long time. 
RUBY If you say a thing and then cough it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse, and don't lose him or sell him. We'll need him on the farm. 
EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING 
And then the two women are off, little men in their outfits, tramping off in the snow. Inman watches. 
EXT. TRACK NEAR THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY 
Ruby and Ada walk. 
RUBY I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing to the animals. 
ADA I thought you were thinking on him! 
RUBY I was not. I was thinking on swollen udders -- and before you say same difference... 
ADA I'm saying nothing. 
Ruby elbows her. 
RUBY Miss lovey-dovey! 
Ada elbows her back. 
EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY 
Inman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a steep slope. Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, A GROUP OF RIDERS JOIN THE TRAIL, IN SLOW BUT STEADY PURSUIT. 
Inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. He and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe of trees. 
INMAN (quietly to Stobrod) Don't look round. 
STOBROD Got it. 
INMAN How many men does he have? 
STOBROD There were five. You can't reason with that man. 
INMAN (takes off his gloves) I got a conversation stopper. (they're getting closer) Closer we get to that broken ground the better. 
Inman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're at the edge of the trees. 
INMAN You hold on tight, do you hear? When I say three, look round, nice and slow. 
STOBROD Okay. 
INMAN One, two, three. 
Stobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS THREE CORPSES HUNG OVER IT, ANOTHER HORSE DRAGS A MAKESHIFT LITTER WITH A COUPLE MORE, SOUVENIRS OF THEIR CAVE VISIT. Teague waves.

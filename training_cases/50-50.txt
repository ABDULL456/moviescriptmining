OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE 
EXT. SAN DIEGO - DAY 
It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches, golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of rapturous citizens. 
EXT. BUS STOP - DAY 
A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers. 
We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered, pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL. 
INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY 
Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls. 
Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do. 
Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine. 
RECEPTIONIST Can I help you? 
ADAM I have an appointment. 
RECEPTIONIST Name? 
ADAM Adam Schwartz. 
The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. He coughs again. 
Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing. 
ADAM (CONT'D) (CONFUSED) Um, am I supposed to go somewhere? 
With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Oh, should I go sit? 
The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine. 
Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time, Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out: 
RECEPTIONIST Adam Schwartz. 
Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else there. Again the receptionist calls out again - 
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) Adam Schwartz. 
ADAM Yeah, that's me. 
RECEPTIONIST Follow me. 
The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown. 
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) Put this on. 
ADAM Do I need to take off all my clothes? 
The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam. 
ADAM (CONT'D) I'll figure it out. 
The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right. 
Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse. 
NURSE JOANNE Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice to meet you. 
Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin. 
ADAM You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend? 
NURSE JOANNE (LAUGHS) Cotton. You're funny. 
Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick yellow line. 
NURSE JOANNE (CONT'D) Now I'm going to need you to fill this cup with urine. You think you can do that? 
ADAM Can't you just cut it out of me? 
DR. ROSS Yes, that is an option. But because the tumor has spread to a such significant size. Cutting it out now would be risky. 
ADAM Well what are my chances of beating this? 
Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but. 
DR. Ross Listen, you're in good hands. The best thing for you to do right now is to not worry...Let me do the worrying. Alright? 
Dr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face. 
DR. ROSS (CONT'D) Maybe you should talk to someone. 
Dr. Ross hands Adam a business card for the "Mount Sinai Psychology Group". 
DR. ROSS (CONT'D) We have a whole department of psychologists here in the hospital. They specialize in cases...in these...sort of matters. They'll be able to help you. 
Not knowing what else to say, Dr. Ross looks at his watch, looks back to Adam, and moves to the door. 
DR. ROSS (CONT'D) Hang in there champ. 
INT. SAN DIEGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - EVENING 
CLOSE ON a computer screen: 
"Neurofibrosarcoma Schwannoma. Treatment Forms: Chemotherapy and Radiation offer negligible success rates. Surgical resection proven to be most effective. Risks of surgery: Amputation of limbs. Paralysis. Death. 2 Year survival rate: 50%. If tumor metastasizes systemically, 2 year survival rate: 0%." 
Adam sits staring at the screen. This is not good. 
The LIBRARIAN, a tall blond surfer type, taps Adam on the shoulder. 
LIBRARIAN Hey bro, time's up. 
Startled. Adam looks up at the librarian. 
ADAM Can I have just a few more minutes? 
LIBRARIAN Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit. (EMBARRASSED) Rules. 
The librarian motions to the LONG LINE of mostly HOMELESS CUSTOMERS waiting to use the computer. 
INT. BUS - EVENING 
Adam sits deep in thought. 
EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
The bus stops. Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a deep breath... 
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Adam enters the living room - it's empty. NPR News is on the radio. Fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel. The sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen. 
RACHEL (O.S.) Adam? Is that you? 
Adam walks into the kitchen. Rachel is at the stove cooking in her underwear. Adam stands in the doorway watching her. God she looks sexy. Rachel turns - 
RACHEL (CONT'D) (in a Hungarian accent) Welcome home Mr. Adam. I made vegetarian goulash. 
Like a ballerina, Rachel crosses to Adam on her tip toes holding out a spoon of her goulash. She holds up the offering to Adam's mouth. He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to hide his internal distress. His sad eyes tell Rachel another story. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) (still using accent) What is wrong? 
ADAM Nothing. 
RACHEL (still using accent) Liar. 
This is not going to be easy. 
ADAM We need to talk. 
Rachel drops the accent. This seems serious. 
RACHEL Why? What's going on? 
ADAM I had a doctor's appointment today. 
RACHEL (WORRIED) What kind of doctor's appointment? 
Adam has no idea what to say. 
ADAM Have you ever seen the movie "Beaches"? 
RACHEL You mean with Bette Midler? 
Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door. 
EDITH So what's for dinner? 
INT. ADAM'S DINING ROOM - LATER 
Everyone sits around the table. Edith pokes at her plate of vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at. 
RACHEL If I had known you were coming I would have made something else. 
EDITH I'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son... (looks at her plate) So this isn't meat? 
RACHEL No it's called sei-tan. 
ADAM It's made of wheat gluten. 
Edith looks more confused. 
EDITH But it's not meat. 
RACHEL No, but it has a texture just like meat. 
Edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash. 
EDITH (INSINCERE) Mmmmm. It's Good. 
Edith puts her spoon down. She pulls a handful of pills out her fanny-pack and puts them in front of Art. 
EDITH (CONT'D) Art, take your pills. 
Art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but doesn't swallow. 
EDITH (CONT'D) Swallow. 
As Art swallows, Edith eagerly turns her attention to Rachel. 
EDITH (CONT'D) So? Did you set a date? 
RACHEL (CONFUSED) A date? 
EDITH (TO ADAM) Do not do summer like your cousin, remember how awful that was? Schlepping around in the heat like that. Plus the bugs and the gnats. 
ADAM (whispers to Rachel) What is she talking about? 
EDITH And now Rachel. I know we haven't discussed this, but are you going to convert? 
RACHEL (whispers to Adam) She thinks we're getting married. 
ADAM Mom. We're not getting married. 
EDITH Oh thank god. (TO RACHEL) No offense. (TO ADAM) So then what's the big news that you made us rush all the way over here. 
Not knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news... 
ADAM Have you ever seen "Terms of Endearment"? 
RACHEL Oh jesus Adam, just tell her. 
EDITH Tell me what? 
ADAM Alright fine. But, before I tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm. 
EDITH Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic. 
ADAM Mom, just promise me. Okay? 
EDITH I promise...You make me out to be some kind of irrational loon. 
Here goes nothing. 
ADAM (MUMBLES) I have cancer. 
EDITH What? 
ADAM (MUMBLES) I have cancer. 
EDITH (TO RACHEL) What is he saying? 
ADAM (takes a deep breath) I have cancer. 
EDITH Cancer? What do you mean you have cancer? 
ADAM I - HAVE - CANCER. 
EDITH I don't understand. 
KATIE Now, why do you say that? 
ADAM I don't know, it was a bad joke. 
KATIE But there's a reason. You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel. 
Katie is losing Adam. 
KATIE (CONT'D) In order to heal the body, you must heal the mind. It's imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger. Get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside. 
Adam's mind drifts away from Katie. He focuses on all the clutter. The slanted clock. The wilting plant. The crumbled paper on the floor. The mess is driving him crazy. 
KATIE (CONT'D) So today what I want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy. 
Katie presses play on her iPod. We hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music. Adam looks up in confusion. 
ADAM Huh? 
KATIE I want you to lay back and close your eyes. 
Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch. 
ADAM Lay here? 
KATIE Yes, I want you to just lay back, and let go. 
ADAM Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? Or my days as a call girl? 
KATIE Another joke? 
ADAM (SHRUGS) Oh come on. Nothing? That was funny. 
KATIE Ssshhhhh... 
Katie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his shoulders. Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention. 
He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the stain. 
KATIE (CONT'D) Close your eyes and relax. Find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer. 
Adam closes his eyes. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
RACHEL (O.S.) Keep your eyes closed. No peeking. 
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Adam is seated at the dining table with his eyes closed. 
ADAM I can't believe you got me a present. (BEAT) Is it that Prada handbag I've been eyeing? 
RACHEL (O.S.) Even better. 
ADAM What is it? 
RACHEL (O.S.) Keep your eyes closed. 
ADAM You know how I feel about surprises. Last surprise I got my parents told me I was adopted. 
RACHEL (O.S.) You're not adopted. 
ADAM Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was. 
Rachel crosses into the room and stands over Adam. 
RACHEL Okay. Open your eyes. 
Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Surprise! 
Adam stares in confusion. 
ADAM (DISAPPOINTED) What is it? 
RACHEL It's Noodle. 
ADAM It's so small. What do you do with it? 
RACHEL (ANNOYED) Adam, IT's a he, and HE's adorable...Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process. 
ADAM Why, did it go to medical school? 
RACHEL (PISSED) I thought you'd be happy... 
SUSAN Eat nothing but green foods. 
ADAM Like a specific kind of green food? 
SUSAN No, any green food. It works, my sister's friend survived lung cancer. 
CUT TO: 
Adam stands with TED. 
TED (SUSPICIOUS) So what kind of cancer do you have? 
ADAM Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas. 
TED Never heard of it. 
ADAM It's pretty rare. 
TED Yeah well, you don't look sick. 
ADAM Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick. 
TED (SUSPICIOUS) Huh. 
CUT BACK TO: 
Adam with Susan again... 
SUSAN There's spinach, zucchini, broccoli, kale, cucumbers, green beans, snow peas, seaweed, kiwi, Zucchini, 
ADAM I think you already said zucchini. 
SUSAN (ANNOYED) Zucchini... 
From across the room, Adam and Rachel lock eyes. He gives her a defeated look, as if to say "help me." Rachel gives a sympathetic smile. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Are you paying attention? 
ADAM (caught off guard) Uh huh. 
SUSAN Cause I'm only trying to help save your life. 
From across the room, Rachel laughs at the entire episode, Adam sparks a smile. 
CUT TO: 
Adam is talking with EDDIE. 
EDDIE (SECRETLY) There's this guy on the beach who injects oxygen into your blood. 
ADAM Is that legal? 
EDDIE No, but it's totally safe. 
CUT BACK TO: 
Adam with Susan... 
SUSAN ...Brussel Sprouts, Turnip greens, Asparagus, Celery, Cabbage, Okra, Honeydew Melon, Limes, Green bell peppers, green chiles... 
CUT TO: 
Jenny cries hysterically as Seth consoles her. 
JENNY (CRYING) I can't believe that he has cancer. 
SETH I know, it's crazy. 
JENNY I've seen him every day for the past two years and I've never once made an effort to talk to him. 
SETH Well I'm his best friend, so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him. 
JENNY Oh what does it matter? It's too late. 
Jenny walks away crying. Seth follows after her. 
SETH Wait. It's not too late. 
CUT TO: 
Adam makes himself a drink at the bar. Greg approaches. 
GREG Hey Adam. 
ADAM (less than excited) Hey Greg. 
NEIGHBOR Nice dog. 
Once the neighbor is out of sight- 
ADAM Will you please just finish. 
The dog finally finishes. Adam runs back into the house. After a minute, he realizes he left the dog in the street. He runs back after the dog, scoops him up and then runs back inside. 
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Adam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes. He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins seductively kissing her neck. He slowly moves his hand downwards. Rachel takes Adam's hand, pulls it up, and clasps it tight against her chest. 
RACHEL Hold me. 
ADAM (UNDER BREATH) Mother fucker. 
The two lay silently with Adam's arms wrapped around Rachel's body. A beat. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Do you...want to move in? 
RACHEL Do you want me to? 
ADAM I was thinking it might be nice, now that I'm not going to work anymore. And with my chemo starting... 
Rachel turns to Adam. 
ADAM (CONT'D) You're here all the time anyway. 
RACHEL (SMILES) Okay. 
Rachel kisses Adam and lays her head on his chest. 
ADAM (WHISPERS) You wanna have sex? 
RACHEL (ASLEEP) In the morning. 
EXT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MORNING 
Edith's car whizzes down the street and peels into the Beth Israel Synagogue parking lot. The car comes to an abrupt stop as it parks in the last empty space. 
Edith and Adam step out of the car and walk 20 feet before they realize Art is still in the car. 
EDITH Art come on. 
ART I'm coming. 
Art, still in the car, doesn't move. Edith looks at her watch and walks back to the car. 
EDITH We're late. 
Edith grabs Art's hand. He slowly gets out of the car. 
INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MOMENTS LATER 
Edith, Art and Adam enter into the 600 seat synagogue. The service led by RABBI JACOBS (75) has already begun. 
Edith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner of the first row. Prime seats, but a bitch to get to since the service has begun - getting there would mean wading through a row of two dozen people. The USHER approaches. 
USHER Please take your seats. 
The Usher motions for Edith and company to sit in the back. 
EDITH What about those seats up there in the front? 
USHER The service has begun. 
EDITH Please. My son has cancer. 
Adam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did that. The Usher looks at Adam, sizing up the situation. Adam couldn't be more uncomfortable. 
USHER Please, follow me. 
The usher leads the group to the front and directs the people in the front row to let them pass through. 
Edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let them by. 
EDITH (QUIETLY) Sorry, my son has cancer. 
Adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past. 
ADAM (QUIETLY) Hi. Nice to see you. 
INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE. ATRIUM - LATER 
Edith and Art stand in a crowd of 600 congregants socializing and conversing after the service. ROSE (60) approaches. 
Back on Alan Alda. 
ALAN ALDA (CONT'D) Toward helping yourself begin to feel in control again...On behalf of all the great folks at Mount Sinai Hospital, I'd like to thank you for your time...make it a great day. 
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
A small group of patients, including Adam, have been watching the video. The people in the room applaud, Adam looks around baffled by both the video and the clapping. 
GEORGE, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, enters the room. 
GEORGE Adam Schwartz. 
Adam stands. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Come with me my baby. 
Adam follows George into the elevator where they ride down into the bowel of the hospital: The Cancer Ward. 
Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other various treatment rooms. 
A sick, fat, BALD ELDERLY WOMAN coughs as she passes. Adam winces in disgust. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) This way my baby. 
George leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room. 
INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - LATER 
Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless patients. He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years. Completely overwhelmed, Adam spots A BALD WOMAN sitting quietly knitting. She's at peace with herself. Her Zen like state helps Adam relax. 
Adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for cancer patients until he notices HENRY (50), a very small man sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator. Despite the fact that every breath Henry takes looks like it might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall. Adam looks on in terror. The genial MITCH(85) notices. 
MITCH That's Henry. 
ADAM Is he okay? 
MITCH He's always like that. 
ADAM (TERRIFIED) Is that going to happen to me? 
MITCH Best not worry about these things. 
ALAN (84), the contentious old man sitting next to Mitch chimes in. 
ALAN (TO ADAM) Want a hit? 
Adam looks down to see that Alan is holding a ONE HITTER full of weed. 
MITCH It makes it all a little easier to handle. 
ADAM (PARANOID) What if someone sees us? 
ALAN Don't be such an old man. Look at this place, it's like Death Row in here, they don't give a shit what we do. 
Adam reluctantly takes a hit. 
MITCH How old are you? 
ADAM Twenty-five. 
ALAN You're lucky. Life only gets worse anyway. 
MITCH Alan, stop it. (TO ADAM) Don't listen to him, he's just messing with you. 
ALAN No I'm not. (TO ADAM) It's all downhill from here. Trust me. First your hair's going to fall out, then your balls will shrink. You'll marry a woman, or man, who'll suck every penny out of your savings and then leave you for a fitness instructor in a teal Miata. Then, to top it all off, your kids will one day stop talking to you because their therapist, who you pay for, tells them you're the reason they're so fucked up. 
MITCH You'll have to excuse Alan here, he's going through a rough time. 
ALAN (TO ADAM) I'm just being realistic. You want some advice? 
ADAM Not really. 
ALAN Don't end up a victim like the rest of `em. Life sucks, the earlier you accept it, the better off you'll be. 
ADAM I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better. 
Alan and Mitch laugh. 
ALAN (TO MITCH) I like this kid. (TO ADAM) I'm Alan Liebowitz: stage 4 lymphoma. Pleased to meet you. 
MITCH Mitch Horowitz, metastatic prostate cancer. 
ADAM Adam Schwartz, schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas. 
ALAN What the fuck is that?...Sounds like the greek dish I had for lunch. 
Katie looks at Adam, is he being for real? She's skeptical. 
KATIE I want you to do some homework. Here's a list of books on mind-body therapy. They should help you get started. 
Katie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books scribbled on it. 
WE PUSH IN ON THE LIST OF BOOKS: 
INT. BOOKSTORE. SELF HELP SECTION - DAY 
WE PULL OUT ON THE LIST OF BOOKS: 
Adam and Seth browse through shelves of books. Seth is reading the author's bio from one of the books on Katie's list. 
SETH (IN EXCITEMENT) "Franz Schlegel is an American `medical intuitive' and `mystic psychiatrist'. Schlegel's teachings are widely recognized as a global spiritual awakening that is transcending individual and collective human consciousness"... You're actually going to read this shit? This guy is a fucking tool. 
Seth ditches the New Age book and picks up one on Mardi Gras. 
SETH (CONT'D) Let's go to Mardi Gras! 
ADAM Why would we go to Mardi Gras? 
SETH Because it's Mardi Gras man. It's like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you, screaming to be fucked. It's a fuck fest. 
ADAM I'm getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it. 
SETH We need to go see the world. 
ADAM This isn't my bachelor party we're planning here. 
SETH (FRUSTRATED) Adam you can not let your cancer go to waste. 
Adam takes the book from Seth's hands and puts it down. 
ADAM I'm not going anywhere. 
From across the store, Seth notices, CLAIRE (30), an attractive employee stacking books. 
SETH Well if you're not going to take advantage of your cancer, then I will. 
Seth yanks the list of books from Adam and crosses to Claire. 
SETH (CONT'D) Excuse me. 
CLAIRE Yes, how can I help you? 
SETH I'm looking to buy a few books - 
Seth hands Claire the list of book titles. She reads. 
CLAIRE Oh. (CONCERNED) Are these for...I'm sorry it's none of my business. 
SETH No that's okay. They're for my best friend, Adam. 
Seth nods towards Adam across the room. 
SETH (CONT'D) He's pretty sick. 
Claire shoots Adam a look - the way one looks at a dying puppy. Adam looks on in confusion. 
CLAIRE How awful. 
SETH Yeah. Cancer, not cool. 
CLAIRE Poor guy. 
SETH I know it's been really hard. 
Claire leans in. 
CLAIRE It's bad isn't it? 
SETH Honestly? (FEIGNING SADNESS) Sometimes I just wish it was me instead of him...to relieve some of the burden, you know? I just...I just want to help. 
INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER 
Adam and Seth exit the bookstore. They pass Claire who gives Seth a big smile followed by the "call me" motion. 
ADAM What just happened? 
SETH (TO ADAM) I'll tell you what happened. Cancer happened, and you need to get on the train. 
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY 
Adam and Seth smoke a joint as they watch "Planet Earth" on a brand new 50" flat screen TV. There are a dozen oversized boxes marked "Rachel" scattered throughout the house. 
KATIE (EXCITED) Adam! This is fantastic. 
Adam is slightly taken aback by Katie's response. 
KATIE (CONT'D) You know if you're interested, there are some more advanced forms of therapy that I think could be really useful. 
ADAM Sure, if you think it'll help. 
INT. LAUGHTER THERAPY - DAY 
Adam and Seth are seated in a semi-circle with a half dozen middle aged men and women. At the front of the group is the LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50) - a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard. All eyes are closed except for Seth and Adam's. Adam's hair is noticeably thin. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST Good morning class. Before we begin I'd like to introduce Adam and Seth, our two newest giggle gurus. 
The class laughs. Adam and Seth look around paranoid. 
SETH (quietly to Adam) What are they laughing at? 
ADAM (quietly to Seth) Just go with it. 
Seth and Adam laugh along with the others. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (to Adam and Seth) Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter. (MORE) 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) Learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non- judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. You see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life. 
The Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at Adam and then Seth. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) We don't tell jokes here, we tell the truth - and we laugh at that truth. 
The Laughter Therapist closes his eyes. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) So let us share. Adam, why don't you tell us what brings you here? 
Adam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) We're all friends here in the Laughter Pagoda. 
ADAM I, ah, have cancer. 
The entire class laughs hysterically. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh. Everyone. Beverly, share - 
BEVERLY Yesterday, I confiscated my son's pornography collection and then used it to masturbate 6 times. 
The class laughs. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST Paul, share, 
PAUL My wife told me she's a lesbian. And then left me for my sister. 
The class laughs. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST JIM - 
JIM (GLUM) I owe two men eight grand by Friday. 
The class laughs. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST SETH - 
SETH My best friend is a giant pussy. 
The class laughs. 
ADAM My best friend's favorite band is Abba. 
Everyone laughs except for Seth. 
SETH (DEFENSIVE) When I was 12. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (HYSTERICAL) Abba! Wonderful. I love it. Seth laugh. 
INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
TIME LAPSE: Adam stares at himself in the mirror. His health slowly deteriorates. Hair begins to fall out. His face thins. 
SUPER: JULY 
FADE TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL. HALLWAY - DAY 
Adam, Alan and Mitch sit in the corridor of the Cancer Ward. Adam is wearing a ski hat to cover his balding head. 
Adam is seated in the front seat as Katie drives. The car is filthy - it's littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers, etc. Katie's body is pressed all the way up against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road. 
KATIE Sorry about the mess. 
Adam picks up a copy of "Organizing Your Way to Success," which is lying on the floor. 
ADAM I think you should ask for a refund. 
KATIE I know, I know. What can I say? I'm not good at getting rid of things. I get easily attached. 
ADAM Yeah, I can see. 
Changing the subject. 
KATIE So you don't drive? 
ADAM Nope. 
KATIE But you have a license? 
ADAM Nope. (BEAT) I actually failed my test. 
KATIE No! 
ADAM (EMBARRASSED) It's true. 
KATIE But, I thought you can re-take the test. 
ADAM Eh. Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best I didn't. 
Katie stares at Adam in shock. 
KATIE What did you do? 
ADAM I kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment...Into the Balboa cactus garden. 
KATIE The garden with all the endangered plants? 
ADAM They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane. 
Katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself. 
KATIE I'm sorry. That's terrible. 
Unable to hold back, Katie continues laughing. This is the first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature. 
ADAM (ABRUPT) Stop the car. 
Katie looks at Adam nervously. 
KATIE Why what's wrong? 
ADAM Just stop the car. 
Katie stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of Katie's garbage and gets out. 
KATIE What are you doing? 
ADAM I can't handle all this mess. 
Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more. Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam is cleaning her car. 
KATIE Wait, no, not that, that's my dinner. 
Adam leaves Katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the garbage. He gets back in the car and takes a deep breath. 
ADAM You can drive. 
EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER 
Adam and Katie arrive at Adam's house. 
ADAM Thanks for the ride... 
Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He's really not in the mood to be alone. He looks back at Katie. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Do you want to come in. For a beverage? Or something? 
KATIE It probably wouldn't be very professional of me. 
ADAM Come on, I'll let you analyze my Id. 
Katie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that Adam is more than a patient. 
KATIE Uh, okay. But I can't stay long. 
ADAM Is it all gone? 
For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is. Adam opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him. They lock eyes for a moment. Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look. 
Suddenly, Rachel walks through the front door. 
RACHEL (O.C.) Adam? 
Feeling a little foolish, Katie motions to leave. 
KATIE I should probably be going. 
Rachel enters the kitchen. 
RACHEL Adam? 
ADAM Finally. Where have you been? 
RACHEL (MAD) I hope I'm not interrupting. 
ADAM Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my therapist. 
RACHEL (SUSPICIOUS) This is your therapist? 
KATIE Please, call me Katie. 
RACHEL (SUSPICIOUS) OK. Katie. What are you doing here? 
ADAM She drove me home. Ring a bell? 
RACHEL Ugh. Shit. (SWEET/NERVOUS) Thank you so much for doing that. Life's been a little crazy lately, which I'm sure Adam has told you all about. I love those shoes. 
KATIE Thanks... 
Awkward silence. The tension is thick. 
KATIE (CONT'D) I'm going to go. I'll see you at our next session Adam. 
Katie leaves. 
ADAM Where have you been? 
RACHEL I was at the gallery. 
ADAM (PISSED) You were supposed to pick me up. 8 hours ago. 
RACHEL I know. I'm sorry. I totally spaced. With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place. (off Adam's look) (MORE) 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Don't look at me like that. You know this is a hard time for me. 
ADAM You're right. Let me go back and talk to the doctor - see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs. 
RACHEL (DEFENSIVE) I'm not just some car service here to shuttle you around! 
ADAM And my house isn't a summer camp. You can't just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility. 
RACHEL And what is it that I'm not taking responsibility for? 
ADAM This. Us. 
RACHEL I can't handle this! You make it sound like I'm your wife. 
ADAM You know what I thought the other day? That I might actually die without ever having sex again. 
RACHEL I'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on. 
Rachel begins to cry. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) You think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this? The past few months have been hard on me too. It's not always about you. 
ADAM (RELENTS) I know. 
Adam tenderly wraps his arms around Rachel. 
A beat. 
RACHEL Why are you so good? 
ADAM You're my Yam. 
INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME NIGHT 
Rachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed. She slowly moves her index finger along Adam's arm and then seductively kisses his neck. Adam firmly grabs hold of Rachel and the two begin to go through the motions. Clothes come off. Adam gets on top of Rachel...And then stops. 
RACHEL What's wrong? 
INT. HOSPITAL. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Adam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling. There is total silence. 
KATIE You're being awfully quiet today. Is everything okay? 
ADAM I'm going to die aren't I? 
KATIE What are you talking about? 
ADAM It's true. 
KATIE We don't know that. 
Adam sits up and looks at Katie. 
ADAM I'm not getting any better. 
KATIE Don't say that, you're doing so well. 
ADAM Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think I'm going to live? 
KATIE (TOTALLY BAFFLED) What are you talking about? 
ADAM Cancer is an epidemic! It killed Alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me. There's nothing anybody can do. 
KATIE This is really good Adam. Let it out. 
ADAM Will you stop! (BEAT) I can't do this anymore. It doesn't matter. None of it. I'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life. 100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer. That's it. 
KATIE This helplessness you're feeling is normal. These emotions you're holding onto are what make you human. But it doesn't mean you can just stop living your life. (BEAT) Look at how you've grown over the past few months, you can't just throw it all away...Talk to me. 
ADAM I know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore. (BEAT) I'm sorry. 
Adam leaves. Katie is left feeling as though she failed. 
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
Adam lies on the bed of an MRI machine. His body is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner. 
INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - MORNING 
TIME LAPSE: Adam's stares at himself in the mirror. His health deteriorates even more. 
SUPER: NOVEMBER 
Looking at himself in the mirror, Adam takes note of his hollow cheeks and worn eyes. He looks awful, like an old man. There isn't any youth left. He's not getting any better, and he knows it. 
Noticing a few renegade hairs sticking up, Adam pulls out a lint brush and combs his head. 
Rachel enters and steps up on the scale. She examines herself in the mirror. 
ADAM I need a new lint brush. 
RACHEL Okay, I'll pick one up. 
ADAM And I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday...The big one. 
Rachel continues to examines her waist. 
RACHEL Am I getting fat? 
Adam stares at Rachel. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) What? 
ADAM Are you listening to me? 
RACHEL (ANNOYED) Yes. 
ADAM So you'll take me? 
RACHEL Of course. 
Rachel leaves. In frustration Adam weakly picks up the scale and throws it against the wall, smashing it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Adam sits alone in his empty house. It's a mess. He looks unhinged. 
He slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches Matlock on his flat screen TV, which has been moved to the floor to make room for Rachel's painting. 
Adam flips the channel to Martha Stewart, then to I Love Lucy, then to General Hospital, then to Body Building on ESPN. He turns the TV off. He's bored. 
ADAM Could be worse. Right? 
Phil notices the Pompeii exhibit. 
PHIL (STARTLED) Jesus! 
Phil feels terrible about what he's going to say next. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Listen Adam...I don't know how to say this... 
Phil places a comforting hand on Adam's shoulder. 
ADAM Don't worry...I get it. You're a good guy. 
PHIL Come back when you're better. You know you'll always have a home here. 
INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER 
Distraught, Adam walks down the Hall of Evolution. Slouched in defeat, he passes the various dioramas depicting human evolution. He begins at MODERN HUMANS and walks backwards in time. 
He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man. He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles match. He continues down the hall towards the exit. 
EXT. SAN DIEGO BOARDWALK - AFTERNOON 
Adam walks along the boardwalk. He's surrounded by perfection. The beach. The water. The blue sky. Hundreds of beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging, biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc. He looks like a raisin among grapes. 
EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY 
Adam stands impatiently on his porch. He looks at his watch and then dials his phone. 
RACHEL (V.O.) Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important. I'll give you a call when I'm done...yay! 
Adam's face is red with fury. He does his best to hold back. 
ADAM (SWEET) Hey, it's Adam. Where are you? Maybe you forgot, but my appointment is today. So call me back. 
Enraged, Adam hangs up. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Fuck! 
Adam picks up his phone and dials again. 
SETH (V.O.) Yoooooo. 
ADAM Hey man, I need you to do me - 
SETH (V.O.) Not around. Leave a message. 
Adam hangs up and dials again. 
EDITH (O.S.) (YELLING) Hello, 
Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of regret runs through his body. 
ADAM Hi mom. 
INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER 
Edith, Art and Adam sit in the exam room, each reading their respective magazines - minus Art who is lost somewhere in his own world. The tension is thick. Edith looks at her watch and shivers. There's a knock at the door. A CUTE NURSE enters. 
CUTE NURSE The Doctor wanted me to apologize for running late, he's just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes. You guys holding up alright? 
EDITH It's very cold in here. Is there anyway you can turn down the Air Conditioning? 
CUTE NURSE Unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat. 
EDITH My son has cancer. 
CUTE NURSE (FEELS BAD) I'm sorry, really, if I could I would, but there's nothing I can do. 
Adam's pissed that his mother has just involved him. 
ADAM (smiles to the Nurse) Don't worry about it. (Scowls at Edith) I'm fine. 
CUTE NURSE Are you sure? I could get you a blanket. 
ADAM No, really, I'm okay. But thank you. 
EDITH I'd love a blanket. 
ADAM (to the Cute Nurse) We're fine. 
CUTE NURSE Okay, but you let me know if you need anything. 
The Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back. The Cute Nurse exits. 
ADAM But you said surgery was too risky. 
DR. ROSS We're out of options. 
Tears roll down Edith's cheek. Adam grabs hold of her hand. 
EDITH But he's going to be okay, right? You're going to fix it. 
Dr. Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother. 
DR. ROSS This surgery is no guarantee. The risks are tremendous. And, even if we're able to remove the tumor there's still the chance that Adam, you'll never be able to walk again. 
Adam looks at his mother. He firmly grabs hold of her hand. 
ADAM Does that mean...I can get handicap parking? 
Adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across Edith's face. 
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Distraught and emotionally worn, Adam enters to discover the smell of a home cooked meal. He walks through the house. 
INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
He stands in the doorway of the kitchen staring at Rachel cooking. Rachel turns around. She's in high spirits. 
RACHEL Hey you. 
Rachel gleefully skips over and gives Adam a sweet kiss on the cheek. 
ADAM Smells good. 
RACHEL The girls and I are having a movie night. I somehow got suckered into cooking. (off Adam's look) Don't worry I left you some. 
Adam feigns a smile, hiding the pain of his heart breaking in a thousand pieces. 
Suddenly Rachel's iPhone VIBRATES. She picks it up, and reads her text message. Her face lights up as she reads. She quickly types a reply. 
ADAM (SUSPICIOUS) Who's that? 
RACHEL Susan. She wants to know what time I'm coming over. 
ADAM (even more suspicious) That's what she just texted? (MORE) 
ADAM (CONT'D) She wants to know what time you're going over to her house? 
Rachel puts the phone down on the counter and returns to her cooking. 
RACHEL Uh huh. 
ADAM Alright, well I'm gonna go lie down. 
RACHEL I might be out late so don't wait up. 
Adam walks to the bedroom. After a beat he moves back to the doorway and pops his head around the corner. He quietly watches Rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room. 
He stealthily steps into the kitchen, picks Rachel's iPhone off the counter and scrolls through her text messages. 
ADAM (TO SELF) What the fuck? 
Rachel enters the kitchen. 
RACHEL What are you doing? 
ADAM Who's James? 
RACHEL My art partner. 
ADAM (re: text message) He wants to know if you're still coming over tonight. Should I tell him you're having a girls night? (CONTINUES READING) Oh wait, you already told him to bring the wine. (LOOKS UP) That's funny. It seems as though you've double booked yourself. 
RACHEL I can't believe you just invaded my privacy like that. 
ADAM (READING PHONE) Oh, you just got another text from him. He says "Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted... 
Rachel reaches for the phone. Adam pulls away. 
RACHEL (FUMING) Give me back my phone. 
ADAM (READING) "Hope you're not too sore from this afternoon." (A BEAT) He seems sweet. 
RACHEL Adam, it's not what you think. 
ADAM Well now how do you know what I'm thinking? 
RACHEL Don't be like that. I didn't do anything wrong. 
SETH Jen giving me a blow job? 
ADAM No, prom night. It feels like a lifetime ago... I know it happened, but that's it. It's like someone else's memory. 
Adam stares out at the ocean. Reality check. 
SETH You okay? 
Adam throws his beer bottle into the ocean. 
ADAM I can't believe this is all actually happening. 
SETH The girl or the cancer? 
ADAM Both. 
SETH It's some pretty fucked up shit. 
ADAM You know, I used to think that I was actually going to spend the rest of my life with Rachel...granted that might not be so far off. (shakes his head) What a waste. 
Seth puts his arm around him. 
SETH We need to get you laid. 
ADAM (ANNOYED) Don't you ever give up? 
SETH No. 
ADAM Seriously, who's going to have sex with me? 
SETH Some girls are into it? 
ADAM I look like Powder. (BEAT) Plus I have erectile dysfunction...temporary. I hope. 
SETH Then let's go get me laid. 
Seth stands, and then stumbles. He's really drunk. 
ADAM I think I should drive. 
SETH You don't have a license. 
ADAM You're drunk. 
SETH Do you even know how to drive? 
ADAM How hard can it be? 
SETH Hard enough that you don't have a license. 
ADAM (SOMBER) This might be my last chance. 
SETH Driving! You care about driving! We could be on Everest getting high on Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you want to drive!...Forget it, I give up. Drive. 
The two get off the boat and climb into Seth's car. 
Adam puts the key in the ignition. Without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the car slams into a giant statue of Neptune riding a sea horse. 
SETH (CONT'D) Hey Miss Daisy, will you please watch where your going? 
ADAM What? I didn't see it. 
SETH That's what the mirrors are for. 
Adam pulls out of the parking lot. 
SETH (CONT'D) Turn right. 
ADAM I know what I'm doing. 
Adam turns left onto a one way street. It's the wrong way. 
SETH Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY! 
An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only nearly avoiding a head on collision. 
SETH (CONT'D) Adam! Turn the car around. 
ADAM No. I'm driving and I want to go this way. 
Another car swerves out of the way. 
SETH What the fuck is wrong with you? 
ADAM For once can you just shut up and let me do this? So I'm driving the wrong way? Big fucking deal. 
ADAM (COY) That's what you think. 
Suddenly Adam passes out. His head slams into the steering wheel. The Horn blares. 
KATIE Adam? Adam? Adam? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Seth and Adam stagger into the building. 
INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Adam and Seth enter the dingy studio apartment - it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. Adam scoops up some dust with his finger. 
Seth is unusually quiet. Both guys are being distant. Seth pulls down the Murphy Bed and the two awkwardly avoid eye contact as they undress. Adam climbs into bed. He notices a book called "Coping with Your Loved One's Cancer" on Seth's bedside table. The book is worn and has multiple book marks - indicating it's been read. Adam looks at Seth, he had him pegged all wrong. 
Seth claps his hands. The lights turn off. 
ADAM Good night. 
SETH Night. 
Lying in bed, Adam hears a strange noise, he tilts his head to the side to see Seth breathing heavily and staring at him. 
ADAM (UNCOMFORTABLE) What are you doing? 
SETH Watching you sleep. 
ADAM It's a little creepy. 
SETH I know. I can't help it. 
Seth lays back on his pillow and holds onto Adam's hand. They both stare up at the ceiling - terrified about the future. 
EXT. FOX MEADOW GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY 
Seth's car enters the Mall parking lot and parks. 
VOICE MALL OPERATOR (V.O.) You have 2 new messages. First message. 
A beep. 
RICHARD MATHESSON (V.O.) Hi Adam, this is Richard Mathesson, your family's estate lawyer. Your mother asked me to call. We need to talk about potential, ah, well just call me, there are some potential arrangements we need to work out. 
INT. MEN'S WEARHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Adam and Seth browse through racks of mens suits. Adam comes upon one he likes. The SALES CLERK approaches. 
SALES CLERK Sir can I help you with anything today? 
ADAM (holds up suit) You think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral? 
SALES CLERK No, what you want is on level 3. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. REDWOOD FUNERAL HOME/CEMETERY - SAME DAY 
Seth's car drives up the long driveway of the Cemetery. 
VOICE MAIL OPERATOR (V.O.) Next message. 
A beep. 
DR. ROSS (V.O.) Adam, this is Dr. Ross. Good news, I was able to expedite the wait for your surgery. Your scheduled for tomorrow morning at 7:00 am with Dr. Lamb. Please call my office if you have any questions. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME/CEMETERY - LATER 
A MORTICIAN, stout and dignified, with a slight British accent leads Adam and Seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds. 
MORTICIAN Here at Linden we're more than just a stopping ground for the deceased. We understand that life is different for everyone, and helping families to see their loved ones off to the hereafter means approaching every funeral and burial with it's own dignity and care...A funeral is a representation of the individuals time spent on earth, so I ask you to reflect on your inevitable interment and think carefully in choosing the service and tomb that best befits you. 
SETH What about a Viking funeral? 
MORTICIAN (INTRIGUED) I'm not familiar. 
SETH (talking out of his ass) You know, we put him on a boat... cover it with...dirt and...branches...whatever you can find. We push it out...into the sea...or the ocean...and then shoot flaming arrows, boom! It catches on fire...And that's it. It's awesome. 
The Mortician stops and looks at Seth. He's not even going to dignify Seth with a reply. A beat. 
MORTICIAN (points to grave plot) Here you are, the Schwartz family plot. 
Adam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones. Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his parents are to go. Adam and Seth stare at the graves as we: 
ADAM They're great, thank you. 
Katie sits on the bed next to Adam. 
KATIE So how you doing? 
ADAM I'm a little freaked out. 
A small GERMAN ANESTHESIOLOGIST enters. There is something incredibly unsettling about her thick accent. 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST Hello Adam, I am the Anesthesiologist. I will give you shot to make you sleep. 
Adam holds Katie's hand. 
ADAM Will you be here when I wake up? 
KATIE I'm not going anywhere. 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST Now relax, this will take a few minutes to feel the effect. 
The Anesthesiologist injects the drugs into Adam's IV. 
ADAM (TERRIFIED) About how long? 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST Relax, you will soon begin the sleeping. 
ADAM Well what if it doesn't work. How do you know I won't wake in the middle of the surgery? What if I- 
Just like that, Adam's out cold. 
INT. HOSPITAL SURGICAL AMPHITHEATER - LATER 
Adam is face down on the operating table. Two Neurosurgeons, Dr. Lamb and DR. HENRY are in mid surgery. Alongside the two doctors are Nurse Wong and NURSE SCOTT. 
DR. HENRY I'm telling you Sir Francis Drake was a Buccaneer. 
DR. LAMB No he was a privateer. 
NURSE SCOTT I thought he was a pirate. 
DR. LAMB A pirate works for no one but himself. A privateer has a mandate from a government. 
DR. HENRY I thought that was a buccaneer. 
DR. LAMB No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned pirate. 
DR. HENRY Then what's a mercenary? 
DR. LAMB (FRUSTRATED) Nurse Wong. Will you Google it? 
Standing to the side of the operating table is the group of Med Students from earlier. They're still taking notes. 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Edith, Art and Seth sit impatiently watching the clock. Katie paces up and down the hall. Hours go by. Time can't seem to go by quick enough. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER 
Dr. Lamb finds Edith, Katie and Seth in the waiting room. 
DR. LAMB We were successful in the extraction of the tumor. However, as you can imagine, with something of this magnitude...there were some unforeseen complications. The bone corrosion was much greater than initially anticipated. We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis, as well as most of the psoas muscle. We also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve, the damage to that nerve is considerable, which is going to hinder his ability to walk...He's in stable condition right now, but it's touch and go. 
INT. HOSPITAL ICU - MOMENTS LATER 
Adam's in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery. A NURSE comes in to change his IV. Adam slowly awakens. He is high on morphine. He stares, mesmerized by the nurse. 
ADAM That is the most beautiful dresses. Where did you get it? 
Dr. Lamb enters. 
DR. LAMB Adam, I see you're awake. 
ADAM I'm here. 
DR. LAMB How are you feeling? 
ADAM I feel wonderful. 
DR. LAMB That would be the morphine. 
Dr. Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine drip and sticks it in Adam's hand. 
DR. LAMB (CONT'D) I want you to push this little button any time you feel pain. It'll trigger the morphine. You think you can do that?

CARRIE Except for the closet which Big says he can redo -- also he says the kitchen needs work but I don't know about that `cause I keep sweaters in my stove. 
Carrie and Charlotte laugh. 
MIRANDA So, he bought it -- and you're going to live there with him? 
CARRIE Yes, together. That's right. 
MIRANDA But he'll own it. So. You are keeping your own place, right? 
CARRIE Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure I'll figure out something I'm comfortable with. 
MIRANDA I just want to make sure you're being smart here -- 
CARRIE And I love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel. Jealous. 
Miranda smiles. Carrie puts her arm around her. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan. 
MIRANDA Fine. I'm jealous. You're in real estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn. 
CHARLOTTE New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan. 
MIRANDA Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn. 
CARRIE There she is. Hey Hollywood! 
Samantha is standing out in front of Christies. She waves to them -- as she finishes a call. 
SAMANTHA (on phone) Samantha Jones... Smith Jerrod's manager -- I'm in New York `till Monday. 
She hangs up; as they reach her. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) How was your flight? 
SAMANTHA Fabulous. Let's go in -- I am so excited! 
18   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/LOBBY -- DAY -- MOMENTS LATER 8 
A lobby bustling with NEW YORK WOMEN. All types. Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda make their way through them. 
CARRIE (V.O.) It was a rare occasion that brought all types of women together. The socialites, the trendies the yuppies, the yentas. 
The girls gently move past by an elderly YENTA, who reacts. 
YENTA Why the pushing? 
9A. 
18A   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE -- LATER                    18A 
Carrie and the girls enter a room filled with dramatically lit jewelry cases that display amazing jewelry. On the walls around the gallery are large photos of a BEAUTIFUL RAVEN HAIRED WOMAN (45). She is captured in candid poses "out and about" New York city at various social events wearing the jewelry on display. 
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Blair Elkenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaire's girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street. 
Samantha, Carrie and Charlotte page through the catalogues as they walk. Miranda types on her Blackberry. 
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And now she was getting the ultimate break-up revenge. An embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy. 
The girls stop. Floating in a case at their eye level is a unique, "two finger" FLOWER RING made out of diamonds. 
SAMANTHA There it is. My baby. 
CARRIE/BIG And she's a beauty. 
SAMANTHA When I saw this in the catalogue I said to Smith: This flower ring is the essence of me. One of a kind, filled with fire... 
CARRIE And a little too much. 
SAMANTHA Exactly. Come on. Let's go spend some of my hard-earned Hollywood money. 
They make their way to the auction room. 
MIRANDA Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's series? Is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon? 
SAMANTHA He sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital. 
MIRANDA Great. Can't wait. 
CHARLOTTE Don't you ever get weirded out by seeing Smith in bed with all those other women? 
SAMANTHA No, I think it's hot. Sometimes, when I'm alone, I masturbate right along with them. 
CARRIE And people say the golden age of television is over. 
SAMANTHA Besides, it's fake sex. When they're doing it -- no one's actually turned on. 
MIRANDA Kinda like Steve and I. 
Miranda laughs. Everyone looks. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I'm kidding. (Beat; then) But come one-- it's been seven years. He does that, I do this... It's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up. 
19   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/AUCTION ROOM -- LATER        19 
A DISTINGUISHED WOMAN AUCTIONEER is at a podium. 
AUCTIONEER Next item. The flower ring. 
Samantha sits up, ready. An electric buzz moves through the crowd. 
CARRIE (V.O.) If Schadenfreude is the word for feeling pleasure at someone else misfortune -- This was "jewelryfreude." 
AUCTIONEER Let's start the bidding at ten thousand. 
Samantha raises her number. The Auctioneer nods. 
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Thank you madame. Do I hear fifteen? 
A WOMAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT (40) on a phone, raises her number. Samantha looks over at her. 
SAMANTHA Bitch. 
CARRIE And the gloves are off. 
AUCTIONEER Do I hear twenty? 
Samantha raises her number. 
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Twenty. Do I hear twenty-five? 
The Woman raises her number. 
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Twenty-five. Thirty? 
Samantha raises her number. Carrie's eyes widen. 
16A. 
BIG Deal. 
He puts out his hand. She takes it and they shake. 
BIG (CONT'D) But... You gotta do better on that corn. Look at all the stuff left on there. 
She looks down at her corn, he's right. She nods. 
22   INT. MODERN RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SUMMER                      22 
Crowded; serious lunch crowd. Carrie sits across from Charlotte and Miranda. Miranda is in a work suit. 
CARRIE So, the other night, Big and I were talking about, you know, moving in together and our future... 
Charlotte's eyes are getting wider and wider. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) ... And about what makes sense as we move forward. And, well... we decided to get married. 
Charlottes SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Carrie and Miranda and the ENTIRE RESTAURANT REACT. 
MIRANDA ... and I'm deaf. 
CARRIE Everyone's looking 
Charlotte looks around at the DISGRUNTLED FACES. She half- stands and address the DINERS looking at her. 
CHARLOTTE Sorry! I'm sorry... but my friend here, just got engaged and she's been going out with the man for ten years. 
The DINERS bursts into APPLAUSE. Carrie slumps in her chair, pulls up her sweater collar, turns to Miranda. 
CARRIE I am mortified. 
MIRANDA There is literally a ringing in my ear. 
23   INT. SAMANTHA JONES MANAGEMENT -- DAY                        23 
A large PHOTO of Smith. Samantha walks past it and up a sleek, modern office building stairway. Her cell rings. 
SAMANTHA Samantha Jones-- 
24   INT. FENDI -- LATER -- SUMMER                               24 
Intercut with Carrie walking through the upscale boutique talking on her pink Swarovski crystal-covered cell phone. 
CARRIE Well... I made a little decision that I hope you'll be happy about. 
SAMANTHA Oh, honey... you finally got Botox. 
CARRIE No. I did not get Botox 
SAMANTHA I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll love it. 
CARRIE I did not call to talk about Botox. 
SAMANTHA I'm just saying. 
Samantha reaches the top of the stairs. Blow-ups of Smith on various magazine covers line the walls of the chic, small office space. 
CARRIE So... Last week, after the auction, I started thinking about my options. 
SAMANTHA Right. 
CARRIE Right, and... well, Big and I decided to get married. 
SAMANTHA Really? 
CARRIE Yes. 
SAMANTHA That's great. 
CARRIE You sounded more excited about the botox. 
SAMANTHA Well, honey -- I am excited for you but -- you know me... I don't really believe in marriage.... Botox on the other hand -- That works every time. 
A RECEPTIONIST (23) hands her some messages. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Honey, I've got to go. The People magazine person is on hold. Smith's on the short list to be their "Sexiest Man Alive." We can catch up when I'm in town next week. 
Samantha hangs up. Carrie looks at her phone: dismissed and disappointed. She closes it and walks on. 
25   INT. FENDI -- A LITTLE LATER                               25 
Carrie rounds a corner. Her phone rings. 
CARRIE Hello? 
26   INT. SAMANTHA JONES MANAGEMENT -- CONTINUOUS               26 
Intercut with Samantha standing in her office. 
SAMANTHA I think I was in shock. I mean, it's you getting married. This is not some random person -- it's you. 
CARRIE I hear ya. 
SAMANTHA And I guess, I thought that after that big mess with Aidan -- you'd never want to get married. 
CARRIE I know. 
19A. 
SAMANTHA So, I put you in my "we're never getting married" file. Now, I've got to take you out of that file. 
CARRIE Sorry about the extra paper work. 
SAMANTHA You'll get my bill. 
CARRIE Samantha, it feels so different this time. No clich√© romantic kneeling down on one knee. Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together. 
SAMANTHA Well, I'm happy for you. 
CARRIE And one more thing... I want you to be maid of honor. How do you feel about that? 
SAMANTHA The same way you feel about Botox. Painful and unnecessary. 
Carrie laughs. Samantha shrugs. 
27   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SUMMER                   27 
Carrie and Charlotte sit on her bed looking through a list of names. ANTHONY sits at her makeup vanity. He has a large notebook open in front of him. 
CHARLOTTE 74, 75, 76.... Seventy-six guests. 
ANTHONY Seventy five sounds better. "A small, wedding of seventy five guests." 
Carrie looks at the list. 
24A. 
SAMANTHA If I knew the girl talk was going to be on "lock down," I wouldn't have flown two thousand miles. 
CHARLOTTE No, we can talk, let's just not use that word. 
MIRANDA She's three, she doesn't know what it means. I'm forty- two and I still don't know what it means. 
CHARLOTTE I know, but she's repeating everything. 
MIRANDA Fine. How often do you guys... 
CARRIE ... "Color"? 
CHARLOTTE Thank-you. 
SAMANTHA Well, I can't color enough. I would color all day -- every day if I had my way. I'd use every crayon in my box. 
CARRIE We get it. You love to color. (To Miranda) Why are you asking? 
MIRANDA Steve and I were "coloring" last night and just as I was about to -- 
Miranda is searching for a word she can use. 
SAMANTHA Come? (beat; to Charlotte) Sorry -- there is no crayon equivalent. 
MIRANDA He wanted to change positions and I said... "Let's just get it over with." 
The ladies react, three different shades of shocked. 
25A. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Well, he kept trying to make it last longer. 
SAMANTHA And this is bad? 
MIRANDA It is when you have a full-time job. 
SAMANTHA I have a full-time job. 
MIRANDA Well, you don't also have a five year old and play groups and PTA and a mother-in-law in a rest home with advancing Alzheimer's. I'm telling you, at the end of the day all I want to do is sleep. The most exciting thing in bed now -- is the bed. 
CARRIE So... Sleep is the new sex? 
LILY Sex. 
CHARLOTTE See. 
CARRIE -- I meant coloring. 
MIRANDA We're just going through a no coloring phase -- it comes and goes, right? 
CHARLOTTE Every couple is different. Harry and I -- 
Carrie and Samantha look over; interested. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) ... Make love two or three times a week. 
MIRANDA Great. Now I feel worse. 
SAMANTHA Well, when was the last time for you? 
MIRANDA Six months ago. 
CARRIE Oh my. 
Miranda looks at her. She -- continues to color. 
MIRANDA But that's a dry spell. 
SAMANTHA I bet it is. 
CHARLOTTE What about you and Big, Carrie? (Off her look) Come on, I told. 
CARRIE Never. But, I will tell you this. When Big colors -- (Beat; sexy) He rarely stays inside the lines. 
Samantha whoops. Carrie resumes coloring. 
MIRANDA Well, this was very helpful. 
30A   INT. BEACHOUSE/BATHROOM -- SUNSET -- SUMMER               30A 
A freshly-showered Samantha sits on a chaise lounge in a robe -- talking on the phone. 
SAMANTHA Send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address. 
Smith walks up to Samantha wearing only underwear. There is a huge bulge in the front. Samantha takes the bulge in. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) (into phone) I've got to go. Something just came up. 
She hangs up. He smiles, looks down at her. 
SMITH I've got a gift for you. 
SAMANTHA So far, I like it. 
27A. 
He smiles as she reaches INTO his underwear basket and removes a long black velvet jewelry case. She opens it. It's the petal ring from the auction. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) How did -- Wait -- that was you on the phone at the auction? 
SMITH I knew how much you wanted it. 
SAMANTHA But I was going to buy it for myself. 
SMITH I wanted to give it to you... for our anniversary. We met five years ago today. 
SAMANTHA (beat; had no idea) Right. 
He smiles, sits down on the bed. 
SMITH Do you like it? 
SAMANTHA To be clear -- This is a ring with diamonds -- not a diamond ring, right? (Off his nod) In that case... I love it. (Re; underwear) It's my second favorite thing I've ever found in there. 
She kisses him, touched -- then reaches in his underwear. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Now, my gift's a little bit more... oral. 
SMITH Babe -- I've got to go to bed. 
SAMANTHA Bed? It's seven-thirty. 
27B. 
SMITH I have to be at the studio by six A.M. and I need to get a workout before that. 
Carrie LAUGHS as he continues to massacre the high notes.

Carrie and Big sit at the bar -- having dinner. 
CARRIE I've been thinking. 
BIG Again? 
CARRIE How about we get married at The New York Public Library? (Gushy and silly) Think how perfect. You and I and our love story surrounded by all the other lesser love stories. 
BIG Do we have to make that big of a deal? 
CARRIE It's not that big a deal. It's seventy-five people in a room that's partitioned in half. 
BIG It's just -- I've already had two big weddings. 
Carrie winces -- stung. After a beat, she goes on. 
CARRIE Well, what did you have in mind? 
BIG I don't know -- a judge, couple friends and then we go for ham and eggs after. 
A bucket of cold water. 
CARRIE Interesting. 
Big looks over at her. She looks upset, hurt, sad. Silence. 
BIG Would we have to whisper? In the library? 
Carrie looks over at him, softens a little. 
BIG (CONT'D) "Do you, Carrie" -- Shhhh. "Take this man" -- SHHHH! 
He raises his eyebrow. She laughs. ELAINE (40) Zaftig, Jewish -- spots Carrie. 
ELAINE Carrie, hi! 
CARRIE Elaine, hi. Do you know John? 
ELAINE No, hi. Nice to meet you. 
CARRIE Elaine writes a single gal column for The New York Post. 
ELAINE Please -- I'd rather you reveal my weight. 
Carrie and Big laugh. 
ELAINE (CONT'D)V.O.) So, what's new? 
CARRIE Well. We're getting married. 
BIG Yep -- At the New York Public Library. 
Carrie looks at Big, touched. Elaine is delighted, TEARFUL. 
ELAINE Oh, my God! This gives me such hope. 
She hugs Carrie, then hugs Big. Then hugs Big again. 
ELAINE (CONT'D) Thank-you. Thank-you for marrying someone our age. 
37   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/DINING ROOM -- DAY -- SUMMER     37

CARRIE Oh, I know who.

Carrie is walking down the street with STANFORD. 
CARRIE (V.O.) Later that day, I met my friend Stanford for our weekly quick lunch and gossip session... Also known as "dish then dash." 
33A. 
STANFORD According to a certain trashy tome, you are marrying John James Preston. 
CARRIE Rumor has it. 
STANFORD Just one question: Does Big know? 
CARRIE (laughs; then) Where are we eating? 
STANFORD Anywhere you like... and you know the rule -- the person on Page Six pays for lunch. 
Carrie laughs. TWO WOMEN spot her and scream.   She and Stanford REACT as the women GUSH. 
40   INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER -- SUMMER                            40 
Carrie and Stanford are mid-meal. Three GAY MALE friends (3O- 40) stand at their table and gush. 
CARRIE (V.O.) It seemed everywhere I went... people I knew were excited and available to come to the wedding. 
Charlotte and Stanford are looking at Carrie, moved. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) A confection so special... 
Samantha reaches up and wipes away a tear. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) ... It could wring a wedding tear from even the most unbelieving of women.

45      INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/CLOSET -- LATER -- SUMMER            45 
Carrie peeks around the closet and looks in. The gown is hanging next to the white suit, dwarfing it.

BIG Okay. Open them. 
Carrie opens her eyes. 
CARRIE Double door. So far so good. 
She opens the closet doors, revealing a beautiful oversized, walk-in closet with shelves and more shelves and places for shoes and more shoes. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Well. You did me proud, Mister. 
BIG Like it? 
CARRIE Like it? It's love at first sight. 
He smiles, proud. She takes the DESIGNER shoe box out of her shopping bag and hands it to him. She opens the lid, takes out a pair of COLORFUL/FUN HEELS and places them on the shelf. She turns back to him. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Now, I believe this is all really happening.

The door buzzes. Carrie pushes the intercom button. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) That's the food -- money on the table. (Beat) I'll get started in the closet... I should be done in seventeen years. 
Carrie starts into the bathroom. Charlotte calls:

SAMANTHA It's a little quick to move out, don't you think? 
SMITH Her reaction is her reaction. Thanks Anaka. 
Anaka nods and walks away. 
SAMANTHA He had sex once. Not even an affair. 
SMITH Maybe it's not the sex. Maybe, it's the cheating. For me... that would be the thing. That it happened behind my back. 
SAMANTHA That's what she said. 
He nods. Samantha eats. Thinks. 
SMITH Look. I know we're not married but - - if you were going to have sex with someone else... 
Long pause. He looks at her. 
SAMANTHA Are you waiting for me to get out my datebook? 
46B. 
SMITH (beat; then) But... seriously, I'd rather know first. 
She gets up from the table and moves over to him. 
SAMANTHA You want me to tell you if I'm going to have sex? Fine. I'm about to have sex. 
She sits on the table directly in front of him and opens her legs. Anaka enters -- sees her position, spins on his heels and walks back out.

MIRANDA (CONT'D) Well -- we've had some marriage problems -- it's not necessary to go into the details but -- I just wanted you to know that we won't be coming to see you together anymore. I'll be here Monday, Wednesday and Sunday -- the other days will be Steve.

The room is crowded with Carrie's boxes waiting to be moved. Big is sitting at a computer reading his emails. 
Close on screen: We see his email address is John@JJPny.com. He clicks open a file as Carrie enters. 
CARRIE Wedding crunch time. We need to really get serious here. 
BIG Not now -- I just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and I have to -- 
CARRIE Nope. Wedding before contractor. Unless you're planning to invite him -- which would make the guest list two hundred and one. 
BIG Two hundred? Jesus, Carrie -- it's gone up again? 
CARRIE Blame the New York Post and Vogue. Two publications that have never before been uttered in the same sentence. 
BIG You said: seventy-five people in a partitioned-off room. 
CARRIE It's the dress. How can I explain this? It's like poker -- The dress upped the ante. 
BIG Change the dress. 
CARRIE No, no, no -- you haven't seen this dress. This dress may be the whole reason to get married. Well, you and the dress. 
She sits in his lap. He adjusts, uncomfortable. 
CARRIE(CONT'D) How are you coming with your vows? Just a reminder -- you are going to be saying these in front of a lot of people, so the pressure is on. 
BIG (He's had it) Up, up. I have to finish this. Up. 
He sort of "helps her" out of his lap. 
CARRIE Hey... 
BIG I don't have time for this. 
CARRIE This is our wedding and you're not taking it seriously. 
BIG No, I'm not -- It's a circus! Two hundred people -- Page Six -- This is my third marriage -- how do you think it makes me look? 
Carrie looks at him, stunned by this new information. 
CARRIE I didn't know that was even an issue. (beat) Why didn't you say anything sooner? 
BIG You wanted all this. 
CARRIE But -- don't you want -- 
BIG I want you, Carrie. That's what I want. I would have just gone down to city hall. 
Tension. He starts out of the room, moving a wardrobe box out of his way as he goes. She stands there. Upset. 
63   INT. BIG'S SUBLET/BATHROOM -- LATER                        63 
Big is brushing his teeth. There's a knock. The door opens. Carrie comes in, vulnerable. 
CARRIE I think it's too late for city hall now. 
BIG Well, no. I wasn't suggesting -- I was just saying. 
He looks at her. She looks -- devastated. 
BIG (CONT'D) See. That is the face I've been trying to avoid. Come here. 
She stands there. He goes to her, hugs her. 
CARRIE You're a great man friend. 
She buries her head in his chest; relieved. He exhales.

70   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- LATER -- FALL          70 
Carrie sits on the bed surrounded by Charlotte, Samantha, and Miranda all wearing matching robes. Laying on the floor near the bed -- three open gift boxes and ribbons. Lily sits in Carrie's lap playing with Carrie's cell phone -- in her PJ's. 
CARRIE (V.O.) There we sat... like a scene out of Louisa May Alcott's: "Not-so Little Women." 
CHARLOTTE I always knew she would marry Big. 
SAMANTHA/MIRANDA You did not! 
CHARLOTTE Yes I did! After every break-up I secretly thought: Nope. They belong together. 
SAMANTHA You thought that after the second break-up? 
CHARLOTTE Yep. 
MIRANDA After the fifteenth? 
CARRIE Ha ha -- hilarious -- we broke up a lot. 
SAMANTHA Yes, but... after the break-ups -- comes the hot make-up sex. 
Charlotte pokes Samantha; indicates Lily. Samantha rolls her eyes. Carrie's cell phone RINGS. Lily wants to answer it. 
CARRIE You want to answer? Go ahead, sweetie... Open it up... 
Lily opens it and holds it up to her face, silent. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Say something. 
LILY Sex. 
They are all shocked; then: LAUGHTER, even Charlotte. 
CARRIE Sweetie, that was your first bootie call. 
SAMANTHA Are you sure she's not my child? 
Carrie, still laughing, wipes a tear away as she takes the phone from Lily and answers it. 
CARRIE Hello? 
71   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                     71 
Big is sitting at the desk, a piece of paper on it. 
BIG It's me. 
CARRIE Oh my God -- did you just hear Lily? 
BIG Hey -- I need to talk. 
Carrie puts her hand to her ear, blocking the laughter. 
BIG (CONT'D) I'm sitting here trying to write these vows and... (beat; then) Is this something we really want to do? 
Carrie gets out of bed; playing it "casual" to the girls. 
CARRIE It's Big. I'm gonna take it in the-- 
She points to the study. Charlotte calls to the phone. 
CHARLOTTE (calling; silly) Get some sleep, groomie! 
Carrie goes into the study and closes the door. 
72   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/STUDY -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL      72 
Carrie leans against the door, her face now concerned. 
CARRIE What's the matter? 
BIG It's just -- everything is great as it is. (beat) I don't want to screw it up. 
CARRIE You won't. 
BIG I screwed it up twice before. 
Big is silent. Carrie is thinking, thinking, thinking. 
CARRIE Here's the thing. This is me that you're marrying tomorrow. Me. Nobody else. 
BIG Yeah. 
CARRIE And I'm marrying you. It's me and you. And you want to know the good news there? 
BIG Yeah. 
CARRIE We've already both done everything we can to screw it up. 
He smiles. She is very alert -- thinking, thinking. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Is that a smile I'm hearing? 
BIG Yeah. 
CARRIE Now, it sounds to me like you've got a bit of writer's block on the vow front. 
BIG Yeah. 
CARRIE And I find - you know - as a professional writer- it's best to just, you know, stop thinking about it so much -- and go to bed. And in the morning... 
BIG You know what to do? 
CARRIE Exactly. And if not -- Just write this: "I will love you." Simple and to-the-point. And I swear I won't even try to take credit for it. 
Silence. Deep silence. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) You're going to bed now, right? 
BIG Okay. Good night. 
CARRIE I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. Me and you. 
He hangs up. She looks terrified.

Raoul KNOCKS on the window. Big looks out. The girls are in the process of climbing out of the limo. Big closes the phone and looks. Carrie gets out of the limo, her back to him. 
BIG (CONT'D) Turn around baby, let me see you. 
Just as he's about to see her face -- Charlotte pulls the veil over it. Carrie is gone -- all Big can see is a bride. He sinks back into his seat and away from the window as the girls hurry up the library stairs. 
83   INT. LIBRARY/WEDDING AREA -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL          83 
Anthony and Stanford are waiting, as are Harry with Lily and Magda with Brady, who is wearing a little tux with shorts and knee socks holding a ring pillow. 
A FLURRY OF HIGH HEELS CLICKING on a marble floor is heard as Carrie and the girls arrive around a corner. Magda GASPS, overjoyed when she sees Carrie in her dress. 
MIRANDA Traffic was the worst -- 
Miranda kneels to hug Brady. Samantha fluffs Carrie. 
SAMANTHA Ready. We're ready. 
Samantha looks over. Anthony has a weird look on his face. 
STANFORD He's not here yet. 
SAMANTHA Who's not? 
ANTHONY The groom. 
Carrie lifts up her veil with ONE arm and looks out from under it. She is on super high-alert. 
CARRIE What's happening? 
SAMANTHA Big's not here. 
CHARLOTTE But we're twenty-five minutes late. 
CARRIE Did anyone call him? (beat; nothing) Give me a phone. Someone give me a phone. 
Samantha hands her the iPhone. Carrie looks at it. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) (tight/controlled) I don't know how to work this. 
Stanford hands her a phone. As she dials she catches a WORRIED LOOK on Charlotte's face. Carrie turns away and holds the phone to her ear, waits. Waits. Then -- 
CARRIE (CONT'D) (into phone) Are you okay? 
84   INT. BIG'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         84

BIG I've been calling you for an hour. Why haven't you been answering your phone? 
CARRIE (anxiety escaping) I don't know where my phone is! (beat) What is going on? Where are you? 
BIG (beat; then) I was out front --but I just left. I can't do this. 
CARRIE (in pain) Oh my God -- 
Carrie drops the phone from her ear -- She's heard the words. The words on some level she was expecting. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) He's not coming. Oh my God. 
The phone slips out of her hand and lands on the floor. Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha don't know what to do. 
SAMANTHA What do you mean he's not coming? 
CARRIE Get me out of here. (beat; a plea) -- Get me out of here! 
SAMANTHA Go, go. You take her. I'll stay here and deal with this -- 
She gestures to the wedding area. Miranda and Charlotte take Carrie's arms and quickly start moving her away. Horror on all of their faces. Brady CALLS after them, his voice ECHOES off the marble. 
BRADY Where you going, Mommy?! 
Samantha looks at Stanford and Anthony -- speechless. 
85   EXT. LIBRARY -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL                       85

Big sits, pale, staring off as the car drives away. 
BIG (sudden realization) What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck am I doing? (to Raoul) Turn around and go back. 
RAOUL It's a one way street. I have to go around the block. 
BIG By the time we go around the block she'll be gone. No one's behind us - - Turn around!

Raoul sees the limo -- coming. 
RAOUL I think this is them. 
BIG Pull over. Pull over. 
Big's car pulls over, as the limo approaches. Big powers down his window -- as the limo passes, he sees Carrie in the window --resting her head against the glass, listless. 
BIG (CONT'D) Carrie! 
Carrie looks up, and see's Big. He smiles an apologetically smile. Her limo keeps on moving. Big watches it go. Until... 
89   EXT. 41ST STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                       89 
The limo SCREECHES to a halt. The back door flies open and Carrie almost leaps out. Big sees her, he looks relieved. 
She hurries up the street to Big's car holding her bouquet. Big gets out of his car just as Carrie reaches him. 
BIG I freaked out for a minute -- but -- I'm ready now -- 
Carrie HITS him with her bouquet. It's a violent direct hit on his face. He recoils. She hits him again, hard... a wounded sound escaping her throat. 
BIG (CONT'D) Carrie! 
She hits him again. He ducks back into the car for protection. She hits the bouquet on the roof of the car -- the flowers start breaking apart and flying everywhere. 
CARRIE I knew you would do this -- I knew it! 
Miranda reaches Carrie and holds her back by her waist. Big gets back out of the car and starts over to her.

SAMANTHA Buenos dias. 
Carrie gets out of the cart and goes into the house -- followed by Charlotte and Miranda. Samantha arrives and picks up a drink off the tray. 
PAULO I'm sorry. I am confused. I am waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston. 
SAMANTHA Honey, you'll be waiting for a long time. 
She sips the drink, then looks at him, "familiar."

SAMANTHA Honey, you have to eat a little breakfast. 
CARRIE I'm tired. 
SAMANTHA Eat something and you can go back to sleep.

SAMANTHA With all this gorgeous fresh food you're just going to eat that pudding crap the entire trip? 
CHARLOTTE It's the only thing in the pantry that's totally safe. (holding up lid) See. Made in Poughkeepsie. I don't want to chance it.

CARRIE Yes. 
MIRANDA I thought it was just feathers. 
CARRIE No. It was a bird. 
CHARLOTTE It was beautiful.

SAMANTHA And the rest of them don't know how to screw you. Trust me-- I've done the leg work. 
MIRANDA And that was all Steve had -- didn't have money -- didn't have a career. He was the good guy bartender with a big dick. 
The all look over at her and react. 
SAMANTHA How big? 
CHARLOTTE I don't want to know this. 
SAMANTHA Eat your pudding. 
MIRANDA Nine. Like -- nine and change.

Carrie puts down the phone. Charlotte walks out of the house wearing a workout outfit. 
CHARLOTTE I'm going for a run and then to the gym for pilates. Anyone want to -- 
They all shake their heads: no. Charlotte trots away. 
MIRANDA Good news. Just got an e mail from your buyer's attorney -- they have agreed to sell you back your old apartment at that escalated price. (reading) And "are willing to vacate by the time you return -- pending an additional financial offer." 
CARRIE Well, apparently you can go home again -- but it'll cost you. 
SAMANTHA Now -- lets work on getting your things there.

Charlotte closes her eyes, lets the water flow over her. 
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And while picturing her loved ones at home in New York, she forgot where she was... 
Charlotte opens her mouth, shower water goes in. 
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And opened her mouth.

MIRANDA (CONT'D) No -- I told you... It has to be in Manhattan. Because it does. (MORE) 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) How hard could it be to find something just on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge? 
The assistant takes the documents and starts away. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) (into phone pissed) On second thought -- Forget it. I could do a better job myself.

CHARLOTTE Thanks for watching her while I went to the doctor. 
CARRIE (pulling on coat) Sure. Everything okay? 
CHARLOTTE I'm pregnant. 
Carrie looks at her. Charlotte smiles. 
CARRIE How? 
CHARLOTTE My doctor said sometimes when women stop trying -- it can happen. She knows other couples that adopt and then get pregnant. 
CARRIE Sweetie. 
CHARLOTTE Carrie -- I'm pregnant! 
Happy, happy tears. Carrie hugs her. 
CARRIE (V.O.) I guess, in certain houses, fairy tales do come true. 
140   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- DAY -- FALL                140 
Halloween costume aisle. Carrie and Miranda browse. 
CARRIE I can't believe you're even dressing up. 
MIRANDA All the parents at Brady's school dress up -- it's fun! Fun thought up by a group of non-working mothers with nothing else to do all day. 
Miranda stops, looks at the costumes hanging there. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Witch and -- "sexy kitten". That's it? The only two choices for women. Witch and Sexy kitten. 
CARRIE You said a mouthful there, sister. 
Miranda holds up a mask of a ghoul screaming in horror. 
MIRANDA Maybe I should just wear this and a business suit and go as myself. 
CARRIE (re; mask) Speaking of monsters -- I got an email from Big. 
Miranda looks over at her. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) "I don't know what to say." (beat) Ah... then don't send an email. 
MIRANDA What were you expecting? 
No idea. Miranda grabs a witch hat. They start walking away. They round a corner, CHILD wearing a mask pops up. 
CHILD Boo! 
Carrie smiles. The child walks away. 
CARRIE Gonna take a little more than that to scare me after what I have been through. 
They start walking toward the check-out counter. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) And in the subject box: two words: I'm sorry. 
MIRANDA Steve is all about "I'm sorry." I'm sorry emails -- I'm sorry voice mails -- I'm sorry flowers -- I'm sorry cards. How about: don't do anything to be: " I'm sorry" for. 
CARRIE Maybe he's sorry. 
MIRANDA Maybe Big is too. 
CARRIE Point taken. (beat) I still can't believe this happened to me. I know it happened, but I can't believe it happened. I lay awake at night going over every detail of the last week in my head. 
MIRANDA Carrie -- There's a detail I've been meaning to tell you about -- 
Carrie spots something; GRABS Miranda's arm with horror. 
CARRIE (V.O.) And then I saw it...the only thing scary enough to scare me after the experience I'd been through. 
On the rack in the front register -- Vogue! 
141   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL        141 
Carrie and Miranda stand looking at an open Vogue: 
"The Last Single Girl: Carrie Bradshaw Gets Married." 
MIRANDA You look great, you look amazing. So. That's the worst of it. 
Carrie flips a page. She noticed something. 
CARRIE Wait -- what's that say? In the box at the end? 
MIRANDA (reading) "Editor's note: The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was cancelled as this issue went to press. Carrie Bradshaw is... 
Miranda stops reading.   Carrie looks at her. 
CARRIE Is what? 
Miranda doesn't want to respond. Carrie pushes the magazine further away so she can read it. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) (reads) "Carrie Bradshaw is still single and living in Manhattan." 
142   EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- LATER -- FALL                   142 
LOUISE Look who's home from the big city! 
CARRIE (V.O.) It was the best money I'd ever spent. 
159A    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- WINTER                159A 
Carrie comes out of her kitchen, holding a Cup O'Soup. She is wearing pajamas and socks. 
CARRIE (V.O.) New Year's Eve... and a Cup O'Soup. 
She plops in a chair in front of the TV. She picks up the "Meet Me in St. Louis" DVD and looks at it. 
159AA   INT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENTS -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        159AA 
Steve is standing in the open doorway -- with his coat and hat on. Miranda is kneeling -- putting a winter coat on Brady. A Christmas tree glows behind them. 
MIRANDA And what are you gonna say at midnight? 
105A. 
BRADY Happy New Year. 
MIRANDA That's right -- but you gotta say it more excited than that -- (then; excited) "Happy New Year!" 
BRADY Happy New Year! 
MIRANDA You say that and then... you kiss. 
She gives him a big kiss. He laughs. She stands. 
STEVE You all ready to go, B-boy? 
MIRANDA Did you pack the new Batman Santa brought you? 
Brady shakes his head: NO. 
STEVE Aw man -- Gotta have the new Batman. 
MIRANDA It's there near the tree. 
Brady leaves to get it. Steve looks over at Miranda. 
STEVE You got plans with the girls? 
MIRANDA We're all kinda staying in tonight. 
STEVE Would you like to come and eat with us? We can go somewhere over here on your side. 
MIRANDA No, thank you. 
STEVE Miranda -- I never meant to hurt you. 
105B. 
She looks away. Brady comes up back to them with Batman. 
MIRANDA There he is. Batman. 
STEVE Put your hat on. It's snowing out. 
Brady nods and takes Steve's hand.   Steve looks over at Miranda. 
STEVE (CONT'D) Happy New Year. 
MIRANDA Happy New Year. 
BRADY Kiss. 
Silence... then, Miranda bends down and gives Brady a big sloppy kiss. 
MIRANDA See you tomorrow. 
She stands up and closes the door. As it closes, Steve looks at her. Finally; it is closed -- she leans against it. 
159AB   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER            159AB 
Carrie sips soup watching a "deliriously in love" Judy Garland sing "The Trolley Song." 
JUDY GARLAND ZING ZING ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS THE MOMENT I MET HIM -- I FELL 
Carrie, not in the mood, picks up the remote -- clicks. The TV goes off. She looks around: Now what? 
159AC   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- WINTER                 159AC 
Carrie sits at her makeshift desk as snow falls outside her window. She looks down at the computer; motionless. CLOSE ON SCREEN: The only thing written on it is the word: "Love." After a beat Carrie types three dots. She thinks, then deletes two of the dots. Her phone rings. She answers it. 
CARRIE Hello? 
105C. 
159B   INT. BUDDAKAN/RED ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER             159B 
Stanford sits in a festive booth with festive FRIENDS. 
STANFORD Happy New Year -- We're having a fabulous time. The only thing missing is you. Come. 
CARRIE That's sweet but I can't, I'm writing. 
STANFORD Oh... Okay. (beat;then) You're not really writing are you? 
CARRIE No. You're not really having a fabulous time are you? 
STANFORD No. Rescue me. It's very forced festive. 
CARRIE Oh yes, that's just what every New Year's Eve party needs: a visit from the lost Bronte sister. 
STANFORD Well... Better a Bronte sister than a Hilton sister. 
CARRIE (laughs; then) Thanks but -- by ten PM I'll be in bed asleep and blissfully unaware of how fabulous this night is supposed to be. 
159C   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- WINTER                 159C 
Carrie is sound asleep. Her phone rings. She grabs it. 
CARRIE Hello. 
105D. 
159D   INT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENTS -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        159D 
Intercut with Miranda -- sitting on her couch watching the New Year's Eve coverage on television. Chinese take-out is on the table in front of her. 
MIRANDA I thought one of the perks of having a family is you don't have to spend New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food. (beat) I'm alone with Chinese food. 
CARRIE I was sleeping. 
MIRANDA Oh, shit -- I'm sorry. 
CARRIE I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months -- and -- for five months you kept a secret like that? 
MIRANDA I tried to tell you once but the Vogue article came out -- 
CARRIE Once? You tried to tell me once? You should have tried to tell me every single day! 
MIRANDA I know, I was looking for the right time. 
CARRIE There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage! 
The Room is now at "attention." 
MIRANDA It just happened -- I wasn't thinking. 
Carrie grabs her purse -- to leave. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Carrie, please -- Don't go -- I -- 
Carrie stands up -- the festive balloon strings bob in front of her face. She pushes them away. 
CARRIE And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me. I have never ever kept a secret from you. Ever! 
She starts out. Stops, comes back -- through the ribbons. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) No, I'm lying. For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve. (beat) There. How does it feel? 
She turns and pushes balloons out of her way as she starts out. A KISSING COUPLE (20's) is BLOCKING her way. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Excuse me! 
They stop -- She squeezes by them. Miranda is devastated. 
191   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER 1 
Candles are lit. Samantha enters wearing a sexy sheer robe and carrying a giant tray of homemade sushi. The phone rings. The machine picks up. Smith leaves a message. 
SMITH (V.O.) Babe -- we're way behind on set. I still haven't been released. I'll get there as soon as I can. 
She SIGHS -- places the tray on the table. Looks at the wall clock: Seven-thirty. 
118A. 
192   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             192 
Eight o'clock. Samantha is sitting in the robe near the table. Not pleased. 
193   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             193 
Eight-thirty -- Samantha is pacing. She takes a piece of sushi -- pops it in her mouth and chews -- pissed. A WOMAN MOANING is heard. She walks over and glances out the window into Dante's living room. Candles are everywhere -- he is naked and GIVING HEAD to naked BLONDE WOMAN. She is writhing in pleasure. Samantha watches -- even more pissed. 
CARRIE (V.O.) It was the same Valentine night Samantha had planned -- minus the sushi. 
194   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- LATER                            194 
Samantha now wearing sweat clothes, sits with her arms crossed -- waiting. The door opens and Smith enters. 
SMITH I'm home! 
He see's Samantha sitting there. He smiles. 
SMITH (CONT'D) (CONT'D) Man, that was a long day -- the crew went into double overtime. 
SAMANTHA You are three hours late. 
SMITH Bummer. I know. Did you eat? 
SAMANTHA Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I hand made for you. The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for you. 
SMITH Why are you so upset? I called. 
SAMANTHA I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you. 
SMITH You made some sushi -- it's not a big deal! 
SAMANTHA Not a big deal? 
She stands up. She picks up some pieces of sushi. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) You see this -- This took me five fucking hours! 
She throws sushi at him. He dodges them. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I am not the type of woman who sits home all day waiting for a man! (beat) You love California so much -- enjoy your hand-made California roll! 
She throws more sushi and storms out. Smith looks at the subzero fridge. A sushi piece slides down the front. 
195    S-C-E-N-E--O-M-I-T-T-E-D                                   195

196B   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                   196B 
A FLORAL ARRANGEMENT sits on the hall table next to the answering machine. A card reading: "I'm sorry -- Miranda" is nearby. The answering machine is recording an incoming call from Miranda. 
MIRANDA (V.O) It's me. Pick up. Are you there? 
Carrie is standing in the bathroom; looking out at the answering machine, brushing her teeth. 
CARRIE (V.O.) Three days of "I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers -- and I still wasn't ready. It was the longest we'd even gone without speaking. 
120A. 
196C   EXT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                  196C 
Rain. Carrie walks up to her stoop. A CAB idling in front. The cab window goes down. Miranda is sitting there. 
MIRANDA Carrie. 
Carrie looks. Stops. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Hi. I need to talk to you. 
CARRIE How long have you been waiting here? 
Miranda looks to the meter, then back to her. 
MIRANDA Seventeen dollars long. (beat) Please get in. It just turned to eighteen. 
Carrie looks at her, hesitates, starts over to the cab. 
196D   INT. CAB -- A LITTLE LATER                                196D 
Rain pours down the windows. Carrie and Miranda sit in silence. A MIDDLE EASTERN DRIVER sits behind the wheel. CLOSE ON: THE METER. It reads 22.00. 
This is weird not talking. 
125A. 
CARRIE (V.O.) ... Samantha had money, a career and a man who loved her... Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life. 
The dog runs up onto the neighbor's deck. 
SAMANTHA No! Come back here. 
205   EXT. NEIGHBORS'S DECK -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING            205 
Samantha is on the neighbor's deck looking for the dog. 
SAMANTHA Where are you, baby? 
She rounds a corner -- and comes face to face with Dante -- showering in the outdoor shower. Water runs over his NAKED and PERFECT BODY. He sees her and smiles a hot smile. She is thrown -- overwhelmed. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick-- (catching herself) --Deck! 
There is a GROWL sound. She looks -- the dog is humping a towel on the deck floor. She looks back at Dante. 
DANTE Want to join me? 
Speechless -- She shakes her head: No -- she scoops up the dog and hurries away. He calls after her. 
DANTE (CONT'D) I'm Dante.     Stop by -- anytime. 
Samantha takes a peek back and continues on her way. 
206   EXT. BEACHOUSE/BEDROOM -- DAY -- SPRING                     206 
Samantha is having lunch outside while on the phone. 
SAMANTHA Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series. 
Dante appears on the deck next store in a wet suit. He unzips it while looking at Samantha. SAMANTHA dips a chip in guacamole and eats it. He pulls his wet-suit down and smiles at her. She dips another chip. He steps out of it and looks at her -- almost torturing her. She looks the other way, dips another chip in guacamole and eats it. Then another. 
207   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- DAY -- SPRING                     207 
Samantha is in the kitchen on the phone. She picks up a slice of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table. 
SAMANTHA We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover. 
She walks to the window and looks out. Dante is on his deck putting on sun screen. He glistens. She chews. 
208   INT. BEACHOUSE/DECK -- NIGHT -- SPRING                      208 
Samantha is in the jacuzzi -- she is looking up at Dante who is on his deck smoking a joint. He indicates for her to come over. She shakes her head: No. He walks away. She presses a button on the control panel. The jacuzzi jets start. She re- positions herself "on" them, then... She reaches over and grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and... starts eating it. 
209   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            209 
Miranda sits in the window -- having a cappuccino, alone. On the table a legal pad with a list of PROS and CONS. 
CARRIE (V.O.) With her two weeks just about up, Miranda's list of pros and cons were equal. 
She throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip on her cappuccino. As she stands up, she catches sight of herself in the mirrored wall. Cappuccino foam covers her top lip. She remembers. She knows. 
210   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- LATER THAT DAY                      210 
Miranda stands on the bridge. Alone. She looks at her watch. 
CARRIE (V.O.) It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons then pros. 
Just as this reality hits -- the CROWD parts and Steve is seen RUNNING up the bridge... towards her. 
127A. 
211   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER                       211 
Miranda and Steve walk along the bridge towards Brooklyn. 
CARRIE (V.O.) And Miranda never looked back... 
212   INT. STEVE AND MIRANDA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT -- SPRING           212 
Steve and Miranda are making love -- it is passionate. 
CARRIE (V.O.) Well, almost never. 
Miranda turns her head back to look at Steve. 
MIRANDA Kiss me. 
213   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                    213 
Carrie's apartment is transformed. It is sleeker, polished, more grown-up, with a warm, modern feel. 
CARRIE (V.O.) And at home -- everything felt and looked different -- and yet still very much me. 
Carrie -- BLONDE again -- walks out of the kitchen with Lilacs in a large vase. The door bell buzzes. 
214   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING          214 
Carrie opens the door. Miranda stands there with a very pregnant Charlotte. 
CARRIE Sorry. This is a very exclusive party. 
MIRANDA We're on the list. Miranda Hobbes plus one...and a half. 
215   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  215 
WOMEN FRIENDS chatting and having fun. The front door is open and a coat rack is visible in the hall. A couple of WAITERS (20's) move around. ANTHONY comes up to Carrie. 
ANTHONY A woman just put a glass down on your new desk without a coaster. I told her if she did it again I'd break her arm. 
CARRIE Thanks. 
He walks on. Miranda wanders up to Carrie. 
MIRANDA Where's Samantha? Her plane landed two hours ago. 
CARRIE You know her, probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out. 
Samantha appears in the doorway wearing a summer coat -- the dog is in her purse. 
SAMANTHA There's no place like home. 
CARRIE Sweetie! 
They kiss -- She goes to Miranda; they kiss. 
MIRANDA There's a rat in your purse. 
CARRIE And that rat better be house trained. 
A CATER WAITER walks over to her. 
CATER WAITER Can I take your coat? 
She kisses him on the lips. GENTLY. SOFTLY. 
219   INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT -- SPRING              219 
Samantha sits in first class. She is crying... while eating a hot fudge sundae. A STEWARDESS leans down. 
STEWARDESS We're landing in new York. I'm gonna need to take that now. 
Samantha nods, and finishes eating the hot fudge sundae as fast as she can. Scraping, almost licking the bowl. 
CARRIE (V.O.) As someone returned to my life... 
220   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                  220 
Carrie stands at the door with Louise. 
CARRIE (V.O.) ... Someone left. 
LOUISE And I put all the unopened mail from your P.O. Box in the manila envelopes on the bottom shelf there. 
She points to the shelf in the new bookcase. Carrie looks. 
LOUISE (CONT'D) And please -- please do not make a mess of CarrieBradshaw.com -- it's my masterpiece. 
CARRIE What am I gonna do without you? 
LOUISE You'll find some other girl... but she won't have my style. 
CARRIE St. Louise, you brought me back to life. 
Emotion floods Carrie; she chokes up. So does Louise -- 
LOUISE And you gave me Louise Vuitton. 
Carrie laughs -- they hug. 
LOUISE (CONT'D) Serious. We need to stop cryin'. 
Louise breaks the hug and takes her "love" key chain out of her purse -- hands it to Carrie. 
LOUISE (CONT'D) Your keys. 
CARRIE Wait -- don't forget your "love." 
LOUISE No, I found my love. I'm leaving that with you. 
Carrie smiles. Louise starts out the door, turns back. 
LOUISE (CONT'D) See you at my wedding. 
CARRIE I'll meet you in St. Louis. 
Louise gives one last look, and leaves. Carrie closes the door. Looks down at "love" in her hand. 
221   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- SPRING                  221 
Carrie is sitting at her desk... typing. 
CARRIE (V.O.) Now, there were no more distractions. (beat) And as I moved on... 
222   EXT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY -- SPRING          222 
Samantha walks past Lovro and Magda sitting on chairs out front, sipping ice tea, and up to Miranda's lower east side apartment stoop with the dog on the leash. 
CARRIE (V.O.) ... Samantha moved in. 
The HOT TATTOOED LATIN GUY is still sitting on the stoop out front with the ferocious looking pitbull. She starts up the stairs. He checks her out. She turns. 
SAMANTHA Hi, I'm your new neighbor. 
HOT NEIGHBOR Diego. 
SAMANTHA Samantha. 
They smile. There is a connection. Samantha looks down. The dog is humping the pitbull. Diego nods approval. 
223   EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            223 
A very, very pregnant Charlotte carrying shopping bags is being seated at a banquette by the HOSTESS (26). 
HOSTESS When are you due? 
CHARLOTTE Next week. 
HOSTESS You look gorgeous. 
CHARLOTTE (touched; embarrassed) Oh, thank-you. 
The Hostess walks away as Charlotte settles in and looks around. Her eyes WIDEN. Big is sitting across the room at a table -- alone. He hasn't seen her. Charlotte starts to panic as the WAITRESS (20's) comes over. 
WAITRESS Hi, can I -- 
CHARLOTTE No, I'm sorry -- I can't stay -- Help me -- pull out the table. I can't -- 
Charlotte pulls herself up off the banquette. As she tries to slide out, her belly and shopping bags knock things off the table. Crash. DINERS looks. Big spots her -- their eyes meet. She moves away as quickly as she can through the room. He gets up and follows after her. 
224   EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            224 
Charlotte exits the restaurant -- visibly upset. Big is quickly on her heels. 
BIG Charlotte. Charlotte wait -- 
He catches up to her - and gently steps to her. 
BIG (CONT'D) You're pregnant -- don't run. 
CHARLOTTE I don't want to see you. 
She starts crying and talking though the tears. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) I'm so mad at you. I was always on your side and then you did that to Carrie -- No, no -- I'm not going to cry -- I'm not going to waste tears on you -- (strong; stomping foot) I curse the day you were born! 
Charlotte's eyes widen. She stops moving, entirely. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) I think my water just broke. (beat) Oh my God -- Taxi! 
BIG My car's right there. Get in my car. 
CHARLOTTE I don't want to get in your car -- I hate your car. Taxi! 
BIG Charlotte -- we need to get you to the hospital -- Please get in my car. It's right here and ready. 
Charlotte finally nods. Big hurries her to the car. 
225   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- LATER                             225

CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) There they were. "The Love Letters of Great Men - Volume One." Plus one more... Written by John James Preston. 
New email -- It reads: "I know I screwed it up -- but I will love you forever." 
Carrie impulsively picks up the phone -- starts to dial. 
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I wanted to call him - but our love... Carrie and Big: volumes one, two, and three... stopped me. 
She puts the phone down and is about to "delete" the e mail -- suddenly; the phone rings. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Hello. 
LOUISE (O.C.) I didn't hear my phone. 
230   INT. BRIDAL SHOP -- CONTINUOUS -- SPRING                   230 
Intercut with Louise, standing in a wedding gown. Her MOTHER (45), GRANDMOTHER (65), and SISTERS (20 15, 8) sit watching. 
LOUISE We are shopping for my wedding gown. 
ANGELA, her youngest sister calls out. 
ANGELA That one makes you look weird. 
LOUISE (calls over) Momma -- can you please -- This is a work call. 
The Mother motions for Angela to sit down. She does. 
CARRIE No, it's okay I figured it out. 
LOUISE Well, I was going to call you anyway -- today is the final day on the Fifth Avenue apartment. You have till six before they change the locks. 
CARRIE I don't need to go over there. 
LOUISE And do you NOT want those never- worn shoes? 
CARRIE Oh -- I completely forgot about -- 
LOUISE `Cause if you don't -- send them on to me. I'll squeeze my feet into them. 
CARRIE It's already five o'clock.

Carrie walks into the bedroom and over to the closet. She pushes open the other double door... Revealing -- 
Mr. Big - standing there holding the Manolos in his hands. He looks up -- surprised by her. 
BIG I was going to get these to you. I didn't want it to be a total loss. 
CARRIE (V.O.) It wasn't logic -- it was love. 
She walks into the closet and over to him. She throws her arms around him. He drops the shoes. They kiss. It's passionate. Very -- very passionate. 
235   INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT/WALK-IN CLOSET -- LATER -- SPRING 35 
Carrie and Big are nestled up next to each other on the carpeted floor of the empty walk-in closet. His suit jacket is off. Her shoes are off. 
CARRIE Why did we ever decide to get married? 
BIG (beat; then) I guess we were afraid it meant something if we didn't. 
She looks at him and nods. It's true. 
BIG (CONT'D) I'm sorry to have done that to you. 
Silence. She touches his lips. 
CARRIE I'm sorry to have done that to you... (beat) And you know the funny part? 
BIG Is there a funny part? 
CARRIE We were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after. 
BIG Yep. The jokes on us. 
She nods... she looks around. 
CARRIE Good closet. 
BIG Thanks. 
CARRIE Comfortable. Is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet? 
BIG I'd like to think I was that smooth. 
CARRIE We better get up before the new owner bust in on us. 
They start to get up. Carrie rises first. He starts to get up, first -- sitting on his side...

Production Draft June 27, 1994 
FADE IN: 
INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY 
CLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt. 
A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering to his wound. 
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of view, as they steer him away. 
FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Come on, Son --this is no place for us. 
YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama. 
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A. SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone... 
P.A. SYSTEM Flight 784 for San Francisco is now ready for boarding at inmate number 66578, Greely. 
INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT 
PRISON P.A. SYSTEM --number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole... 
COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented. 
Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS "REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE "DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM. 
Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures, GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages. 
COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE... 
COLE Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on? 
JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid! 
JOSE "Volunteers" again. 
JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it. 
SCARFACE "Volunteer duty". 
The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes. 
COLE I didn't volunteer. 
SCARFACE You causing trouble again? 
COLE (controls his temper) No trouble. 
INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT 
COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes. 
TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE 
COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it. 
OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.) All openings must be closed. 
COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall. 
OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.) If the integrity of the suit is compromised in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper not closed, readmittance will be denied. 
INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT) 
COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor, steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door clangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back. 
On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock. COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It 
INT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT) 
COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand. 
The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders. 
INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT) 
COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through 
RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk. 
The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall. 
Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly. 
MICROBIOLOGIST Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole. 
COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down. 
ASTROPHYSICIST We want you to tell us about last night. 
COLE I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told. 
The SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully. 
COLE (worried) I mashed the spider, didn't I? 
MICROBIOLOGIST We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw. 
INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT) 
COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night. 
ASTPOPHYSICIST Where you collected sample #4, what street was that? 
COLE Uh... 
BOTANIST It's important to observe everything. 
COLE I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street. 
As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves, COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall.  One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  Another features a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on) and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE". 
ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.) Close your eyes, Cole. 
Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently. 
BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES. 
ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.) Tell us in detail what you've seen in this room. 
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Uh, in this room?  Uh... 
MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.) How many of us are there? 
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Six...seven, if you count me. 
ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.) Tell us about the pictures on the wall... 
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Uh, you mean the newspapers? 
A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.) Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you hear my voice?  What do I look like? What does he look like, the man who just spoke?  How old were you when you left the surface? 
The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A. SYSTEM at the airport. 
INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY 
THE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse leading to the departure gates. 
P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.) Flight 784 now boarding at gate... 
Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago Hulls Sports Duffle Bag. 
MR. PONYTAIL WATCH IT! 
YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates. 
Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!" 
YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks.... TERRIFIED TRAVELER Just exactly why did you volunteer? 
INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT) 
COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS. 
ASTROPHYSICIST Wake up, Cole. 
COLE Uh, I didn't hear the... 
MICROBIOLOGIST (tapping a pencil on the table) I asked you, why did you volunteer? 
COLE Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered. 
The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves. 
COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as the ENGINEER speaks to him. 
ENGINEER We appreciate you volunteering.  You're a very good observer, Cole. 
COLE Uh, thank you. 
ENGINEER You'll get a reduction in sentence. 
COLE keeps his face impassive. 
ASTROPHYSICIST To be determined by the proper authorities. 
ENGINEER You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away? 
COLE No, sir! 
COLE You wouldn't understand. 
RAILLY You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital? 
COLE I have to go. 
RAILLY A jail?  Prison? 
COLE Underground. 
RAILLY Hiding? 
COLE I love this air.  This is wonderful air. 
RAILLY What's wonderful about the air, James? 
COLE It's so clean.  No germs. 
RAILLY You're afraid of germs? 
COLE I have to go. 
RAILLY Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James? 
COLE This is April, right? 
RAILLY July. 
COLE (sudden panic) July?! 
RAILLY Do you know what year it is? 
COLE What year is it? 
RAILLY What year do you think it is? 
COLE 
RAILLY You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future? 
COLE (slightly confused) No, 1995 is the past. 
RAILLY 1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989. 
COLE looks stunned. 
INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING 
COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN. 
COLE Where are you taking me? 
POLICEMAN #1 South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel. You're gonna love it. 
COLE South of France?!  I don't want to go to the South of France.  I want to make a telephone call. 
POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door. 
POLICEMAN #2 Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink with your act, but you don't fool us. 
Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light. 
EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY 
A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows. 
INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING) 
Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLE stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants, PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise. 
As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and starts inspecting his scalp... 
BILLINGS Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you got any creepy crawlies. 
COLE I need to make a telephone call. 
BILLINGS (pulling Cole's head) Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo. Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says. 
COLE It's very important. 
BILLINGS What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it easy, relax into things.  We all gonna get along fine if you just relax. 
COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration. 
INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY) 
COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the large room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where light pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises. 
PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly. 
BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON, a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt. 
BILLINGS Jeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James. Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay? 
JEFFREY (with a sly look) How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd be doing your job. 
NARRATOR (v.o.) Take a chance.  Live the moment.  Sunshine. Gorgeous beaches.  The Florida Keys! 
ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen. 
ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers. 
TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.) We'll return to the Marx Brothers in "Monkey Business" following these messages. 
JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.) Monkey Business!  Monk Key Business. 
COLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking. JEFFREY Get it?  Monk - Key.  Monk! (big grin) Key! 
JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment.  A KEY! 
COLE (groggy) What....??? 
JEFFREY Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part. 
COLE What...??? 
JEFFREY Not, "what", babe!  When! 
"When???" 
JEFFREY (pressing the key into Cole's hand) Now! 
VOICE/TV (o.s.) Let us guide you to the stocks and bonds that will enhance your portfolio. 
JEFFREY (leaping to his feet) YES -- NOW!  BUY NOW!  STOCKS AND BONDS! NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW. 
ANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating. 
VOICE/TV (v.o.) A portfolio tailored to your specific needs and the needs of your loved ones... 
ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily. 
JEFFREY YES, YES.  ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW! 
ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a beeper, calling for help. 
ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room. 
JEFFREY BUY!  SELL!  SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY! 
ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE.  Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces. 
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just completed the puzzle stares, very upset. 
Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield. 
HEAVY WOMAN PATIENT I'M GETTING DIZZY.  MAKE HIM STOP! 
SKINNY MAN PATIENT HERE THEY COME!  THEY'RE COMING! 
OLD MAN PATIENT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I GOT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I'M INSURED! 
JEFFREY OPPORTUNITY!  DEFINITELY!  A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY!  OPENING NOW!  NOW'S THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT!  YES! YES!  MASTERCARD!  VISA!  THE KEY TO HAPPINESS! 
ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY is sending a message to him.  COLE looks at the ward door. 
COLE'S POV:  the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter. One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit. 
JEFFREY SEIZE THE MOMENT!  GET RICH!  NOW'S THE TIME!  GO FOR IT! 
BILLINGS (missing a tackle) God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool. 
ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating.  He locks at the door...blurring in and out of focus.  He looks down at the key in his hand. 
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREY resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him. 
JEFFREY LAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW! 
ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries to insert the key in the lock. 
ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole. 
ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder. 
COLE'S POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE. 
ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It won't turn. 
A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear. 
PATIENT Place to go would be...Florida.  The keys are lovely this tine of year. 
COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again.  It turns. 
PATIENT Be careful.  J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead. 
COLE pauses, stares, not understanding.  Then, he opens the door. 
INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL 
Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room facing several elevators. 
RAILLY I have to do this, James.  You're very confused. 
RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin. 
INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY) 
DR. FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table.  DR. CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there. 
DR. FLETCHER Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition. 
RAILLY I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just... 
DR. FLETCHER He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it? 
RAILLY Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and... 
DR. FLETCHER (impatient, not interested) Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull. 
RAILLY I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say? 
DR. FLETCHER You see what I mean?  You're being defensive. (to Dr. Casey) Isn't she being defensive, Bob? 
But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door. 
BILLINGS Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another... situation. 
INT.  CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY) 
DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN, GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him. 
DR. FLETCHER He was in full restraints?  And the door was locked? 
BILLINGS Yes, sir.  Did it myself. 
DR. FLETCHER And he was fully sedated? 
RAILLY He was fully sedated! 
DR. FLETCHER Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now? 
DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall. 
INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM) 
Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into the sky as the airport P.A. System drones... 
P.A. SYSTEM Flight 784 to San Francisco now boarding at Gate 38... 
YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION. 
MR. PONYTAIL bumps him. 
The BLONDE MAN sprints past.  The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out! 
WOMAN'S VOICE NOOOOOOOOOO! 
TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE running after the BLONDE MAN!  But this time, YOUNG COLE catches just a glimpse of her face.  She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings.  She calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM... 
BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM The Freedom For Animals Headquarters now boarding on Second Avenue.  The Army of the Twelve Monkeys... 
ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.) Cole, you moron -- wake up! 
INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE 
As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE... 
UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM -- they're the ones who are going to do it... 
COLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him.  It's a beat-up old tape recorder. 
UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER I can't do anything more.  The Police are after me. 
The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap... 
ASTROPHYSICIST Well? 
COLE Uh, what? 
ENGINEER He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out. 
ASTROPHYSICIST Cole, did you or did you not record that message? 
COLE Uh, that message...me? 
MICROBIOLOGIST It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call? 
COLE (angrily) I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989. 
SCIENTISTS 
The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers.  Then, 
ZOOLOGIST You're certain of that? 
GEOLOGIST (before Cole can answer) What did you do with your time, Cole? Did you waste it on drugs?  Women? 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) Science isn't an exact science with these clowns.  You're lucky you didn't end up in ancient Egypt! 
INT.  LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE 
COLE is strapped on a gurney.  SCIENTISTS hover near-by, whispering.  The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating. 
GEOLOGIST No mistakes this time, Cole. 
ASTROPHYSICIST Stay alert.  Keep your eyes open. 
ZOOLOGIST Good thinking about that spider, Cole. Try and do something like that again. 
MICROBIOLOGIST Just relax now -- don't fight it.  We have to know exactly what's there so we can fix it. 
The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube... reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital. 
COLE'S POV:  a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber door is CLANGED shut. 
EVERYTHING IS BLACK.  A HUM BUILDS.  THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE HUM REACHES A DEAFENING LEVEL, THEN DIMUENDOS.  WE BEGIN TO HEAR BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE, VOICES SHOUTING IN FRENCH, A SUDDEN HUGE EXPLOSION!  THEN... 
EXT.  TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY 
DRIZZLING RAIN.  And SCREAMS.  COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he?  SOLDIERS in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit fifteen yards away.  Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks... in FRENCH.  COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I! Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French. 
SERGEANT (FRENCH, subtitled) Where's your mask?!  And your clothes... and your weapon, you idiot?! 
COLE What?  What?? 
COLE looks around desperately.  A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being stretchered past them in the narrow trench.  Machine guns chatter close at hand.  AAK AAK AAK.  A grenade EXPLODES.  Reacting to the foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs... 
SERGEANT (FRENCH, subtitled) Captain!  A Kraut!  We got a Kraut! 
COLE I don't understand.  Where am I? 
The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German. 
CAPTAIN (GERMAN, subtitled) How'd you get here, soldier?  What's your rank?  Where are your clothes? 
COLE I...don't understand. 
CAPTAIN (frowning, GERMAN, subtitled) German!  Speak German!  What are you doing here? 
VOICE (o.s.) (pleading in English) I gotta find 'em.  I gotta find 'em. Please, you gotta help me! 
COLE turns, sees... 
It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in the "underground" time.  He's being carried past COLE now on a stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded. 
COLE JOSE! 
JOSE Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we? 
JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.  SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.  COLE goes down.  Hit in the leg! 
SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects. 
Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead from a chest wound, his gas mask half off. 
COLE is reaching for the mask when... 
A SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION. 
EXT.  COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT 
Stunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at the dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.  MOVING IN we FOCUS ON a large poster advertising "The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995". WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON... 
DR. KATHRYN RAILLY MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS MAY 17 
INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT 
A large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen is a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained by PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing. 
RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.) According to the accounts of local officials at that time, this gentleman, judged to be about forty years of age, appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle near Stonehenge in the West of England in April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent, the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence which he predicted would wipe out humanity in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the village, was taken into custody, but then mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again. 
WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern in a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES. 
RAILLY (cont.) In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons of great pestilence, men have often believed the prophecies of crazed fanatics, that the end of the world was come."  Obviously, this plague/doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling when reality supports it in some form, whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox, or AIDS.  In addition to these "natural" contagions, there are now technological horrors as well:  besides radiation, consider our lurking fear of germ warfare and its close approximation, chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head in the deadly mustard gas attacks during the First World War. 
ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc.. 
RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.) During such an attack in the French trenches in October, 1917, we have an account of this soldier... 
ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until the image approximates Munch's famous painting. 
RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.) -- who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the lines where Doctors discovered he had lost all comprehension of French but spoke English fluently, albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize. The man, although physically unaffected by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed he had come from the future, that he was looking for a pure germ that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the earth in the year... 1995! 
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE. 
ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill. 
RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.) Although seriously injured, the young soldier disappeared from the hospital before more data could be gathered.  No doubt, he was trying to carry on his mission to warn others, substituting for the agony of war...a self-inflicted agony we call the "Cassandra Complex". 
As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN, RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening attentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS. 
RAILLY (cont.) Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall, was condemned to know the future but to be disbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence, the agony of foreknowledge combined with impotence to do anything about it. 
He's lowered the map.  It's COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty. 
RAILLY Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago. 
COLE 1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here! 
COLE is indicating a freeway entrance. 
RAILLY turns the wheel sharply. 
EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT 
The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway. 
INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT 
RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily against the seat.  She says carefully... 
RAILLY I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me? 
COLE You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. (sudden pride) I can read, remember? 
RAILLY Yes, I remember. (a beat, then) Why do you want to go to Philadelphia? 
COLE It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. (pointing suddenly, eagerly) Zs that a radio?  Does it play music? 
RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL. 
COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.) This is a personal message to you. 
COLE sits up, alert, listening intently. 
COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.) Are you at the end of your rope?  Are you dying to get away? 
COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message. 
COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.} The Florida Keys are waiting for you. 
COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills the car.  It's confusing!  He blurts out... 
COLE I've never seen the ocean! 
Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her professional tone. 
RAILLY It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You do understand that, don't you?  It's not really a special message to you. 
COLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but she's probably right. 
COLE You used to call me "James". 
RAILLY You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you. 
COLE (cynical laugh) Everybody's got a gun.  In this city... 
He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC!  FATS DOMINO singing "BLUEBERRY HILL"!  COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's. 
COLE Can you...can you make it louder?  I love hearing twentieth century music! Hearing music and breathing air! 
As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily. 
EXT.  FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT 
"BLUEBERRY HILL" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear window, zips past a sign at 65 mph. 
The sign says, "PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES." 
INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT 
RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his head out the window.  what can she do?  Just then, while she's trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in... 
ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.) This just in from Fresno, California: emergency crews are converging on a cornfield where playmates of nine year old Ricky Neuman say they saw him disappear right before their eyes. 
COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now. 
ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.) Young Neuman apparently stepped into an abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive, possibly seriously injured.  Playmates claim they heard him cry out faintly but since then there has been no contact with... 
COLE "Never cry wolf!" 
RAILLY What? 
COLE My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens. 
RAILLY "If something really happens"...like what, James? 
COLE Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff... 
RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations. 
RAILLY Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...? 
COLE Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one? 
It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, "SINCE I MET YOU, BABY". 
IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.) "Since I met you, baby, My whole life has changed... 
ANGLE ON TV, the picture of RAILLY filling the screen. 
----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING ----------------------- 
COLE My notes.  Observations.  Clues. 
RAILLY Clues?  What kind of clues? 
COLE A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment. 
RAILLY What will you do...when you find this...secret army? 
COLE I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth. 
RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back. 
COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes. 
COLE You won't think I'm crazy next month. People are going to start dying.  At first the papers will say it's some weird fever, some virus.  Then they'll begin to catch on.  They'll get it. 
RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.) We interrupt this program with a special bulletin... 
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert. 
RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.) This report just in from Fresno, California.  Naval sonar specialists who were flown to the site... 
COLE I thought it was about us.  I thought maybe they'd found us and arrested me or something. 
RAILLY stares at COLE. 
COLE Just a joke. 
RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.) -- an hour ago have been unable to determine the location of the boy in the 150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into the narrow tube claims he heard breathing sounds coming from approximately seventy feet down... 
COLE reaches over and changes stations.  MUSIC again. 
RAILLY Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well? 
COLE When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him. 
RAILLY What do you mean -- when you were a kid? 
COLE Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left! 
COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left. 
EXT.  SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY 
An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES. 
EVANGELIST "And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces:  and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged." 
ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving, COLE, beside her, staring out the window. 
INT.  ACURA/SKID ROW STREET 
COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable "RESIDENTS". 
COLE Where I come from we think of this as Eden. If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown food.  Eden!  Look at them!  They donut know what they have.  They don't see the sky.  They don't feel the air! 
COLE'S POV:  a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING! 
COLE (o.s.) And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug they haven't a clue.  WAIT!  STOP! 
EXT.  ACURA/SKID ROW 
On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures. 
Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE. 
COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang insignias.  We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle. 
COLE The Twelve Monkeys!!!  They're here. (looks around) Somewhere.  Come on! 
He pulls her along the sidewalk.  No question, he's insane. 
At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.  Then, still keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert. 
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens... 
COLE Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people! 
RAILLY I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is. 
ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!  He's found another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS! 
But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE. 
RASPY VOICE (o.s) You can't hide from them, Bob. 
COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future. 
LOUIE No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try. (conspiratorially) They hear everything.  They got that tracking device on you.  They can find you anywhere.  Anytime.  Ha Ha! 
RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction. 
COLE Come an.  We're running out of time. You can't help him. 
As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly. 
RAILLY Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him! 
COLE I did him a favor.  Now come on. 
COLE, pulling her again, sees more "12 MONKEYS" on the wall. 
RAILLY You didn't have a gun before, did you? 
COLE I've got one now. 
EXT.  SECOND AVE - DAY 
The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him, points urgently at COLE. 
EVANGELIST You!  You!  You're one of us, aren't you? 
But COLE has stopped and is staring at... 
A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters.  The sign over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION. 
INT.  FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY) 
Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired, and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM.  Behind them, a large poster proclaims, "ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO".  Just then, there's a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see COLE and RAILLY enter. 
COLE looks startled.  It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in here.  Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour. 
Bookshelves line two walls.  The front window is blanked cut with posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings, photos of animal atrocities.  The fourth wall features the counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR. 
FALE Uh, can we help you? 
COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets an urgent warning. 
FALE Excuse me.  You looking for something in particular? 
RAILLY It's all right, James -- it's just a tape. 
COLE'S eyes follow her look.  It's a tape recorder underneath a sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD". 
COLE I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. 
FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY.  "We have a problem!" the look says. MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing. 
TEDDY We don't know anything about any "Army of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't you and your friend disappear, okay? 
COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS. 
COLE I just need some information... 
TEDDY Didn't you hear me?  We're not... 
TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes. 
COLE is pointing a pistol at them.  A TIGER SNARLS. 
RAILLY James, no -- don't hurt them. (to the activists) Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do whatever he tells you to do.  He's... upset -- disturbed.  Please -- he's dangerous -- just cooperate. 
MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up. 
FALE What do you want -- money?  We only have a few bucks. 
COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again.  A BABOON HOWLS with laughter. 
COLE I told you what I want. (snaps at Railly) Lock the door! 
RAILLY James, why don't we...? 
COLE Lock it now! 
RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE, 
BEN I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this. 
FALE Shut up! 
COLE Mason??? 
RAILLY Jeffrey Mason? 
BEN Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason. 
INT.  FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY) 
The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement.  They're very frightened, eager to cooperate. 
FALE Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big star -- the media latch on to him because he's picketing his own father, a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist". You musta seen all that on TV. 
COLE No, I don't watch TV. 
COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while RAILLY watches helplessly.  Suddenly, COLE finds something he thinks he's seen before.  He holds it up. 
COLE Is this him -- Dr. Mason? 
RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down. 
RAILLY starts opening the door.  Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her. 
COLE Where are you going? 
She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience Store appended to the Gas Station. 
RAILLY You can come with me.  I have to get some things.  Scissors, bandages, some alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look at your leg, James.  I'm a doctor. 
COLE looks helpless, hesitant.  She's in charge...for the moment. 
EXT.  CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON) 
The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.  We HEAR the CAR RADIO but not the engine. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.) Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining engineers continue their desperate attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the ant in which nine year old... 
COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door.  He's staring up at the sun and the sky.  RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh. 
RAILLY You shouldn't put your weight on it. You need stitches and antibiotics. Lucky for you it was near the surface. 
RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket while COLE continues staring up at the sky. 
COLE I love seeing the sun. 
A beat.  COLE tries to stand up. 
RAILLY Wait -- let me help you. 
RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.  A beat. They're very close.  They don't move.  RAILLY looks like she can barely breathe. 
COLE (leans closer, shuts his eyes) You smell so good. 
RAILLY (trying to concentrate) You have to give yourself up, you know. 
A beat.  The spell is broken.  He reaches for his pants, then turns back to her, suddenly grim. 
COLE I have to do something now.  Something I don't want to do.  I'm so sorry. 
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.  He looms over her.  He's cold now, steeled. 
COLE I have a mission.  It's important. 
RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die. 
EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT 
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.  Encountering another AGENT, he pauses. 
FIRST AGENT They find him? 
SECOND AGENT Who?? 
FIRST AGENT That kid.  The one in the pipe. 
SECOND AGENT You believe this?  They're dropping a monkey down there with a miniature infra-red camera strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich wrapped in tinfoil. 
FIRST AGENT You're making that up! 
ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to the receding VOICES of the AGENTS. 
SECOND AGENT (o.s.) I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird! A monkey and a sandwich.  Wonder who thought that one up. 
FIRST AGENT (o.s.) Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel Prize! 
Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.  He doesn't see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes. 
INT.  MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
A formal dinner for forty.  Desert has been served.  DR. MALCOLM MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS. 
DR. MASON Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner and this excellent and stimulating company for itself, with no sense of purpose.  But alas, I am "burdened" with the sense that with all this excess of public attention and this cacophony of praise, there comes great responsibility.  Indeed, I practically feel a soapbox growing under my feet whenever I stand for more than a few seconds. 
While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone. 
DR. MASON (o.s.) The dangers of science are a time worn threat, from Prometheus stealing fire from the Gods to the Cold War era of the Dr. Strangelove Terror. 
AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for.  JEFFREY MASON! 
DR. MASON (cont.) But never before, not even at Los Alamos when the scientists made bets on whether their first atomic bomb test would wipe out New Mexico, has science given us so much reason to fear the power we have at hand. 
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear. 
JEFFREY What are you talking about?  What friend?  I'm not expecting anyone. 
ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance. 
DR. MASON Current genetic engineering as well as my own work with viruses has presented us with powers as terrifying as any... 
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room, grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience. 
JEFFREY This is ridiculous.  My father is making a major address. 
INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION 
He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically. 
RAILLY I could have died in there.  If something had happened to you I would have died. 
COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood. 
COLE I...I...I'm really sorry. 
Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him. 
RAILLY What have you done?  Did you...kill someone? 
COLE (getting to his feet) No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree. 
RAILLY See -- you can drive after all! 
COLE Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy! 
She looks at him.  Breakthrough?  Very calm now, the doctor. 
RAILLY What made you think that? 
COLE Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. (horrified) You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea? 
RAILLY Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face. 
COLE I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that. 
RAILLY It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you. 
COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING. 
COLE I need help all right.  They're coming after me. 
RAILLY First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay? 
COLE (brightening) It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground. 
RAILLY Give me the gun. 
COLE The gun! ... I lost it 
RAILLY You're sure? 
COLE (showing her) No gun! (looking up) Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe! 
RAILLY starts around to the front of the car. 
RAILLY I'm going to attract their attention, let them know where we are, okay? 
RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn. 
RAILLY (calling out) They'll tell you to put your hands on top of your head.  Do what they tell you.  You're going to get better, James -- I know it! 
ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.  An insect!  He reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass, stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.  The HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky. 
ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars. 
ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face. 
COLE I love this world! 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS from the woods.  The police are almost here.  She gets out of the car, starts around toward COLE. 
RAILLY Remember, I'm going to help you.  I'll stay with you.  I won't let them... 
She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned! 
COLE is gone.  Disappeared. 
INT.  POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING 
RAILLY is being "debriefed" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS. 
RAILLY Then I said something to him about cooperating and he said he would do that, so I got in the car and started honking the horn.  When I got out, he was gone. 
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN You lucked out.  For a while we thought you were a body they found down state... mutilated. 
A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it. 
RAILLY He wouldn't do something like that -- he... 
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN (interrupts, hands her the photo) This the man he attacked? 
RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped against the alley wall, obviously dead. 
RAILLY I'd like to be clear about this.  That man and the other one were..."severely" beating us.  James Cole didn't start it.  In fact -- he saved me! 
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist -- why do kidnap victims almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em and try to make us understand how kind these bastards really were? 
RAILLY (as if reciting) It's a normal reaction to a life- threatening situation. (suddenly animated) He's sick.  He thinks he comes from the future.  He's been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate.  He needs help! 
INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM 
YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide. 
MICROBIOLOGIST Others will take over now... 
ZOOLOGIST We'll be back on the surface in a matter of months.... 
GEOLOGIST We'll retake the planet. 
ASTROPHYSICIST We're very close!  Because of you! 
ENGINEER (unrolling a document) This is it, James...what you've been working for. 
BOTANIST A full pardon! 
MICROBIOLOGIST You'll be out of here in no time. 
ASTROPHYSICIST Women will want to get to know you... 
COLE I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL! 
Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before. 
ASTROPHYSICIST (sympathetically) Of course you want to be well, James. And you will be...soon. 
COLE bursts into hysterical laughter. 
COLE YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS! YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE. MADE YOU UP!  YOU CAN'T TRICK ME! YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND YOU'RE MY INSANITY! 
INT.  PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY 
CLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone, 
RAILLY He not only used the word "prank" -- he said the boy was hiding in a barn. 
RAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen. 
DR. FLETCHER He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress. 
RAILLY For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die! 
DR. FLETCHER Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not. 
RAILLY And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith. 
INT. "HOSPITAL" CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT 
Alone in his "hospital" room, COLE struggles without success to free himself from his restraints. 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) You sure fucked up, Bob! 
Startled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and continues his feverish struggle. 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) But I can understand you don't want your mistakes pointed out to you. I can relate to that, old Bob. 
COLE looks around in spite of himself.  Nothing to see but the walls and the landscape paintings. 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) Hey, I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking I don't exist except in your head.  I can see that point of view.  But you could still talk to me, couldn't you? Carry on a decent conversation? 
COLE (blurting) I saw you! In 1995!  In the real world! You were a bum!  You pulled out your teeth. 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob? They don't like that.  That's a no-no. And when did you say you saw me? In...1872? 
COLE FUCK YOU! 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) Yelling won't get you what you want.  You have to be smart to get what you want. 
COLE Oh, yeah?  What do I want? 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) You don't know what you want?  Sure you do, Bob.  You know what you want. 
COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth.  Then... 
COLE Tell me.  Tell me what I want. 
RASPY VOICE (o.s.) To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to be topside -- breathe the air -- to be with her. ... Isn't that right?  Isn't that what you want? 
Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment.  When he speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper. 
COLE More...than...anything. 
INT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
RAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream.  Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.  Her eyes snap open.  A beat to orient herself.  RING.  She reaches for the phone. 
INTERCUT LIEUTENANT HALPERIN'S OFFICE/RAILLY'S BEDROOM 
CLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone. 
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN Dr. Railly?  Jim Halperin, Philly P.D.. Sorry to call so early but... 
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone, 
RAILLY You found him?  Is he all right? 
CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows giving an "I told you so" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop across his desk, then continuing into the phone, 
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN Au contraire, Doctor.  No sign of your good friend, the kidnapper.  However, the plot thickens.  I have a ballistic report on my desk that says the bullet you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's thigh is an antique...and all indications are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920. 
With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil, 
COLE San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. 
BOTANIST Meaning...??? 
COLE That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. 
BOTANIST And your only goal is...??? 
COLE To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus. 
BOTANIST So that...??? 
COLE Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth. 
COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects... 
a magazine photo of wall graffiti:  "ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE WATCHING!  IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE SOURCE?  3 BILLION DIE?" 
BOTANIST (o.s.) This is from a magazine printed in late September, 1995.  The writer speculated that this graffiti might be related to the epidemic that by that time had already killed thirty million people world-wide and was getting worse.  He says, certain people, unnamed, were questioned, but what came of that is not known.  But it is a clue you should pursue. 
COLE stares at the picture. 
EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT - DAY 
LOUD BANGING!  The storefront window, completely covered with posters, quivers violently.  Images of MONKEYS covered with electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.  It's RAILLY. 
RAILLY IS ANYBODY IN THERE?  HELLO?  IS SOMEONE IN THERE?  IF YOU'RE IN THERE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. 
INT.  FAA STORE 
JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters. 
FALE It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up. 
BEN What's she doing? 
FALE She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit! 
JEFFREY Whine, whine, whine.  What about walkie talkies?  We used to have walkie talkies. 
EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT 
From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she, seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door. 
RAILLY I SAW YOU!  I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.  I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! 
RASPY VOICE (o.s) Secret experiments! 
RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict. 
LOUIE That's what they do -- secret weird stuff! 
RAILLY You!  I know you! 
But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now. 
LOUIE Not just on them.  Do 'em on people, too -- down at the shelters.  Feed 'em chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em. 
RAILLY Have you seen James Cole?  The man...? 
LOUIE They're watchin' you.  Takin' pictures. 
RAILLY follows his look. 
ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper. 
RAILLY The police.  I know.  Listen, I need to talk to James, but he has to be careful how he contacts me.  He mustn't get caught.  Do you understand me? 
LOUIS Uh, yeah, sure.  Uh...who's James? 
RAILLY He was with me, he spoke to you. Several weeks ago.  He said you were from the future...watching him. 
LOUIS gives her a look that says, "I'm outta here!" 
But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously "tagging" their way along the street with cans of spray paint. 
RAILLY stares at the PUNKS. 
INT.  FAA STORE 
FALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY, and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening between posters at the front window. 
JEFFREY You get the bolt cutters? 
KWESKIN One dozen.  They're in the van. 
FALE One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters? 
JEFFREY (grins) You really want to know? 
FALE No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything. 
BEN Hey!  Do you know what she's doing? 
FALE He's seriously crazy -- you know that. 
EXT.  SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY 
An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley. 
The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES COP'S eyes searching everywhere. 
Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter. 
HER POV:  the POLICE CAR passes from view. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing, 
RAILLY James!  Come on. 
A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster, bits of lettuce in his hair. 
COLE I don't understand what we're doing. RAILLY (climbing out of the dumpster) We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you. 
COLE (climbing out after her) You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them. 
But she's not listening.  She's peeking out the alley entrance. 
RAILLY'S POV:  across the street is a run-down skid row hotel, THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY. 
INT.  GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER 
The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often, stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE. 
DESK CLERK Twenty five bucks an hour. 
RAILLY An hour?! 
DESK CLERK You want quarter hours, go someplace else. 
RAILLY (catches on, pulls out her last bills) Here's ninety eight.  For the night.  Deal? 
The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events.  Then, he turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her. 
DESK CLERK Forty four.  Fourth floor, turn right. Elevator's busted. 
RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color. 
ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb stairs.  As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone, punches a number, speaks into the phone. 
DESK CLERK Tommy?  This is Charlie at the Globe. You know if Wallace has a new girl? Sort of a rookie type?  Blonde? 
INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY) 
COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY pace back and forth like a mad woman. 
RAILLY Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what? 
COLE I thought I was in...prison again. 
RAILLY Just like that?  You were in prison? 
COLE No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said. 
RAILLY You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods? 
COLE I don't know -- I don't remember. 
RAILLY The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax? 
COLE It was?  I didn't...know. 
RAILLY James, you said he was hiding in the barn... 
COLE I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy... 
RAILLY IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL! 
COLE looks at her.  She's really upset. 
COLE Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV show and copied it.  Listen, you were right, it's all in my head.  I'm mentally ill, I imagine all that stuff.  I know they're not real, I can trick them, make them do what I want.  I just worked on them in my head and I got back here.  I can get better.  I can stay here. 
RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE. 
It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame, 
RAILLY What does this mean to you? 
COLE ...I had a dream about...something like that. 
RAILLY You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there? 
COLE You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything... 
RAILLY Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon. 
COLE stands, moves close to her. 
COLE I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown. 
INT.  GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY 
The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall alongside the open doorway to Room 44.  The UNIFORMED OFFICERS are backing him up, weapons drawn. 
PLAINCLOTHES COP POLICE!  THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND COME OUTTA THERE! 
No response. 
INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 
The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol extended in both hands.  He pans the gun around the empty room. 
HIS POV:  the open window...the blood on the floor. 
WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom) HEY!  ZAT THE POLICE!  I'M AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN HERE!  I WAS ATTACKED BY A COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST! 
EXT.  BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON 
A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the toney downtown shopping district.  Among them, RAILLY looks furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  She's hidden her bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody handkerchief to his mouth. 
As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling city, the tall downtown buildings.  His eyes go up. 
COLE'S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  A building with a ledge.  The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!! 
ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed entrance to a store. 
RAILLY Wait here.  I'm going to try that phone number.  Let's hope it's nothing! 
Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES looming frighteningly close. 
A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display window.  Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away 
Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window.  Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY. 
COLE'S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into the phone. 
ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  Confused, COLE stares at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him, eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient. 
RAILLY James!  James!  It's okay.  We're insane!  We're crazy! 
COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look. 
RAILLY It's a Carpet Cleaning Company... 
COLE A Carpet Cleaning Company? 
RAILLY (laughing) No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned. 
COLE You... you left them a message? RAILLY (impishly) I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys... 
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth!  He starts to recite... 
COLE "The Army of the Twelve Monkeys -- they're the ones who are going to do it.  I can't do anything more.  The police are watching me." 
Now she's stunned.  She glances back and sees the phone booth twenty yards away. 
RAILLY You... you couldn't have heard me. 
COLE They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice. 
RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning. 
ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic. Noticing something, he reaches for his radio. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him into the CROWD. 
RAILLY Come on. 
INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM 
RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK. 
RAILLY And this. (turning) Anything else? 
But COLE'S not here.  He's a short distance away...staring. 
COLE'S POV:  aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of brand new consumer goods. 
ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and full of moldering merchandise. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK. 
RAILLY I guess that's it. 
CLERK Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am? 
RAILLY (producing Wallace's roll of bills) No -- I'll pay cash. 
The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills! 
RAILLY What floor are the wigs on, please? 
EXT.  PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT 
Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway. 
COLE (moving his head to see the film) I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things. 
RAILLY If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers. 
COLE Flowers!  What flowers? 
From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound. 
RAILLY (whispering) It's an expression.  Here... 
She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing it on COLE'S head, adjusting it... 
COLE Why are we doing this? 
RAILLY So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry. 
There are tears in her eyes.  They discomfit COLE. 
COLE But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy. 
RAILLY In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police. 
SHADOWY MOVIEGOER SHHHHHHH 
COLE (whispers) Where can we hide for a few weeks? 
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground, the OCEAN behind them. 
RAILLY You said you'd never seen the ocean... 
EXT.  GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision. 
URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.  Then, METAL ON METAL. Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen with phony rocks.  Stalking back and forth.  Huge.  Upset. 
CLANK.  CLANK.  METAL ON METAL.  GRUNTS of effort, then, DR. MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened. 
DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.) What are you doing to me?  Where are we?  Jeffrey, please... 
SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.) For God's sake, put the tape back on his mouth! 
The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest. 
JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.) Forget the tape.  The monkey's louder than he is.  You gonna tape the monkey's mouth? 
EXT.  PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT 
Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS. 
EXT.  LION'S PEN/ZOO 
The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.  From the darkness, unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response. 
EXT.  AVIARIES/ZOO 
A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages. 
INT.  MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM 
CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS continue.  Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie filling his field of vision. 
HIS POV:  the MOVIE SCREEN.  TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. 
ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around.  Empty seats on both sides of him.  He's alone.  He panics. 
COLE Kathryn?! 
INT.  THEATER LOBBY 
A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock Festival".  PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone.  Turning, she reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses. She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM!  Crossing the lobby toward the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate in the tight dress. 
Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip.  The BLONDE MAN stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE. 
BRUNETTE We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West. 
The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional, revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe.  The Blonde Man is COLE!  He's confused. 
COLE You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you. 
RAILLY Well, you look pretty different, too. 
COLE I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone. 
RAILLY (studies him seriously) I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you. 
Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them. 
INT.  STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER 
RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room.  She kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other janitorial items.  COLE responds to her passion as they move deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters. Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats. 
EXT.  SUBURBS - DAWN 
The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood. The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than reality.  Did we really see him at all? 
DR. PETERS Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples. I have the appropriate papers. 
INT.  END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT 
RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security. 
RAILLY Oh, God, we don't have time for this. 
ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of clothes and a Walkman. 
DR. PETERS Biological samples.  I have the paperwork right here. 
DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands. 
SECURITY OFFICER I'm going to have to ask you to open this, sir. 
DR. PETERS Open it? (blinks stupidly, then) Of course. 
DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it. 
There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  DR. PETERS pays no attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE. 
SECURITY OFFICER'S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. 
ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the commotion. 
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed glass tube out of the metal cylinder. 
DR. PETERS Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the papers -- it's all proper.  I have a permit. 
SECURITY OFFICER It's empty! 
Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it. 
DR. PETERS Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty! But I assure you, it's not. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. 
RAILLY Please listen to me -- this is very urgent! 
SECOND SECURITY OFFICER You'll have to get in line, ma'am. 
TRAVELER We're all in a hurry, lady.  What's so special about you? 
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers. 
DR. PETERS You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye. 
A beat.  OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes, and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose! 
DR. PETERS It doesn't even have an odor. 
The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing, and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist. 
SECURITY OFFICER That's not necessary, sir.  Here you go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have a good flight. 
Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and shoves them back into his gym bag. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her with his finger. 
SECOND SECURITY OFFICER Who are you calling a "moron"? 
COLE Get your hands off her! 
The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble. 
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get involved.  Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns. 
FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  COLE'S moustache is slipping.  COLE senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look. For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away. 
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away. 
SECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.} HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT. 
DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen. 
The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from the floor beside the search table.  He waves them at DR. PETERS. 
DR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants. 
ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he confronts the SECURITY OFFICER. 
COLE I said, get your hands off her.  She's not a criminal.  She's a doctor...a psychiatrist. 
RAILLY looks alarmed at that. 
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  The FIRST DETECTIVE has the photos in his hand. 
ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates. 
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS! 
RAILLY THERE HE IS!  HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS!  STOP HIM! 
ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE MAN FROM HIS DREAM!

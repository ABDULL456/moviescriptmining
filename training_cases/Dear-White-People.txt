1    NEWS BROADCAST - VARIOUS SCREENS, VARIOUS PLACES             1 
ANCHOR A "race war" has erupted at one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious institutions. 
Glued to this are our story's subjects, who we meet in... 
2    A SERIES OF SHOTS                                            2 
TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor. 
ANCHOR (O.S.) Outrage over an "African American Themed" party organized by predominately white students of Manchester University has resulted in rioting and property damages. 
2A   KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue      2A eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room. 
ANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT'D) Guests were invited to "liberate their inner Negro, fry up chicken, enjoy a sugar water concoction known as Purple drank and wear oversized Barack Obama T-shirts." 
2B   COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts    2B adjusts the straight bangs of her weave to better see the small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips.            * 
ANCHOR (CONT'D) Officials claim an investigation is underway to find those responsible for the event and subsequent riot. 
2C   SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an       2C edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black. 
ANCHOR (CONT'D) In an effort to address diversity issues, the school appointed African American scholar Dr. Walter Fairbanks as Dean of Students. 
2D   LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed    2D glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains his otherwise boyish face. 
ANCHOR (CONT'D) Last year the Dean's office celebrated slight gains in diverse applicants but with many now calling for Fairbanks' resignation, that may have been pre-mature. 
2E   DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his       2E 50's fights a panic as he watches in a stately office. 
ANCHOR (CONT'D) Up next, a cat that loves to water ski? That and more after the break. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS How could this happen? 
TITLE CARD: FIVE WEEKS AGO 
3    EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY                                 3 
This sprawling impressive mix of Colonial, Gothic and Modern architecture is presented like a living brochure. 
SUPERIMPOSE: MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - "NOSCE TE IPSUM" 
As we cut through the living brochure, we're presented with groups and programs. Their CRESTS and titles SUPERIMPOSED. 
SERIES OF SHOTS - TOP ACADEMIC PROGRAMS 
3A   White kids with "Trump" blazers and glares - DESMOND         3A SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. 
3B   Kids with dark eye circles and unkempt hair stand before     3B the BING SCHOOL OF HISTORY. 
3C   A cluster of skinny jeans and expressive hands before the 3C GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL. ONE BLACK KID stands in the back. 
SAM (V.O.) Dear White People. The minimum requirement of Black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two. 
4    INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY                                          4 
Samantha White (Sam) watches the campus through a one way window with the cool but knowing gaze of someone much older. She gets off on sensing and pushing buttons - with a subversive delivery style that boarders on deadpan. 
SUPERIMPOSE: SAMANTHA WHITE, SENIOR, VISUAL AND NEW MEDIA 
SAM (CONT'D) Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone does not count. 
She fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to address a box of pamphlet sized books bearing the title "EBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE." One by one she scribbles her autograph on the books. 
5    EXT. ELLINGTON LIBRARY - DAY                                     5 
SERIES OF SHOTS - NATIONALLY RENOWNED STUDENT GROUPS 
Disheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE. 
5A   Casual Prepsters shoot us the finger - PASTICHE HUMOR INC. 5A 
5B   Hopping out of a taxi is Lionel Higgins. His sweet but       5B insecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head. 
COCO Excuse me? 
HELMUT What part of Chicago you from? 
COCO Hyde Park. 
HELMUT What street? 
COCO Seventy Eighth and -- 
HELMUT -- Seventy Eighth is Southside sweetheart. And you know what they say. You can take the girl out the hood but -- 
COCO -- Ain't nothing hood about me. 
HELMUT Thanks so much for coming in. 
Coco gets up to leave. Tries to recover. 
COCO So what's this show about anyway? 
HELMUT Here's the way reality works sweetheart, I'm the producer. I ask the questions. Be in touch. 
And with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders before unmuting his iPad. 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People I am here to burst your post-racial little bubble. (MORE) 
SAM (O.S.) (CONT'D) Yes Oprah may have her own network, but Ann Coulter is still writing best sellers, Black kids are still getting shot for wearing hoodies, and even here the few vestiges of Black culture are under attack by conservative groups, trustees and yes our very own President Fletcher. 
Helmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin. 
HELMUT This is the school radio? 
13   INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY                         13 
A pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the halls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively debates, flirt and bump the student radio. 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, thanks to the new process of randomizing housing assignments for Sophomores, some of you may be jarred by an assignment to Armstrong/Parker house. 
The owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks. 
TROY Someone turn that trash off. 
SUPERIMPOSE: TROY FAIRBANKS, SENIOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE 
Even with his post workout sweat he looks like the cover of Jet. Troy exudes "approachable homie" as he spots a small group of WHITE SOPHOMORES who walk timidly down the hall. 
TROY (CONT'D) Newbies right? 
The white sophomores nod their heads yes. 
TROY (CONT'D) Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home of the dopest dining hall in all of Manchester. I'm Troy, Head of House. 
SOPHOMORE What's up my brother? 
SAM (O.S.) When encountering a Black person try and stay calm. Don't say things like "what's up" and "my brotha" That's not how you normally talk. 
TROY Ya'll take care. Nice Jordan's bro. 
Coco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls. 
SOFIA Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs. 
COCO You're so cute. 
SOFIA Is it weaved? 
Coco's face is a battle between fury and polite surprise. 
SOFIA (CONT'D) I saw "Good Hair" in Afro studies. 
COCO (moving on) Hey what house did you get? 
SOFIA Huh? Oh Bechet bitch. 
COCO Of course. The mere thought of a Fletcher anywhere else... 
SOFIA Easy, it was the luck of the draw. Daddy had nothing to do with it. 
Coco rolls her eyes behind a smile. 
SOFIA (CONT'D) And honestly, if I had to pick anywhere to be it'd be here. 
REGGIE Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in shucking or was it jiving? 
TROY My major's in Jive. Minoring in Shuck. You're still majoring in trying to fuck my left overs right? 
Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia. 
SOFIA You need a shower. 
15   INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - DAY                                  15 
Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over the toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He jots something down on a notepad as he whispers... 
TROY You went from ODB to Trey Songz... 
16   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT                   16 
The hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black. Helmut West watches from the back. 
TROY Artie, you know your success ratio with the ladies went up like thirty percent after I started edging you up dog, come on. You went from ODB to Trey Songz! 
The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro'd bohemian disciples (who we'll call the BOFROS). Sam records the proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera. 
REGGIE That's his platform? Haircuts? 
SAM Oofta is as Oofta does. 
Coco, sneaks through the door. She's got the eyes of Helmut on her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she sits in the only open spot next to... 
SAM (CONT'D) Just because we're colored don't mean we run on colored people time. 
COCO Boycotting hot combs don't make you an expert on "colored people" boo. 
Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits. 
TROY No but seriously, I care about you guys. I care about this house. We had a great year last year and if it ain't broke... 
Troy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes. 
Sam doesn't want to get up - her breathing gets heavier. 
REGGIE Just pretend like you're in the booth. Just you and the mic. 
SAM Hate this shit. 
As Sam gets up and passes Troy -- 
TROY You really think you can take this from me? 
SAM Troy we live in a world where there's a Big Momma's House 3. I don't have a chance in hell. Thank God. 
Sam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd. 
SAM (CONT'D) Troy my brother, it's broke. 
The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line. 
SAM (CONT'D) Troy's a legacy kid. And yet it's under his watch that Armstrong / Parker, the bastion of Black culture here was gutted. By the Randomization of Housing Act. Second years of color no longer have a say in where they go. The culture that's been fostered in this house for two decades will be wiped out in two years. 
Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up -- 
SAM (CONT'D) This wasn't motivated by a desire to mix things up. Bring about racial and socioeconomic harmony. No, the Black kids are sitting together in the proverbial cafeteria and they must be up to no good. 
Coco's eyes are in the back of her head. 
SAM (CONT'D) We sit together to protect ourselves. Over a century of houses grouped by sports affiliations, political leanings, majors, you name it. Black folks get their own house, suddenly we got a problem? 
Students look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy. 
SAM (CONT'D) This Act doesn't affect the other houses like it does ours. There are plenty of trustees, former coaches, and presidents watching out for the others. All we have is a Dean who'd rather please his massa -- 
TROY -- Yo that's enough of that Sam -- 
SAM -- then stand up for his own. Look, I know ya'll ain't voting for me. Ya'll ain't ready and I didn't come here for that. The Black Student Union and I have brought a petition to repeal the Randomization of Housing Act. I plan on bringing it to the President and together we can bring Black back to Manchester. It'll be by the door. 
Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy - give her daps and all sorts of praise. 
MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand. 
MARTIN I assume everyone has the app I created by now? 
REGGIE (aside) It's a child's app... 
19   EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY                                        19 
Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out to.. 
...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he trades "No Homo's" with the others. 
Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing. 
Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise... 
GEORGE Lionel right? 
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) George. We had Civ last semester? How you doing? 
LIONEL Grood...Gate...I'm ah.. 
GEORGE Fan of your stuff. In the Observer? 
LIONEL No one reads the Observer. 
GEORGE You seen this? 
George hands Lionel Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyer. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) The residents of Armstrong / Parker just made her head of house. Am I crazy or is there a there there? 
LIONEL What made you come over here? 
George holds up Sam's "Ebony & Ivy." Lionel takes it. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) I mean I'm glad you came -- 
GEORGE -- My staff? God bless them. They're whiter than Michael Jackson's kids. We're fucked if anyone of them writes this story and I will not let the transfers at the Gazette do it first. 
LIONEL The oldest one has his face. 
GEORGE You're in the Black Student Union. You probably know Sam. 
Lionel shakes his head "yes" and "no" at the same time. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You come up with a good angle? I want it in the Bugle. 
Lionel eyes the bold "Bugle" logo on George's shirt. 
LIONEL (aside) Trumpet... 
GEORGE Bugle. Focus. The only paper on campus with a national subscription base and an Advisor from the New York Times? Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel. You're good. You belong with us. 
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we know he's never heard these words. Never belonged any place. Doesn't hurt there's a handsome boy smiling at him either. 
20   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                     20 
Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall between them. 
TROY Get it yet? 
Sam shakes her head yes. 
TROY (CONT'D) Good. You've now got the shared calendar, contacts, and official email. 
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack of papers. 
TROY (CONT'D) Oh and before I forget. 
SAM Event requests for the year? 
TROY Just this month. They need your approval. Also don't forget to pick your office hours. At least 20 per week. 
SAM That's absurd. 
TROY You're in charge of a hundred residents now. And they need time to complain to your face. About noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free options in the cafeteria. Etcetera. 
SAM Troy. I didn't think I was going to win. 
TROY And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act isn't gonna do shit. None of the other houses are concerned. 
SAM Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that "random" works out to their advantage. 
TROY And you think a petition is going to change that? 
KURT The biggest athletes, movie stars, hell your president is Black. (MORE) 
KURT (CONT'D) Sometimes I think the hardest thing to be in the American work force right now is an educated white guy. 
SUNGMI You're not serious. 
KURT You guys still got affirmative action, you're set. 
REGGIE This shit. 
SAM What are you doing in here? 
KURT Obama. Leader of the free world got into Harvard on affirmative action. Know who's not president right now? The guy that didn't get in. 
SAM On behalf of the colored folks in the room, let me apologize for all the better qualified white students whose place we're taking up. 
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument. 
SAM (CONT'D) You get lost? Bechet is that way. 
KURT Yeah but what other dining hall gives you chicken and waffles? Dear White People right? Funny stuff. How haven't we staffed you yet? 
SAM On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor magazine? 
KURT We're a lot more than a magazine sweetie. SNL staff is basically half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just like the network comedies. 
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco. 
SAM What gives you Clubhouse kids the right to come to our Dining Hall? 
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese. 
SAM (CONT'D) You don't live here. 
MARTIN Sam? What are you doing? 
SAM You can't eat here. 
Kurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge. 
TROY Chill Sam damn. Let the man-- 
KURT & SAM -- I got this. 
KURT Who are you to put me out? 
SAM (realizing) I'm the Head of this house. And I'm doing things my way. 
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to which Sam slams his tray to the ground. 
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad. 
KURT You got any idea who you're -- 
SAM -- Yeah, I know who your daddy is. The same one who's been pushing to break up this House for a decade. What's wrong? Is he scared letting the Negroes gather in groups might start a rebellion on the plantation? You tell him from me...he should be. 
Kurt looks into Sam's eyes and then his crew. They want out. 
KURT Bad move. 
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight snicker from Lionel which draws Sam's eyes right to him. 
Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts to GEORGE: "I've got the angle. I'm in." 
SAM You too. 
LIONEL Me? 
SAM Is this your house? 
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him. 
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady applause. Troy and his table look around baffled. 
By the caution on Sam's face it seems the first time she's ever heard this sound directed at her. 
A slight envy boils in Coco. 
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out. Locked out again. 
23   INT. COCO'S ROOM - DAY                                       23 
SAM -- Look this thing might as well be my right hand Professor. I was busy this summer that's all. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN With everything but your major? While your peers are taking internships, making short films... 
SAM My dad. He's sick. Had to go home. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN If you need some time off, take it. But if you want to make it to next semester -- 
SAM -- I do -- 
PROFESSOR BODKIN -- Pull it together. This is Manchester. 
Sam wants this. It's in her eyes as she holds her tongue. 
25   EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY                             25 
Sam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys. 
SAM Thematically dubious? 
GABE Well what was that supposed to be about exactly? 
SAM You're thematically dubious! 
Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her. 
SAM (CONT'D) Since when do TA's give critiques? 
GABE You invoke Minstrelsy for shock value, but to what end? 
SAM To invoke the same feeling I get when I turn on the TV and see some so-called reality star shuck and jive for ratings egged on by no doubt white producers. Or the sassy Black secretary with no backstory or character development aside from their skin color. 
GABE So it's a tit for tat?                      * 
EXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY                     * 
SAM                               * You're honestly saying that art             * can't be reactionary?                       * 
GABE                              * You're reacting to a work made              * almost a hundred years ago.                 * 
SAM                               * Yes because fear of Black men being         * involved in the United States               * Government is a completely                  * antiquated concept. No social               * relevance whatsoever today.                 * 
GABE                              * Frankly I just think sometimes its          * better to hold a mirror up to your          * audience than to drop an                    * ideological piano over their head.          * 
SAM                                          * Frankly I just think works that                        * deal with the African Diaspora                         * through a post-modern lens are                         * outright rejected unless they're                       * handled by a white artist.                             * 
GABE                                         * African Diaspora? Really?                              * 
26   INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY                                      26 
The war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs. 
SAM Blackface is alive and well in our culture. Who primarily buys hip hop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta? The same homogenized images of Black people over and over again? White people Gabe. 
GABE Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies? 
SAM We're an underfed community. None of this changes the fact that the vibrancy, the complexity of Black culture has been distilled into commodities and marketing schemes to be bought and sold-- 
GABE --to the detriment of the so called "real thing." Got it. 
And into a room... 
INT. GABE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Gabe slams the door. 
SAM I am indistinguishable from the so called "urban" images used to amuse and market to white America. 
GABE And the commodification of culture is uniquely oppressive to Black people? 
Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans. 
GABE (CONT'D) So when Kanye raps about Louis V and Rolexes and Classical Art, exactly what exploited pocket of Black America are those references being mined from? 
Sam can't get her shirt off fast enough. 
SAM On your knees. 
Gabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
GORDON "The honeys?" You're from Vermont. 
KURT Guys what's the Pastiche motto? 
GORDON "Sharpen thy sword." 
MITCH Our motto is a euphemism for masturbation? 
GORDON It's a reminder that satire is the weapon of reason. So who on campus is being unreasonable? 
MITCH Sounds like a reminder of how gay you are. 
GORDON Was that even a reasonable attempt at a quip Mitch? 
MITCH Hey Gordon, say reasonable again. 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, knowing Lil' Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an Honorary Black Card. It just reminds me how often you say the word "nigga" when no one Black is around as is required in reciting said lyrics. 
Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs headphones into his computer and looks down. 
KURT The hell does Sam think she is? 
MITCH Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a pissed off baby. 
Kurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they're leaning towards the same idea. 
KURT Could we? 
GORDON How? 
Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick. 
KURT Hey Lionel. Talked to the Dean today. (MORE) 
KURT (CONT'D) We had a very enlightening conversation. I just want to say... I'm sorry about the voice message. 
29B   DINING ROOM                                              29B 
Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel's table. Kurt unzips his pants silently. 
KURT (CONT'D) Do you accept? 
Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he starts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly looks in the other direction. Kurt's friends crack up. 
GORDON Please put that away. 
KURT You got to talk to these people in a language they'll understand. 
Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro. 
LIONEL Pathetic. 
KURT (yelling) Wherever he ships you off to, be sure to pack a sense of humor with you, kay bro? 
Lionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam's "Ebony & Ivy" book to a section called... 
SAM (V.O.) The Paper Bag Tests. 
As Lionel reads we swish pan to... 
30    DREAM DINER                                                  30 
...an abstract Diner set. Sam at the counter addresses us. 
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST 
SAM The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly's for a snack. Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you (Black) who once ran up a thirty dollar bill and left a dollar tip. 
WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us. 
Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him. 
SAM (CONT'D) You watch all the other customers order before you do... 
Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel. 
LIONEL Pastrami sandwich on rye. 
SAM ...then proceed to wait no less than forty minutes for your food. 
A wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come. 
As the impromptu party dies down... 
SUNGMI Okay and One Hundred? 
REGGIE Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black as hell just cause. 
Sam rolls her eyes. 
SUNGMI But what about just being you? 
SAM Like I said... 
44   INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT                                       44 
Lionel's got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. Annie's really warmed to him - her hands play with his afro. 
ANNIE You don't mind do you? 
SAM (V.O.) There's only a few ways a person of a color can survive at a place like this... 
LIONEL Of course not. 
GEORGE Alright so then what? 
LIONEL So then Sam says "What, is your daddy scared the Negroes are gonna start a rebellion on the plantation?" 
George goes CRAZY at this. 
GEORGE To Kurt Fletcher!? 
LIONEL Yeah. Yes. Yup. 
GEORGE We've got a news item but there's something bigger here. It's a profile piece on Armstrong / Parker and Sam White's pseudo revolution. 
ANNIE What's the headline? 
LIONEL Outdated nationalist seeks purpose starts race war? 
Lionel's joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it. 
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES before Lionel briefly. 
GEORGE Beers in the corner. Bang out the news item tonight and we'll work on the profile piece for next week. 
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and Annie stare at Lionel expectantly. 
LIONEL What are you doing? 
ANNIE All Bugle staffer must freestyle. It's law. 
GEORGE You want to be a staffer right? 
LIONEL (awkward) My name is Lionel Kind of like a lion King of the jungle Indigenous to Africa... 
The beat has long since stopped. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Sorry. 
45   INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                  45 
Troy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out. 
TROY Yo man, you know I wasn't talking about Sof back there with whole forty bitches thing. I was just -- 
KURT -- trying to get on my staff? 
TROY I never really thought about -- 
KURT -- Bullshit. Game Night is where we make our bids for the new staff. It's why everyone's here. You were practically about to bust out a tap dance. 
TROY I'm a Poly Sci major man. I just came to hang out. 
KURT My staff likes you. A lot. 
TROY But you don't. 
KURT This thing with you and Sof... 
TROY I'm good to her. 
KURT Our dad's have been playing a game of chess off and on since 1972. 
Coco's phone buzzes with a message. It's Kurt. 
COCO (reading) We want you. Come by Ellington tomorrow at eight. (to Troy) Anything? 
Troy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy's eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go. 
COCO (CONT'D) You're going to have to stand up to him sooner or later Troy. 
52   EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY                          52 
Troy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation marks her pretty face. 
SOFIA You said you loved me. 
TROY I like you a lot. 
Salt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her. 
SOFIA What do you do in the bathroom? When you leave the shower running? Was it just to get away from me? 
Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess. 
TROY I smoke weed and write jokes. 
Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as... 
...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before Troy turns to enter the house. 
53    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME                     53 
Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other's gaze. 
As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that they're headed in the same direction. 
53A   UPSTAIRS                                                 53A 
Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it with a key. Troy's already at the door when he looks up and realizes Lionel's just entered his apartment. 
54    INT. TROY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                           54 
TROY The hell are you doing? 
LIONEL & TROY This is my apartment. 
TROY The hell it is. 
LIONEL The Dean said it was the only opening. 
TROY Head of House doesn't share. 
LIONEL But you're not Head of House. 
Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door leaving Lionel alone in the living room. 
57   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                      57 
Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back. 
DREADS Stay Black, my brother. 
LIONEL Sure thing? 
Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the entrance - suddenly chums. Troy's getting good news and gladly shakes Kurt's hand. 
KURT Need your submission by Thursday. 
TROY You got it bro. 
The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt. 
KURT The fuck? 
Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed. 
TROY Yo! 
Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall. 
Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam briefly who shares the same smirk. 
He realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Do you honestly think this is in the spirit of Armstrong / Parker house? 
SAM The role of the counter culture is to wake up the mainstream to -- 
DEAN FAIRBANKS -- I've got furniture older than you. Counter culture? Is that what you think this is? That show of yours? 
SAM What about my show? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Your show is racist. 
SAM Black people can't be racist. 
The Dean is rendered speechless at this statement. 
SAM (CONT'D) Prejudice? Yes. But not racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people can't be racist since they don't benefit from such a system. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Do you read the school papers? 
SAM Is the New York Times a school paper? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Your antics are making press Sam and press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night. 
SAM Warm milk? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS He's building a file on you. 
SAM It's not my fault your son couldn't beat me in an election. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS I'm sure it was hard growing up. Wondering which side you fit into. Feeling like you have to overcompensate perhaps? 
SAM If that's true, I'm not the only one Dean. 
Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank's last words resonate more than she'd like. 
Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit. 
59B   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                   59B 
Huge canvas signs with the words "WHITES ONLY" are strewn about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs. 
Sam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the SUV. 
REGGIE There you are! We supposed to start at noon. 
SAM I told you I had class. 
There's a vibration in Sam's pocket. Her phone says "MOM." She cuts it off and picks up a "white's only" sign. 
REGGIE Those are going up on Gillespie. Good right? 
Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it's too much. Reggie sees a doubt in her eyes. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Yo. What's that? You're not getting cold feet are you? 
SAM No. I mean how long do I have to talk anyway? 
REGGIE You're kidding right? You're sort of the keynote. 
SAM Yeah but...you know I think the whole Malcolm X thing is your lane Reg. I'm just not -- 
REGGIE -- They came to hear you Sam. Grab a bullhorn. Turn it on. 
Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to her phone. Sam checks: "IT'S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME" 
Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe who's just happened upon the parking lot. 
GABE What is all this? 
SAM (on phone) Hey. In the middle of-- -- Okay. Okay. Okay. 
Tears well up in Sam's eyes as she shakes her head no and heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe. 
When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted look of indignation asks her what she's doing. 
REGGIE Sam? 
Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie's heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Sam! 
60    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY                           60 
GABE Everything okay? 
SAM (happy tears) His condition's stable. 
GABE Good. That's good Sam. 
Gabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again. 
SAM Gabe! 
Gabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie... 
GABE What!? 
...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down the heartbroken looks on her disciples' faces. 
SAM I'm sorry. 
And with that she closes the door right on Reggie. 
62   EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT                              62 
Coco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing terrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee's. 
HELMUT New videos are picking up steam. 
COCO Told you I was good TV. 
HELMUT The show I'm scouting for... It's called Black Face / White Place. It's reality. Like a "True Life." Each episode centers on a different one of "us" in a sea of "them." 
COCO Interesting. 
HELMUT Interesting? You think they want interesting? Dignified stories of triumph and survival? (off Coco's naive shrug) They want the "authentic urban experience" which is basically network talk for bitching and weave snatching. I'm telling you this because the network is looking to take one of the subjects to series. I got one episode. One shot to find that subject. So if we do this... 
COCO ...we do it all the way. I'm guessing Sam turned you down. 
HELMUT I think so. She called me a Bojangling Oofta, whatever that means. Everything else she said would've been bleeped on tv. (off Coco's laugh) So look, forty thousand hits on Youtube is good. It's not great. 
COCO I'm about to get a whole lot more. 
63   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - DAY                               63 
Coco sits before a video camera. The room is dim. 
KURT We don't have anyone like you on staff and you had a great idea. We brought you here to -- 
COCO -- I want to MC it. Your party. 
KURT We're here to tell you what we want. 
COCO You want me and in order to get me, you have to let me MC. (MORE) 
COCO (CONT'D) And I want to do a live video blog from my Youtube account. 
BACK TO: 
64    EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY                              64 
HELMUT They'd let you do that? 
COCO They got no choice. They need me -- 
BACK TO: 
65    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                            65 
COCO -- cause without me ya'll look like a bunch of privileged assholes. 
KURT We don't let people video blog our events... 
COCO ...You got a week to put this thing together boo boo. What's it going to be? 
CUT TO: 
66    EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY                              66 
Helmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye. 
COCO You look surprised. 
HELMUT It's just... 
Troy and his father are alone. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You didn't tell me you and Sofia had a misunderstanding. 
TROY Who did? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Her father. She was very upset. (off Troy's silence) Troy. What sort of vision do you have for yourself? 
TROY Get my degree. Then Law School and then -- 
DEAN FAIRBANKS --And what's that got to do with partying with Kurt? With smoking weed and writing jokes? 
Panic flashes over Troy. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) Okay, so what? Is it the spotlight Kurt gets? You want to be on...tv or something? You know how many Black men waste their lives to get on TV? Be rappers and ball players? 
TROY (wanting it to be true) Dad no. I want what we always talked about. Maybe have my own firm someday? Run for office. Make a difference. Wife. Kids. I want all that. I really really do. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS And the drugs? God damn it Troy I taught you better than this. I have been in academia a long time, I've seen a lot of things. The men who really run this world? You got no idea what they see when they see you. You are not going to be what they all think you are. You will not give them that satisfaction, you hear me? 
TROY Yes sir. 
73   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                      73 
Sam steps out of Fletcher's office into the waiting room. Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other down as Kurt enters his father's office. 
A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through the window. 
Sam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and listens in. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER I know about the party. You picked a hell of a time. 
KURT What party -- 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER -- You're cancelling Kurt. End of story. 
75   INT. BULLPEN - DAY                                        75 
Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over hears... 
GEORGE (O.S.) Lionel's story on the would-be protest outside of Gillespie is running tomorrow and I'm also having Lionel work on a profile piece of Armstrong/Parker like you suggested. Really break down what's going on. 
Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a phone call. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Right. It's almost like they recycle so much from their past - Music, food, fashion, and now turbulence. 
This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Thank you so much. Okay, take care. 
George can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie. 
ANNIE Well? 
GEORGE That was our Times advisor. He said it's stories like these that get editors recommendation letters. 
Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but reassured when they see who it is. 
LIONEL The Negro at the door didn't scare you this time. 
Annie smiles and heads for the door. 
ANNIE Lionel please. You're only technically Black. G, going to French. You want me to hold your seat? 
GEORGE Thanks. 
Annie smiles and walks out. 
LIONEL You need something? Saw your e- mail. 
GEORGE Yeah, I need someone to do the Donor's function on Saturday. Small dinner for the school's big givers. Administration wants a little coverage. 
LIONEL That's Halloween night. 
GEORGE Right, which is why no one else will take it. 
LIONEL Ah. Thus the new guy. 
George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets close. 
GEORGE On my way to class, but you can stay and check out last year's piece. You'll do fine. 
LIONEL Hey, some could argue that a show with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty Black show. 
TROY Yeah? That work out for you? 
LIONEL No. No it did not. At least not in High School. I bet there's a statue of you at your High School. 
TROY I was beloved. Won't lie. 
LIONEL Did they know you were a trekker? 
TROY My pops left a paint by numbers template for success at that High School. All I had to do was fill in the blanks. Football captain. Valedictorian. Prom King. 
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy. 
TROY (CONT'D) So what? You're growing that out? 
LIONEL I think it's gaining sentience. 
TROY It's...out there. 
LIONEL It's like a black hole for white people's fingers. They're obsessed. 
TROY You know I cut hair. Why didn't you ask me? 
LIONEL You're I dunno...you? 
Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to Gillespie. 
GEORGE Li! You ready man? 
LIONEL No costumes? I got a tux for this. 
ANNIE We just got out of the staff room. 
GEORGE Yeah, we're going as overworked. 
LIONEL Where is it? 
ANNIE Garmin House. On third I think? 
LIONEL Third and Basin. I know it. 
Before Lionel jets to join them. 
TROY Yo man. If I'd gone to your High School, I'd have had your back. 
Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends. 
78   EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    78 
Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in. 
79   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    79 
The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz. 
It's a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with "Purple Drank." Everyone downs the stuff. 
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 
Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE. 
TROY ...my own firm. Maybe run for office. Make a difference you know? 
The couple smile. A buzz draws Troy's eyes to his phone - photos from "Dear White People" pop up in his news feed. 
80    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    80 
Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel glances at the posters - it's Kurt with a large Afro wig mimicking Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyers. 
LIONEL This is kind of fucked up. Right? 
GEORGE Pastiche. The world's most erudite boneheads. Who wants another round? Come on Lionel, help a brother out. 
LIONEL Kitchen's this way. 
80A   ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS                                       80A 
Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She's feeling herself as she's handed a drink. 
She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw. 
Kurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give him props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the others. His phone rings. 
KURT Yeah? 
INTERCUT 
COCO Kurt, it's me. I can't do this. 
KURT Okay, I'm fucking confused. 
85    INT. SAM'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     85 
Lionel sits across from Sam. 
SAM What do you want me to do? Go over there and yell at them? 
LIONEL Have you heard you yelling? 
SAM This house is filled with folks willing to take up after a cause Lionel. Believe me. Never would have guessed you'd be one of them but... 
LIONEL For the first time in my life, I can't just sit around and do nothing. How can you? 
SAM If I'm caught being a part of anything like this...it wouldn't be good for me right now okay? 
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door. 
SAM (CONT'D) I'm done being everybody's angry Black chick. 
Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out. 
Sam's focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks. 
86    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT                        86 
Lionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER. 
86A   DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS                                    86A 
Lionel gingerly walks in the room. He's still an outsider here - but something's changed in him. 
LIONEL Hey. How's it going. Hi. 
No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations. Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Hey...what is this? 
SUNGMI Black Student Union. 
Lionel smiles shyly. He should've known that. 
Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front. 
DREADS Your call then man. 
REGGIE (to everyone) Alright ya'll - thanks for coming out tonight. Looks like Sam's not making it so...let's just call it. 
The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think... 
LIONEL Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lionel. Some of you...none of you probably know me. I've never been to a meeting. But I just came back from a party on campus and I think you should know about it. 
Lionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. He's got the judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an open laptop on a desk. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Anybody mind if I? 
Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel browses through the photos. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) I mean...I don't know. This is fucked up right? 
REGGIE Alright brother. What's the plan? 
Lionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. They're mobilizing. Readying for action. Lionel steels himself. 
LIONEL We go over there. Now. 
CURLS Think there's enough of us? 
SUNGMI You know you don't have a monopoly on being a pissed off minority. Latino's United is meeting across the hall. Asian American League too. (off the stares) You guys got better snacks. 
87   INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT                                  87 
Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses. 
LIONEL Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo! 
The crowd is with it - thinks it's part of the show as Lionel proceeds to freestyle terribly... 
LIONEL (CONT'D) My name is Lionel, Some people call me Li. Lots of people think that I talk kinda white. Well that's alright. Yeah that's cool. I'd rather you think I'm white, than tap dance for you. 
With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over. 
Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock. 
Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground. Lionel's off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes Kurt away in his defense. 
Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT. 
More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the party disintegrates into chaos. 
Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera. 
Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on the ground. Arguments come to physical blows. 
The steel in Sam's gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak? 
And then she spots... 
...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door. Sam's camera and mic stay trained on Coco. 
COCO What? Say it. Come on. 
Sam stays silent. 
COCO (CONT'D) This may come as a shock, but these people don't give a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman. They pay millions of dollars on their tans, their lips, their asses, Jay- Z tickets, you name it, cause they wanna be us. (MORE) 
COCO (CONT'D) So they got to be for a night.I'm not about to go out into the streets in protest of a Halloween party. 
Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco realizes it's herself she's trying to convince. 
Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is new for her. Keeping her mouth shut. 
89   EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   89 
Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night. 
90   EXT. KURT'S YARD - NIGHT                                    90 
Kurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the ground. 
KURT Dude. I know you can't help it... 
Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down. 
KURT (CONT'D) ...but why are you such a fag dude? 
Lionel spits in Kurt's face and pops right back up again. We see it in his eyes - he'll never give up. 
Kurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. He pushes him down again. Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche - some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back. 
Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt's eyes. Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard. 
LIONEL Finally got me where you want me. 
Kurt's in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him. 
Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt's let up. For a moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support. 
The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out. 
The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him. 
Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard - One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him. 
91    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    91 
The motor on Sam's Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a complete standstill. 
Troy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer. 
Dean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos. Sam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS What is all this? 
92    INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                      92 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Who's this? 
Kurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him. 
KURT My lawyer. 
CUT TO: 
94B   We'll be cross cutting between several of these sessions. 94B 
COCO So when I got the invite and saw everyone clicking "yes" I figured it was back on. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You were hoping to make the staff? 
COCO 
CUT TO: 
DEAN FAIRBANKS At what point in time did you show up to the event? 
94C   Sam sits with arms folded.                                  94C 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) Samantha. Please. 
SAM Why am I even here? 
CUT TO: 
KURT 94              Guys throw parties at the house all               94 the time. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS We know you were planning this. 
KURT Your son tell you that? 
CUT TO: 
94D   Fairbanks stares down his son. Troy is silent and anxious. 94D 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (reading) "...wishing you could sip on Henny out yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving you the side-eye?" (and then) You write this Troy? 
Troy looks up at his father embarrassed. 
TROY No. Mine wasn't chosen. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS But you wanted to be? 
TROY What I wanted didn't matter then. Why should it matter now? I told you about the party, remember? 
CUT TO: 
DEAN FAIRBANKS 94              The invite came from the Pastiche               94 Facebook account. 
KURT I loathe Facebook. 
An OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear. 
KURT (CONT'D) You've got to believe me. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You've used that line on me before this year Mr. Fletcher. When a homophobic message mysteriously appeared on a voice mail line you shared with a roommate. 
CUT TO: 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) What were your intentions when you went back the second time? 
LIONEL To stop it. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS By any means necessary? 
LIONEL Someone once told me...Manchester is like jazz. I don't know much about jazz. But from what I can tell, when your solo's up, you better blow. 
Fairbanks fights a smile. 
CUT TO: 
94C                       SAM                                    94C All I did that night was hit record brother. 
The Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and looks out his huge windows onto the campus below. 
CUT TO: 
94E   The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials    94E are taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day. 
Gabe fights the urge to hug her. 
SAM We were actually on the phone last night for hours. First time we talked since the bypass. He was putting up a strong front. Teasing me about being so worried. Then came the stories about me as a little girl I'd heard a thousand times. About how independent I was. 
Gabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment. 
GABE Want to talk about it? 
SAM My mother worked nights so he would take me to school. And it pissed me off because he would follow me all the way to homeroom. Every time he tried to hold my hand I'd scream and pull away. He thought I was just being...difficult. 
A hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them? 
SAM (CONT'D) But it was the kids. And the parents and the teachers. They'd see this Black girl and this white man and wonder what we were doing together. Even at nine I could feel their eyes on me. Especially at nine. It brought tears to my eyes. 
Gabe's stone face melts at this. 
SAM (CONT'D) I was just a bratty girl, didn't know any better but-- The thought of losing him-- You know? I just feel so bad. How awful am I to do that to him? To anyone I love? 
Gabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His arm is on her shoulder now. 
GABE I'm sure he forgives you. 
SAM Think so? 
Gabe nods. Sam's normal defenses come back up lest she cries. 
SAM (CONT'D) So anyway. I didn't mean to say all of that. I don't know why I did. 
GABE Sam. Where are you going? 
SAM I don't know. Lunch? 
Gabe starts to walk with her. 
GABE Isn't it Mac and Cheese day at Armstrong/Parker? 
SAM Think they'll let you in? 
Gabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into each others' eyes. 
Don't even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.

Coco sits across from Helmut. He's got his eyes on a Youtube clip from Sam's movie featuring Coco. 
COCO (YOUTUBE) I know this may come as a shock, but they don't give a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman... 
HELMUT Two hundred thousand views. Look they even auto-tuned it. 
With a click Helmut pulls it up. 
AUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE) Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin Tubman! Don't give a fuck about no muthafuckin Tubman! 
Coco's not sure what to think. 
HELMUT Couple months, that's how long shooting for an episode takes. We recommend you cut your course load in half to accommodate the schedule. 
COCO Half? 
HELMUT Trust me it it'll read "full-time" in the episode. If...once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule. 
COCO For shooting? 
HELMUT For uh...classes and stuff. Won't be graduating early anymore sweetheart. 
Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco. 
HELMUT (CONT'D) Five grand for the episode. Twenty each if you get picked up for series. What do you say? 
Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut. 
HELMUT (CONT'D) Trust me sweetie it's the same out there as it is in here. Good news is? Against all that damn white you and I? We pop. Think I wanted to be the go-to producer for all things Black? 
Coco shrugs. 
HELMUT (CONT'D) Tell you what's worse though. Being that broke Nigga stuck on the south side of Chicago. Hundred and Fiftieth street. 
Coco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --

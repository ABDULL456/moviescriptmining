"FATAL INSTINCT" 
Screenplay by 
David O'Malley 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN ON: 
EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT 
The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell. 
CLOSE SHOT - A PAIR OF SEXY HIGH HEELS 
and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier. 
OPENING TITLES & CREDITS OVER. 
After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with each step. 
The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond. 
NED (V.O.) To some guys, women are like a cheap puzzle... with pieces that just don't fit. They think the soul of a woman is darker than a back alley... more tangled than a telephone cord... and colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada. But those guys don't even have a clue. 
She stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term "femme fatale" was coined for her. She's on display... and knows it. 
NED (V.O.) When you know women the way I do, you understand exactly what what makes them tick... what makes them hum... what makes them jiggle up and down when they walk. And it's not the kind of thing you can learn from a correspondence course. 
The CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM. 
One is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost. 
Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his fingers. 
The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola. 
ANGLE - LOLA - NED'S POV 
She walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing. 
NED (V.O.) There are two kinds of women in this world... and I've known 'em both. 
ANGLE - ARCH 
Arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't "voice-over" narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud. 
NED (V.O.) One will take you for a fast ride on a bumpy road with no seat belt. But the other kind... 
ARCH (interrupts) Jeez... knock off the chatter, will ya. 
NED Just trying to keep you awake, Arch. 
ARCH I'm awake! Where do you come up with all that crap about women? 
NED It's true. Women are very complex, but if you know how to read 'em... they're an open book. You can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches. 
ARCH Are you kiddin'? 
NED I'd stake my career on it. Anybody ever proves me wrong, I'll throw away my badge. 
ARCH Aayyhh... women are trouble... 
NED I used to believe that too. Until I married Lana. Now, she... is a peach. 
ARCH Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home. Everything a guy could ever want, including NO kids. 
NED I'd love to have kids. 
ARCH What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break! (looks around) Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes you think Milo's gonna show up here? 
NED Logic. He knocked off all those banks. He's got cash. He's gonna want to spend it. This is one of the few places that still takes cash. Sooner or later... he's gotta turn up. 
ARCH And how we s'posed to recognize this scumbag? 
NED The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you see him... you'll know him. 
In the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through the panty-hose pulled down over his head. 
ARCH These are the best damn Nachos in North America. Maybe the world! 
He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and turns the container over. 
ARCH I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill. You want some? 
Ned shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean. 
A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME. 
A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes. 
LOLA Got a light? 
INT. BUMPER CAR PAVILION - NIGHT 
...and drags a FLUSTERED MAN out of a bumper car, jumps in, and speeds away! 
A beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch. Ned flashes his badge at a FRECKLE-FACED KID in one of the bumper cars. 
NED Police emergency! I need your car! 
He pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable FLASHING RED LIGHT on the dashboard... then speeds off after Milo, a SIREN WAILING! He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper cars in the pavilion. 
Ned's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside. Milo turns the wheel, RAMMING Ned! Ned RAMS him back, both bumper cars swerving violently... spraying SPARKS! 
Ned SLAMS Milo's car again! Milo loses control, spins out and SMASHES into the pavillion railing! 
Ned swerves to avoid a collision, but RAMS into two other bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. A BEAT. The AIRBAG inflates in his bumper car. 
Arch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage. They turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an alley between two buildings. A sign on the building says: DEAD END ALLEY. 
Ned and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow after Milo.

Sequence omitted from original script. 
IN THE ALLEY 
Milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. Suddenly, Ned's hand shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard. 
Milo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a handcuff on his wrist. He shoves Milo's arm against the fence and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink. 
A SWITCHBLADE flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp CLICK! Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face. On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and flips Milo's knife away. 
Milo pulls a .45 Calibre REVOLVER with his free hand! Ned shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. Milo looks surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back. 
NED You take science in high school, Milo? 
MILO I skipped high school, cop! 
NED Then you're probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics. 
MILO What about it? 
NED If you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed, the explosive force multiplies by twenty-three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity? 
MILO Yeah. So? 
NED The gun will blow up in your hand... and it won't even scorch my pinkie. 
MILO Ha! That's just theoretical hypothesis. Inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment. 
NED Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart guy. Let's find out. 
Milo hesitates, unsure. Finally, he releases the gun. Ned raises it up on the end of his finger. Arch pulls it off with a loud POP! 
Ned cuffs Milo's hands behind him... spins him around. 
NED You have the right to remain silent... next... if you waive that right, anything you say... next... 
REVEAL ARCH 
holding up a series of "cue cards"... as Ned reads from them. 
NED ...may be used against you in a court of law... next... You have the right to an attorney... Do you have an attorney? 
MILO Nahhhh! 
NED Then today's your lucky day... 
He flips out a business card, handing it to Milo. 
ANGLE - THE BUSINESS CARD 
It reads... "Ned Ravine - Defense Attorney" 
EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DAWN 
Large. Expensive. Impressive. The name on the mailbox reads "Ned and Lana Ravine." 
We begin to HEAR the O.S. SOUND of passionate lovemaking! 
OMIT 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOUSE - DAWN 
The CAMERA MOVES up the stairs, into the bedroom. Still O.S., we hear more heavy breathing... urgent whispers... lust... passion... squeaky bedsprings! 
A trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the bed... shoes, a dress, slip, bra, nylons, panties... greasy coveralls with a "Frank Kelbo - Mobile Mechanic" namepatch, dirty work boots, a wrench and a gigantic grease gun... 
The bed shakes violently. A female VOICE calls the shots as various tools drop to the floor. 
OMIT 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY 
Richly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books. As in all "Noir" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room. Ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk. 
LAURA, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer office, files in hand. She is Ned's astute, dedicated, self- sacrificing "girl-friday" and legal secretary. She keeps his life from spinning crazily apart. She absolutely adores him. 
NED Laura... do you know where...? 
LAURA (hands him file) Right here. The judge decided to skip arraignment and take Milo direct to trial. You're six minutes late, but don't sweat it. You got Judge Allen. He's always eleven minutes late. 
She picks up a lawbook, flips it open to a dog-eared page. 
LAURA I suggest you try Lemming versus Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed. 
NED (thinks about it) Yeah. Good idea. 
He smiles gratefully... drops the file into his briefcase. 
Ned heads for the office washroom. Laura darts ahead of him into the washroom and turns the water on. 
Ned steps in... splashes some water on his face. Laura grabs a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly... hands it to Ned. He dries his face, looking at her with genuine fondness and gratitude. 
NED I don't know what I'd do without you? 
She glances toward the toilet, notices it hasn't been flushed. She FLUSHES it, lowers the seat. 
LAURA Really? 
She sits down on the toilet seat, watching him adoringly as he shaves with an electric razor. 
NED Laura, how long have you worked for me? 
LAURA Two years, seven months, twenty-three days, nineteen hours... (checks her watch) ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds. (softly, to herself) ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty- five... fifty-six... 
NED And when was the last time I gave you a raise? 
Laura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a point. 
LAURA Never. But that's okay. I don't need a raise. In fact... I was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary. 
He clicks off the razor, turns to look at her for a long moment, considering this, then... 
NED Naw. That's okay. You keep it. 
He gives her a manly pat on the shoulder then casually tosses the towel onto the rack, where it hangs sloppily askew... right next to her face. He exits. 
Laura stares at the towel with a tortured expression. The CAMERA PUSHES IN to her face as we see... 
INT. ULTRA-MODERN BEACH HOUSE - DAY 
Scrawled on a steamed-up bathroom mirror - FLASHBACK - CAPE COD - THREE YEARS EARLIER. A hand wipes the mirror off, revealing Laura... younger, longer hair, with a nasty black eye. 
LAURA'S HUSBAND appears behind her, glaring insanely. He looks toward the towel rack. 
There are three towels... with HIS - HIS - HIS embossed along the bottom edge. One towel hangs longer than the others. 
LAURA'S HUSBAND Did we forget something? 
She meekly lines up all the towels. 
LAURA'S HUSBAND Did we forget something? 
She meekly lines up all the towels. 
INT. BEACH HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY 
Laura's Husband pulls the cupboard open. All the cans and boxes are neatly stacked in straight lines. All except one. She straightens it... trembling with fear. 
EXT. DECK OF BEACH HOUSE - DAY 
He pulls her outside, nodding toward a line of tall PINE trees behind the house. They are all straight and even... except one, whose tall branches tower conspicuously above the rest. 
He holds up a chainsaw, nodding toward the trees. Shaking and tearful... she backs into the house. 
END FLASHBACK 
BACK TO LAURA 
SCREAMING out in terror! Ned rushes in, shaking her. 
NED Laura. Laura! What is it? 
LAURA (coming out of it) I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a bit... claustrophobic... in the bathroom. 
NED Maybe we should try some prune juice. 
He gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze, then exits. She shakily straightens the towels and regains her composure. 
Ned opens a wardrobe closet in his office. He walks along, looking at thirty exactly identical blue suits, hanging neatly. Laura follows behind him. He stops and stares, indecisive. 
He lays them on the corner of the stand... then slips into the chair. He picks the cards up and flips thru them. On the back we can see scribbled... "NED'S IDIOT CARDS" 
NED Yeah. These are them. 
Ned jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the cards. 
NED Reading from the cards now... quote "You have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say... may be used against you in a court of law." Is that right? 
NED (back in the chair) That's right. 
NED (stands up, announces) WRONG! The official Miranda warning is... "anything you say CAN be used against you in a court of law." Not "may"... "CAN!" (on the attack) Don't you know the difference between "can" and "may", Detective? Every school kid knows "can" is a verb that indicates ability to perform, while "may" is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act. 
Ned pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he hits the chair. 
NED I didn't have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns! I was trying to protect society from a deranged MADMAN! (leaps up, pointing) But this ivy league fop...!!! 
The courtroom ERUPTS! The Judge bangs the gavel. Ned strides proudly toward the defense table. 
NED I have no more use for this witness. 
JUDGE ALLEN Mr. Ravine... 
Ned turns. The Judge motions with a finger for Ned to approach the bench. Ned does, resting his hand on it. 
JUDGE ALLEN I'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar. 
The Judge smacks Ned's hand with a ruler! 
NED Ow! 
PROSECUTOR (jumps up) But your Honor...! 
JUDGE ALLEN I know, I know. It's a technicality. But it's the kind of technicality that makes the American legal system what it is today! Court's adjourned! 
The Judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it on the bench like a gavel. BAM! BAM! BAM! It is DEAFENING! Everyone covers their ears in pain. 
The THX Sound System Logo appears at the bottom of the screen... along with "The Courtroom Is Listening" 
INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Ned turns the key... enters through the private door. He HEARS the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing Lola's Theme... his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the outer office. 
ANGLE - NED'S POV THRU OPENING 
A gorgeous pair of legs, sleek nylons, high-heeled shoes. 
There are several CANDY WRAPPERS, CIGARETTE BUTTS and other pieces of TRASH stuck to the bottom of one shoe. 
NED 
pushes the door open. It's Lola. She wears a tight white dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat. The hat tips up slowly, revealing her eyes. 
LOLA I waited. You never came back. 
Ned reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel. 
NED I got busy. Here's that paper towel I promised. 
LOLA Thanks... 
NED How'd you get in? The door was locked. 
Lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin. She smiles. 
LOLA It's miraculous what a real woman can do... with a bobbie pin. 
Ned looks at the door. The frame and lock have been brutally chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! She pulls out a pack of cigarettes... BLACK LUNG LITES. 
LOLA (offering) Cigarette? 
NED No... thanks. They're bad for ya. 
He goes to the water cooler. She lights up, exhaling a soft cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring. 
LOLA Yes, I know. I like things that are bad for me. (touching lawbooks) So... I hear you go both ways. 
Ned hesitates... about to drink from the paper cup. 
NED Only once. It was a fraternity prank. I never saw him again. 
He gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand. 
LOLA No, I mean... you're a cop and a lawyer. 
NED Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets... but they all deserve a fair and costly trial. 
Ned turns, tries to casually "dunk" the crumpled cup in the waste basket. He misses. 
Laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms. She sees Ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to pick it up. 
LAURA I'll get that. 
She picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket. 
FRANK I came back for my shower cap. 
Lana, now wearing the diaphanous gown, pulls him inside. She kisses him hungrily, slipping a frilly plastic shower cap with a gaudy floral design on his head. 
LANA Yeah, well you came to the right place. 
She walks to the living room. Frank follows, still wearing the shower cap. Lana snaps her fingers. 
LANA Sit down. 
He sits in a chair, looking around. 
FRANK Where is he? 
LANA On duty all night. By the time he wraps up his reports, it'll be close to noon tomorrow. 
She sits on the couch, picks up a stack of papers. 
LANA I was just reading over... 
She looks up at Frank. Sees the shower cap. 
LANA Take off the hat, Frank. 
He slips the shower cap off as Lana continues. 
LANA I was just reading over my husband's insurance policies. You wouldn't know anything about insurance, would you, Frankie? 
FRANK Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies part-time. I got half a brain... or didn't you notice? 
LANA I musta had my eye on something else. (hands him papers) How about a translation. 
He flips through, scanning the pages, shrugging. 
FRANK Standard accident policy... all the usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three million bucks! (flips page) And there's a triple indemnity rider. 
LANA Meaning? 
FRANK Aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium. If the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the policy. 
LANA Nine million dollars...? 
FRANK Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the company. Nobody ever collects. 
LANA Why not? 
FRANK Well, like here... it only pays off if he's shot with a pistol, falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream. 
LANA All three? 
FRANK See what I mean, sweetheart? What are the odds of that? 
LANA It could happen. (dramatic beat) Suppose it did happen? 
FRANK Then you'd be rich. 
LANA Then we'd be rich. 
FRANK What're you sayin'...? 
She drops to her knees in front of him, her face close to his, speaking with a persuasive urgency. 
LANA We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch! And I know exactly how! He has a legal symposium in Santa Barbara this weekend... All we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving. 
FRANK How we gonna do that? Didn't you tell me he hates trains? 
LANA That's where you come in, baby. You're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. That should be no problem for you. 
She gets up, walks to the adjoining room... snapping her fingers at her side. He follows. 
She steps to a table, pulls the cover off an elaborate scale- model of Dealey Plaza and a train station, complete with HO- Scale model trains chugging around the tracks. 
She uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot. 
LANA Then... we give him a lift to the train station... through Dealey Plaza, past the Book Suppository and around the grassy knoll... 
FRANK Isn't that out of our way? 
Ignoring this, she turns the LIGHTS OFF, walks over to a screen and picks up a remote control. She clicks the button. A SLIDE PROJECTOR comes on, throwing an IMAGE on Frank's back. We can read the words: THE PLAN. 
LANA Move, Frank. 
He moves over. "THE PLAN" appears on the screen. 
LANA And pay attention. 
As she talks, IMAGES appear on the screen, accompanying her rapid spiel. We see: a shot of the depot, a map of the rail route, a gun, a river, a Bingo game, baseball action and a huge dollar sign! 
LANA Ten minutes out of the station he'll be standing in the vestibule between cars... trying to avoid a panic attack. Fourteen minutes and ten seconds out, the train crosses the Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds, I shoot him, shove him out the door... he hits the river and drowns. Bingo! A triple play. We're rich! 
The lights click ON. 
FRANK You been thinking about this a lot, haven't you? 
NED Damn birds! 
He grabs his shoe, heaving it toward the open window. 
EXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Frank glances back up at the bedroom window with an arrogant smirk. WHAP! Ned's shoe hits him right in the face! 
EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY 
Ned comes down the courthouse steps. He pauses in the street, glimpsing the back of a WOMAN passing nearby... a STUNNING BLOND decked out in a clinging dress and fashionable hat... a long strip of toilet paper trailing from her high heel shoe. It must be LOLA. He turns to watch her. 
A HORN BLARES! BRAKES SCREECH! The SOUND OVERLAPS to... 
INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY 
The door opens. Ned enters, looking terrible. Suit ripped, hair messed up, bruised and battered, briefcase crushed. 
LAURA My God, Ned... you look like you were hit by a bus. 
NED I was. (notices) Who's in my office? 
LAURA Max Shady's mother. 
NED Not again. 
INSIDE THE OFFICE 
MRS. SHADY, an older woman with a pleasant appearance, sits in an overstuffed leather chair. Ned and Laura enter. 
NED Hello, Mrs. Shady. 
Ned goes straight to his office closet, pulls out an identical blue suit... and starts stripping off his tattered clothes. 
NED Laura... check on my insurance. Make sure it's paid up. 
Laura reluctantly returns to the outer office. 
MRS. SHADY Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max, is getting out of prison tomorrow. 
NED (checks his watch) Gee, has it been seven years already? 
MRS. SHADY Seven long, miserable years in the slammer. And he's a bit pissed off. 
NED Well, being locked in a tiny room with no TV can make a guy feel pretty tense. 
MRS. SHADY I'm very concerned about him, Mr. Ravine. He said you were a two-bit shyster... and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling ball! 
He goes to her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder, looking her right in the eye, attempting to provide solace. 
NED I'm sure the experience wasn't all negative. He probably made a lot of friends... 
MRS. SHADY (ever hopeful) You think? 
NED ...learned a useful trade... 
MRS. SHADY Oh yes... live autopsies... 
NED ...caught up on all those books he wanted to read... 
She struggles to her feet feebly... 
MRS. SHADY Maybe so... but he said he's going to punch you in the testicles... 
She hauls off and PUNCHES him like a pile driver! WHAM! He doubles over, gasping. 
MRS. SHADY ...smash your face... 
She KNEES him in the face, raising him up... then nails him with a devastating RIGHT CROSS, spinning him around. He collapses over the desk. 
MRS. SHADY ...and decimate your wardrobe. 
She grabs the tail of his suit jacket and rips it up the back! 
MRS. SHADY And I wouldn't want that to happen. (spanks his butt) He's a naughty naughty boy. I just thought I should warn you. 
She turns and shuffles out, passing through the outer office. 
MRS. SHADY (to Laura) Bye for now. (pauses by desk) Oh... may I have a cookie? 
LAURA (at file cabinet) Sure. 
She grabs a handful of cookies and casually flings them at Laura... as she heads out the door. 
MRS. SHADY Thank yooooooooou. 
Laura rushes into Ned's office with the file folder. He staggers unsteadily by the desk. 
LAURA Oh my God, Ned. 
NED I hate when she comes to see me. 
LAURA Don't you realize, Ned?... you could be in real danger. 
He steps out, pauses... turns to her. 
NED Don't forget to lock up. 
Ned pulls the door shut. The lock CLICKS. He pauses by his car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the door. 
He tries the knob, but the door is locked. He looks through the small window. He sees Lola standing inside... breathing heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister, hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart. 
He pushes against the door. It won't budge. He goes to the large window, gazing inside. She slides one hand enticingly across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose. 
He points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it. She looks away. Frustrated, Ned tries the window. It's locked. 
He picks up a wrought iron chair, SLAMS it into the window! The heavy chair falls apart. The glass doesn't even vibrate! 
He sees a riding power mower in the driveway... jumps into the seat, starts the engine... barreling toward the front of the house! THUNDER CRASHES and LIGHTNING FLASHES in the sky! 
He PLOWS into the side of the house, SMASHING a huge hole thru the wall!... MOWING a swath in the carpet! 
Lola GASPS. Ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her. She opens her arms, breathless. The MUSIC SWELLS dramatically! She intercepts him, embracing him passionately. 
LOLA I knew you'd come back... 
NED (looking past her) I forgot my car keys. 
He struggles free, grabbing his car keys from the hall table. She follows, embracing him again, even more tenaciously. 
LOLA That's not what you came back for. 
NED Yes it is. 
Impatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him hard, desperately clawing at his clothes. She's relentless... devouring him with her lips and tongue. 
Overwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion. His car keys drop from his hand. She pushes him down toward the floor. 
LOW ANGLE - AT FLOOR LEVEL 
Her hands grasp his shirt, ripping it open. The buttons fly in all directions! She grabs at his leather belt, twisting it in her hands... ripping it in two! 
She grabs his pants by the cuffs... rips one pant leg off! Then the other!... tossing them over each shoulder! 
Ned and Lola tumble across the floor, arms and legs entangled... rolling themselves up in a rug in the process. 
ANGLE - FIREPLACE 
A roaring fire. We HEAR O.C. MOANING and HEAVY BREATHING. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a sheepskin rug in front of the fireplace. No one is there! A crystal vase falls, CRASHING on the stone hearth. The CAMERA TILTS UP to REVEAL Ned and Lola... stretched out on the mantle, ravishing each other. 
ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR 
The door suddenly BURSTS OPEN! Ned and Lola tumble out... wrapped in each other's arms, food tumbling out with them. 
OMIT 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
ANGLE - THE DINING ROOM TABLE 
The table wiggles. The CAMERA MOVES UP to REVEAL Ned and Lola kissing passionately. She lays on the table, arms and legs stretched upward... a spinning plate balanced on the pointed finger of each hand... and a large spinning platter balanced on the end of her pointed left toe. Her right foot brushes the platter to keep it spinning. The Ed Sullivan Show position. 
SEVERAL ANGLES - IN BED 
-- Ned and Lola's entangled legs, moving under the sheets. 
-- Ned sitting, wrists tied to the brass bed with silk scarves. 
-- Lola, also with her wrists tied to the bed with silk scarves. 
-- Then... A WIDER ANGLE... revealing that they are BOTH tied... at opposite ends of the same bed! 
ANGLE - THE BASEMENT STAIRS 
Wrapped in each other's arms, they tumble down the stairs... crashing into a workbench, still kissing passionately! 
ANGLE - A WALL SOCKET 
Ned's hand plugs in a cord. RACK FOCUS to a soft lamb's wool BUFFER WHEEL rising into frame, WHIRRING. It dips into an open can of FLOOR WAX... then moves over to Lola's naked body, buffing the surface of her skin to a high gloss. The CAMERA MOVES to her EYES. They're CROSSED in ecstasy. 
ANGLE - THE BEDROOM FLOOR 
HEAVY BREATHING. SQUEAKY BED NOISES. The CAMERA MOVES up along the mattress. The bed moves with a jerky rhythm. The CAMERA REVEALS Lola's hand, grasping the sheet tightly. WE MOVE UP to Lola, lying face down against the pillow. 
LOLA (breathless) ...don't... stop... 
FULL SHOT - THE BED 
Ned jumps up and down on the bed like a trampoline! Lola is on her stomach, bouncing each time Ned's feet hit the bed. 
LOLA ...Oh Ned... please... don't... stop... 
He does a complete BACK FLIP!... then keeps bouncing. 
EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
The wind blows. THUNDER and LIGHTNING! RAIN pours down. 
His voice begins to ECHO and FADE as the CAMERA MOVES IN to a CU of Lola's enraged EYES! 
NED (voice echoing) ...you aren't very attractive... you aren't very attractive... you aren't very attractive... 
And then WE SEE... 
A CLOSE SHOT of her hand, grasping the ice pick... scratching it along the side of the tub, peeling back the porcelain. A GRATING SCREECH OVERLAPS to... 
INT. PET STORE - DAY 
TIGHT on a SCREECHING TROPICAL BIRD. We PULL BACK to reveal Ned looking around the store. His ripped pants have been temporarily repaired with big pieces of masking tape. A CLERK steps over with two big Parrots on her shoulders. 
CLERK Don't touch anything. You bond with it... you buy it. Whatdya want? 
NED I'd like to buy a pet. 
She eyes him suspiciously. 
CLERK Yeah. For what purpose? 
NED It's a gift... for my wife. 
CLERK Right. They all say that. 
NED She spends a lot of time alone. I thought it might be nice if she had something to keep her company. 
CLERK Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know you're not the kind of guy who punches out parakeets? Or takes some poor defenseless animal, throws it in a sack and runs over it with your car five or six times. 
NED I would never hurt an animal. 
CLERK Boy, I would. They're driving me CRAZY! 
Turns and SHOUTS at the noisy birds. 
CLERK Shuddup! 
They do. She turns back to Ned. 
CLERK Okay... tell me more about this broad you're married to. I like to match people with the pets they deserve. 
INT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
A typical police squad room... smoke-filled, cluttered, busy. Arch sits at a desk doing paperwork, surrounded by the Gang Members... who are also filling out papers. Arch SINGS to himself, munching on nachos from a big pile of chips. The Gang Members harmonize with him. 
A Gang Member reaches for a nacho chip. Arch grabs for the gun in his shoulder holster. 
ARCH Uh-uh. 
The Gang Member drops the chip. Arch pops it in his mouth, continues singing. The Gang Members join in with harmony. 
Ned enters in the background, carrying a box with airholes in it. He steps over to his desk, looking at the singing Gang Members, then motions like a choir leader, cutting them off neatly. 
NED (doubtful) You do all my paperwork? 
They all hand over their completed paperwork. Ned stares at them for a beat... surprised. 
NED Get out of here. 
They do. He opens the files... checks out the papers. Arch notices something O.S. and gets up. 
ARCH And a damn good job, too. One of 'em even did it in Spanish. 
Arch turns the sound up on a wall-mounted TV monitor. 
ARCH Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours. 
On the screen... it's Max Shady speaking to the press. 
MAX (O.S.) (on T.V.) ...I'd like to reach down Ned Ravine's throat and pull out his guts with my bare hands! 
ARCH (shocked) Jesus... you hear that? 
NED He's just working through his anger, trying to find a constructive outlet. 
ARCH Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The guy's a friggin' looney! 
NED Trust me, I spent a lot of time with him when I was preparing his case. He's really a very sweet, sensitive human being. 
MAX (on T.V.) I'd like to mash his head like a ripe melon... 
NED He gets a little melon-dramatic. 
MAX (on T.V.) ...then cut off all his fingers and rip out his liver with my teeth! 
NED (shrugs) See. Loves to exaggerate. 
Arch slumps in his chair, really stunned. 
ARCH Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit. 
Ned laughs it off. He starts checking through the messages and paperwork on his desk. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up. 
NED Lieutenant Ravine. 
She steps into the doorway of his office. 
LAURA Were you? 
NED What? 
LAURA There's lipstick on your collar. 
She returns to her desk. Disturbed, Ned quickly pulls the shirt collar out, checks it. 
NED No there isn't. 
LAURA No... there isn't. But you answered my question. She's a real looker, huh? 
NED Who? 
LAURA Lola Cain. 
NED I hadn't noticed. 
She opens the blinds behind her and looks at Ned through the window between their offices. 
LAURA Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't noticed. (returns to work) That's alright. She noticed enough for both of us. 
She picks up a stack of papers from the FAX machine. Ned steps into the doorway, wearing a clean shirt. 
LAURA I worry about you, Ned. I worry a lot. (hands him papers) Max Shady's been faxing death threats to you all morning. 
NED (reading bits) ...stick a knife in your... (reacts, next) ...rip the eyeballs out of your... (next) ...drive razor-sharp spikes under your... 
LAURA Did you get to the one...? 
NED ...cut it off... shove it in a blender. 
LAURA Yeah... that one. 
NED (tosses them aside) He's just getting it out of his system. Once they say it... they never do it. You know... like the President. 
There's a KNOCK at the door. They look up to see an ominous SILHOUETTE of a MAN on the milkglass. Ned starts toward the door. Laura grabs his arm, stopping him. 
LAURA (whispers) Wait. It might be him. 
She opens her purse, pulls out a big COLT .45, holding it out to him. Ned stares at it, taken aback. 
NED Where did you get that? 
LAURA (as if obvious) From my purse. 
NED What are you doing with it? 
LAURA (still obvious) Handing it to you. 
NED Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun for? 
LAURA You shoot it. A bullet comes out. Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a cop, I'd think you'd know these things. 
NED Laura... put the gun away. 
He hands the gun back to her... goes to the door... opens it. There's a young DELIVERY MAN holding a bouquet of flowers. 
DELIVERY MAN (checks card) Flowers for Ned Rav... (looks up) Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy? Man, you are dead meat! 
Ned grabs the flowers, slams the door. Laura takes the envelope from the flowers... opens it. 
LAURA Is this another sick joke from Max Shady? 
She looks at the card... her expression turning cold. 
NED What is it...? 
LAURA (hands it to him) Lola Cain. 
She grabs the flowers... takes them into the bathroom. 
LAURA I'll put these in water for you. 
Ned opens the envelope. An audio cassette drops into his hand. Written on the label: PLAY ME. 
From the bathroom, we hear the LOUD SOUND of a TOILET FLUSHING. 
INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT 
It's raining. Ned pops the cassette into the tape player. 
LOLA'S VOICE Ned, darling... I know this seems like a strange way to talk with you... but since you won't take my calls, I have no other choice. (then suddenly) Watch it! That red car's turning left! 
Ned swerves to avoid a collision, HONKING his horn. 
LOLA'S VOICE I love you, Ned. We're meant to be together... forever. (then suddenly) The light's changing! Floor it! Go! Go! Go! 
Ned guns it!... accelerating through a yellow light. 
LOLA'S VOICE Nice move! (then sincere again) Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not even your wife. I'd hate to have to tell her about us, but if necessary... I will. 
The CROWD presses closer... not missing a thing. A WOMAN snaps a FLASH PICTURE! A MAN turns on his video camera. 
LOLA It doesn't matter. She'll know all about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE! 
Mortified, Ned spins on his heels and makes a bee-line for the safety of the Men's Room. Lola holds up two tickets. 
LOLA I got us tickets to see Iron Butterfly! 
NED I hate opera! 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Ned bursts in, goes to the urinal... not noticing BEN ARUGULA, an older gentleman in a business suit, standing at the urinal next to him. A beat later... Lola enters. 
LOLA Why are you running from me? Didn't it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing my buns with carnuba wax? (looks down) Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey want to go exploring? 
NED He's busy right now. 
Arugula glances sideways at Ned, curious and uneasy. 
NED Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a big mistake! One lousy mistake in his whole stinkin' life! So why don't you give him a BREAK! Besides... he belongs to my wife! 
EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 
Lana FIRES her gun rapidly... BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!... over her shoulder, behind her back, under her leg. 
ANGLE ON TARGET 
A full-body cut-out of a man, wearing one of Ned's trademark gray suits. A HUGE SMOKING HOLE has been blown right through the crotch! Lana smirks, inhales the SMOKE from the gun barrel... and blows it out. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
TILT DOWN from an official government seal that reads "ARS GRATIA ARTIS." JUDGE Ben Arugula... the distinguished looking gentleman from the men's room, sits on the bench. Ned, Laura and a SLIMY DEFENDANT stand at the defense table. 
JUDGE ARUGULA I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey for setting yet another unusual legal precedent. This is the first time I've ever tried a case in which the JURY was found to be insane. 
ANGLE - JURY AND BAILIFF 
The BAILIFF is handing out straitjackets to all the JURORS. The Jury Foreman struggles to get his on and laced up. 
BAILIFF (to another Juror) What're you? A thirty-eight long? 
BACK TO JUDGE ARUGULA 
JUDGE ARUGULA The jury will be remanded to the Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi Valley. Court's adjourned. 
INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY 
The JURY is led from the courtroom in straitjackets and chains. Ned and Laura follow them out. 
NED Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you tell me? 
LAURA It's not important. I just had one last year. 
NED Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate! 
In the b.g. the Slimy Defendant pulls a gun and forces CITIZENS... including Judge Arugula... up against the wall, robbing them! 
LAURA Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll have another one sometime. 
NED I insist. And I want to get you a nice present. 
LAURA You're so sweet. You don't have to. You gave me a present last year. Those lovely Ginzu knives. 
NED Yeah... aren't they great! They last forever. And you can cut right through a shoe with 'em! 
As they walk off, we HOLD ON a CLOSE SHOT of a newspaper. The headline reads: EX-CON STALKS COP/LAWYER NED RAVINE! Below it is a picture of Max Shady, eyes wide with psychotic rage... a huge cigar in his mouth, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt. 
Hands lower the newspaper... revealing Max himself, with the same cigar, shirt and crazed look on his face. 
INT. LE MISS FASHION BOUTIQUE - DAY - MONTAGE 
Laura models hats... each one becoming more outrageous. She coaxes Ned into joining her. They BOTH try on WOMEN's hats... smiling and laughing... as "Brown Eyed Girl" plays. 
In one of the mirrors, we SEE Max Shady's reflection... as he also tries on women's hats, watching them, puffing his cigar. 
INT. LE HULA BOWL RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Laura wears a baseball cap with beer cans attached to each side with long, curved plastic straws. The cap emblem reads "BEER BIMBO." A price tag hangs from it. She is beaming. 
In the b.g., Hawaiian DANCERS juggle flaming torches as they dance around an ICE SCULPTURE of a Hula Dancer. 
NED It's nice to be off the streets... away from all the pain and misery out there. 
Ned motions casually toward the world "out there"... sticking his thumb into the eye of a WAITER who is bending over to pick up a spoon, setting off a chaotic CHAIN REACTION of small disasters that finally culminates with someone near the dance floor bumping into the Torch Juggler, throwing his rhythm off. 
Distracted, he starts catching the FLAMING ENDS of the torches! OW! OH! YI! OUCH! YIPES! 
He drops them all. The Waiter who bumped into him, politely picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the Torch Juggler. He grabs the flaming end of the torch... and lets out a SCREAM! 
He lunges toward a voluptuous HULA GIRL ICE SCULPTURE, grabbing the frozen breasts. His burned hands SIZZLE! 
Ned and Laura don't even notice... gazing only at each other. 
LOLA (to Laura) Like some ice for your drink? 
She drops the ice Mermaid head. It shatters Laura's glass to bits! Lola turns to Ned with a cold glare. 
LOLA Does your wife know you're... "working" late? I certainly hope so, Mr. Ravine. 
She lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter, then flips it like a jackknife. It STICKS into Ned's chair, right between his legs. 
Lola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at Laura... then exits. 
EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING 
Frank opens the hood to Ned's car, holding a screwdriver in one hand... a wrench in the other. He doesn't know where to start. 
CLOSE ANGLE - MAX SHADY'S FEET - MORNING 
A NEWSBOY tosses a folded newspaper. It lands at Max Shady's feet. Max picks up the paper, opens it. The headline says: SHADY READS NEWSPAPER IN FRONT OF RAVINE RESIDENCE! Max looks around self-consciously, eyes shifting uneasily. 
INT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Lana stands by the front door. She calls upstairs to Ned. 
LANA Hurry up, darling. You'll be late! 
Frank slips in, wearing his greasy overalls. He wipes his hands on a rag... giving Lana a sly wink. 
FRANK (whispering) It's all taken care of. When do I knock on the door? 
LANA Wait until I signal you. When I raise the blinds... you knock. 
She steps over to the blinds and demonstrates. He knocks. 
LANA Not now! 
FRANK Oh, later... right... okay. 
She nods, patronizing. Frank exits. Lana picks up the Skunk, cuddling him. Ned comes down wearing his trademark gray suit. Lana kisses him passionately... a final farewell. 
LANA Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye- bye to Little Ned. He loves his daddy... don't you Stink Pot? 
NED (pets the skunk) See you tonight, Junior. 
As soon as Ned closes the door, Lana's smile vanishes and she casually tosses the Skunk aside with a LOUD CRASH O.C. 
EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING 
Ned turns the car key. Nothing. He gets out, opens the hood. He stares... dumbfounded. 
INT. THE HOUSE - MORNING 
Ned comes in, visibly upset. Lana acts surprised. 
LANA What's wrong? 
NED This neighborhood is getting worse all the time! Damn kids stole my engine! 
LANA Why don't you catch the train to Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty minutes. 
NED I'll just fly up. 
LANA No! 
Ned looks at her strangely. She catches herself. 
LANA I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists seized the airport this morning. A plane crashed into the tower... and all the runways are on fire! 
NED Yeah. So? 
LANA And it's fogged in. 
NED (disappointed) Dammit. 
LANA For my peace of mind... take the train. 
Lana goes to the window, starts to raise the blinds. 
NED I can't do it. You know how I feel about riding trains. 
She stops... letting the blinds drop down. 
LANA Darling... it's only a short trip. 
NED (reconsiders) Yeah... right. A short trip. 
She starts to raise the blinds again. He picks up the phone. 
NED (he hesitates) A short trip to hell in a metal tomb! 
He slams the receiver down. Lana drops the blinds again... 
LANA Just because both your parents died in a train wreck... 
NED And my brother, Jeff... 
We now SEE that the seat of Max's pants has been ripped out, his naked buttocks scratched and scraped raw by the road. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Ned stares out the window... apprehensive, nervous. 
Frank and Lana enter at the opposite end of the coach. They spot Ned, quickly ducking into a seat where they can observe him yet remain hidden from view behind the tall seatbacks. 
INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY 
Max walks through the car looking for Ned. He pauses, puffing on his big cigar. A WOMAN PASSENGER looks up and is shocked to see Max's scraped bare butt hanging out only inches away. 
WOMAN PASSENGER OH! My dear gracious! 
Max swivels around to look at her... turning his bare behind toward an IRRITABLE MAN across the aisle. 
IRRITABLE MAN SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish that foul smelling cigar? 
MAX (turning slowly) You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU want me to put out my cigar? You want ME to put out my CIGAR? 
IRRITABLE MAN Yeah. 
MAX Certainly. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Max enters through the vestibule, without his cigar, stopping in his tracks when he sees Ned. He smiles to himself, then ducks back into the lavatory. 
INT. LAVATORY - DAY 
Max looks at himself in the mirror. He's a disaster. He opens the violin case, pulling out his trademark "Ned Ravine" gray suit on a hangar. It's not even wrinkled. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Ned looks pale... sweating... reacting tensely to every lurch and bump the train makes. The feeble Old Woman strains to pull her huge steamer trunk down the aisle, inch by inch, toward Ned. 
ANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA 
Lana peers over the seat, watching Ned with a cruel smile. 
LANA It's already getting to him. He'll be out of that seat and into the vestibule within ten minutes... I guarantee it. 
INT. LAVATORY - DAY 
Max is cleaned up, dressed in the suit. He straightens his tie, slicks his greasy hair back, sticks a big cigar in his mouth and grins at himself in the mirror. 
MAX You talkin' to me? You talkin' to ME? You... talkin'... to... ME? 
He reaches into the violin case, pulls out a complex assortment of metal parts, assembling them swiftly. CLICK... SNAP... CLUNK! It's an incredibly nasty looking high-tech, automatic weapon with gigantic cartridge clip. 
He screws on a long silencer and points the gun at the ceiling. POOF!... a muffled gunshot! Debris fall around him. He looks up. He has blown a HOLE through the roof of the coach. 
He adjusts the Silencer Volume Control, which has a scale from 1 thru 11. He turns it all the way down to "0"... DEAD SILENT. He pulls the trigger. The gun RECOILS, but there is absolutely NO SOUND! He has blown another HOLE in the ceiling. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Ned looks across the aisle to see a GROSS SLOB pulling all kinds of strange food items from a paper bag, making a big, sloppy, disgusting SANDWICH that squirts and drips all over. Ned turns away... really queasy now. 
INT. LAVATORY - DAY 
Max reaches into the case, pulls out A BLENDER! He plugs it into the outlet and REVS it a couple times, grinning wickedly. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Max steps out of the lavatory and sees the CONDUCTOR coming his way collecting tickets. He quickly spins around, slides the door open and steps into the vestibule between cars. 
The Conductor can't get past the Old Woman, so he climbs over the top of her trunk, with no thought of helping her. 
INT. VESTIBULE - DAY 
Max looks out the side window, trying to conceal the weapon in front of him. The Conductor enters, sees him. 
CONDUCTOR Ticket? 
Without turning, Max holds the ticket up over his shoulder. The Conductor takes it, punches it, notices the gun barrel. 
CONDUCTOR Sorry pal... automatic weapons are only allowed in the club car after nine p.m. 
Max turns, raising the gun with a nasty GROWL. The Conductor casually snaps a baggage tag to the barrel, taking the gun. 
CONDUCTOR I'll check it with baggage. You can claim it at the depot in Santa Barbara. 
The Conductor drops the weapon into a big mesh bag... along with a dozen other guns he's collected. He exits. Max whirls around facing the window, eyes filled with rage. Now what? 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
A gun barrel slowly protrudes between the seats in front of Frank and Lana. Their eyes widen. Suddenly, a stream of water hits Frank in the face! He sputters. A LITTLE KID named JEFF scrambles into the aisle. 
JEFF Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years old. Didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash? No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck? My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really neat. Everybody gets creamed! All bloody guts... heads ripped off and stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts"? 
Lana turns to Frank... inspired. She leans toward Jeff. 
LANA You want to earn a couple bucks, kid? 
INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY 
The Conductor is still tagging weapons as the Old Woman comes up with a Ruger Mini 14 machine gun, a Mauser C96 automatic handgun, a sawed-off double-barreled .12 gauge shotgun... and an old wooden slingshot. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Lana looks through the small window into the vestibule and catches a glimpse of a gray suit. She ducks back, leaning against the lavatory door. 
INT. LAVATORY - THE MIRROR - DAY 
Ned's dripping face rises up from the sink into view. He splashes more water on, trying to overcome his queasiness. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Lana reaches into her purse, pulls out a gun. She looks through the vestibule windows into the first coach car, her eyes searching for Frank. 
INT. FIRST COACH CAR - LANA'S POV - DAY 
Frank pokes his head out into the aisle, looking toward Lana. He waves at her. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Lana ducks back, pressing herself against the lavatory door... gripping the gun, tense. 
INT. LAVATORY - DAY 
Ned starts to open the door, then stops. He notices the violin case. Opens it. A couple of bullets roll around inside. Then, he sees the blender... puzzled. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Lana leans forward, looking through the vestibule windows, watching desperately for Frank's signal. 
INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY 
Frank looks out the window and sees... 
EXT. THE RIVER - FRANK'S POV 
It looms ahead. 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Lana sees Frank's frantic signal. She raises the gun, pulls the hammer back and steps quickly into... 
INT. THE VESTIBULE - DAY 
Max hears someone enter. He stiffens... 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Ned steps out of the lavatory. 
INT. VESTIBULE - DAY 
Lana FIRES!... blowing a hole right through Max and the window behind him! She keeps firing! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! More bullets than the gun could ever possibly hold! 
INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY 
Ned hears the GUNSHOTS and whirls around, looking into the vestibule through the glass window, just as... 
INT. VESTIBLE - DAY 
...Max turns to face Lana, filled with bloody bullet holes. 
MAX You shootin' at me? 
Shocked to see it's Max, Lana empties the rest of the bullets into him... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Max is SLAMMED back into the vestibule door by the impact! 
MAX Yeah... you're definitely shootin' at me. 
She fires one last shot... BLAM!!! 
EXT. TRAIN ON BRIDGE - DAY 
Max flies out the door, executing a perfect "full gainer with a triple twist and a half-tuck"... a flawless Olympic style dive... ending with a dead body "belly flop" into the water! 
INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY 
Frank sees Max hit the river and lets out a loud "WHOOP!" The Old Woman shoots him a nasty look. He stifles himself. 
INT. VESTIBULE - DAY 
Ned slides the vestibule door open... steps toward Lana. In a daze, she raises the gun, points it at him, pulling the trigger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. He takes the gun from her gently. 
INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY 
Frank jumps up, rushing forward. He skids to a stop... seeing Ned through the glass! Shocked, he ducks back. 
INT. VESTIBULE - DAY 
NED In this crazy world, there's not a whole lot a guy can count on. But when the chips are down, I can always count on you. 
He takes her hand gently and kisses it... 
Arch points toward the cage. 
ARCH They're waiting for ya. They didn't want to start without her attorney being present. 
CLOSE ON LANA - CANTED ANGLE 
There's a BIG MOTH on her mouth. The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY. A beat... she spits the moth off, irritated. 
LANA PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could use a good exterminator. 
Three POLICE INVESTIGATORS sit opposite Lana at a long table. Moths flutter everywhere. 
INVESTIGATOR # 2 (to Police Guard) Let's get the SWAT Team in here. 
Ned, Laura and Arch enter the cage as the Guard exits. 
LANA Can't you get me out of this cage, Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here. 
NED Judge said no bail. Don't worry. Just tell the truth, you'll be fine. 
He turns to the Investigators. 
NED Who's gonna handle the interrogation? 
INVESTIGATOR 1 It's your collar... your bust... your call... your show... your play... your move... your wife... 
NED Okay, okay!... I'll handle it. 
Laura sits at the far end of the table and opens her notebook. Lana pulls out her mirrored compact, starts to apply lipstick. 
INVESTIGATOR 2 Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup allowed in this building. 
He nods toward a warning sign: a circle around a LIPSTICK with a diagonal line thru it. She responds, cool, confident. 
LANA What're you gonna do... arrest me for primping? 
In the b.g., members of the SWAT Team desperately swat at the fluttering moths. 
Ned spins his chair around, plants one foot on it, leans on his knee, looking hard at Lana. 
NED Don't give us a tough time. Just spill it! What were you doing on that train? 
LANA Well... 
Ned raises his hand, sits down, leans close, changing his tone. 
NED (confidential) As your attorney, I must advise you... you don't have to answer that question. 
Ned stands, paces, agitated... plants his foot on the chair again. He leans toward her... getting tough again. 
NED Alright, quit playing games with us! (fires questions) Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get the gun? What's your link with the CIA? 
LANA I... 
Ned jumps in, motioning with his hands for this to stop. 
NED Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I will not tolerate this unwarranted badgering of my client. She'll have her day in court, gentlemen. 
He slams his briefcase shut and turns to Lana, sincere. 
NED I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine, for being so cooperative with these gentlemen. (turns to Laura) Did you get all that down, Laura. Every word she said? 
LAURA Yep. Both of 'em. 
EXT. NED'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 
The CAMERA MOVES IN to a wire mesh cage at the very back of the yard. A small sign on it says: NED JUNIOR. The door is open. The cage is... empty! 
EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 
Lola rides the roller coaster with Lana's pet Skunk. She LAUGHS maniacally as they plunge down a steep grade! 
The Skunk stands stiffly on her lap, his paws planted on the guard rail, eyes bulging out!... his fur standing straight up! 
INT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY 
Ned hesitates at the front door. It's open a crack. He moves inside cautiously. There is a strange BUBBLING SOUND coming from the kitchen. He moves toward it... apprehensive. 
He enters the kitchen and SEES... a huge bubbling pot on the stove, foam spilling over from under the lid! His mind reels! He charges out the back door. 
EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - DAY 
Ned bursts out the back door... CAMERA TRACKING with his feet as he dashes across the huge back yard... MUSIC POUNDING! 
He SEES the EMPTY animal cage! The door is open. A fuzzy blanket hangs halfway out. 
Shocked, Ned spins around... running back toward the house... CAMERA TRACKING HIS FEET, struggling to keep up. The CAMERA SLAMS into a tree!... CRACKING the LENS! 
INT. NED'S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY 
Ned bursts in... SEES the bubbling pot!... a huge butcher knife on the counter!... and LOLA, arms outstretched to greet him. 
NED NO! 
JUDGE SKANKY Sustained. 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
Laura is on the stand. Ned hands her a sheet of paper. 
NED And can you tell us what this is? 
LAURA Yes. It's a death threat that Max Shady FAXED to you on the day he was released from prison. 
Ned snatches it back, pacing, folding it into a paper airplane. 
NED A FAX in which he threatened to puree certain parts of my anatomy in a blender! I'd like to submit this into evidence. 
PROSECUTOR (jumps up) Objection! Who cares about the FAX in this case? 
JUDGE SKANKY I'll allow it. 
Ned sails the paper plane toward the COURT CLERK, who is at an evidence table already piled high with tagged guns, appliances, knickknacks, auto parts and other junk. 
The plane sails toward an open window. The Clerk grabs it... going OUT the window with the plane! 
EXT. COURTHOUSE LAWN - DAY 
The Cheerleaders lead the SPECTATORS in an exuberant CHEER. 
CHEERLEADERS U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi! You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A- M-A! How you think you got that way? Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama! 
In the b.g., the Court Clerk plummets to the ground, then staggers to his feet, and stumbles... dazed... back toward the courthouse. 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
One of the JURORS watches a "DICK VAN DYKE" re-run on a small portable TV monitors, oblivious to the testimony. In the b.g., the battered Clerk stumbles back in with the paper plane. The Conductor is on the stand. Ned holds up a BLENDER. 
NED And is this the blender you found in the lavatory of the train? 
CONDUCTOR Yes... it is. 
NED I'd like this marked as evidence. 
The Bailiff reaches out, Ned waves him off... instead, tossing the blender over several heads to the Court Clerk... who runs to catch it, CRASHING into the wall. The blender falls, SHATTERS. 
ANGLE - BROADCAST BOOTH 
SPORTSCASTER Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's check out the re-play. 
On the RE-PLAY SCREEN we see the action repeated in SLOW MOTION as the Sportscaster draws lines, circles, x's and squiggles. 
SPORTSCASTER Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide open! But instead of handing it off, Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh! The pass is wide! A real wobbler! There's no way! He scrambles, but he just can't get his hands on it... And RIGHT THERE!... (freezes the frame) ...WHAM! That blender is gone! 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
At the defense table, Laura glances over at Lana, who is casually browsing through a copy of GALS & GUNS magazine. Laura reacts, then, trying to be as diplomatic as possible... 
LAURA Ned... did you ever consider that maybe you don't know women as well as you think you do? 
PROSECUTOR (O.S.) Now would you tell the court, in your own words, what you said to Mr. Ravine? 
They both look toward the witness stand. Ned is shaken. 
NED (whispers) I'm really worried about this guy. He could blow our whole case right out of the water. 
ANGLE - WITNESS STAND - MOMENTS LATER 
Jeff, the little boy from the train is on the witness stand. The Prosecutor stands by, listening as... 
JEFF (singing) Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... mutilated monkey meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet... Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... and me without a spoon! 
The JURORS turn pale and reach for the air sickness bags in front of them. The Courtroom erupts. The Judge pounds his gavel LOUDLY. 
JEFF (pointing at Lana) That lady paid me two bucks to sing it to him...! 
But NO ONE hears this in all the confusion. The Judge, also looking ill now, bangs his gavel again. 
JUDGE SKANKY Recess! Ten minutes! 
EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 
The Judge, Jury, Attorneys and Spectators are all playing on the swings, teeter-totters, monkey bars... having a blast! Ned and the Prosecutor play "dodge-ball." Laura cheers Ned on. The Prosecutor rockets the ball at Ned... and just misses! 
PROSECUTOR Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha! 
LAURA No you didn't! 
NED No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile! 
The BAILIFF steps into CLOSE UP, blowing a whistle loudly! 
BAILIFF Recess is over! Let's go... move it, move it, move it! 
INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - LATER 
Marching band MUSIC fades off-screen. 
Lana is on the stand. The Bailiff swears her in. 
BAILIFF Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? 
LANA (looks to Judge) Do I have to answer that, Harlan? 
JUDGE SKANKY No, no dear. I'll vouch for her. 
Ned approaches. 
NED Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you Lana? 
LANA No. Call me Angel Tits. 
PROSECUTOR I object! 
JUDGE SKANKY Sustained. Counselor... you will address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine. 
NED (after a beat) Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell the court... what were you doing on that train? 
LANA I saw Max Shady at the station... saw him get on board. I knew he'd made threats to kill you and mutilate your reproductive organs... 
Ned and EVERY MALE in the courtroom winces at this, doubling over in imagined agony. Lana pauses, then continues... 
LANA ...so I got on the train too... so I could warn you. 
NED Do you want to have children? 
LANA Someday. With the right man. 
NED But you couldn't have children if my... (makes a gesture) ...were... (another gesture) ...and, uh... 
LANA It would be difficult. 
NED So you followed him, knowing you had to protect me... your husband... your best friend... the man you love... the future father of your children. 
LANA Something like that. 
NED And when you saw that maniac standing in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and fired and fired and FIRED! 
LANA And fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired... 
She pauses to count off on her fingers, then... 
LANA ...and fired and fired and fired. 
NED The defense rests, your Honor. 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
The COURTROOM ARTIST has been sketching intensely throughout the trial. We finally see... he's been sketching a BOWL OF FRUIT on the Court Recorder's desk. Ned picks up some fruit from the bowl and approaches the defense table. 
NED How can you convict a courageous woman who risked everything to save the life of her beloved husband? A woman who acted boldly to stop a demented maniac from doing THIS!... 
Ned shoves the BANANA and two PLUMS into a demonstration blender on the defense table. He hits the puree button and the blender WHIRRS loudly! 
NED (shouts over) ...pulverizing the private parts of the man she loves! 
All MALES in the courtroom react with pained expressions, cringing and doubling-over. Ned turns the blender off. 
NED (directly to Jury) Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the potential mother of my potential child. I challenge YOU to strike a blow for motherhood and the American justice system! Put the "con" back in the Constitution. Put the "ju" back in jurisprudence. Put the "can" back in American. And put the "dom" back in freedom. Find this woman INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed happy tonight! 
INT. PRESS ROOM - LATER 
A REPORTER opens the door marked PRESS ROOM. Inside, a DOZEN REPORTERS press their pants on a dozen ironing boards. 
REPORTER The jury's back! 
The Reporters scramble for the door, pulling their pants on! 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
The CAMERA FOLLOWS a folded piece of paper as the Jurors pass it along to the FOREMAN... who hands it to the Bailiff... who hands it to the Judge. He unfolds it, reads it... then winks flirtatiously at the FEMALE JUROR who wrote it. She blushes. 
JUDGE SKANKY (back to business) So... has the jury reached a verdict? 
JURY FOREMAN (stands up) Yes we have, your Honor. 
JUDGE SKANKY How do you find the defendant... on the count of manslaughter? 
JURY FOREMAN Not guilty. 
JUDGE SKANKY On the count of murder in the first degree? 
JURY FOREMAN Not guilty. 
JUDGE SKANKY On the Count of Monte Cristo? 
JURY FOREMAN Not guilty. 
A BOISTEROUS CLAMOR in the court. The electronic signs FLASH "NOT GUILTY!"... "NOT GUILTY!"... "NOT GUILTY!" 
JUDGE SKANKY Good. Then on the count of three, let's all get the hell out of here! One... two... 
One of the Coroner's INVESTIGATORS approaches Arch and Ned. 
INVESTIGATOR Looks like a suicide. We found a note. 
He holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers. Ned takes it, trying to unroll it. 
INVESTIGATOR It was stuck up his nose. 
Ned hands it off to Arch, who casually unrolls it. The Investigator slips, arms waving, and falls out of frame. 
ARCH (reading it) "I can't take it anymore. I'm a mediocre mechanic... and a lousy lover." 
NED He's sure got that right. 
Arch gives Ned a very strange look. Ned feels his stare. 
NED The "mechanic" part, I mean. 
In the b.g., various COPS pair up to have their pictures taken by the Police Crime Scene Photographer... posing, grinning. 
NED (stares at the body) I don't know why, Arch, but I just can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't suicide. 
THE CAMERA MOVES 
behind Ned on his line, revealing Frank... pinned to the wall by the power screwdriver stuck in his back! It's still running... vibrating with a GRINDING HUM. 
Ned reaches out and turns the screwdriver OFF. 
INT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY 
Ned enters, pausing. He hears VOICES. He goes to the living room. Lana and Lola turn to see him in the doorway. He is shocked. Lana looks shaken. But Lola is cool... in control. 
LANA Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um... 
NED (nervous, defensive) Um? She told you her name was Um? And what other lies did she tell you? I've never seen this woman in my life! Never followed her home! Never had sex with her in the refrigerator! It's all a sick fantasy... and I deny everything! 
He turns to Lola. 
NED When will women like you learn, you can't tear apart a perfectly good marriage with your vicious lies... Miss UMMMM! 
LOLA Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith. I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine. The big powerful kind that suck up everything in sight. I was just telling your wife, if she wants to get rid of all her dirt, she has to be willing to pay the price. 
She turns to Lana with a cold and contemptuous glare. 
LOLA Let me know what you decide, Mrs. Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure meeting you... Ned. 
Lola exits. As soon as the door closes, Lana whirls around in a fury!... SMASHING a lamp! She SHRIEKS furiously! 
LANA I... hate... SALESMEN! 
He puts his arms around her, comforting. 
NED I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything. Tell you what... let's take a trip. 
LANA A trip? 
NED Yeah. Just the two of us. 
LANA (darkly inspired) I like that. Just you and me... all alone. I'll start packing. 
NED Great. Listen... I got something to take care of. I'll be back in awhile. 
He kisses her and exits. Lana turns to look up toward the landing, a vengefully insane smile clouding her face. 
INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - DUSK 
A demanding KNOCK at the door. Lola hesitates at the door. 
LOLA Who is it? 
The door CRASHES OPEN! Ned is silhouetted in the doorway. He looks really pissed! Lola turns and runs. Ned sprints after her, leaping through the air... bringing her down with a tackle! 
NED I just want to talk. 
LOLA Why didn't you say so? 
Her foot shoots out, smashing him right in the face... WHAM! She jumps up and scrambles away. Ned pursues her. She grabs a bottle of scotch from the counter, spins around. 
LOLA Would you like a drink? 
She throws the bottle! He ducks and it shatters on the wall! 
NED No thanks. I'm driving. 
She whirls on one foot, nailing him in the head with a FLYING SPIN KICK! He stumbles back, dazed. She grabs an ice pick. 
LOLA Then let's get to the point! 
Lola charges! Ned rolls onto his back, jamming both feet into her stomach, heaving her up over him... thru the air! She SLAMS into the wall!... then slowly turns... still cool and collected. She raises a cigarette... lights it with the ice pick "lighter." 
LOLA So what's your problem, tough guy? 
NED Stay away from my life, my wife, my home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on a vacation and when I come back, I don't ever want to see your face again!

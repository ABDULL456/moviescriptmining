I . 
EXTREME CLOSE ON A CELL PHONE resting face up on a black surface. A beat of silence           -- is broken by its abrupt RING... RING... RING... Move in tighter on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827 RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING... 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT 
We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys. 
INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT 
A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table, empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure hunched over a laptop. Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a gentle, intelligent demeanor. Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing. 
INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT 
Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors. 
INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT 
Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk. 
JONATHAN Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet? The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up. 
OLD MAN It is tomorrow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN Right. I forgot. The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him -- 
OLD MAN Anything else? 
JONATHAN Uh - no. No that's it, thanks. 
EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT 
Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound. Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first floor marked by unlit neon: "FLEURS DE SOLANGE." He ascends the steps, his keys out -- 
WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.) Jonathan! The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent, standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket. 
JONATHAN Solange, you're up so late? 
SOLANGE So early, Jonathan. We open in one hour. 
(GRINS) So tell me, you have been out with a lady friend, oui? 
JONATHAN 
(SMILES) Je suis desole, madame, mais no. 
SOLANGE But why else does a young man come home at such an hour? 
JONATHAN Just working late, that's all. 
SOLANGE Every night working late, working late. (teasing him) Ah, you can't fool me. You are Mister Mischief maker - I know this! You come by 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires Worth and Berman to give their blessing to our books, and they send you? 
JONATHAN Have laptop, will travel. What about you? 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) What about me? 
JONATHAN Well, I didn't get your name for one.th-- The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out. 
MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.) .ose. 
JONATHAN Sorry - I didn't catch that? (gets no response) Hello...? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MALE VOICE                                                       (O.S.) I said it's Wyatt. Wyatt Bose. Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door - - only the men's room is now empty. 
COMPUVOICE                                                       (SOUND ADVANCE) Message-four. Three-oh-eight-pee-em. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Alone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell phone. We..find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger. 
PETERSON                                                         (O.S.) Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to- confirm you're wrapping up over there at Rutherford Stern because the controller at Clancey has been on me to get someone in there by Thursday. I told him how brilliant you are, said you're the best auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you some documentation... Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in worth&berman.com. He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week. Other than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Jonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain on the tabletop. Yawning, he glances at his watch - 
MALE VOICE   (O.S.) 12:53                                                            a.m. Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the' doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice: 
WYATT Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home and saw the lights. We met before, in the can... 
JONATHAN Sure. It's Wyatt, right? WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something very likeably "on" about him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT So do you normally work this late? 
JONATHAN Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to finish up. What about you? 
WYATT You kidding? This is an early night. Hard to believe that once upona time a man's success was measured by how little he had to work. You know in Sweden the average worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation? (regards his stacked files) Do-you like accounting? 
JONATHAN It's all right, if you enjoy working with numbers. Do you like being a lawyer? 
WYATT It's all right. If you enjoy working with assholes. Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen. 
WYATT Well, I'm probably disturbing you - 
JONATHAN No - it's okay. Really. 
WYATT So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have to like be in Mensa to work there? Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly. 
WYATT Been with them long? 
JONATHAN Since my senior year of college. They subsidized my graduate degree. 
WYATT Really. So you were poor? Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question. 
(CONTINUED) 
S. 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN Well - I guess you could say that. I was raised by a single mother, and she died when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people have had it worse. 
WYATT Not around here. Practically every suit I know is Harvard by way of Andover. 
ASSISTANT CONTROLLER Uh huh. Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back. 
JONATHAN Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt Bose's office? The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance. 
JONATHAN Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here. She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's eyes follow her lazy finger down the list -- 
A GRUFF VOICE (O.S.) Hey, quit looking down her shirt! Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor. 
WYATT Leaving, huh? So where to next? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols after that. Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder. 
WYATT Hey, wait up a sec. (smiles back) Well, good meeting you, Jonathan. ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer. Jonathan bends for his briefcase - 
WYATT                                                           (O.S.) Wait, so you have off tomorrow? Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall. 
WYATT You don't happen to have .a. decent backhand, do you? 
INT. MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY 
Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's). Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return. 
SAME SCENE - LATER A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it back. Jonathan returns it with equal force. A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball. Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two inches outside the opposite baseline. 
WYATT Out! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air. Silence - then Wyatt's SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space. 
WYATT Commiserations, Messer. Good game. They shake hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted. 
WYATT 
(WARMLY) Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat the crap out of me. Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter. The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net. 
WYATT They asked if we'd fancy a post-game cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it. Jonathan is barely able to speak. 
JONATHAN Oh? I would've been happy to. 
WYATT Are you kidding? They're a couple of first years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do better. Hey, you OK? Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet. 
INT. RACKET CLUB LOUNGE 
Soft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area. Wyatt is admiring Jonathan's weathered tennis racket. 
WYATT Man, I remember when these first came out. I think I was a frosh at boarding school. (chuckles; fingers a string) Jeez, are these strings natural gut? 
JONATHAN Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I should replace them, they're all frayed... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar. From behind, it looks remarkably like "S"... Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise. 
INT. LOCKER ROOK! 
Wyatt and Jonathan in towels, heading for the showers. Jonathan still deep in the 'S' moment - 
WYATT Have you ever considered contacts? Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face       - his eyeglasses in particular. 
JONATHAN Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was allergic to something in the solution. 
WYATT Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your eyes especially. Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel. 
WYATT It's not a come on, just an observation. (considers him a beat) You don't get much, do you. 
JONATHAN What - you mean sex? 
JONATHAN Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off. 
WYATT You hope you can pull it off. You know who you remind me of? James Getz. 
JONATHAN Who? 
WYATT A guy I roomed with freshman year at Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when you loosened him up. Only from day one, he just didn't fit in. For starters, he was dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there was always this boundary - this wall - between Getz and everyone else. You could argue we laid the foundation, but he built it. Built it by believing the lie. 
JONATHAN What lie? 
WYATT That he was any different. The clothes, the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all one big masquerade. Anyone can get in, you've just got to wear a costume. But Getz never got that. He assumed he could never scale the wall, when the truth is he was the only one guarding it. It never occurred to him his anonymity could be an asset. No one gets over like the guy who's just a face, an impression. We are - all of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be. 
JONATHAN So what happened to him? 
WYATT Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself. 
JONATHAN (hesitates a beat) You're pulling my dick, aren't you. Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT With both hands. Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit. 
CUT TO: CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat. He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders: 
EMCEE And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine, the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour! 
INT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT 
An ultra-elite "new burlesque" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female, sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease. Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience. 
WYATT It's a little self-conscious, but I thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's that suit working out? 
JONATHAN Oh - great, actually. 
WYATT Keep it then. I've got two just like it. Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives. 
WAITRESS Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen. 
JONATHAN Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass? 
WYATT We'll try not to spill any. (regards the floor show) So what's the wildest thing you've ever done? Sexually, I mean. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've never been too adventuresome. 
WYATT All right, what's the lamest thing then? 
JONATHAN The lamest... Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it. 
JONATHAN Actually, that was probably a few months ago. I was flipping through money magazine and saw this small ad in the back. It read something like "Are. you feeling all alone? Looking to meet women but have forgotten how?" And-there was this number. 
WYATT And you called it? So what happened? 
JONATHAN Nothing actually. The phone just kept ringing. And that's it. Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up. 
JONATHAN Lame enough for you? 
WYATT You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine. That is beyond lame. Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan. 
JONATHAN .Hello? Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan. 
JONATHAN .All right... Goodbye. Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt. 
JONATHAN She wants to dance. 
ON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her shoulder to his table, where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone. Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself. The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear... 
INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - A CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING 
Clancey's stiff CONTROLLER                                      (50s) hovers nervously over Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger, pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its. 
CLANCEY CONTROLLER Any problems, you'll want to see Julie Levinson, she's our assistant controller                       - or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior accountant. If Werner's unavailable, we have two staff accountants                                     - but like I said, I don't anticipate any problems. I mean we've never had any before, so... 
JONATHAN Right.I just need the access codes for the accounts and sub-accounts? The Controller suddenly looks uneasy. 
JONATHAN You've got account numbers, but no access codes. Without those I can't get the banks to authorize statement verification. (beat; smiles) Besides, how else can I steal the money? 
CLANCEY CONTROLLER What? 
JONATHAN Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I do need those codes though, when you get a chance. 
INT. CLANCEY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Other than Jonathan's suit and tie, the reduced number of post-its and the lighter stack of files                        - little has changed. Jonathan is hunched over his laptop. Like Rutherford Stern's conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall. Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference to him. Slightly different tank, slightly different fish. CLOSE ON A BUSINESS CARD: a Rutherford Stern masthead, beneath it Wyatt's name and office number. Jonathan picks up his cell phone and dials it. RING... RING - 
WYATT (O.S.) Hey, Jonathan. 
JONATHAN How'd you know it was- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT (O.S.) You really ought to block your caller ID. So - same place as yesterday? 
EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY 
Along the entire square of ledge, throngs of SUITED BUSINESS TYPES bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare. It's here we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite. 
WYATT I wonder what the Founding Fathers would make of this scene. Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat. 
JONATHAN I'm just glad to be outside. (awkwardly heartfelt) I've got to tell you, this has been great, meeting up for lunch. I used to just- A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge. 
WYATT Yes?... Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme on the 6:15                                                     out of JFK tonight... Fine. Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's. 
WYATT Rutherford needs me to join him asap in London to paper some financing with Lloyds. I tell you about this? 
JONATHAN No - no you didn't. 
WYATT Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks. Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in. 
JONATHAN Sounds exciting. 
WYATT Nah, it'll be boring as sin. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises from the ledge. 
WYATT Shit, I'd better get back. You ready? 
INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 
Sitting before his laptop, Jonathan takes out his cell phone and punches in some numbers. 
COMPUVOICE                                                     (O.S.) 
I'RN-SORRY-THE-VOICE-MAIL-PASSWORD-YOU- 
ENTERED-IS-NOT-VALID-PLEASE-TRY-YOUR- He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded message. He hangs up -- when it abruptly RINGS, surprising him. He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it. 
JONATHAN Jonathan Mess- CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger. 
INT. CLANCEY BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
SAME SCENE - SHORT TIME LATER Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait, glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WOMAN'S VOICE                                                    (O.S.) Pardon me, but may I ask you something - personal? Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit. 
THE BLONDE Are you waiting for me? 
JONATHAN I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt, right? 
THE BLONDE Excuse me? (hesitates, appraising him) I'm sorry, did we speak earlier? 
JONATHAN Yes. Yes we did - 
THE BLONDE Good. Let's go then. 
INT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR 
Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair. Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand. 
JONATHAN (whispers aside) Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and I., we don't know each other...? She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips. 
THE BLONDE No fooling. DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows. 
THE HALLWAY Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room. 
JONATHAN What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain there's been some kind of mistake. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him. 
THE BLONDE You're not who I spoke with on the phone? 
JONATHAN No - I mean, yes, but - 
THE BLONDE You're not attracted to me? 
JONATHAN Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          - 
THE BLONDE It's just what... exactly? She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long. 
INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER 
A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's tentativeness is all but gone. Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language: 
THE BLONDE Fuck. LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but she's fast asleep. 
INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open. Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am. He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her. 
INT. PLAZA - RECEPTION DESK - MORNING 
Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DESK CLERK Sir, I'm showing that room as having checked out at                                                 6:20                                   this morning. 
JONATHAN Well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there? 
DESK CLERK I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose information regarding our guests. If you give me her name, I can confirm if she was registered here. 
JONATHAN Actually, the thing is... it's okay. Forget it. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - MORNING 
BRITISH ACCENT Frankly I'm surprised that whoever gave you access didn't explain more. 
(SIGHS) Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no jobs                                                           - no nothing. Two, latex is mandatory and non-negotiable.. Three, no rough stuff   - the only rule that's even remotely malleable provided there's mutual consent, although I say if that's your thing, take it elsewhere. And finally... She halts a few feet from the registration desk. 
BRITISH ACCENT The initiator is responsible for the room. 
JONATHAN (takes him a second) Oh - so I should...? 
BRITISH ACCENT Precisely. 
BACK IN THE ELEVATOR Jonathan is holding a key card. British Accent is leaning against the opposite wall, eyeing him with a slight grin. A moment. DING. The elevator doors open. 
INT. MERCER HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
They are headed for a room as he ventures another question: 
JONATHAN So are there a lot of - people - who do this? She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when the CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE WAITER is crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan turns back to find her staring at him uneasily. 
BRITISH ACCENT How did you get into this? 
JONATHAN Well, a friend of mine - 
BRITISH ACCENT He uploaded your numbers but failed to explain the basics? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN He's                                                          - well, he was going out of town. (off her frown) I'm doing something wrong, aren't I? 
BRITISH ACCENT It's not that, it's just... well, you strike me as something of a stowaway. In fact if I were more suspicious, I'd say you didn't belong here at all. Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation --- 
BRITISH ACCENT But obviously somebody felt you did. The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt! 
BRITISH ACCENT And I'm a sucker for bashful boys... She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm... and removes the key card from his hand. 
INT. MERCER HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Jonathan and British Accent having sex. She has his arms pinned back, writhing on top of him, clearly enjoying the control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride. 
INT. MERCER HOTEL - BEDROOM- LATE NIGHT 
Jonathan lies in bed-beside British Accent. 
JONATHAN Can I ask you something? Why do you do this? 
BRITISH ACCENT Why are any of us doing this? For the economics of the arrangement. (rolls over, away from him) It's intimacy without intricacy. Jonathan's about to reply -- 
BRITISH ACCENT Look, I've got a 7                                            a.m. breakfast, so... She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat. 
JONATHAN Well - good night. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She doesn't reply. 
INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS                                        - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE DAY 
Jonathan.alone at his laptop, the stack of files down to a bare few. He dials a number on 'his' cell: 
JONATHAN (into phone) Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess you're busy.with stuff over there. (smiles to himself) I've been kinda busy too! I've been wondering - did you mean for me to take your phone? 
EXT. RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT 
Jonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night. 
JONATHAN (V.0.) I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can see you grinning right now. Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps inside -- 
JONATHAN                                                        (V.0.) Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you. SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SWELLING: to herald a MONTAGE: 
INT. THE BENJAMIN - LOBBY - NIGHT 
SOLANGE There really is no one? Jonathan evasively shakes his head. 
SOLANGE There should be, Jonathan. It is not good for a young man to be too much alone. He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him. Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his cell phone. A beat, then another... .and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out into the night. 
INT. THE HUDSON HOTEL - LOBBY -- LATE NIGHT 
Checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits, Jonathan faintly hears what sounds like WYATT'S LAUGH. He quickly turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby. Through slotted glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men. Reflected in the mirror, a WOMAN appears behind him. Jonathan freezes, his eyes grow wide - 
WOMAN Excuse me... He doesn't breathe. Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm... It's her.                                                       -It's "S". 
INT. THE HUDSON - ELEVATOR 
Jonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but she's oblivious, smiling casually back at him. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
"S" enters first, flips on the light, proceeds inside. Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued. "S" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair. Jonathan remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the wrists of her blouse, then the collar button. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jonathan is about to say something but can't. She undoes the next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the next -- 
JONATHAN Before we...um, the thing is                                   - I know you. She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front clasp of her bra. 
JONATHAN Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met before. In the Times Square subway station. It was raining... 
â S â 
(GRINS) In the subway? 
JONATHAN You had no umbrella. You were soaked. 
âC,. It's true, I don't have an umbrella. 
JONATHAN Then you asked me if the N train stops at Canal. She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse. 
JONATHAN Wait. 
âSÂ» Is something the matter? 
JONATHAN This just seems strange, that's all. 
SÂ Because you've seen me before? 
JONATHAN Maybe. I don't know, it's just                                 - 
(EXHALES) Ever since that night on the train, I've thought about how nice it would be to see you again. And now suddenly, here you are, taking off your clothes. â S of Bingo! So what's the problem? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN It's just that- 
"S,1 (a generous smile) Hmm, it is kind of a gear-shift. She starts to button her blouse back up. 
âSâ Well, maybe some other time. Jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat - 
JONATHAN Wait - don't go. She glances back curiously. 
JONATHAN What I mean is, by any chance... are you hungry? 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN 
A BELLMAN rolls a cart noiselessly down the carpet, placing early editions of the New York Times before each room. He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper. We can hear the sound of JONATHAN AND "S" TALKING AND LAUGHING... 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
They sit across from each other Indian-style on the bed. The radio is tuned to a pop music station. They're finishing a meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously. You have some ketchup on your chin. 
JONATHAN sorry, I'm a messy eater. âsâ Me too. Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes the napkin, dabs it in water and cleans him up. 
CONTINUED: 
ALSIP You work in a bank? 
JONATHAN Nahh, I'm... I'm kind of an accountant. us,, Now I bet that's just what you wanted to do when you were a kid! 
JONATHAN Oh yeah. I'm living the dream. Feel free to leave now. u S â Still here. 
JONATHAN So what about you? 
âSÂ» No, we're still on you, Frank. Off Jonathan's look, 'Frank'? 
âS.11 You look like a Frank. So, Frank, when you were a little boy, what did you wanna be when you grew up? .Jonathan thinks. Confesses: 
JONATHAN A pro tennis player. 
âS,. Huh! I wanted to be an umpire. 
JONATHAN You're kidding? âsâ Really! I loved the idea of sitting in that big, high chair. (umpire voice) 'The ball was good,'Mr McEnroe.' 
JONATHAN I can see it. An 80's new wave love song comes on the radio. She beams, reaching across Jonathan to turn it up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: a, S 11 I used to love this song. "S" stands up on the bed, starts to dance. She reaches her hand out to Jonathan. He smiles, shakes his head. 
JONATHAN Trust me, it's not a pretty sight. 
"S:, I'll be the judge of that. He hesitates, then takes her hand, rises to his feet, and starts to dance with her. He's self-conscious at first, but she's agile enough to guide him, and soon he's into it. is S Il See? You just need the right partner. She closes her eyes, swaying with the music. They dance together. He's falling even harder for her. As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn escapes her. She covers her mouth. of S+â I'm so sorry. Suddenly I'm crashing. She drops down on the bed, tugging him down with her. They lie back, side by side. 
JONATHAN I'd like to see you again. Not in a hotel. it S+ " Hmm. I'd have to think about that. 
JONATHAN How about tomorrow? /. S to It is tomorrow. She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes her eyes and drifts off. Jonathan gazes over at her. The perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe. And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away. He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from under her -- when she stirs and nuzzles closer. He looks over 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: to the purse, then back at "S," sleeping peacefully on his arm... and chooses this perfect moment over knowing any more. 
INT. THE HUDSON - HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes slowly open. JONATHAN'S POV: her purse is no longer on the chair. He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her pillow. The indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself. He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom. There's a NOTE on the desk on hotel note paper: Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will call u later. Sunbeam xxx He stares at the note, beaming - when his cell phone rings. Jonathan picks it up. 
MAN'S VOICE                                                     (V.0..) Are you free tonight? A bea- - and then Wyatt's familiar laughter. 
JONATHAN Hey! Are you back in town? 
WYATT (V.0.) I wish. It's friggin' anarchy in the U.K.. I'm stuck here at least another week. 
JONATHAN Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night - at the Hudson. 
WYATT (V.0.) The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been enjoying my little gift. 
JONATHAN Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl. 
WYATT (V.0.) That's fantastic! Who is the lucky gal? 
JONATHAN She's a member of your naughty little sex club. I have broken all the rules and had an honest-to-God conversation. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT (V.0.) That's extremely naughty of you! So what happened, Romeo? 
JONATHAN I'd like to say it's a long story but it's not. When you are coming back, you gotta meet her. 
WYATT (V.0.) So she's, what, a lawyer or something? 
JONATHAN I-have no idea, I don't know all that much about her. All I know is I can't wait to see her again. 
WYATT (V.0.) Listen, I don't want to dampen your spirits, but - be careful, okay? 
JONATHAN Would you like some help, ma'am? 
OLD WOMAN I can manage, thank you. Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way. .Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers. We see Room 518                                                 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on. Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on the door, calls out: 
JONATHAN I can't get the card to work. He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel: red. He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence. 
JONATHAN Hello?... Hello? He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into the door. Nothing. Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into 
THE ROOM He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets. Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket. Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed, splattered all over the crumpled sheets... Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just as he senses something behind him and BANG!                     - something hits him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of potatoes. 
BLACKOUT. 
TWO HOURS LATER THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The ice has melted, a pool of water seeps out... follow the flow to arrive at Jonathan's 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: fingers... slowly responding to the cold water... The TV playing a different film now. OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on the floor. He groans a little. Rubs the back of his head. Checks his hand for blood. Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet, shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of "S." He runs into the bathroom. Also empty. Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED. He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them. He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in the morning, no one around. 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY 
Tripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the corridor. He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator. Jonathan tears off in its direction... He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor indicator overhead: "4" slowly creeps to "3". 
INT. STAIRWELL 
His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and continues to dash down... BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in 
THE LOBBY His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild- eyed and shaking. It's utterly vacant at this hour, the only sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' "Yesterday." 
SLAM! OF JONATHAN'S HAND ON THE FRONT DESK 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Asian Clerk working there snaps his head up with a startled gasp. Jonathan barely manages to breathe the word: 
JONATHAN help... 
INT. HOTEL LOTUS -                                            5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER 
Two hotel SECURITY GUARDS take the lead as they near room 517, Jonathan trailing, breathless and shaken... 
JONATHAN .I saw blood on the bed and then someone hit me. When I came to, she was gone. 
SECURITY 1 This woman you were with. What's her name? Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing. 
SECURITY 2 Sir? 
JONATHAN I don't know. (off their looks) It starts with an 'S'. I think. 
SECURITY 2 Was shea prostitute? 
JONATHAN No! No, she's just a person. A friend. 
SECURITY 2 A friend with no name. 
JONATHAN Of course she has a name! I just don't - we have to find her - something must have happened to her! 
INT. ROOM 517 
The two Security Guards are eyeing the bed. 
SECURITY 1 I thought you said there was blood? 
JONATHAN I told you, whoever did this must have cleaned it up while I was out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jonathan freezes, eyes darting to the night stand. 
INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM 
Jonathan enters, wanders for his bed -- when he pauses, staring at his dresser. He approaches, peering down at something that's caught his eye... HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved. Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark - (SOUND ADVANCE) BANG! of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in 
A SPARE BEDROOM Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts through faded file folders crammed with papers and documents. 
JONATHAN                                                          (INTO PHONE) .Your ad says                                                     24-Hour Locksmith... Well how soon could you-... Fine. He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked "CREDIT CARDS." Sorting through old statements, he finds the line: "To report a card lost or stolen..." 
INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN 
CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S HAGGARD FACE in the mirror of a medicine cabinet as he pulls it open. Be fishes around, finds what he's looking for: a SMALL BLACK CANNISTER for film. He pops the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money. Jonathan exits the bathroom, crosses the living room to the foyer, where we find a LOCKSMITH finishing changing the lock. 
INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN 
Jonathan lies awake, staring at his muted TV, his face tear- stained, his eyes clouded. 
JONATHAN (V.O.) This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able to come in today. I'm - pretty ill... 'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY 
Jonathan seated, resting against the window, drifting off into.restless sleep. We MOVE IN TIGHTER ON HIS FACE, tighter -- 
CONDUCTOR (O.S.) Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next. 
Jonathan jerks awake. A few stares from nearby passengers. 
EXT. CANAL STREET - DAY 
Jonathan emerges from underground to hectic Chinatown. What once felt romantic now feels cold and exclusionary, a bustling mix of ASIANS and map-clutching TOURISTS. He surveys the area,-overwhelmed, eyes searching for anything resembling a clue. Foreign faces return only cold, blank stares. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jonathan pauses by a STREET VENDOR, takes from his pocket the GUM WRAPPER he found in the hotel, shows it to the vendor... 
INT. CHINESE MARKET - DAY 
Cramped and dingy. Jonathan makes his way to the counter, where an OLD WOMAN sits smoking. He holds up the wrapper. 
JONATHAN I was told you sell this gum here? The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a candy display. In one box is the same gum. 
JONATHAN A woman - a white woman - buys this brand of gum. I need to find- The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese. 
JONATHAN I'm sorry, I don't                                              -- Do you know the woman I'm talking about? A white woman...? Please, it's very important that I                              -- 
GIRL'S VOICE                                                    (O.S.) My grandmother doesn't speak English. Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL.(13) in a smock. 
JONATHAN Can you ask if she knows the name of the white woman who buys this gum? The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes. a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan. 
GIRL She says they sell that gum in practically every store in Chinatown. 
EXT/INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jonathan is struggling with his stiff new key, hearing his PHONE RINGING inside. 
INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT 
Jonathan rushes for the phone, picks up. 
JONATHAN Hello?

DETECTIVE RUSSO Mr. Messer? 
INT. NY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE - LOBBY                       - AN HOUR LATER. 
Creepy and drab. Jonathan enters, approaches a RECEPTIONIST. The Receptionist nods, points across the lobby to Detective Russo. Jonathan looks very worried. 
INT. M.E.'S OFFICE                                              - A RICKETY ELEVATOR 
JONATHAN Messer. Jonathan Messer. I'm an auditor from worth and Berman. 
INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - CORRIDOR 
Jonathan walks alongside Ms. Pomerantz. 
POMERANTZ Are you sure you have the right firm? 
JONATHAN Yes                                                             -- yes, I'm                         --- He works here. I've seen him working here. I net him here. 
POMERANTZ When was this? 
JONATHAN A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here. He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion. 
POMERANTZ I don't know what's going on, but I can assure you, there is nobody here named- 
JONATHAN I've seen him in the halls                                      - for Chrissake we smoked pot in the conference room! Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER - 
FLASH INSERT -= COFFEE LOUNGE This Lawyer and another laughing at Wyatt's punch line. Jonathan runs over to the Lawyer, grabs the man's arm. 
JONATHAN Thank God. Look, I'm trying to find Wyatt. 
LAWYER Who? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him, cracking jokes in the coffee lounge. FLASH ON SAME SCENE: Wyatt looks up, eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting... but Wyatt just nods coolly. 
LAWYER I crack jokes with a lot of people. 
JONATHAN Hold on, you're telling me you don't-- 
LAWYER Hey - easy with the hands, okay? Jonathan realizes he's got the man's sleeve in his fist. He lets go, spins back to Ms. Pomerantz. 
JONATHAN He said he was in London with Mr. Rutherford, paperinga - 
MS. POMERANTZ                                                   (O.S.) Mister Messer. Jonathan spins to find Ms. Pomerantz scowling at him. A beat. 
MS. POMERANTZ Mr. Rutherford is presently recovering from hip surgery. In New Jersey. Jonathan glances around, to find everyone - lawyers, assistants, mail clerks                                         - all staring at him. 
INT. WYATT'S BROWNSTONE - DAY 
Breathless, Jonathan bolts up a set of stairs, knocks on a door. No answer. He knocks harder. From within we hear a set of FOOTSTEPS. Sound of a lock turning, the door is opened... 
JONATHAN Wyatt - .by a MAN in his early 60's, his WIFE behind him; both strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts types. 
JONATHAN Sorry, I                                                        -- I need to speak to Wyatt. 
MAN Excuse me - Wyatt? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN Wyatt Bose. He lives here. 
WOMAN In this building? He must be new. See, we've been out of town the past2 months - 
JONATHAN Not in this building - in this apartment. 
MAN 
(FROWNS) Young man, we've owned this apartment going on thirty years now. 
JONATHAN But... I was right-here-with him... The Man takes a step back, catching his wife's equally wary expression, his hand making for the chain lock. 
JONATHAN 
(DESPERATE) Wait!! That painting there, it's                              a Gerhard Richter, right? 
INT. HOTEL CASABLANCA - LOBBY - LATER 
Jonathan anxiously escorts ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN past the quasi- Moroccan motif. Asking her something, he takes out a folded paper from his pocket, shows it to her: it's the photocopy of Bansky's license with the image of Wyatt's face. She quickly shakes her head, her eyes searching for the exit. 
INT. THE LOMBARDY - BAR - NIGHT 
Jonathan trails a TALL WOMAN as she bee-lines for the exit. He grabs her arm, thrusts the photocopy into her hands. She halts, looks up at him... and tears it in two before handing it back and hurrying off, her glare full of paranoia. 
TNT. THE SHERRY-NETHERLAND - LOBBY - NIGHT Jonathan rises from a couch to greet YET ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN. He gets no more than a few seconds into his question when she about-faces without a word. Jonathan has a relentless look in his eye. Takes out his cell, calls another number... 
INT. VARIOUS HOTELS - LOBBY COUCHES - NIGHT 
Rapid jump cuts of A DOZEN DIFFERENT WOMEN'S FACES, all indicating twenty different kinds of "no"; with each cut the women occupy the exact same position in frame, only their faces and the hotel backgrounds behind them change. 
INT. THE MICHELANGELO - ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Room key in hand, Jonathan rides up with a woman in a BLACK BUSINESS SUIT - a tall, attractive business-type. Jonathan stares at his shoes, trying to mask his. utter exhaustion. 
INT. THE MICHELANGELO - A ROOM - NIGHT 
Jonathan and Black Business Suit come in. She starts to 
UNDRESS: 
JONATHAN I need to ask you something, it's incredibly important... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He pauses to unfold his now scotch-taped photocopy, shows it to her. She freezes, eyes fixed on the license photo. Jonathan braces himself for her departure                       - when she stares back up at him in scared but clear recognition. 
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER Seated on the edge of the made bed, Black Business Suit shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette. 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT I was in Chicago on business, a little over a year ago. I was out.to dinner with one of our Chicago partners,.a man named Holloway. That's how I met him. TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we SMASH TO: 
INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A slightly older man                                            (HOLLOWAY) sits with his back to us. Across from him sits Black Business Suit. A YOUNGER MAN steps into frame, rests his hand on Holloway's shoulder. 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.) At first I assumed he was a junior executive at their firm. But he wasn't. That's not to say he didn't work for Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate capacity... 
TNT. THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette. 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing - you know, this thing -- for a while. 
INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Wyatt is talking, entertaining his two companions - but clearly more focused on Black Business Suit, flirting it up. 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.) I was simply curious. More so when he apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten about another engagement. Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BACK TO MICHELANGELO ROOM 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT I was intrigued. He was intelligent, informed about everything from law to art to politics. I'd never met anyone so in command of his own charm. He said that he'd come from nothing, that everything he learned, he learned from his tricks. He claimed that Holloway was even grooming him for a position at his company. She lights another cigarette with her old one. 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT In a way, I felt for him. But I also admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a way of making me feel - close to him, you know? This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods. 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT So I found myself telling him things.. Personal things. And, next thing I knew - 
JONATHAN You told him. About this. A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette. 
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know all the details. 
(EXHALES) I suppose I'd had too much to drink. And I was distracted... I was thinking about what a great lay he was going to be. 
INT. FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -.SUITE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal aggression. She's on all fours, arching lustily, pleasure nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes. Exhausted, her body goes limp. TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of real pleasure. She struggles, tries to protest - when his hands grip her shoulder blades, thrusting harder, violently pinning her down, her sudden fear stifled by the mattress -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand grabs Jonathan's arm. He spins                                                        - it's a FIRE WORKER. 
JONATHAN I live here. 
INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker. His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down, furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls. 
FIRE WORKER Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat. Better get your valuables together. 
INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM 
still in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - "Duck on Bike" too. 
JONATHAN (calls out) How did it start? 
FIRE WORKER (O.S.) We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse. 
INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM 
Jonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left. Not very much. He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket. 
INT. SPARE BEDROOM 
Jonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take. He finds a file marked "Bank Statements," pulls it, about to toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its contents --- CLOSE ON THE FILE. Stuffed with paper. But not bank statements... Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan with Simone Forester. Some we've seen, some new. Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea telling us the contents of each and every file have been swapped out with photos. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of Jonathan and "S" walking in Chinatown. He scans through others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel Lotus... TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication - 
FIRE WORKER                                                     (O.S.) Mr. Messer? Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the doorway. He quickly shuts the file. 
JONATHAN Just                                                            - give me a minute. 
INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM 
A paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed near to bursting. The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently. 
FIRE WORKER That everything? Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation. 
JONATHAN I guess it is. 
FIRE WORKER You got someone you can stay with? 
INT. A SEEDY HOTEL LOBBY - DOWNTOWN - PRE-DAWN 
The sort of decrepit no-tell motel frequented by hookers and junkies. Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through steel mesh at. the NIGHT CLERK. 
NIGHT CLERK It's fifty for the night. Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what he discovers are his last three                                 $20s. 
INT. SEEDY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN 
Even more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows, stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of paid sex bleed in. Somewhere a bottle smashes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and "S." She's smiling up at him. EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in time, at once haunting and heartbreaking. He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway ("BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED"). His eyes drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him - FLASH ON: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN "WYATT'S.BROWNSTONE" of Wyatt with bleached hair styled in a loose spike -- IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17." 
CUT TO: Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand. 
OFFICE ON PHONE Boston Police, how can I direct your call? Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him: 
JONATHAN This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge number 274655.                                                                                                                     1   just need some information from you guys. Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally - 
OFFICER ON PHONE Well? 
JONATHAN You've got a case, a missing person named William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can tell me the date he was last seen? 
OFFICER ON PHONE Hold a sec. 
WYATT I have some instructions. Follow them and I might let her live. 
JONATHAN Where is she? 
WYATT This should've been simpler. I frame you, you panic... 
JONATHAN Where is she?! A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts: 
JONATHAN Goddamn it tell me what you did to-- 
WYATT Press pause on the questions and listen. The brokerage firm you're auditing is Clute Nichols. As a standard part of that audit you're temporarily privy to all client accounts as well as access codes required for transactions. At                                   11                              p.m. tonight you're going to skim from those accounts a total of                                             $200 million and transfer that money to an account I've established overseas. 
JONATHAN I can't                                                         - I have no idea how to even- 
WYATT I know you don't. But I do. Your passport. (brandishes the gun) Now, please. Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches it. And hands Jonathan an ENVELOPE. 
WYATT It's all in there.                                              11                              pm tonight. Their banks will just be opening. 
JONATHAN It won't work - they screen for stuff like this. It'll be discovered eventually. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT I can live with eventually. I always have. 
JONATHAN This account overseas                                   - it's in my name, isn't it? A moment of tense silence. Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then: 
JONATHAN Why'd you pick me? Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question. 
WYATT You answered the ad, Jonathan. (off Jonathan's confusion) "Feeling all alone out there? Have a great job, fine personality and good looks to match, but no time to.meet that special someone? Help is just a phone call away -" 
JONATHAN The ad - in Money magazine... 
WYATT 
(GRINS) Told you to block that Caller ID. Of course I had to scope out a whole lot of losers before I hit the jackpot. After all, there only so many Jonathan Messers out there. 
(BEAT) If you screw with me, well - you saw what I did to that Blonde? That's kindness compared to what I'll do to your little .girlfriend. You won't even recognize her when I'm through. 
JONATHAN Why should I believe you? Everything you told me was lies. 
WYATT Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now... now you're fucked. He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT Remember: be smart. I'll be watching you. And... feel free to take a shower, looks like you could do with one. The front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring shell-shocked at the envelope. 
EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER 
Jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his suit pocket. As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to find a car barrelling at us. Jonathan dives out of the way an instant before the car would have hit him. Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers up to see Wyatt's BLACK BMW speeding away. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WORTH & BERMAN - AN OFFICE - LATE DAY 
A stiff guy in his late-30s is working in his office when an ASSISTANT enters. 
ASSISTANT Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers is here to see you. Jonathan Messer? 
PETERSON 
(PUZZLED) Really? Well - okay, bring him back. We follow the assistant out the door, read the name stencilled on the glass "CHET PETERSON, SENIOR MANAGER." 
INT. WORTH & BERMAN - LOBBY 
Through a set of frosted glass doors we see Peterson's Assistant approach a RECEPTIONIST, who gestures across the lobby. The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is seated. She addresses him. He rises. 
INT. WORTH & BERMAN - PETERSON'S OFFICE 
(BEAT) Are you free tonight? A sudden, jarring SOUND ADVANCE OF MUSIC as we 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - ROOFTOP - LATE NIGHT 
An elaborate and intensely packed WEDDING PARTY is being held up here beneath the glow of heat lamps, the music and crowd noise unspeakably loud. We travel through the din, past hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy. 
EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT 
The party noise is even slightly audible                        30   stories below, where we find Jonathan carrying his bag as he enters... 
INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY 
Jonathan surveys the busy lobby. GUESTS mulling. STAFF bustling. And, of course, the "ELOISE" PORTRAIT. 
WYATT (O.S.)' May I ask you a personal question? Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic smile. With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers. Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand. 
JONATHAN Where is she? 
WYATT In one of the rooms. Safe. (a thin smile) I got us a table. 
INT. LOBBY BAR - MOMENTS LATER 
A WAITRESS delivers a pair of drinks to where Jonathan and Wyatt are seated. 
WAITRESS Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy. The Waitress leaves. Wyatt raises his glass. 
WYATT To friendship. Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt. 
JONATHAN Bansky's dead, isn't he? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT He was dead when I met him. Just like you. The rest was a mere formality. (re: the laptop) Of course he didn't have your bargaining chip. Speaking of which... 
JONATHAN Not until I see her. She's the only reason I'm here and not at the police. 
WYATT I told you, she's in a room. Alive. 
JONATHAN Give me the key then. Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on the key card to indicate a room number. 
WYATT As soon as you're done, I'll tell you the room number. 
JONATHAN Not good enough. Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a handgun concealed by his suit. 
JONATHAN You won't let her live. You killed all the others, you'll have to kill us too. 
WYATT Hey, I like you, okay? You'll be fine. 
JONATHAN (scoffs, repulsed) You like me. 
WYATT I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all, you're my creation. I'm the one who gave you life. 
JONATHAN Don't you get it? It was her, not you! She's the one. She gave me life! You can steal my identity, but not what's here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is startled by Jonathan's passionate outburst. 
WYATT Yeah, well, I'm weeping big wet ones for you both. Now, let's get on with it. 
(BEAT) I don't have all night, Jonathan. Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent. Wyatt lets go of the key card. Jonathan opens his bag... 
SAME - MOMENTS LATER CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep. The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an access code. Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then pauses, looking confused. Jonathan quickly reaches around. to the back of his laptop, feels an empty jack - and suddenly turns pale. 
WYATT What is it? 
JONATHAN My wireless modem - I must have left it in the conference room. I can't get back online. Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething. 
Wide shot of an empty hotel hallway -- as suddenly the fire alarm blares to life. Pan                                                                                                                                     180   to find Jonathan dipping into an emergency exit stairwell. 
INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY 
Wyatt is just about to step onto an elevator, when a crowd of wedding guests also start to pile in. Furious, he abandons the elevators for the nearest stairs. 
INT.                                                            7TH FLOOR HALLWAY 
GUESTS spilling out of rooms met by the blaring alarm... 
INT.                                                            8TH FLOOR HALLWAY 
. as Jonathan smashes the glass of yet another fire alarm. 
INT. LOBBY - SECURITY DESK 
Surveillance monitors show guests in the various hallways and stairwells rushing in confusion at all angles... 
SECURITY                                                        (O.S.) We've got alarms on two - wait, three floors                                                          - 
EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP 
Only the party 30 stories above remains oblivious: music still blasting, the upscale throngs still partying. 
INT. STAIRWELL 
Wyatt is bounding up the stairs, rounding the Fifth Floor - - when he hears the door overhead bang open, and like a tidal wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell. Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up the stairwell. 
INT.                                                            9TH FLOOR - HALLWAY 
Close on a door marked by a placard:   9th floor -- as it's banged open by Jonathan's shoulder. The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925...921...           918...   913...   910... Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907. He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot -- when a hand grabs his forearm! He spins in panic to -- - a CLEANING WOMAN. She says something.in Vietnamese, indicating the ringing alarms. 
JONATHAN Fire, I know - I'll be out in a minute. The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan quickly slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green. He jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find - 
INT. ROOM 907 
- nothing. The room is freshly made up, no sign of life other than A PORNO FILM BLARING from the TV set on Pay-Per-View. Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she? He searches every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere. The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set -- Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the TV and shoves it off its ledge. It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence. Jonathan rubs his brow, heaving in desperation -- when his eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the TV was 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan taps it, he realizes: it's hollow. He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall... And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: "S". Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over. She looks semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by how lifeless she appears - - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her face to his chest. 
âS., (whispers gratefully) You're alive. He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully. 
JONATHAN What do you say we stick together from now on? 
JA S" I'd like that. 
INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL 
A rush of guests hurriedly descending the staircase, a seemingly endless stream of densely packed faces. Close on Wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests - as he's the only one heading up. He passes the 6th floor... 
INT.                                                             9TH FLOOR 
Jonathan and "S" hurrying down the hall - Jonathan torn between a choice of two stairwells. His eyes dart from one to another                                                          - he finally gambles on the one to the right. 
INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL 
Wyatt forcing his way upstream with menacing determination; his gaze is wilder, more and more irritated by the descending mob of successful, well-dressed guests he's pushing against -- - when he halts, peering up through the railings' lozenge- shaped opening, past a collection of hands and profiles... .to Jonathan and "S" some three stories above. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: TIGHT ON WYATT. As yet unnoticed by Jonathan, he remains halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him. TIGHTER ON HIS EYES. That predatory gleam. EVEN TIGHTER ON HIS GUN, tucked carefully at his side. CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" three stories above, starting to descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the flow of bodies below. Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a good look. He grips the railing, leans further over... and his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him -- 
JONATHAN He's down there! I saw him - 
11 SIP Oh God - 
JONATHAN Up - we've got to go up! Clutching her arm, Jonathan and "S" turn back up, against the flow of traffic. Stories above, less and less people are evacuating. ANGLE ON WYATT as he presses upward, his steely gaze even more rapacious. The crowd is thinning as Jonathan and "S" race upward as well. INSERT JONATHAN'S POV: a shaky, dizzying blur as they race higher and higher... INSERT WYATT'S POV: from below but gaining on them, Jonathan and "S". appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn of the staircase... CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S", desperately racing upwards... CLOSE ON WYATT bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the staircase now empty and quiet, save for the footfall of Jonathan and "S"                                                 - no more than three floors above Wyatt now... Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the railing, takes aim... CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" still hurrying up - when a shot rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the

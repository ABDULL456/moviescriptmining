1	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 
Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND. As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS and PHRASES as though from a public address system. 
2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN 
in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading. 
3	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY 
Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there. 
4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY 
BEN - and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us?  Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless.  But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you.  I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.

SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at us through the air. 
16	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY 
Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT. 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent into Los Angeles - 
SOUND of a SONIC BOOM. 
CUT TO: 
17	INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT 
His eyes open suddenly. 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE The sound you have just heard is the landing gear locking into place.  The Los Angeles weather is clear and the temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do not expect any traffic delay and will make our four hour and eighteen minute flight plan smack on the nose.  We enjoyed having you on board and look forward to seeing you again in the near future. 
18	SHOT 
PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them. 
19	REVERSE ANGLE 
PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and looks out the window. 
20	EXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT 
Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every direction. 
SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH. 
BEN Just fine, Mr. Loomis. 
Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the hall. 
MR. LOOMIS I want to get a drink and then I want to hear all about that thing you won.  That Hopperman award. 
BEN Helpingham. 
MR. LOOMIS Helpingham!  Right!  Now you wait right here. 
Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket. 
LADY 1 Ben - we're all so proud of you. 
LADY 2 Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud. 
LADY 3 What are you going to do now? 
BEN I was going to go upstairs for a minute - 
LADY 3 No - I meant with your future. 
LADY 2 With your life. 
BEN Well - that's a little hard to say - 
MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben. 
MR. MCQUIRE Ben! 
Ben (to the ladies) Excuse me. (he turns around) Mr. McQuire 
MR. MCQUIRE (overwhelmed with pride) Ben. 
BEN Mr. McQuire. 
Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall toward the back of the house and out through the back door. 
30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT 
The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard. 
MR. MCQUIRE Ben - I just want to say one word to you - just one word - 
BEN Yes, sir. 
MR. MCQUIRE Are you listening? 
BEN Yes I am. 
MR. MCQUIRE (gravely) Plastics. 
They look at each other for a moment. 
BEN Exactly how do you mean? 
MR. MCQUIRE There is a great future in plastics. Think about it.  Will you think about it? 
BEN Yes, I will. 
MR. MCQUIRE Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal. 
Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben. 
WOMAN #1 Here he is now.  Here's Ben. 
BEN Excuse me just a minute - 
Ben goes into the house through the back door. 
31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT 
We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room. 
SOUND of a door SLAMMING. 
32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a window, the SOUND of the WIND. 
32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location) 
Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room. 
MRS. ROBINSON Oh.  I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it? 
BEN It's down the hall. 
They stand for a moment, loocking at each other. 
MRS. ROBINSON How are you, Benjamin? 
BEN Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is down at the end of the hall. 
Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed. 
BEN Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean to be rude but - 
Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and lights it. 
MRS. ROBINSON Is there an ashtray in here? 
BEN No. MRS. ROBINSON Oh - I forgot.  The track star doesn't smoke. 
She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the wastebasket. 
MRS. ROBINSON Is it a girl? 
BEN Is what a girl? 
MRS. ROBINSON Whatever it is you're upset about. 
BEN Are you always this much afraid of being alone? 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes. 
BEN Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed? 
MRS. ROBINSON I'm very nuerotic. 
She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH. 
MRS. ROBINSON May I ask you a question? 
Ben looks at her. 
MRS. ROBINSON What do you think of me? 
BEN What do you mean? 
MRS. ROBINSON You've known me nearly all of your life.  You must have formed some opinion. 
BEN Well - I've always thought that you were a very - nice - person. 
MRS. ROBINSON Did you know I was an alcoholic? 
BEN What? 
MRS. ROBINSON Did you know that? 
BEN Look - I think I should be going - 
MRS. ROBINSON Sit down, Benjamin. 
BEN Mrs. Robinson - if you don't mind my saying so - this conversation is getting a little strange.  Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and - 
MRS. ROBINSON No. 
BEN What? 
MRS. ROBINSON My husband will be back quite late. 
They look at each other.  Ben is half standing. 
MRS. ROBINSON He should be gone for several hours. 
She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and retreats around the other side of the chair. 
BEN Oh my God. 
MRS. ROBINSON Pardon? 
BEN Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no. 
MRS. ROBINSON What's wrong? 
BEN Mrs. Robinson, you didn't - I mean you didn't expect - 
MRS. ROBINSON What? 
BEN I mean - you didn't really think that I would do something like that. 
MRS. ROBINSON Like what? 
BEN What do you think? 
MRS. ROBINSON Well I don't know. 
BEN For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house.  You give me a drink.  You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours. 
MRS. ROBINSON So? 
BEN Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce me. 
There is a pause.  She looks at him. 
BEN (weaker) Aren't you? 
MRS. ROBINSON Why no.  I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you - 
BEN Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said? 
MRS. ROBINSON It's all right. 
BEN It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone. 
MRS. ROBINSON Sit down. 
BEN Please forgive me.  Because I like you.  I don't think of you that way.  But I'm mixed up. 
MRS. ROBINSON All right.  Now finish your drink. 
BEN Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you. 
MRS. ROBINSON We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink. 
BEN What is wrong with me? 
MRS. ROBINSON Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait? 
BEN Her portrait? 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes. 
BEN No. 
MRS. ROBINSON We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it? 
BEN Very much. 
We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to the doorway to Elaine's room. 
37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE I'm in the bathroom. 
BEN Well here's the purse. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Could you bring it up? 
BEN Well I'll hand it to you. 
Ben starts back up the stairs. 
BEN Come to the railing and I'll hand it up. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Benjamin - I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what. 
Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs. 
BEN I'm putting it on the top step. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse? 
Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly down the hall. 
BEN I'm putting it here by the door. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Will you bring it in to me? 
BEN I'd rather not. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE All right.  Put it in the room where we were. 
BEN Right. 
38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the door to the bedroom behind her. 
BEN Oh God. 
She smiles. 
BEN Let me out. 
She turns the lock on the door. 
MRS. ROBINSON Don't be nervous. 
BEN Get away from that door. 
MRS. ROBINSON I want to say something first. 
BEN Jesus Christ! 
MRS. ROBINSON Benjamin - I want you to know I'm available to you.  If you won't sleep with me this time - 
BEN Oh my God. 
MRS. ROBINSON If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement. 
BEN Let me out! 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you understand what I said? 
BEN Yes.  Yes.  Let me out! 
MRS. ROBINSON Because I find you very attractive and any time - 
There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside. Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into the hall and down the stairs. 
39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT 
Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again. SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING. 
MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE Is that Ben's car in front? 
BEN (jumping up) Yes, sir! 
FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters. 
BEN I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson home.  She wanted me to drive her home so I - I drove her home. 
MR. ROBINSON Swell.  I appreciate it. 
BEN She's upstairs.  She wanted me to wait down here till you got home. 
MR. ROBINSON Standing guard over the old castle, are you? 
BEN Yes, sir. 
Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass. 
MR. ROBINSON Here.  It looks like you need a refill. 
BEN Oh no. 
MR. ROBINSON What? 
BEN I've got to go. 
MR. ROBINSON Is anything wrong?  You look a little shaken up. 
BEN No.  No - I'm just - I'm just a little worried about my future.  I'm a little upset about my future. 
Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him. 
MR. ROBINSON Come on.  Let's have a nightcap together. 
Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks. Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson turns and brings him the drink. 
BEN Thank you very much, sir. 
MR. ROBINSON Ben - how old are you now? 
BEN'S VOICE Could I speak to you for a second, Dad? 
But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience. 
MR. BRADDOCK - what was I saying? 
MRS. ARNOLD Feature attraction. 
MR. BRADDOCK Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see you're paying attention.  A feature attraction that will be one of the most astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard. 
They all laugh and some applaud. 
MR. BRADDOCK Now I'm going to ask for a big round of applause to bring this boy out here - wait a minute - let me amend that - to bring this young man out here - because today he is twenty-one-years- old - 
MR. ARNOLD (his hands like a megaphone) Let's get on with the show! 
MR. BRADDOCK Just hang on a minute because I have a few words to say - 
MR. ARNOLD You always do. 
They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy comeback. 
BEN'S VOICE Dad - could we just talk about this for a second? 
MR. BRADDOCK Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning - 
MR. ARNOLD Bring him out! 
PETER AND LOUISE On with the show!  On with the show! 
MR. BRADDOCK (to the window) I can't hold them much longer, Ben.  You better get out here. 
BEN'S VOICE I'd like to discuss this. 
MR. BRADDOCK (to his audience) This boy - I'm sorry - this young man - is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halping- ham Award Scholar - but before he does - 
Mr. Braddock darts back to the window. 
MR. BRADDOCK - before he does - (to the window) You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them. 
BEN'S VOICE Dad - can you listen - 
MR. BRADDOCK (meaning it) I'll give you ten seconds. (back to the people) He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present - and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks - so let's hear it for - 
Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open. It slams against the wall inside. 
MR. BRADDOCK - Benjamin Braddock! 
44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY 
At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand. 
The people applaud. 
45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV 
The people in the backyard.  His father stands just outside the screen door. 
MR. BRADDOCK Folks - this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep - 
Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. 
We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it. 
SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly. 
We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. 
We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both begin to motion us toward them. 
We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under.  He has a big smile. 
We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool. 
46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV) 
Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking down into it. 
PULL UP AND UP AND UP 
Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners, swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing, sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools. SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND of the WIND. 
Hold for a few seconds, then: 
SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN 
In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Hello. 
BEN Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite know how to put this - 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Benjamin? 
BEN Look - I was thinking about that time after the party - 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Where are you? 
BEN - and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something - 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Where are you? 
BEN Uh - The Taft Hotel. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Did you get a room? 
BEN No.  Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather - 
The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table by the window. 
PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson. She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does not see her approach. 
MRS. ROBINSON Hello, Benjamin. 
BEN Oh.  Hello.  Hello. 
He rises quickly. 
MRS. ROBINSON May I sit down? 
BEN Of course. 
He pulls out a chair, for her. 
MRS. ROBINSON Thank you. 
They sit down. 
MRS. ROBINSON How are you? 
BEN Very well.  Thank you. 
Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down at the center of the table. 
MRS. ROBINSON May I have a drink? 
BEN A drink?  Of course. 
Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand. The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs. Robinson apologetically. 
BEN He didn't see me. 
MRS. ROBINSON Waiter! 
For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back. The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson. 
MRS. ROBINSON I will have a martini. 
WAITER No. 1 Yes, madam. 
The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go. 
MRS. ROBINSON You don't have to be so nervous, you know. 
BEN Nervous.  Well, I am a bit nervous.  I mean it's - it's pretty hard to be suave when you're - 
He shakes his head. 
MRS. ROBINSON Did you get us a room? 
BEN What? 
MRS. ROBINSON Have you gotten us a room yet? 
BEN I haven't.  No. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want to? 
BEN Well - I don't.  I mean I could. Or we could just talk. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want me to get it? 
BEN You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want to get it now? 
BEN Now? 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes. 
BEN Well - I don't know. 
MRS. ROBINSON Why don't you get it. 
BEN Why don't I get it?  Well - I will then. (he stands up) If you'll excuse me. 
Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

Ben walks to the front desk and stands there. 
ROOM CLERK Yes sir? 
BEN A room.  I'd like a room, please. 
BEN To tell you? 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes. 
BEN Well - I want you to know how much I appreciate this - really - 
MRS. ROBINSON The number. 
BEN What? 
MRS. ROBINSON The room number, Benjamin.  I think you ought to tell me that. 
BEN Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely. It's 512. 
MRS. ROBINSON Thank you. 
BEN You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.

Ben turns on the light switch on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on the light. 
61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area through the window.  Ben closes the blinds. 
61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room, finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him. 
MRS. ROBINSON Well? 
He clears his throat and then he kisses her. 
BEN Well. 
MRS. ROBINSON Benjamin. 
BEN Yes? 
MRS. ROBINSON I'll get undressed now.  Is that all right? 
BEN Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just stand here?  I mean - I don't know what you want me to do. 
MRS. ROBINSON Why don't you watch? 
BEN Oh - sure.  Thank you. 
She takes off her jacket.

SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern. 
PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot, half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set. 
SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up. 
Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way. 
SOUND of BRACELETS being put on. 
Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

MR. BRADDOCK Why? 
BEN Well - it's very comfortable - just to drift here. 
MR. BRADDOCK Have you thought about graduate school? 
BEN No. 
MR. BRADDOCK Would you  mind telling me then - what were those four years of college for?  What was the point of all that hard work? 
BEN You got me. 
MR. BRADDOCK (trying unsuccessfully to control himself) Now listen, Ben.  I think it's a very good thing that a young man - after he's done some very good work - should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on.  But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass. 
Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock. 
MRS. BRADDOCK The Robinson's are here. 
Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out the sun. 
MR. ROBINSON Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with yourself these days? 
BEN Oh - not too much.  Taking it easy. 
MR. ROBINSON That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that.  Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon.  I want you to call her up this time. 
BEN I will. 
MR. ROBINSON Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together. 
Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them.  (A long pause) 
MRS. BRADDOCK Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin. 
84	SHOT - BEN 
BEN Hello, Mrs. Robinson. 
MRS. ROBINSON Hello, Benjamin. 
MRS. ROBINSON If you want. 
BEN Good.  I mean are we dead or something? 
MRS. ROBINSON Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other. 
BEN All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together. 
MRS. ROBINSON Are you tired of it? 
BEN I'm not.  No.  But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then? 
MRS. ROBINSON Well what do you want to talk about? 
BEN Anything.  Anything at all. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences? 
BEN Oh my God. 
MRS. ROBINSON Well? 
BEN Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best we can do let's just get the god- damn clothes off and -- 
She reaches for her shoe. 
BEN Leave it on!  Now we are going to do this thing.  We are going to have a conversation.  Think of another topic. 
MRS. ROBINSON How about art. 
BEN Art.  That's a good subject. You start it off. 
MRS. ROBINSON You start it off.  I don't know anything about it. 
BEN Oh. 
MRS. ROBINSON Don't you? 
BEN Yes I do.  I know quite a bit about it. 
MRS. ROBINSON Go ahead then. 
BEN Art.  Well what do you want to know about it. 
She shrugs. 
BEN Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art. 
MRS. ROBINSON Neither. 
BEN You're not interested in art? 
MRS. ROBINSON No. 
BEN Then why do you want to talk about it? 
MRS. ROBINSON I don't. 
Ben nods and looks at the rug. 
MRS. ROBINSON Can I take off my clothes now? 
BEN No.  Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you really want me to? 
BEN Yes I do. 
MRS. ROBINSON I got up. 
Ben starts shaking his head. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want to hear it or not? 
BEN Yes.  But you might try and spice it up with a little originality. 
MRS. ROBINSON I got up.  I ate breakfast and went shopping.  During the after- noon I read a novel. 
BEN What one. 
MRS. ROBINSON What? 
BEN What novel did you read. 
MRS. ROBINSON I don't remember. 
Ben nods. 
MRS. ROBINSON Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until - 
BEN There! 
MRS. ROBINSON What? 
BEN Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about. 
MRS. ROBINSON Him? 
BEN I mean everything.  I don't know anything about how you - how you work this.  I don't know how you get out of the house at night.  I don't know the risk involved. 
MRS. ROBINSON There isn't any. 
BEN There's no risk? 
She shakes her head. 
BEN How do you get out of the house? 
MRS. ROBINSON I walk out. 
BEN You walk right out the door. 
BEN Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who... 
MRS. ROBINSON All right.  Now let's get to bed. 
BEN Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. So how did it happen? 
MRS. ROBINSON What? 
BEN I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances? 
MRS. ROBINSON Not particularly. 
BEN Was he a law student at the time? 
She nods. 
BEN And you were a student also. 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes. 
BEN At college. 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes. 
BEN What was your major? 
MRS. ROBINSON Why are you asking me all this? 
BEN Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college? 
MRS. ROBINSON Art. 
BEN Art? 
She nods. 
BEN But I thought you - I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then. 
MRS. ROBINSON Kind of. 
BEN Well how did it happen? 
MRS. ROBINSON How do you think. 
BEN I mean did he take you up to his room with him?  Did you go to a hotel? 
MRS. ROBINSON Benjamin, what does it possibly matter? 
BEN I'm curious. 
MRS. ROBINSON We'd go to his car. 
BEN Oh no.  In the car you did it? 
MRS. ROBINSON I don't think we were the first. 
Ben thinks for a moment. 
BEN What kind of car was it? 
MRS. ROBINSON What? 
BEN Do you remember the make of the car? 
MRS. ROBINSON Oh my God. 
BEN Really.  I want to know. 
MRS. ROBINSON It was a Ford, Benjamin. 
BEN (jumping up) A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a Ford!  That's great! 
MRS. ROBINSON That's enough. 
BEN So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford. 
There is a pause. 
MRS. ROBINSON Don't talk about Elaine. 
BEN Don't talk about Elaine? 
MRS. ROBINSON No. 
BEN Why not? 
MRS. ROBINSON Because I don't want you to. 
She walks to the bed. 
BEN Well why don't you? 
She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his jacket. 
BEN I wish you'd tell me. 
MRS. ROBINSON There's nothing to tell. 
BEN Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden? 
Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows. 
BEN Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's -- 
MRS. ROBINSON Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out. 
Ben looks at her. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you understand that? 
BEN Well look.  I have no intention of taking her out. 
MRS. ROBINSON Thank you. 
BEN Well don't thank me, because I want you to. 
There is a long pause. 
MRS. ROBINSON But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you?  I want you to promise me that. 
There is another long pause. 
BEN Look.  Why the hell did you bring this up.  It never occured to me to take her out. 
MRS. ROBINSON Then give me your word you won't. 
BEN This is absurd. 
MRS. ROBINSON Promise me, Benjamin. 
BEN All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson. 
MRS. ROBINSON Thank you. (pause) Benjamin - 
BEN Let's not talk about it.  Let's not talk at all. 
At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
92	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY 
Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are there. 
MR. BRADDOCK Elaine's back from school.  I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out. 
Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues eating and reading. 
CUT TO: 
93	INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the doorway. 
MRS. BRADDOCK Don't you think that she's a terribly attractive girl? Because I think she's one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen. 
Ben gives a small whimper. 
CUT TO: 
94	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY 
Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep their heads above the surface. 
MRS. BRADDOCK It's pretty embarrassing.  I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine. 
BEN Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life. 
MR. BRADDOCK I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it? 
BEN Look - Elaine Robinson and I do not get along. 
MR. BRADDOCK How do you know?  You haven't seen her since high school.  I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable. 
BEN That has nothing to do with it - 
MR. BRADDOCK I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening - doing God knows what - 
MRS. BRADDOCK Don't go on like this.  Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out - 
BEN I do. 
MRS. BRADDOCK - then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.

The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a table for two are seated, jammed in against each other, the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table, facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs. Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up. 
CUT TO: 
98	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY 
Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the pool.

Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head. 
BEN Elaine - I like you.  I like you so much.  Do you believe that? 
She nods. 
BEN Do you? 
ELAINE Yes. 
BEN You're the first - you're the first thing for so long that I've liked.  The first person I could stand to be with. 
She takes his hand. 
BEN I mean my whole life is such a waste.  It's just nothing.  I'm sorry.  I'll take you home now. 
He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car. 
ELAINE Benjamin - are having an affair with someone? 
He freezes with his hand still on the key. 
ELAINE I'm sorry. 
He turns off the engine. 
ELAINE I'm sorry.  That is not my business. 
BEN It just happened.  It was just this thing that happened along with everything else.  Can you understand that? 
She nods. 
ELAINE Was she married or something? 
BEN Yes. 
ELAINE With a family? 
BEN Yes.  She had a husband and a son. 
ELAINE Did they ever find out? 
BEN No. 
ELAINE And it's all over now.

It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package. From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift. Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out, dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps, reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap. 
MRS. ROBINSON Drive down the block. 
BEN Mrs. Robinson - I have a date with Elaine.  We're going for a drive. 
MRS. ROBINSON (looking at him for the first time) Do exactly what I say. 
Ben starts the car forward down the driveway. 
125	ANOTHER ANGLE - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON 
As they drive. 
ELAINE Please - will somebody tell me - 
She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again. Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the door.  Elaine looks away. 
ELAINE Oh - no. 
Ben backs up. 
BEN Elaine - 
ELAINE Oh my God - 
Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben as possible, Elaine moves away from the door. 
BEN Please. 
Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out of her eyes. 
BEN No - don't cry - 
ELAINE GET OUT! 
BEN Don't cry. (holds the package out to her) 
ELAINE Get out of here. 
She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut. 
ELAINE (holding the door) Get out!

Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben. 
MRS. ROBINSON (calmly) Goodbye, Benjamin.

DISSOLVE TO: 
140	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY 
It is early morning.  We see a swinging door pushed open to reveal:  Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can see an orange tree.  Mr. Braddock is pouring orange juice from a MINUTE MAID container.  Ben stands inside door. 
MR. BRADDOCK Say that again. 
BEN I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson. 
MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE. 
MR. BRADDOCK Well - well - well - 
He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand to shake it.  Mrs. Braddock appears in the doorway.  Ben is shaking his father's hand. 
MRS. BRADDOCK What's happening? 
MR. BRADDOCK Ben says he and Elaine are getting married. 
MRS. BRADDOCK I don't believe it. 
MR. BRADDOCK That what he says.  Right? 
BEN I'm going up to Berkeley today. 
MRS. BRADDOCK Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting - 
MR. BRADDOCK Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate. 
BEN No.  I think you'll want to wait on that. 
MRS. BRADDOCK They don't know? 
BEN No - they don't. 
ELAINE Benjamin - I would like to know what you're doing here. 
BEN Here?  In Berkelely? 
ELAINE Yes. 
BEN Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street - and I've been getting to some classes - 
ELAINE But you're not enrolled. 
BEN No.  I just sit in.  They don't seem to mind.  They've been very congenial about it. 
She looks at him and starts to shake her head. 
ELAINE Benjamin - you're - I don't know what to say - you're -- 
BEN Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it. 
ELAINE - really incredible - 
BEN Here he comes. 
ELAINE What? 
BEN I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow. 
Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH. 
CARL (waving) Elaine! 
BEN He certainly is a good walker. 
Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and takes Elaine's hands. 
CARL Am I late?  I'm sorry. 
BEN We thought you said by the monkey house. 
Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben. Ben smiles. 
ELAINE This is Benjamin Braddock. Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode here with me on the bus. 
CARL Glad to meet you, Ben. 
Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand. 
BEN Great meeting you, Carl. 
Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder. The three of them look at each other for a moment. 
BEN Swell seeing you.  Have a good time. 
Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back at: 
177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE 
Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks. 
178	SHOT - BEN 
As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears. The agony is such that he has to steady himself with his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place. He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can, crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron. He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires to straighten it out with the iron. 
There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can, then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper on his lap. 
BEN Come in. 
There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

ELAINE Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us? 
BEN Elaine - right now I don't feel like talking much.  I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now. 
He stands, looking into the empty suitcase. 
ELAINE Can I just sit here while you're packing? 
BEN If you want. 
Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets down on his knees and looks under the bureau. 
ELAINE What are you looking for? 
BEN My belt. 
ELAINE Don't you have it on? 
BEN No.  I have two.  The other one is the one I'm looking for. (he reaches under the bureau) What's this? (he brings out a marble) It's from my grandmother. 
ELAINE The marble? 
BEN The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother. 
ELAINE Oh. 
Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it. 
ELAINE What are you going to do now? 
BEN I don't know. 
He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear and carries them to the suitcase. 
ELAINE Are you going home? 
BEN No. 
ELAINE Well - where are you going? 
He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the suitcase. 
BEN Elaine - you're going to have to stop asking me that. 
He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine gets up, goes to the door and opens it. 
ELAINE I don't want you to leave tomorrow. 
BEN I don't understand. 
ELAINE I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.

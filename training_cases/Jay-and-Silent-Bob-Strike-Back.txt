JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK 
Screenplay by 
Kevin Smith 
OVER BLACK WE SEE: 
CHYRON 
A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far away-- 
EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY 
We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in the Mother's hands. 
MOTHER Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese, 'kay? 
She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby. 
MOTHER This'll keep the sun out of your eyes. You be good now. 
She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar. 
Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets her Baby down beside him. 
MOTHER Don't fucking move, you little shit- machine. Mommy's gonna try to score. 
A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted. 
PASSERBY Excuse me--who's watching these babies? 
MOTHER The fat one's watching the little one. 
PASSERBY Oh, nice parenting. (walking away) Leave'em out here like that and see what happens. 
The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird. 
MOTHER FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE! 
PASSERBY (waving her off) Ah, keep on truckin'. 
MOTHER (to baby) D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me how to fuckin' raise you? Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking think he is? What's the worse fuckin' thing could happen to you sitting outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck! 
The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing. The smaller one says-- 
BABY Fuck, fuck, fuck... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE PRESENT 
JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record Rack is now RST VIDEO. 
Jay is mid-chant. 
JAY (as a chant) --fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother- fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck, noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed, smoking weed, doing coke, drinking beers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers, rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who smokes the blunts? We smoke the blunts! 
A pair of TEENS approach them. 
TEEN 1 Lemme get a nickel bag. 
JAY Fifteen bucks, little man. Put the money in my hand. If the money does not show, then you owe-me-owe-me- owe. (changing up to Morris Day) My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh! I think I want to know ya', know ya'-- 
TEEN 1 (digging in pockets) What the hell are you singing? 
JAY You don't know "Jungle Love"? That shit is the mad notes. Written by God Herself and handed down to the world's greatest band--the motherfucking Time. 
TEEN 2 The guys in that Prince movie? 
TEEN 1 Purple Rain. 
TEEN 2 Man, that shit was so gay--fucking eighties style. 
Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against the wall. 
JAY Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind word about The Time! Me and Silent Bob modeled our whole fucking lives after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and Tubby here's my black manservant! 
Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door behind him. 
JAY But they said Jay and Silent Bob! They used our real names. It doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life. 
HOLDEN Really. 
JAY Yeah! And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like "Oooo! I want to suck youse guys dicks off. What's your names?"  And I'll be like, "Jay and Silent Bob." And she'll be like, "Oh--I read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs."  And then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our good names! 
HOLDEN First off, I don't know how good your names really are. Secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile. The Internet's given everyone in America a voice, and everyone in American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. As long as there's a Bluntman and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it.  Jay steams, thinking. Then, a light dawns on him. 
JAY But wait a second--if there wasn't a Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent Bob, right? 
HOLDEN They're not saying anything about you now--they're talking about fictional characters! 
JAY (oblivious to Holden; to Bob) So all we gotta do is stop 'em from making the movie! 
HOLDEN Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process. Are you fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. I mean, a Jay and Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to see that? 
Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for a beat. Then-- 
HOLDEN But since it is happening, you might as well just ignore the idiots on the Internet, go find Banky, and get your "motherfucking movie check." As you so succinctly put it. That's what's important here. 
JAY No, Holden McNeil--what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do. (off monitor) When did it say they're making that movie? 
HOLDEN They start this Friday. 
JAY So if today's Tuesday, that gives us-- (counts) Eight days. 
HOLDEN It's more like three days. 
JAY Right. Three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made! C'mon, Silent Bob-- 
Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose. 
JAY We're going to Hollywood. 
They stride off. Holden shakes his head. 
HOLDEN Now that's what I call the Blunt leading the Blunt. 
EXT. BUS STATION--DAY 
Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled "Los Angeles." They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After a beat, they re-emerge. 
JAY Tickets? Since when did they start charging for the bus? 
They head toward the depot. 
JAY Didn't we used to ride that shit to school every day for free? 
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY 
The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey. 
INT. BUS--SAME 
Jay makes his way up to the DRIVER. 
JAY We in Hollywood yet? 
DRIVER It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles, sir. We left twenty minutes ago. 
JAY I didn't ask you about Los Angeles. I asked you about Hollywood. 
DRIVER Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir. 
JAY Don't change the subject! Are we in Hollywood yet or not? 
DRIVER Please sit down, sir. 
Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat. 
JAY Why don't you take your seat Ralph Kramden-- 
Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob. 
JAY I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't shit to so on this bus. 
Silent Bob mimes jerking off. 
JAY I already did that. Twice. 
JAY Yeah, but we ain't gay. 
GUY Well, neither am I. But have you seen the price of bus tickets lately? Shit--I don't wanna cough up two hundred bucks just to get to Chicago. 
JAY Well, I don't wanna cough up some dude's sperm! 
GUY Don't be so suburban--this is the new millennium. Gay, straight--it's all the same now. There're no more lines. 
Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot. 
JAY There's one. On this side of it, we ain't gay. 
GUY All hitchers do this. Why do you think people pick us up? If you get a ride, it's expected--I don't care who the driver is. It's the first rule in the Book. 
JAY What book? 
GUY The unwritten Book of the Road. 
A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy points to it, as if to say "See?" The passenger-side door opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He looks out the window at Jay and Bob. 
GUY Follow the rules of the Book, and you'll get where you're going in no time.  Excuse me. 
Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road. 
Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window and leans toward them. 
NUN You two boys need a ride? 
INT. CAR--LATER 
The NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun. 
NUN You both don't have to sit back there. One of you can sit up here with me. 
Silent Bob shakes his head "no" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs up front. 
NUN So where are you boys from? 
JAY New Jersey. 
NUN What brings you to Indiana? 
JAY We're going to Hollywood. 
NUN Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways away. 
JAY Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up. 
NUN Well, do unto others. That's what the Book says. 
JAY (misinterpreting completely) Wait a minute--you follow the Book, too? 
NUN I live my life by it. 
JAY Really? You? 
NUN Of course. You know how lonely it gets on the road? Thanks to the Book, I'm never alone--if you know what I mean. 
JAY I guess. This guy back there explained it to us. But I didn't think you'd be into that. 
NUN Are you kidding? I've dedicated my life to it. Every hour of every day. 
JAY Shit--you nuns are alright. 
NUN You live by the Book, too? 
JAY You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta. 
NUN That's good to hear. But it takes deed, not words. It's a lot easier to say you live by the Book than to actually do it. (looks at him) Can you do it? 
JAY You want me to do it right now? 
NUN No time like the present, right? 
Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head "no." Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and starts to bend down. 
JAY Alright. (he suddenly stops) You hear that? She's not a Catholic. She's a Presbyterian. 
Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed. 
EXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY 
An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob enter. 
INT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME 
As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm. 
JAY Yo--check that shit out: the Internet. Let's see if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick. 
Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look at the screen and go wide-eyed. 
JAY "Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob is gonna lick balls, because they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely each other's." 
Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed. 
JAY Eww. (reading further) "Yes--they are real people. Real stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal." (to Bob) Motherfucker! It's time we wrote something back! Type this shit down. 
Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates. 
JAY All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball- lickers.  We're gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches. Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who are making the movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our shit that we made 'em eat. Then all you motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay and Silent Bob. 
Silent Bob finishes typing and presses "Return". He and Jay nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking up at the menu board. 
JAY That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get back on the road, get to Hollywood, and stop that fucking movie from getting made. No more hairy-bush nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing-- and I mean NOTHING--distract me. 
As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. She's bathed in light, glowing. 
She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us. 
Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's eyes, getting zero response. 
JAY'S POV 
The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to her breasts, then down to her crotch. 
Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him. 
But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She smiles at the zombified Jay. 
GIRL (off cup) Oh my God. Do you get free refills with that? 
JAY Oh, what--this? I just wear this for protection. You know--so no guys try to grab my shit. 
GIRL Hi. I'm Justice. 
JAY (dreamily) And I am so fucking yours-- 
Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze. 
JAY I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my hereto life-mate, Silent Bob. 
JUSTICE It's nice to meet you. 
JAY Justice, hunh? That's a nice name. (under his breath, to Bob) Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F- U-C-K-I-N-G-- (back to Justice) So you come here often? 
JUSTICE Oh, I'm not from around here. My friends and I are taking a road trip, and we just stopped to grab something to eat. 
JAY Your friends, hunh? Where they at? 
JUSTICE (pointing) Out there. By that van. 
Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair around, looking incredibly sexy. 
Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him-- 
JAY Dude--I think I just filled the cup. 
INT. VAN--DAY 
Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food to her friends. 
JAY Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!! 
SISSY Who the fuck are these guys? 
JUSTICE This is Jay and Silent Bob. (to Jay and Bob) Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy. 
CHRISSY Where the fuck did they come from? 
Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts them. 
JUSTICE Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical lab where they perform gross experiments on animals. 
JAY So, what kind of animals are we talking about here--like bears and rhinos? 
BRENT No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats... heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak for them, who will? (touches Justice's arm) Right, Jussy? 
Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After a beat, he relaxes. 
JAY Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you over here for a second? 
Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him confidentially. 
JAY Be honest, yo--you're down with this for the fine-ass pussy, right? 
BRENT I'm down with this because I love animals, stupid. 
JAY Even sheep? 
BRENT Of course. Sheep are beautiful creatures. 
JAY They are beautiful, aren't they? 
BRENT Oh God, yes. 
JAY So then you'd fuck a sheep? 
BRENT What is your damage little boy? You've got a sick and twisted world perspective. 
JAY No, you misunderstand me, Prince Valiant. I mean if you were another sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if you were another sheep? 
BRENT I--suppose so. 
JAY That's what I thought. (suddenly loudly, to all) YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP! 
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY 
The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off. 
JAY YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!! 
EXT. HIGHWAY--LATER 
The van drives down the road. 
INT. VAN--SAME 
Missy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels between them. 
CHRISSY What the fuck are we gonna do now? 
SISSY Shut up, I'm thinking. 
In the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her, and she quickly folds them up. 
JAY Is Hollywood near where we're going? 
JUSTICE Is that where you guys are from? 
JAY Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent! 
JUSTICE Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you all the way out here? 
JAY Well, we couldn't hang in front of the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of the strainen-en order, which sucks ass 'cause it's been like our home since we were kids. Silent Bob even busted his cherry there. 
JUSTICE (to Bob) You did? I'll bet she was a lucky girl. 
Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has strayed. 
JAY Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying to tell a story here. 
JUSTICE Sorry. 
JAY Anyway, we were talking to Brodie and he said there's gonna be a Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we went to see Holden McNeil, and he showed us the Internet, and that's where we found all these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us. So we decided to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from getting made.  And now we're here. 
JUSTICE Wow. I have no idea what you just said. 
JAY Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like animals, huh? 
SISSY Why the fuck did you let that little stoner throw Brent our of the van?! 
JUSTICE Oh please--if I had to listen to one more of those stupid songs, I was going to throw him out myself. 
SISSY We needed Brent, Justice! He was our patsy! 
JUSTICE We'll find someone else. Besides, I didn't see you trying to stop Jay from throwing him out. 
SISSY Because I didn't want to blow our cover! 
JUSTICE Cover, shmover--you all hated his songs, too. 
CHRISSY Not as much as I hate you. 
Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance, 
CHRISSY Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone! 
SISSY (rubbing Chrissy's shoulders) Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a little too wound for sound. 
CHRISSY Then how about you help me take the edge off? 
Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other customers regard them wide-eyed. 
JUSTICE (to Customers) They're really good friends. 
SISSY (TO CHRISSY AND MISSY) Would you two knock it off? We're in the fucking heartland here! Try to blend! 
JUSTICE They already do--she's the milkmaid, and she's the cow. 
CHRISSY Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow, bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your head off and fuck your spine stump. 
SISSY Enough! (calm to Justice) We have a very simple gang here, Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl. But lately, I'm having a hard time figuring out what you're doing here. 
JUSTICE That makes two of us. 
CHRISSY Shit--your name doesn't even fit the rhyme scheme. 
JUSTICE That's because very few names rhyme with "douchebag." 
CHRISSY (getting in her face) You're dancing on my last nerve, Strawberry Shortcake. (to Sissy) You deal with the weak link. I'm gonna take Missy into the dirty convenience store bathroom and hate- fuck the shit out of her. 
Chrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go. 
JUSTICE And you said letting them read all that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to anything. 
SISSY Don't change the subject. You know what you have to do now, right? Since you let our patsy slip away, you've gotta convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place. They've gotta break into Provasik now. 
JUSTICE Uh-uh! 
SISSY Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out of this gang. Just use the little one's crush to convince him, since he's so fucking in love with you. 
JUSTICE Jay? No he's not. 
SISSY What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing your hand back in the van like he was fucking Lord Byron? 
JUSTICE Well, maybe he was just raised with manners. 
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY 
A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store. 
JAY (to exited Girl) YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?! (to Bob) Yeah. 
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY 
Sissy continues to confront Justice. 
SISSY You're the one that brought the kid in, Jussy. So you've gotta make amends. 
JUSTICE Jay is not taking Brent's place as the patsy. 
SISSY That kid and his quite friend are our only options at this point. Now we got about two hours before we get to Boulder. That gives you plenty of of time to work on him. 
JUSTICE I'm not gonna do it. 
SISSY Why the fuck not? 
JUSTICE Because he's just to so innocent! 
CHRISSY Kaboom, you little stoner fucks. 
The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into the car with them. 
CHRISSY It's set. Let's roll. 
The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there. The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting down from two minutes. 
INT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT 
Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the cages. Jay hits him. 
JAY What the fuck are you looking at? There ain't no snacks here, man! Now we got what we came for, so let's get the fuck out! 
Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes his head frustrated. 
JAY Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck are we supposed to do about it? 
Silent bob offers Jay a look. 
EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT 
The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob (carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs, birds, rabbits. All race off into the night. 
Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it. 
JUSTICE JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS! 
Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks. 
JAY Oh shit-- 
Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay looks to Bob, pissed 
COP DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS EXPLOSIVE! 
The counter on the device attached to the van hits "0," and the van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one direction, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye. 
JAY Justice-- 
We crane up from him as he bellows-- 
JAY JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!! 
Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still carrying the bag. 
EXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY 
We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY opening the door and heading inside. 
INT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY 
The Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go wide. 
DEPUTY Oh, fudge... (calling off) Marshal Willenholly! 
INT. BATHROOM--SAME 
MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks off. 
WILLENHOLLY Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby-- It takes two hands to hold doesn't it--?  Uhhh-- 
As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him. 
WILLENHOLLY WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING! 
DEPUTY (O.S.) Sir, we got a report of a break-in at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing lab. 
Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine. There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants. 
WILLENHOLLY Have you read this article on the mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I wish that was in our jurisdiction-- I'd shut down every last one of those ass-cock chuggers, personally. 
The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then at Willenholly. 
WILLENHOLLY What? "Ass" means "donkey." 
DEPUTY Yes, sir. (hands him a fax) 
WILLENHOLLY (looks at fax) Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet. 
Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at-- 
SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them, staring back. 
JAY This is Jussy's monkey (to Suzanne, angrily) JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY FUCK! 
Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and pulling back as if he's going to strike. 
JAY (to Silent Bob) Do something. Tons of Fun! 
Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to see over silent Bob. 
JAY Is that fucking thing waving at us? 
Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at the ape. 
JAY Holy shit? That monkey understood us! Maybe it's some sort of super- monkey! 
Suzanne offer them a "raspberry." Spitting as if the comment was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at this. 
JAY What the fuck was that for? It's not a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo? 
Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, "Congo stunk." Silent Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him, stung. 
JAY You're my bitch. You get my back. Don't go joining this chimp's side. 
Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers. 
JAY Yo--what if there's more super monkeys up in the lab? Maybe they're making an army of 'em up there! Holy shit! Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the X-Files Roswell--style! 
JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see-- 
INT. LAB--DAY 
We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files. 
JAY (V.O.) Working in secret with a crew of double-dealing, nicotine-fiending fucks that're selling out the human race, these supermonkeys will use simian science and their genius IQ's to make man and monkey alike believe that they're the superior species! 
EXT. BALCONY--DAY 
A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of apes, who wave fists in the air. 
JAY (V.O.) Then all it'll take is one little monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the dumber chimps into a frenzy, until they go all ape-shit and start demanding more bananas, better pay, and human flesh! 
EXT. FIELD--DAY 
Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield, and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net over him. 
JAY (V.O.) You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job. And if you don't wind up with a monkey hog in your mouth, you'll be captured, killed or worse... 
INT. LAB--DAY 
Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a living, screaming, Dante. 
JAY (V.O.) Eaten alive! 
EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY 
The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop 
JAY (V.O.) Then these monkey fucks'll start wearing our clothes and rebuilding the world in their image. 
EXT. BEACH--DAY 
We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up, then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised. 
JAY (V.O.) And only those who outwit those damn dirty apes'll ever remember that it was MAN who once ruled the earth! 
JAY (at statue) YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!! 
WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO: 
EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY 
Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne angrily. 
JAY Not on my watch, motherfucker! 
Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously. 
CHRISSY The only thing I regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals. 
MISSY You are so nasty. 
CHRISSY I'll show you nasty, you little slut. 
SISSY Would you two get a room? 
CHRISSY Fine--we'll take yours. (getting up in Sissy's face) I am gonna stain your sheets, bi- otch. 
Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls her eyes. 
SISSY Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure. 
JUSTICE They're your gang. 
SISSY Oh and not yours? You know, I don't get you, Justice. You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning, blowing shit up. Now you're like this little priss with a conscience. It's really a fucking drag. 
JUSTICE We all gotta grow up some time. 
SISSY If moping around over some little boy you're crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos. 
JUSTICE Don't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys? 
SISSY Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend? Then how about taking a shower? 
Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace. They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas. 
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY You the gals that ordered the pizzas? 
SISSY This dopey bitch ordered the large plain, but I could go for some hot, thick, Sicilian. 
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY No charge, lady.  He rushes into the motel, Justice sighs, looking up at the stars. 
JUSTICE (quietly) I'm sorry, Jay. 
INT. DINER--DAY 
Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne digs into a banana split. 
JAY You know, Justice died trying to save this monkey, so maybe we should keep her around. That way, we can honor her memory. 
Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their food. 
JAY Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing all sentimental, and you're all about a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't you glad we stopped to eat?  And you were all piss-scared the cops'd bust us or something. You know what I say? (singing, a la NWA) 
VOICE (O.S.) (via bullhorn) THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER THE ORANGUTAN! 
Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then-- 
JAY You think they're talking to us? 
EXT. DINER--DAY 
There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other COPS. 
SHERIFF YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY. (to other COPS) Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty. 
Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind the car, gun drawn. 
SHERIFF The ape. 
WILLENHOLLY What? 
SHERIFF An orangutan's a member of the great ape family. It's not a monkey. 
WILLENHOLLY Look, who's the Federal Wildlife Marshal here? (into bullhorn) JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE. SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT! 
INT. DINER--DAY 
Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth, like scared rats. 
JAY What the fuck are you waiting for? Go out there and give 'em the monkey. 
Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked. 
JAY Oh, what, man? I said that shit before I knew they were gonna shoot us! Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't takin' no bullet for no monkey! 
Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay rolls his eyes. 
Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets. 
JAY FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!! 
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY 
The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't), shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at it, screaming.

As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the tunnel. She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent Bob's hands.

Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of the tunnel. 
JAY You see that shit? Damn--remind me not to get on the monkey's bad side. Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so we can get the fuck out of here.

EXT. DAM--DAY 
Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the road, 
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY 
Suzanne sits by the side of the road. A car pulls into the shot. 
Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway just in time to see-- 
The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is looking out the back window waving.  Jay and Bob leap to their feet, chasing after the truck. 
JAY HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?! 
The truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob stand there, panting. 
JAY Man! Who the fuck just steals a monkey?! 
Silent Bob indicates themselves. 
JAY Oh yeah. (pissed) Well this fucking blows! We got one more day to stop those fucks from making that movie, and someone goes and takes the only thing I had left from the one woman I ever loved enough NOT to try to stick my hand down her pants! 
Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne. 
JAY Go after the monkey? How the fuck are we supposed to know where that thing's going? 
Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares at him. 
JAY What? What is that supposed to mean?! Don't just fucking point like-- (imitates him) You ain't the broad in the Children of a Lesser God. Use you fucking mouth for more than eating, ya tubby bitch! 
Bob starts an elaborate pantomime. Jay tries to guess what he's saying. 
JAY You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta take a salad? Take a salad? What the fuck are you trying to say? 
Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message. 
JAY JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!? 
Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face. 
SILENT BOB THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB FUCK!!! 
Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the direction of the car went. Jay watched him go for a beat, then follows, muttering under his breath-- 
JAY Say it, don't spray it, bitch.

DEALER I don't know that the fuck you just said, little kid. But you touched a brother's heart, so I'm gonna help you out with some directions to the studio. 
JAY You know where Miramax is at? 
DEALER Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for seventy-eight percent of my business. 
INT. E! ENTERTAINMENT NEWS--DAY 
After E! news logo plays. CUT TO STEVE KMETKO in studio. 
STEVE KMETKO Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent Bob?  A source at the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office tells us a posting was pulled off an Internet movie chat board that was allegedly written by the two domestic terrorists themselves. It's sending a shockwave through Hollywood. Jules Asner's on the scene at Miramax Studios, Jules? 
Jules Asner is in front of the Miramax Studios main gate. 
JULES ASNER Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is one of terror today, after the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office learned that hot, new terrorists Jay and Silent Bob are targeting Miramax Studios for their next campaign of blood, violence and monkey-theft. In the posting, pulled off Movie Poop Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome threatened, quote-- (reading) "Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax Expletive-Deleted who are making the Bluntman and Chronic movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive- Deleted, which is made up of our Expletive-Deleted, then eat their Expletive-Deleted, which is made up of our Expletive-Deleted that we made 'em eat. Unquote. So far, we haven't been able to get a statement from anyone here are the studio. 
BACK TO STEVE in the E! Studio. 
STEVE Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are on the lot, shooting a super-secret project. Have you seen then roaming around? 
BACK TO JULES at Miramax Studios. 
JULES No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck buying a soda at a concession stand earlier. 
STEVE But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob? 
JULES None whatsoever. However, to be fair, all the feds have to work with is murky videotape, so no one's even a hundred percent sure what Jay and Silent Bob look like, exactly. For all we know, they could already be on the lot. 
As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera and start waving behind Jules. 
INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY 
Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops out of her seat. 
JUSTICE Oh my God! Jay! No! 
Justice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on-- 
The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table. 
Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks for a beat, then-- 
JUSTICE Fuck it. 
She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in her pocket. 
INT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY 
The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning. Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity. Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads: SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM. 
EXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY 
The convertible skids out, taking off. 
INT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY 
There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap). Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note. 
SISSY That bitch!  That fucking, fucking bitch!!! (to girls) Get dressed. We're going after her. 
CHRISSY Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet. 
SISSY Which is more important to you: a fortune in diamonds or busting a nut? 
Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties. 
SISSY (O.S.) Chrissy! Now! 
CHRISSY Fuck-- 
Chrissy races back up the stairs. 
EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY 
The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob. 
JAY We gotta play this right. 
Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle and giving chase. 
AGENT SID I'll bet, Will. What's it this time... Beaver trouble? Some kind of unauthorized marsupial trafficking? 
The agents crack up, stifling their laughter. 
WILLENHOLLY (taking it in stride) No, no--nothing like that. Say--there aren't other people listening in, are there? 
AGENT SID No way, man. It's just me and you talking here. 
WILLENHOLLY Good. I'm tracking a monkey down that's on it's way to Los Angeles, and I could use some bureau backup. 
AGENT SID Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should stake out Clint Eastwood's place. Didn't he used to drive around with a monkey that'd punch people and drink beer? 
The Agents crack up. Willenholly's catching on. 
WILLENHOLLY Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone? 
AGENT SID No way--Dunston! 
WILLENHOLLY Alright, now that's not fair. I know I didn't make it as high up as you guys, but my job's just as important. 
AGENT SID Calm down, Will. Don't go all... bananas on us! 
The Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed. 
WILLENHOLLY I come to you as a friend--as a fellow professional--and this is the shit I get?! 
AGENT SID You're right, Will. Tell you what-- we'll get our best man on your case right away. You might've heard of him. He's a doctor. 
WILLENHOLLY (excited) Oh, a doctor? 
AGENT SID His name's Doctor Zaius! 
The Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly tears up, enraged. 
WILLENHOLLY SCREW YOU GUYS! 
Willenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking laughter still emitting from it. Willenholly cries. 
EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS LOT--DAY 
The Red Light FLASHES outside the soundstage. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME 
Jay and silent Bob stand amidst a line of EXTRAS. Silent Bob looks O.C. goes wide-eyed, and pokes Jay, pointing O.C. Jay looks and sees-- 
A COLLEGE BAR set that looks like the College Bar from Good Will Hunting, complete with CLARK (the stuffy college jerk). MATT DAMON stands off to the side, loosening up for the scene. BEN AFFLECK calls to the O.C. DIRECTOR. 
BEN Where are we taking it from, Gus? 
Gus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money. He just shrugs. 
GUS I'm busy. 
BEN You're a true artist, Gus 
MATT Just take it from "It's a good course." 
BEN Oh, now you're the director. 
MATT Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's remember who talked who into doing this shit in the first place. Talking me into Dogma was one thing, but this-- 
BEN I'm sorry this is taking you away from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses- who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely- flick you're supposed to be doing this week. 
MATT Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you never saw Forces of Nature? 
BEN You're like a child. What've I been telling you? Sometimes you've gotta do the safe picture. Sometimes, you do it for art. Sometimes, it's the payback picture your friend says you owe him-- 
They take a beat and look at the camera. Then-- 
BEN And sometimes, you go back to the well. 
MATT And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games. 
BEN Now that's just mean. 
Jay turns excitedly to Bob. 
JAY This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, 'cause that's those two fucks from that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do is figure out a way to get close to them-- 
Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see-- 
Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar- looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4 
CLAPPER/LOADER Scream four, scene thirty-seven, take one. (claps it and rushes off) 
WES CRAVEN Action! 
The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff, until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out. 
SHANNEN DOHERTY Alright, you bastard! Let's see who you really are! 
Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal SUZANNE. 
Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed. 
SHANNEN DOHERTY Fucking Miramax-- (getting up) CUT! 
Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask. 
WES CRAVEN Shannen, usually I say "cut." 
SHANNEN DOHERTY A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't even trying anymore, are you? 
WES CRAVEN The market research suggest that people love monkeys. 
Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne. 
JAY WE LOVE THIS MONKEY! 
They rush out. West shrugs to Shannen. 
WES CRAVEN See? 
Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair. 
EXT. LOT--DAY 
Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne. On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting. The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until-- 
At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the other Security Guards gaining. 
JAY What the fuck are we gonna do? 
Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front. 
Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse. Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart. 
JAY PUNCH IT!!! 
Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the vehicle, taking flight, 
Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as-- 
Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a soundstage) a la E.T. 
Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then they look ahead and let out a scream. 
The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage Building. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY 
The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see. 
JAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent Bob, looking down as them. 
JAMES Holy shit--that looked like it hurt. 
JASON Are you guys alright? (off Suzanne) Hey! They've got a monkey! 
Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other. 
JAY Yo, I think that shit just kicked in. 
JAMES Let's get you guys on your feet. 
James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All stare at one another, perplexed, 
Then-- 
JAY (to door; deepening voice) Uh--yeah. They're in here. 
SECURITY GUARD Do they have you hostage? Should we call your publicists? 
JAY NO! I mean, we kicked those guys' asses bad. They're--knocked out. 
EXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME 
The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James. 
SECURITY GUARD Great work, sirs! If you let us in, we'll take over-- 
JAY (O.S.) (through door) NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in here! Together! 
The Security guard look at one another. 
SECURITY GUARD Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the door, sirs. 
The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job face to the rest. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY 
Bob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods, and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet. 
JAY What the fuck are we gonna do?! How are we gonna get out of here without them seeing us? 
Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet, smiling. 
EXT. LOT--DAY 
The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and Silent Bob. 
JAMES YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS! 
JASON HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M THE PIE-FUCKER. 
SECURITY GUARD (to Cops) He'll be the pie--in prison. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY 
Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits). 
JAY This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In these outfits we're totally incognito. 
Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders. 
A.D. Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? Great--you've changed costumes already. Let's get you to set. (pulling them off) The director doesn't like to be kept waiting. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET 
It looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side, near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs the hustling, white crew. 
DIRECTOR Look at all these crackers, Seventy million dollars and I can't even get a black grip? 
A white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director. 
P.A. Here's your coffee, sir. 
DIRECTOR (eyes the coffee) You spit in this?  Because I know all you white folks are pissed off that the studio'd entrust a multi- million dollar to a brother. 
P.A. I didn't spit in it, sir. 
DIRECTOR Then taste it! Go on! 
The P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it back to the Director. 
P.A. It's all good, sir. 
DIRECTOR No it ain't all good. Oh, you think I want it now, after your lips touched the cup? Get the fuck off my set! 
P.A. You the man, sir. 
DIRECTOR No you the Man! And that's the problem! 
The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches. 
BANKY Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and Chronic. We met a few weeks back. I'm the executive producer. 
DIRECTOR/CHAKA Oh--you're the executive producer, hunh? Well go "produce" me a latte no white folks spit in--okay Fucky? 
A.D. Or House Party Three? 
CHAKA Shut the fuck up! 
Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock- Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill-shot, when we hear-- 
JAY (O.S.) YO-BITCH-FISTS! 
Cock-Knocker turns to see-- 
Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One). 
JAY Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg. 
Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong Saber. 
CHAKA (from behind the monitor) I think George Lucas is going to sue somebody-- 
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY 
Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside the flashing red light. 
WILLENHOLLY (looking around) So, this is Hollywood? (suddenly full of purpose) Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent Bob. 
Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY 
The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two shots, O.C. 
WILLENHOLLY FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!! 
Willenholly goes wide-eyed. 
It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses. 
WILLENHOLLY Oh my God-- (to kids) Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm on the wrong, uh--wrong set. 
The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the O.C. Willenholly. 
KID You killed Mooby-- (to Kids) LET'S GET HIM!!! 
The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as he's attacked. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME 
Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle. 
COCK-KNOCKER (breaking character) You are not upstaging me, Van Der Beek! 
Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other hand. 
COCK-KNOCKER (to O.C. Chaka) CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A "CUT"! 
On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire). 
Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, Jay grins at Cock-Knocker. 
JAY Now whose balls have been busted, bitch? 
Suddenly, a gun shot rings out. 
All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun first on Jay, then Bob. 
WILLENHOLLY The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and Silent Bob! (revealing badge: calling out) Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal Wildlife Marshal. These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey. 
VOICE (O.S.) They didn't really steal that monkey. 
All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows. Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops. 
JUSTICE It was just a diversion so we could steal these. 
Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing them. 
JUSTICE And they're not the leaders of C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real. 
WILLENHOLLY No--the clit's real. The female orgasm is a myth. 
JUSTICE (to Jay) Are you guys alright? 
Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head. 
BANKY Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I just wanted to say hi. I'm-- 
JAY Banky fucking Edwards! Just the motherfucker we came to see! 
BANKY (shocked) Holy shit! What the fuck are you guys doing here?! 
Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the floor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue. 
BANKY Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?! 
JAY All these assholes are calling us names on the Internet, 'cause of this stupid movie! 
BANKY I feel for you boys--I really do. Those Net snipers can be really cruel. But Miramax paid me a shitload of money for Bluntman and Chronic, so it occurs to me that people bad- mouthing you on some web-site is none of my FUCKING CONCERN! 
SILENT BOB Oh--but I think it is. 
Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes. 
JAY Here we go again-- 
SILENT BOB Shut the fuck up. (to Banky) We had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights. And as we're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property, Bluntman and Chronic, when we said property was optioned by Miramax Films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium. As you failed to do that, you're in breach of the original contract--ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable position. 
Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a beat, Jay adds-- 
JAY Yeah. 
Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming. 
BANKY So, what do you guys want, to go away and take your lady friends with you? 
JAY Shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the Internet anymore. 
BANKY Even if there's no movie, people are still free to talk shit about you on the Internet. That's what the Internet's for: slandering others anonymously.  Stopping the flick isn't going to stop that! 
In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the air. 
JAY Well this isn't fair!  We went to Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts! We ain't leaving empty-handed! 
On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap. 
JAY What's up baby? You look good! 
BANKY Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy? 
JAY Oh yeah. (pushing Sissy off him) Get the fuck offa me, pig! 
Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair. 
Jay, Bob, and Banky continue. 
BANKY You guys are gonna ruin my movie career. 
JAY Well, we want something for our mental anguish. 
BANKY Tell you what: we'll settle this monetarily. I'll give you half of what I made. 
JAY Half?!? 
BANKY Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll give you two-thirds of what I made! 
JAY Fuck-you--you already said half? You can't take it back! 
Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand. 
BANKY Done 
Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing each other. 
SISSY Your shit is so tired, Justice! 
JUSTICE Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!

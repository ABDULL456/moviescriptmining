GALVIN ...now who is that...? 
MICKEY ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them... 
GALVIN Sally Doneghy, now who is that? 
MICKEY One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way... 
GALVIN ...hey, I don't need your charity... 
MICKEY ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file. 
Galvin pours himself a drink. 
GALVIN Hey, what are you, my nanny? 
Mickey walks to him, knocks the drink out of his hand and slaps him several times in the face. 
MICKEY Listen to me. Listen to me... listen to me, Frank, 'cause I'm done fuckin' with you. I can't do it any more. Look around you: You think that you're going to change? What's going to change it? You think it's going to be different next month? It's going to be the same. And I have to stop. This is it. I got you a good case, it's a moneymaker. You do it right and it will take care of you. But I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this is the end. (beat) Life is too short, and I'm too old. (beat) 
Mickey walks out of the office. Slams the door. Beat. 
Galvin looks around the office. Goes to his sofa. Sits, reaches to side table. 
ANGLE - INSERT 
The side table, a pack of Luckies. Galvin taking one, his hand shaking a little. Also on side table a pile of change containing a small rosary and a wedding ring. 
INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - INSERT - DAY 
The carriage of a typewriter. A sheet of paper. Its letterhead reads "Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law, 124 State Street, Boston, Mass. 02981. Cable FRAGAL." Someone is typing, "Sorry I had to go out. Back at 10. Judge Geary called. Are you available for lunch Wednesday University Club?" A hand takes a paper from carriage and puts it on desk. Takes a pen and signs, "Claire." 
ANGLE 
Galvin in the anteroom, dressed in his suit, unshaved, having just signed the paper. He takes a piece of Scotch tape from the dispenser on the desk, picks up a file folder from the coffee table. It is torn in several places and rudely Scotch- taped. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. - INSERT 
The file headed Deborah Ann Kaye v. St. Catherine Laboure Hospital et. al. 
ANGLE 
Galvin surveys the anteroom, opens door to corridor, Scotch tapes the note he has just typewritten to the outside of the door. 
INT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - DAY 
Dark paneling, clean, simple. A drinkers' bar. OLD BARTENDER and THREE CUSTOMERS spaced widely, Galvin in his overcoat downing a shot, the file open before him. He is reading. 
He checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm, throws a dollar on the bar, and heads for the door. 
INT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME CORRIDOR - DAY 
Galvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown nursing home. He receives suspicious looks from the Attendants. He is checking numbers on the doors against a notation in the file. He finds the correct door and enters. 
INT. NURSING HOME WARD - DAY 
The door to the ward from the inside. Galvin opening the door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each bed. Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
The chart held by Galvin. DEBORAH ANN KAYE, various medical notations. He lowers the chart and we SEE in the bed beyond it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes. 
ANGLE 
Galvin replaces the chart, puts his file, briefcase, etc. on the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in the bed. Takes another one. Puts down camera, sits on the end of the bed gazing at the unseen form. He lights a cigarette, and sits looking at her. 
INT. CORRIDOR - GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
SALLY DONEGHY. A mousy woman in her forties is standing by a door on which is written, "Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law." 
GALVIN I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in? 
SALLY It's locked. 
GALVIN (astonished) It's locked? 
Sally Doneghy points to the note on the door. Galvin takes it from the door. Reads. "Back at 10, Judge Geary. Lunch..." 
GALVIN I'm terribly sorry... I hope we didn't put you out. Won't you come in...? (motions Sally into inner office, gestures with note) I'd offer you some coffee, but it looks like my girl just went out. 
French windows, a fire in the grate, a view of Boston Common, JOSEPH ALITO, a slender, elegant man in his forties dressed in a very expensive suit, reading from his notes, news clippings, etc., which are held in a leather folder. 
ALITO 'Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce nineteen sixty as a full partner. Resigned the firm nineteen sixt-ynine over the Lillibridge case...' Do you...? 
Alito, strolling as he reads, moves toward the windows with his file TO REVEAL BISHOP BROPHY, a self-contained man in his early sixties, sitting on a leather couch, listening. 
BISHOP He was accused of jury tampering. 
ALITO Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks. 
BISHOP Four cases in three years... 
ALITO The man's an ambulance chaser... 
BISHOP ...tell me about this case. 
ALITO This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court. 
BISHOP No -- we don't want this case in court. 
ALITO Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff. 
BISHOP I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed. 
ALITO No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not. 
BISHOP So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me. 
ALITO All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial. 
The Bishop nods, meaning, "You are dismissed." As an afterthought: 
BISHOP If we were to go to trial, would we win the case? 
ALITO Well, of course, it's always dangerous... 
BISHOP I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win? 
ALITO (in an "of course" tone) Yes. 
Alito, preparing to leave, reaches to the Bishop's desk, where he has laid his leather folder. 
ANGLE 
The clipping in the folder, confused Galvin being led into jail, "Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case." Alito's hand snaps the folder shut. 
INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY 
A man's arms full of textbooks. Prominently displayed:

INT. OFFICE 
Galvin entering. CLAIRE PAVONE, a woman in her fifties, at the secretary's desk, hanging up the phone. 
CLAIRE (to phone) Thank you very much. 
Galvin looks up at her in surprise. 
GALVIN What are you doing here? 
CLAIRE Mickey told me to come back to work. 
Galvin nods, proceeds into his office, reading from the textbook. Claire follows him into the office. 
CLAIRE ...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy... 
GALVIN ...yes. Get her on the phone... 
CLAIRE ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office... 
GALVIN (putting down books) Gruber... 
CLAIRE Mickey told him to call. (reading from notes) 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.' 
The young Lawyer stands as Concannon sits, listening. 
YOUNG LAWYER Please turn to your Page Four. 
All the lawyers in the office turn in their files to that page. 
YOUNG LAWYER We're going to start with a review of the depositions of the Operating Room Team: the nurse-anesthetist, the scrub-nurse, the... 
INT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Galvin and Mickey at a library table piled with books. A dingy, dusty law library. They are smoking, speak in undertones, referring to the yellow legal pads in front of them. Rehashing material. 
MICKEY Who have we got? 
GALVIN We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. 
MICKEY You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. 
GALVIN Admittance form is wrong. 
MICKEY Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. 
GALVIN I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... 
MICKEY (conceding) ...Gruber's not bad. 
GALVIN Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, (hunts for book on desk, holds it up; reads) 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' (rummages through a pile of papers on the desk) ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...' (checking a list) They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? 
MICKEY (checking list) No. 
GALVIN (reading from pad) 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up. 
MICKEY Right. 
GALVIN Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan. 
MICKEY Right. 
GALVIN Brindisi versus Electric Boat. 
MICKEY You got a good memory, Franky. 
GALVIN I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport... 
INT. O'ROURKE'S PUB - NIGHT 
Galvin and Mickey entering the bar, walk over to the bar. 
Galvin sees something O.S. Call to the bartender. 
GALVIN Jimmy? Bushmills. (turns to Mickey, whispers) Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. 
MICKEY Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight? 
GALVIN I'm going to get laid. 
Galvin motions with his head down at the end of the bar. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
The Woman from last night, sitting in her same place at the end of the bar. Mickey looks at her. Shrugs. Gets up off stool. 
MICKEY Don't leave your best work in the sheets. 
He salutes, walks off. 
Galvin takes his drink and moves down to her. 
GALVIN D'you find an apartment? 
LAURA Still looking. 
GALVIN I changed my life today. What did you do? 
LAURA I changed my room at the Hotel. 
GALVIN Why?

INT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS-DAY 
JUDGE SWEENEY, a florid man in his sixties, sitting in shirtsleeves eating bacon and eggs off of a hotel service on a tray, talking conspiratorially with Ed Concannon, who is drinking coffee, seated across the desk. They are obviously old friends. The sound of a door opening. They turn their heads to the door. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
Galvin standing in the door. 
JUDGE (V.O.) You're late, Mr. Galvin. 
He enters the room. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he sits next to Concannon. 
GALVIN Yessir. I'm sorry. 
JUDGE Why is that? 
GALVIN I was held up. 
Concannon smiles and extends his hand. 
CONCANNON Ed Concannon. 
GALVIN (shaking his head) Frank Galvin. We've met before. 
As the Judge starts to speak Galvin cannot help looking at Concannon out of the corner of his eye. 
JUDGE Let's do some business. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. GALVIN 
Concannon, brisk, expensive-looking, tanned, huge gold watch, custom-made suit. 
JUDGE (V.O.) They tell me that no bargain ever was completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a deal. 
Concannon feels Galvin's eye on him, half-turns, smiles. 
ANGLE - THE JUDGE, CONCANNON, GALVIN 
JUDGE Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. 
GALVIN This is a complicated case, your Honor... 
JUDGE I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? (smiles at Galvin) See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? 
GALVIN My client can't walk, your Honor. 
JUDGE I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you. 
CONCANNON Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. 
JUDGE Huh! 
CONCANNON My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. (beat) When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. (turns to Galvin) As long as you understand that. (beat) It's got to be that way. 
GALVIN We are going to try the case. 
A beat. Galvin fumbles for a cigarette. The three sit in silence. 
JUDGE (incredulous) That's it...? (beat) Come on, guys... life is too short... (beat) You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. (beat; turns to Galvin) Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. 
GALVIN ...things change. 
JUDGE ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... 
GALVIN I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... 
JUDGE And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. (beat) I myself would take it and run like a thief. 
GALVIN I'm sure you would. 
The Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and insulted him. He controls himself. 
JUDGE Hm. (beat; checking book) We have the date set? Next Thursday. Good. (smiles) See you boys in court. 
JOHN That's thirty-three bucks. Can you believe that...? 
MICKEY Oh, yeah. Your broad from last night. 
Galvin pays the Cigar Stand Operator. 
JOHN Thanks, Franky. 
GALVIN Tell her that I'll meet her there, okay? See you tomorrow in the office. 
Mickey shrugs. 
GALVIN We're doing fine. 
ANGLE 
The two of them crossing the lobby. 
Dick Doneghy, looking around the lobby, spies them, starts across, and accosts Galvin. 
DONEGHY You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? (pushes Galvin into a wall; advances; pushes him again) Who do you think you are...? 
GALVIN Hold on a second. 
DONEGHY I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did? 
He pushes Galvin again. Galvin waves Mickey off. 
GALVIN It's all right, Mickey. 
DONEGHY You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours... (pushes Galvin again) You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years. (beat) Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister. 
GALVIN I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... 
DONEGHY What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred... 
GALVIN I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars. 
DONEGHY You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives. 
He nods sadly to himself. Beat. 
GALVIN If I could accept the offer right now, I would. (beat) They took it back. 
DONEGHY I understand. (starts to walk away from Galvin; stops) I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred. 
INT. O'ROURKE'S PUB - NIGHT 
Laura is sitting in the same place at the bar. Mickey comes up to her.

LAURA How'm I doing so far?

JUDGE (O.S.) Yes? 
Galvin opens the door and goes into the Judge's darkened study. The Judge is watching a basketball game on TV, drinking a beer. CAMERA FOLLOWS Galvin into the room. 
JUDGE What is it? 
GALVIN Thank you for seeing me. 
JUDGE That's perfectly all right. 
Judge turns down the volume of the game, but keeps watching it. 
GALVIN I need an extension for my case. 
JUDGE You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared. 
GALVIN I had a witness disappear on me. 
JUDGE That happens. 
GALVIN I could subpoena him if I had a week. 
JUDGE I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you. 
Judge leans forward, turns up the volume on the game.

In the sense that I feel that we'd like to accept it. (beat) Well, it's rather a shock to me, too; but it's my client's wishes... She's changed her mind as of this evening...

ANGLE 
The conference room. WIDE. Concannon's young lawyers taking notes as Concannon rehearses Dr. Towler, a Sony VTR being operated by one of them.

DR. TOWLER I was her doctor. 
CONCANNON You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy... 
DR. TOWLER ...I was one of a group of...

DR. TOWLER Yes.

DR. THOMPSON ...What difference would...

MARY ROONEY I told the guy I didn't want to talk to... 
GALVIN I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is? 
MARY ROONEY No. 
GALVIN He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what? 
MARY ROONEY ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me? 
GALVIN I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big... 
MARY ROONEY I've got nothing to say to you. 
GALVIN You know what happened. 
DR. THOMPSON I am on the staff of... 
MICKEY Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say... 
DR. THOMPSON ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I... 
Mickey drops his belligerent attitude. Turns to someone behind him. 
ANGLE 
The two men, Galvin standing behind Mickey, smoking. He nods. 
MICKEY (to Dr. Thompson, casually) She getting good care over there? 
DR. THOMPSON Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I... 
MICKEY (grilling him again) Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means? 
DR. THOMPSON 'Code Blue'... 
MICKEY It's a common medical term. 
Mickey half-turns to Galvin, shrugs minutely, meaning, "We're in trouble."

LAURA Isn't there something you... 
GALVIN That's not the question. It's over. (beat) Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win. 
LAURA You're talking like a drunk. 
GALVIN That's what I am. 
Beat. 
LAURA And it's over...? 
GALVIN Yes. 
LAURA Well, then what are you doing here? 
GALVIN I... do you want me to leave? 
LAURA You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself? 
GALVIN I... 
LAURA You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? (beat) I thought it's not over till the jury comes in. 
GALVIN Who told you that? 
LAURA You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place. 
GALVIN And what makes you so tough? 
LAURA Maybe I'll tell you later. 
GALVIN Is there going to be a later...? 
LAURA Not if you don't grow up... 
GALVIN If I don't 'grow up...' 
ANGLE - CLOSEUP 
GALVIN at Plaintiff's table, looking down at notes. 
JUDGE Is the Plaintiff ready? 
GALVIN (looking up) Ready, your Honor. 
JUDGE Defense...? 
CONCANNON Ready for the Defense, your Honor. 
ANGLE 
The Courtroom. P.O.V. JUDGE. 
JUDGE Let's begin. 
Galvin gets to his feet. Walks over to the JURY. Looks at them, appraising. He pauses as before a great effort. Takes a breath. Exhales. 
GALVIN It's a terrible thing to sit in judgment. So much rides on it. I know that you've thought, 'How can I be pure. How can I be impartial without being cold. How can I be merciful and still be just?' And I know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this morning to be helped. To judge correctly. We have the reputation of two men. Two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us. And with those two respected men we have my client, Deborah Ann Kaye... (beat) ...who was deprived of sight, of locomotion, hearing, speech, of everything, in short, which constitutes her life. (beat) We are going to prove she was deprived through negligence. (beat) Through the negligence of those respected men. We will show: One... 
INT. ARCHBISHOP'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR-DAY 
A lavishly appointed corridor. Alito and BILLY, the YOUNG LAWYER from Concannon's office, walking slowly down the corridor. 
ALITO Why did he go to see Mary Rooney? 
YOUNG LAWYER She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors. 
ALITO What did he find? 
YOUNG LAWYER Nothing. 
ALITO How good's your intelligence? 
YOUNG LAWYER Very good. 
ALITO And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson? 
YOUNG LAWYER As far as we know, nothing. 
Alito nods, they stop outside a large double door. 
ALITO Thank Mr. Concannon for me. Please tell him I'll see him at his office. 
Alito knocks on the door. The door is opened by a YOUNG PRIEST. 
Alito nods to the Young Lawyer, enters the Bishop's study. 
The door is closed behind him. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
The jury box. One JUROR leans over and makes a whispered comment to another. The SECOND JUROR nods, inclines his head toward the witness box. 
ANGLE 
DR. Thompson on the stand. Composed, waiting. Concannon consulting his notes. 
CONCANNON Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct? 
DR. THOMPSON That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion. 
CONCANNON Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today? 
DR. THOMPSON Just as you are, Sir... 
CONCANNON Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor? 
DR. THOMPSON No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State... 
CONCANNON ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine? 
DR. THOMPSON No. 
CONCANNON Neurology? 
DR. THOMPSON No. 
JUDGE Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question? 
DR. THOMPSON I... given the limits of your question, that's correct. 
JUDGE The Doctors were not negligent. 
DR. THOMPSON (beat) I... um... 
The Judge shrugs, meaning, "Well then what in the hell are we doing here?" 
ANGLE 
Galvin, furious. 
ANGLE 
The Judge and Witness. 
JUDGE Thank you. 
The Witness starts to step down. Galvin strides over to him and speaks to the Judge. 
GALVIN I'm not through with the witness, your Honor. With all due respect if you are going to try my case for me I would appreciate it if you wouldn't lose it. 
The Judge stands, furious. 
JUDGE Thank you. I think that's enough for this morning. I'll see the Plaintiff's Counsel in my chambers. Now, please. 
The Courtroom rises. The Bailiff is heard, "All rise, court is adjourned until one o'clock." 
INT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS - DAY 
Galvin, furious, standing against the wall. The Judge comes in from his own entrance, shucking his robe. Equally angry. 
JUDGE I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today. 
GALVIN I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me. 
JUDGE Listen to me, fella... 
GALVIN No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair. 
Galvin is pacing. Beat. 
JUDGE (conciliatory) Galvin, look, many years ago... 
GALVIN And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are. 
JUDGE (beat; barely controlling anger) Are you done? 
GALVIN Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. 
JUDGE You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail. 
INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS CORRIDOR-DAY 
Galvin walking down the corridor, having just come from the Judge's Chambers. Sally Doneghy comes up to him. 
SALLY What does it mean? (beat) I... I mean we, you have other tactics... 
GALVIN We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to... 
SALLY Are we going to win? (beat, desperately needing to trust) We have, you know, other tactics, though... 
GALVIN Yes. 
She nods. Beat. Walks off. Galvin turns to the open door to the Courtroom, through which the SPECTATORS are reentering for the afternoon session. Mickey is standing by the door, he catches Galvin's eye. They look at each other a moment.

GALVIN Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness? 
MICKEY (reciting a catechism; dispiritedly) You use their witness. 
GALVIN That's right. 
MICKEY I think we tried that. The case is over. 
Galvin continues pacing. He will not hear what was just said. 
MICKEY And how the fuck... You broke the first law that they taught you in law school. You never ask a question you don't know the answer to. (beat) Frankie, wake up. You got your own expert witness says there was no negligence. It's over. Period. There'll be no other cases... 
Galvin turns on him, animal-like. 
GALVIN There are no other cases. This is the case. (beat) Now you decide... (beat) Are you in or out...? 
INT. CONCANNON'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Soft, dim lights. Concannon sitting on a couch. He holds a red-backed file document. His listener is unseen. 
CONCANNON I know how you feel. I know you don't believe me, but I do. I'm going to tell you something I learned when I was your age. I had prepared a case. Mr. White asked me, 'How did you do.' (beat) I said, 'I've done my best.' He said, 'They don't pay you to do your best. They pay you to win.' (beat) That's what pays for this office. (beat) And that's what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor. And for the kind of law that you want to practice. And that's what pays for your clothes and my whiskey, and the leisure that we have to sit back and discuss philosophy. (beat) As we're doing tonight. (beat) We're paid to win the case. 
ANGLE - CONCANNON AND LAURA

ANGLE - INSERT 
GALVIN I just saw her. 
ROONEY In New York? 
GALVIN What? 
ROONEY You saw Kat in New York... (beat) ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?

GALVIN What are you doing in New York...?

She sighs, starts to speak. Stops. Beat. They look at each other -- he starts to speak, cannot. He knocks her to the floor, she upsets the table.

KATHY Yes. 
Galvin holds up a form. 
GALVIN You signed this form? 
She looks closely at it. Is satisfied. 
KATHY Yes. 
GALVIN These are your initials, 'K.C.'? 
KATHY Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name. 
A beat. 
GALVIN D'you ask the patient when did she last eat? 
KATHY Yes. 
GALVIN What did she say? 
KATHY She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital. 
GALVIN One hour. 
KATHY Yes. 
GALVIN And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour? 
KATHY I did. 
GALVIN A single hour. 
KATHY Yes. 
Galvin walks away from the witness box. He looks at the jury. He turns to look at the spectators. His thoughts are a million miles away. Unconsciously he straightens his tie. 
ANGLE 
Galvin in front of the dead-still courtroom. He breaks his reverie. 
GALVIN (to Concannon) Your witness. 
Concannon is on his feet as Galvin walks back to his table. 
Concannon walks over to Kathy and begins forcefully: 
CONCANNON You are aware of the penalties for perjury...? 
KATHY It's a crime. 
CONCANNON Yes. (beat) It is a crime. A serious crime. 
KATHY I wouldn't do it. 
CONCANNON You would not...? 
KATHY No. 
CONCANNON In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right? 
KATHY Yes. 
CONCANNON Just now... 
Kathy getting down from the stand. The Judge addressing Galvin. 
GALVIN Nothing further, your Honor... 
JUDGE Mr. Concannon...? 
Concannon is signalled by Billy, the young lawyer at the Defense table, who is gathering notes from his colleagues, who have been researching during Kathy's speech. 
Concannon walks over to the table and is quickly "talked through" the notes by Billy. 
JUDGE Mr. Concannon. 
Concannon cuts Billy short, meaning, "Yes, I understand, I'm far ahead of you," he takes the notes and returns to the bench. 
CONCANNON Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form. 
JUDGE ...one moment, Mr. Concannon... 
The Judge nods, meaning, "I am considering..." 
ANGLE 
The Judge. He is making some notations on a page in front of him. He nods to himself, he has reached a decision. He looks up. 
JUDGE The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form. (explains to them) It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original... 
CONCANNON Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here. 
JUDGE I'm going to uphold that. 
ANGLE 
Galvin getting to his feet. 
GALVIN I object, your Honor... 
JUDGE Overruled... 
GALVIN Exception! 
JUDGE Noted. Thank you. (to Jury) Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed... 
ANGLE 
Galvin, silent, fuming, sitting at the table. 
JUDGE (V.O.) Her entire testimony must be stricken from the record. You shouldn't have heard it, but you did. Now, that was my mistake... and you must strike it from your minds, give it no weight. 
Galvin takes a sheet of legal paper and starts writing on it. 
INT. BISHOP BROPHY'S SUITE - DAY 
ALITO Legally it's over. Concannon was brilliant.

INT. COURTROOM - JUDGE HOYLE'S P.O.V. - FULL COURTROOM - DAY 
All looking slightly to their right. 
ANGLE 
JUDGE SWEENEY Mr. Galvin...? 
ANGLE - GALVIN 
In front of the full jury box. Beat. 
GALVIN You know, so much of the time we're lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us what is right. Tell us what's true. There is no justice. The rich win, the poor are powerless...' We become tired of hearing people lie. After a time we become dead. A little dead. We start thinking of ourselves as victims. (pause) And we become victims. (pause) And we become weak... and doubt ourselves, and doubt our institutions... and doubt our beliefs... we say for example, 'The law is a sham... there is no law... I was a fool for having believed there was.' (beat) But today you are the law. You are the law... And not some book and not the lawyers, or the marble statues and the trappings of the court... all that they are is symbols. (beat) Of our desire to be just... (beat) All that they are, in effect, is a prayer... (beat) ...a fervent, and a frightened prayer. 
GALVIN In my religion we say, 'Act as if you had faith, and faith will be given to you.' (beat) If... If we would have faith in justice, we must only believe in ourselves. (beat) And act with justice. (beat) And I believe that there is justice in our hearts. (beat) Thank you. 
He stands still a moment, then surveys the still courtroom.

15 Minutes 
FADE IN 
on the words CZECH AIRLINE.  We are panning across the words on the side of the plane. 
INT. AIRPLANE 
ANGLE DOWN 
on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH. 
EMIL (V.O.) Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth. 
OLEG (V.O.) Okay. 
INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY 
CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.  Tall, scraggly beard. Piercing blue eyes.  He's dressed in an outdated suit.  His eyes are alert, cunning and smart. 
OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not tall - but wide.  A wrestler's body.  Emil looks at Oleg. (The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.) 
EMIL Don't fool around. 
OLEG Okay. 
Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to take a picture of himself. 
EMIL Did you hear what I said? 
OLEG I want to document my trip to America. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER Next. (Emil steps up) Could I see your documents, please? 
EMIL Yes sir. 
He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? 
EMIL Two weeks holiday. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER How much money are you carrying with you? 
EMIL I have five-hundred dollars. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area! 
Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D) (to Emil) Is he with you?  Are you travelling together? 
EMIL Yes. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER Please join us. (to Oleg) Come on forward. 
EMIL Is there a problem? 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents? (takes Oleg's passport) Are you related? 
OLEG Yes...he's my friend. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another? 
Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off. 
EMIL We are both from Prague. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER (to Oleg) How long are you planning to stay? 
EMIL Two weeks. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER I'd like to speak for himself, okay? 
EMIL He doesn't speak English. 
OLEG I speak English. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER (to Oleg) Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here? 
LEON (CONT'D) Yeah? 
HAWKINS Paulie, you've got kids, right? 
PAULIE My kids don't talk to me anymore but they were great when they were young. 
LEON (into the phone) Sure it's him?  Great! (collapses the phone) Unique's home. 
They all rise from the table. 
EDDIE Paulie, I need the cure. 
PAULIE Step into my office. 
Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave. 
HAWKINS So you got your kids listening to Opera? You still singing in the church on the weekends? 
INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY 
Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg. 
SECONDARY OFFICER Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that. (to Emil) And what kind of work do you do? 
EMIL I am butcher. 
SECONDARY OFFICER You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for? 
EMIL You stuff sausage in it. 
SECONDARY OFFICER And what do you do with the bones? 
EMIL Dog food. 
Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport Control for their detainment. 
SECONDARY OFFICER Are you married? 
EMIL No.  Are you proposing? 
ANGLE UP 
through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us... 
INT. MENS ROOM 
Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror. 
EDDIE Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? What are you doin' Saturday? 
Leon enters.  Eddie turns. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I'm gonna propose. 
LEON When? 
EDDIE Tomorrow.  At lunch. 
LEON You ready? 
Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns. 
EDDIE The thrill of the hunt.  I love it. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY 
Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop action.  Each stands with an old suitcase. 
OLEG (in Russian) Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies! 
EMIL (in Czech) Don't speak Russian! 
OLEG (in Russian) Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? 
EMIL (in Czech) Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out! 
Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A videocamera's pointed out in the street. 
OLEG Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision. 
EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY 
The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him. 
EMIL Turn that off!  Get the bags. 
OLEG Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog. 
EMIL For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. (challenging) Unless you refuse, Oleg. 
Oleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil, he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building. 
EMIL (CONT'D) There.  5RW. 
Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks and Emil pushes it open. 
INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY 
The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl. 
OLEG What? 
EMIL Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs. 
Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving down the dirty hallway to a corner door. 
INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS - a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg films him... 
MILOS Emil???! 
EMIL Surprise!  Surprise! 
Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his comely wife. 
INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Emil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace, bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The following is in Czech and subtitled in English.) 
EMIL Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding. 
MILOS Did you hurt her? 
EMIL You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money? 
OLEG Hello, Tamina. 
Oleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks at Oleg. 
MILOS Take your eyes off her, Oleg! (to Emil) Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught. (of Oleg) It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!! 
EMIL Milos.  Get my money! 
Oleg videotapes the scene. 
CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR 
All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped around her. 
MILOS (nervously) We spent it! 
EMIL Ha. Ha. 
MILOS Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?! 
Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her throat. 
MILOS (CONT'D) Emil.  Put down the knife. 
Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified. 
MILOS (CONT'D) Emil.  I'll help you. 
Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm him by talking softly. 
MILOS (CONT'D) I can get you a job. 
EMIL A job? 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER 
Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is now NAKED! 
MUGGER You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me all over, it was disgusting. 
Jordy unlocks the handcuffs. 
JORDY I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry. 
Korfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him. 
JORDY (CONT'D) You okay? 
MUGGER A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights! 
JORDY Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here. 
Jordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around himself cursing - hurrying away. 
EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT 
Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign. 
INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has been talking to a FATHER. 
ROSEANNE (ON T.V.) So you slept with your son's wife! What's that all about? 
FATHER (ON T.V.) I take full responsibility for sleepin' with my daughter in law.  I had low self esteem, I thought I had to compete with him. 
Emil reaches for his dictionary. 
EMIL (mutters) Self-esteem?  Self-esteem?? 
He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self esteem. 
FATHER (ON T.V.) Losin' my job and everything, caused my behavioral disorder. (turns to his son) Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you? 
The audience boos.  Roseanne mediates... 
Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen - rewinding Milos' murder.  We see it now for the first time - as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He's wearing Milos' Rolex. Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.  Emil looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera. 
EMIL (Czech) Turn that fucking thing off! 
OLEG (Czech) I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer. 
Emil grabs the videocamera. (Czech) Don't break it!  Don't break it! 
EMIL Speak English! 
OLEG (English) You said speak Czech! 
EMIL How you erase this? 
OLEG I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera! 
Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet. 
EMIL Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill him. (noticing) What's this? 
Emil found the last card in the wallet.  It's pink with a picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY ESCORTS - and a number. 
EMIL (CONT'D) Worldly escorts? 
Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages - finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the background. 
SEXY VOICE Hi? 
EMIL Hello? 
SEXY VOICE Are you looking for companionship? 
Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil. 
OLEG Whore? 
EMIL I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl? 
MAX That's it.  I'm suing. 
KORFIN Get in line. 
Korfin takes over - throwing him out.  Jordy turns to Garcia who is laughing. 
JORDY What's so funny.  How does he know so much about me?  Who tells him my life story? 
GARCIA He hangs around downstairs.  The guys talk to him.  He's a joke... 
JORDY He's no joke!  One day he's gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big. 
GARCIA Okay.  Okay.  We'll ban him from the station. 
INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT 
As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen, accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces America's highest rated 'news magazine' show. 
ROBERT HAWKINS Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim.  According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to believe...watch. 
EMIL (O.S.) Louder. 
VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting on the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us. 
EMIL (CONT'D) Louder. 
Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the volume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the background.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson. 
STEPHEN GELLER This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor. 
ROBERT HAWKINS Your doctor? 
STEPHEN GELLER Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication. 
ROBERT HAWKINS ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people? 
STEPHEN GELLER It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor. 
ROBERT HAWKINS You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. 
STEPHEN GELLER Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted. 
ROBERT HAWKINS Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist? 
STEPHEN GELLER Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move? 
ROBERT HAWKINS And isn't there a movie in the works about you? 
STEPHEN GELLER We're in negotiations, that's correct. 
ROBERT HAWKINS But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes? 
STEPHEN GELLER That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted. 
Emil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated. 
EMIL I love America.  No one is responsible for what they do. 
There's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over to it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.  Emil looks at us. 
EMIL (CONT'D) Get in the bathroom! 
OLEG (O.S.) Whatever we do - we fuck her, right? 
EMIL Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up! 
Emil turns off the TV.  Our POV backs into the bathroom, closing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks down at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife sticking out of Emil's BOOT.  Emil's hands pull his pants cuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door and opens it.  It's not Daphne and she's not world class. 
HONEY Hi, I'm Honey. 
EMIL Where's Czech girl? 
HONEY Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl. 
She enters.  Closes the door behind her. 
HONEY (CONT'D) Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser. 
EMIL I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her? 
JORDY It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want. 
EDDIE Watch the news? 
JORDY Nah, I musta missed it. 
EDDIE Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit. 
JORDY Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff. 
EDDIE Nah, why should you? 
JORDY I don't even watch TV. 
EDDIE Good.  Good.  Commendable. 
Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back. 
JORDY Did you get a report from the M.E.? 
EDDIE Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me? 
JORDY If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. (then) What about the report? 
EDDIE You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal. 
Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.  Hands it to Eddie. 
JORDY The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here. 
EDDIE Pretty. 
JORDY (acts as if he didn't notice) Hmmmm. 
EDDIE Maybe you don't care about that either. (beat) Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile. 
JORDY Who says she's a suspect? 
Jordy tries to take the sketch back.  Eddie holds on. 
EDDIE What would you call her? 
JORDY Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows? 
Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were. 
EDDIE Obviously they weren't having sex.  As you pointed out.  So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that? 
Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy. 
JORDY Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell. 
EDDIE Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary? 
JORDY Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally. 
Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it. 
EDDIE Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay. (to Jordy) We've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian... 
Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch. 
JORDY I'll come with you. 
EDDIE There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do. 
JORDY I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something. 
EDDIE This isn't homicide school. 
JORDY My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle. 
EDDIE You're Polish? 
JORDY My folks are. 
EDDIE Stay here. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY 
Gil looks confused.  Eddie points to the toilet.  Seat is up. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Do the seat for me. 
Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.  Eddie stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.  Holding the unlit cigar.  Looking around at the blood splattered walls. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Only one guys checked in? 
LEON Yeah. 
EDDIE C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful. 
Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Our killer...our killer's standing here slashing at her.  She's fightin' him. The blood is splattering this way.  It's on this wall... (pointing to the right of Jordy) And there's some specks over here. (to the left of Jordy) There's nothing here because someone was standing right here.  Someone big.  And he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood. He wouldn't walk out of here like that. (turning to Murphy) Murphy, what kind of knife you think we're talking about here? 
Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the blood-splattered wall. 
MURPHY If you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks aren't deep but they're kinda wide... not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife. 
EDDIE What if the tip was broken off? 
MURPHY Could be.  Then we should find it here somewhere. 
EDDIE I think we've already found it. 
Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young detective, returns. 
TOMMY There was only one call from this room last night.  I dialed it.  It's an escort service. 
LEON Did you identify yourself? 
TOMMY Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid. 
EDDIE Call communications and get an address on that number. 
Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service address on it. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Good work. 
INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY 
Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie. 
JORDY You goin' to the escort service? 
EDDIE You got any better ideas? 
JORDY Mind if I ride along with you? 
EDDIE This has nothing to do with your fire. 
JORDY But what if it does?  You might need my help. 
As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches. 
MAN Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for my son? 
EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY 
Jordy catches up.  Eddie finishes signing the autograph using the man's back. 
EDDIE I'll let you know what happens. 
JORDY This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over. 
EDDIE Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come. 
JORDY I'll call it... tails. 
Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy. 
EDDIE Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads. 
Jordy flips the coin and it's heads. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Heads.  See, you lost twice. (beat) Okay.  Get in. 
Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car.  Before Jordy can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.  Jordy stands on the sidewalk - dejected.  Eddie stops the car again and this time lets Jordy get in. 
EDDIE He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly! 
ROSE She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison. 
EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY 
As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING. 
INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY 
Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with astonishing dexterity.  This man can drive.  Eddie picks up his phone - dials.  Jordy is on his cell phone as well. 
EDDIE Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's. 
JORDY (overlapping) I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already. 
Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.  Eddie picks up a beer he was holding between his legs - finishes it. 
EDDIE You thirsty? 
JORDY I'm on duty. 
EDDIE (drinking) So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back. 
JORDY Of course. 
EDDIE Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about? 
JORDY I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. 
EDDIE Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first. 
Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right. 
INT. LUDWIG'S SALON - DAY 
We're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon - it's big and spacious.  The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST. 
OLEG (O.S.) Daphne Handlova? 
RECEPTIONIST Daphne?  In the back.  Probably shampooing a customer's hair. 
Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.  LUDWIG, the owner, is with her. 
LUDWIG Why are you messing with your hair color again?  You're going to kill your hair. You won't look good with black hair. 
DAPHNE I want to do it, alright? 
LUDWIG Well, then do it after work.  A customer's waiting. 
He leaves, a customer approaches.  She smiles at him - turns on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.  She backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door! 
TO THE BACKYARD 
There's a garden out there.  Daphne runs toward the alley. Oleg follows her - still videotaping.  As she rounds the corner she bumps into...Emil!  He pulls out his kitchen knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with the broken tip against her throat. 
EMIL I...I have a temper. 
She looks at him, not understanding.  Oleg films the scene. 
EMIL (CONT'D) When I lose it, I lose control.  I didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to prison, they beat me.  I still didn't tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos like a brother... 
The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic softness to it.  He wants to reconcile his behavior to her. 
EMIL (CONT'D) (in English) I'm not a killer. 
The back door opens.  He shoves the knife in his pocket as Ludwig peers around the alleyway.  What he sees is Emil leaning close to Daphne, kissing her. 
LUDWIG Daphne, will you be coming back to work? 
DAPHNE In a minute, Ludwig. 
Ludwig leaves. 
EMIL Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a whore.  But washing hair?  This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you. They should be washing your hair. 
Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it. 
EMIL (CONT'D) I don't want to kill you.  But if you talk, I will. (whispers) I thought you'd want these. 
Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant, maybe twenty feet away.  Tommy stands next to her.  This is where Eddie and Jordy are headed. 
NICOLETTE I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department? 
EDDIE I really can't give out any information right now at this point. 
NICOLETTE Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct? 
EDDIE He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine. 
NICOLETTE Do you have the suspect in custody? 
EDDIE Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. 
NICOLETTE (to cameraman) Alright, cut, cut, cut. 
Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his shoulder. 
NICOLETTE (CONT'D) (to Eddie) Eddie, are you okay? 
EDDIE Yeah.  Now's not a good time. 
NICOLETTE Alright. 
EDDIE Alright? 
NICOLETTE Alright. 
EDDIE Alright. 
NICOLETTE Okay. 
Eddie walks into the restaurant.  Throws a look back at her, then enters. 
INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY 
Jordy talks to Daphne. 
DAPHNE I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything. 
EDDIE C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people? 
DAPHNE Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs. 
EDDIE Go on. 
She says nothing. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you. 
DAPHNE If I tell you, will you arrest me? 
EDDIE Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you? 
She still hesitates. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid 
JORDY She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her. 
EDDIE Is that all there is? 
She looks at Eddie. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you. 
DAPHNE No, no, don't talk to Immigration! 
She clams up. 
JORDY Why not? 
EDDIE Something back home? 
Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.  Eddie sits across from her.  Jordy crouches down next to her. 
DAPHNE ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him. 
JORDY (optimistic) Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide. 
NICOLETTE Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing. 
EDDIE Yeah, yeah.  Good thing. 
NICOLETTE Okay. 
EDDIE See you later.  Good luck. 
NICOLETTE Thank you. 
EDDIE Don't be late. 
She walks out. 
INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY 
Jordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire station is empty. 
JORDY The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. 
DAPHNE So...the station is empty? 
JORDY Yeah.  This way. 
He gestures toward the stairs. 
INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes never leaving Jordy's. 
JORDY You considered becoming a prostitute? 
DAPHNE Yes, I considered it. 
JORDY Did you ever turn tricks before? 
DAPHNE No. 
JORDY What about back home? 
DAPHNE No. 
Daphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close. 
DAPHNE (CONT'D) I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's. 
JORDY So you were never a prostitute? 
DAPHNE What are you asking me? 
JORDY I'm just trying to find out who you are. 
She looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's hinting. 
DAPHNE Can you let me go? 
She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning and backs up slightly. 
JORDY Showers are this way. 
Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even closer. 
DAPHNE You could shower with me. 
Jordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks away.  Gestures towards the showers. Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are lined with shower stalls. 
JORDY I'll uh, I'll get you a towel. 
He leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the street. 
JORDY 
gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he notices the window.  It's open. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Shit! 
He rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns - looks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through the curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over - quickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain aside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Are you alright? 
EDDIE (O.S.) I told him to take her there. 
Jordy and Duffy turn.  Eddie walks out.  Eddie turns - Tommy - the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward Hotel - is coming out of the back office. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Tommy, get her outta here. 
Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct. 
TOMMY This way, ma'am. 
EDDIE There was too much press hangin' around there.  I didn't want her face on the news.  So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down. 
DUFFY Oh. 
EDDIE It was my decision, not his. 
DUFFY Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions. 
EDDIE Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours. 
DUFFY Oh yeah...?  Alright. 
EDDIE (to Jordy) I'm ready to be briefed. (to Duffy) Excuse us. 
DUFFY (to Eddie) Yeah, sure. (to Jordy) Beep me when you're ready for the press conference. 
JORDY Will do, Chief. 
Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk - toward the back and to his office. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Eddie, I... 
Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy. 
EDDIE Wait. 
INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM'S SQUAD - DAY 
A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. Eddie enters with Jordy. 
EDDIE Guys...give me a few minutes? 
They empty out. 
JORDY Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. 
EDDIE Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me. 
JORDY I took her there for a shower and that's it. 
EDDIE Just a shower? 
Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look. 
JORDY Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but... 
EDDIE No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead. 
JORDY I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent. 
EDDIE Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional. 
JORDY But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her. 
EDDIE How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it. 
Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat. 
JORDY Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that? 
EDDIE You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him. 
Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out.  He sticks it in his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds the match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look. 
INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Eddie walks in - carrying flowers.  He closes and locks the door behind him.  He grabs the phone.  Dials. 
EDDIE It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did they check the hospitals?  Airports? Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia... 
Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun. 
Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp. 
Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach. 
Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S STOMACH. 
Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be dying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a close up. 
Emil looks at Eddie. 
EMIL (CONT'D) Die.  Die. 
Emil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie off, suffocating him. 
BLACKNESS 
We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you feel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally, in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a tiny pixel on a TV screen. 
WIDENING 
further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and dignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in his NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with the videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio from Eddie's funeral. 
NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.) ..Detective Flemming was one of the most decorated NYPD detectives in the history of New York.  He made several thousand arrests during his career, including the famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by the community in which he served.  His partner eulogized him... 
Leon is at the mic. 
LEON (ON T.V.) ...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend and my partner...he taught me the meaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man in every sense of the word.  I'll miss him... (choking on tears) Sleep well, brother. 
Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace."  Oleg PANS from the TV and focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame - carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again, the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this. 
INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY 
It's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many who were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black ribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake - boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet has been laid out. 
Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon. 
HAWKINS Awful...what an awful day.  He was New York City. 
Hawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's Tommy.  Hawkins nods to him. 
TOMMY I never got to tell him how much I admired him. 
HAWKINS I know, son, I know.  We all loved him. 
Hawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves to her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at him.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. Definitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins. 
NICOLETTE You know...you know he was gonna propose to me.  The crime guys found a card he'd written out to me.  And a ring box...these fuckers that killed him - have my ring.  They have my diamond engagement ring... 
Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion. 
HAWKINS I know. 
NICOLETTE What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me? 
HAWKINS Well, he... 
NICOLETTE (overriding) I want to hear everything he said. 
HAWKINS I'm trying to tell you. 
NICOLETTE Alright.  Go ahead. 
HAWKINS That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. 
NICOLETTE Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!! 
Nicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear. 
NICOLETTE (CONT'D) I'd never had a great relationship before.  I'd never made great choices with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to know.  He was older, my parents told me I was nuts to get involved with him. But he was so great to me.  Always encouraging, telling me I could do anything... (beat) He was the one.  You know, I'd give up everything - everything - for just a little more time.  I would've spent fifteen minutes with him if that's all I knew I had. 
She's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him off - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow. 
MAGGIE Robert...? 
HAWKINS What are you doing here? 
MAGGIE (holding a cellular) You've got a call. 
He looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the front door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls Daphne out of the way. 
DAPHNE (CONT'D) (in Czech to the man) Hello.  How are you? 
INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of flowers are outside Daphne's apartment. 
JORDY What's this? 
She takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne reads: "Good luck with all your troubles.  I'm here if you need me...Ludwig." 
JORDY (CONT'D) Is he your boyfriend? 
DAPHNE Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous? 
JORDY If I was your boyfriend, I might be. 
DAPHNE If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away. 
They're staring in each other's eyes.  The sexual tension strong. 
JORDY A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one. 
DAPHNE No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you. 
JORDY I'm glad I met you. 
They hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss. Urgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. They part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the hall.  Jordy clears his throat. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Let's get your stuff. 
He opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to her.  Gestures that it's okay to enter. 
INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
It's very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. The apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking the same thought.  Another kiss. 
JORDY You better get packed. 
DAPHNE Right. 
She holds his look. 
JORDY Do you have coffee? 
DAPHNE In the kitchen. 
JORDY I'll make some for us. 
DAPHNE I'll get my clothes. 
She heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES - SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO THE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK. 
DAPHNE (CONT'D) Jordy!!! 
JORDY No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!! 
Jordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows the drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne SCREAMS! 
DAPHNE That's not mine! 
WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher because it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy CAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and JORDY'S HAND. 
He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. Closes the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it under the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He hurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before the extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a chair through the window. 
JORDY Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us! 
Too late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in the kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along the ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone: 
JORDY (CONT'D) This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075, make it quick, we're trapped!  8th Avenue and 44th Street. 
He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It's locked.  Jordy kicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that under the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. Shuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold water.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. She notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield. 
DAPHNE Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d! 
Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield. 
DAPHNE (CONT'D) They were here! 
Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in that moment why he's surrendering.  Jordy yanks Emil up - dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still favoring his ankle. 
CUTLER (to Emil) Don't say anything. 
EMIL Where are we going? 
CUTLER I'm coming with you. 
EMIL Yes.  Yes, come with me! 
CUTLER (to Jordy) I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him. 
The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything. Cutler stays close to Emil.  Making sure he's in the video footage. 
JORDY Turn that camera off! 
EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS 
As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door to his car.  Leon grabs Emil. 
LEON I'll take him. 
JORDY No way!  He's mine! 
LEON (holding on to Emil, squeezing his arm hard) We're takin' him.  Don't argue! 
JORDY He's my collar! 
LEON Well, he killed my partner! 
JORDY He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in. 
Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into custody. 
LEON Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I'll follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him! 
Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes. 
LEON (CONT'D) You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are goin' down.  I'll be there with a smile when they put you down! 
Cutler hurries to Emil's side. 
CUTLER Don't say a word.  Don't respond to his taunting! (to Leon) He's represented by counsel.  You want to speak to someone - you speak to me! 
TOMMY Out of the way, counselor. 
Tommy shoves Cutler aside. 
CUTLER Don't you put your hands on me, Detective. 
Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.  Leon turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything. 
LEON And you, you'll pay for what you did! 
HAWKINS (low) This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him. 
Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend. 
LEON You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself. 
HAWKINS If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend! 
LEON Don't give me that fucking shit. 
The cameras are rolling. 
MURPHY Don't get into it on TV. 
LEON (yells to other cop cars) Alright, let's get going! 
Leon and the other cops rush to their cars.  Jordy is already behind the wheel.  As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger seat, Jordy takes off.  The cameras film him driving away. INT. JORDY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Jordy takes a left turn, racing away.  Running all the lights. 
TOMMY What are you doin'?  You're gonna lose everybody! 
Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side Highway.  The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left lane - having lost the police. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) Where are you goin'??  This ain't the way to the station! 
A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking out at the waiter. 
HOOKER Come in. 
Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing the hooker back out of the room.  Jordy moves to the bedroom door.  Peers through the crack.  Oleg sits on the edge of the bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.  He's hooked up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his footage of the fire. 
OLEG Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless. No cuts. (excited) And look.  Look at that transition. That's filmmaking!!  Isn't it great?! 
Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised. 
JORDY Don't move! 
Oleg grabs the videocamera.  Has on hooker in a head lock and picks up the other one.  He rushes at Jordy - using one of the hookers for protection. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Drop the girl!  Drop her!! 
Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into the living room and over the back of the sofa.  Oleg rushes out into the 
HOTEL HALLWAY 
Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down the stairwell. 
EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT 
Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.  He runs through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!  Jordy chases him, gun in hand! 
Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic, cars braking to a stop.  One SLAMS into another. Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.  People gawk. Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his underwear.  Oleg runs, knocking people aside.  He's holding the camera in his hand.  It's on. 
JORDY STOP!  STOP THAT MAN! 
A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.  Knocking him down.  Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into: 
INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door. 
TICKET TAKER Hey, come back here! 
The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy counter.  Jordy rushes in the door. 
JORDY Where is he?  Where'd he go? 
TICKET TAKER Middle door. 
Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle door - and enters the theater through the far door. 
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.  It's a night scene, the theater is dark.  Jordy tries to see faces. He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle. 
DRUNK'S VOICE Kill him!  Kill the bastard! 
Jordy spins toward the voice - it's a DRUNK.  Others start YELLING for blood! 
AUDIENCE Shoot him!  SHOOT! 
A GUNSHOT!  Jordy ducks!  Another GUNSHOT!  Jordy realizes the shots are coming from the screen. 
OLEG Look!  Over here! 
Jordy turns.  Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to film Jordy's death with a videocamera. Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders and heads, bounding for the screen. 
JORDY Everybody down!  Stay DOWN! 
Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.  Some in the audience don't realize the real thing is happening.  Oleg leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. Jordy runs down the aisle.  Oleg FIRES at Jordy.  Jordy FIRES back.  People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a clear shot.  Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.  Jordy raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has disappeared. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Shit! 
SIRENS are heard from outside.  VOICES of cops are heard as they enter. 
CLOSE ON TV 
A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie theater. 
REPORTER (ON T.V.) ...and the wild chase through Times Square ended with the suspect, Oleg Razgul, escaping.  The fire department has identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw. 
The channel is changed.  PETER ARNETT is reporting the same story. 
PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.) In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for handling sensational cases - claims his client is unfit to stand trial. 
EMIL Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out? 
Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes it. 
EMIL (CONT'D) That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me. 
CUTLER Your father put cigarettes out on you? 
EMIL Out on my back when I was a small boy. 
CUTLER Can I see your back? 
Emil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified. 
CUTLER (CONT'D) Oh, Jesus. 
EMIL I'm abused.  Don't you think? 
CUTLER I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture. 
INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a subpoena in his hand. 
DUFFY The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King! 
JORDY What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. 
DUFFY Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! 
JORDY Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. 
DUFFY Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. 
JORDY End my career? 
DUFFY How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield. 
JORDY But Chief?  Over this?? 
DUFFY There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial. 
Jordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun - looks at it. 
DUFFY (CONT'D) (pats Jordy's shoulder) I know you got backup at home.  Drop it off. 
Jordy sighs and exits. 
INT. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY 
Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEYS. 
STERN (to Jordy) Look, what don't you understand?  We've got a good relationship with the Czech's and the State Department doesn't want to cause an incident. 
JORDY But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness! 
STERN They've got her testimony on videotape. And even if they do take her to court immediately after she'll be extradited. The Czechs want her back.  She shot a cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic?  How would you feel if the Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?! 
Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers his voice. 
STERN (CONT'D) And just between us...I was married to a redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from both. 
Jordy gives him a look. 
STERN (CONT'D) You want to see her - go ahead. 
Jordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The assistant U.S. Attorneys leave. 
JORDY We're gonna fight the extradition. 
Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers. 
DAPHNE Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own. 
JORDY ...Do you really want me to forget about you? 
DAPHNE I don't want to drag you down with me. 
JORDY Daphne, I... 
THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP 
Cutler's car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from the van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the POLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at Cutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with: 
CUTLER ...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill! 
Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max, the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler continues: 
CUTLER (CONT'D) ...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future. 
They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch obsessively. 
HAWKINS Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?! 
Jordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. Smiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts. 
JORDY You think this is funny??  What the hell are you laughing at? 
Emil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the jacket. 
CUTLER (to a nearby escort) Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions. 
A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil. 
JORDY This is it?  This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing? 
CUTLER You may not like it marshal, but that's the law. 
JORDY And what about the other victims??  What about their families?  He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk? 
Jordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. Gets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly. 
EMIL Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm insane. 
Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to: 
A VIDEO POV 
as it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who he's been waiting for.  His face lights up. 
HAWKINS I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where is it?  Where is the tape? 
IT'S OLEG 
In disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera. 
OLEG It's all in here.  All in here. 
MEANWHILE JORDY 
has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly: 
HAWKINS Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some interesting evidence, something you should look at! 
Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he continues introducing his broadcast: 
HAWKINS (CONT'D) I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane! Hard to believe...watch! 
Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his videocamera up in the air. 
OLEG (ON VIDEO) He knew exactly what he was doing - all of this was planned!  It's all here in my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. Look! 
Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie: 
EMIL (ON VIDEO) ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... 
CUTLER (points to Oleg) Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him! 
The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of reporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the press corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy notices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He yells at Oleg! 
EMIL Traitor!! 
OLEG No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action! 
Oleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as: 
BANG! 
Oleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER escorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are screaming.  It's CHAOS.

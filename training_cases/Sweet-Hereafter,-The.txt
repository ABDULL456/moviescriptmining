FADE IN 
INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- DAY 
A young family together in bed.  It is a bright summer morning.  Father, mother, and a three year old girl are still asleep.  They are naked.  A light breeze drifts into the room.  The scene is serene and softly suspended. 
Head credits appear over this idyllic image.  The little girl turns in her sleep.  A dog barks outside. 
CUT TO 
INT./EXT.  CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
From the peaceful tableau of the sleeping family, the scene shifts to a vehicle entering a car wash.  The image is shot through the windshield, from the driver's point of view. 
The car enters the lathered world of spinning felt wheels and gushing water. 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
Inside the car MITCHELL STEPHENS, a man in his mid-fifties, listens to a stirring piece of music.  The sound of the car wash is filtered out by the strains of music. 
CUT TO 
EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT 
The phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large city.  A young woman, ZOE, enters the booth and lifts the receiver. 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
MITCHELL STEPHENS is going through the wash.  The automatic mops and buffers embrace his car with water and suds.  The cellular phone in the car rings.  MITCHELL picks it up. 
MITCHELL Yes?  Yes, I'll accept the charges. 
CUT TO 
INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT 
ZOE is on the phone.  There's a figure outside the booth waiting for her. 
ZOE Daddy, it's me...How are you doing? That's great...Where are you? What's that sound? 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
MITCHELL in his car, playing with the volume on his radio. 
MITCHELL I'm in a car wash. 
CUT TO 
Around the practising band, various carpenters and technicians are making final preparations for that evening's big event. 
One of the people watching the band is SAM BURNELL, a man in his early forties.  He watches his daughter, NICOLE, as she sings into the microphone.  NICOLE is sixteen. 
NICOLE stares at her father as she sings. 
ANGLE ON 
SAM looking back at his daughter.  He is intensely proud of her.  SAM is a carpenter, working on at the fair site.  He gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the grandstand. 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPORT. WASHROOM -- AFTERNOON 
CLOSE UP of a three year old girl, staring up into the lens. Her face is full of sweetness and trust. 
ANGLE ON 
MITCHELL STEPHENS in a crowded airport washroom, watching a young father, PETER, trying to change the diaper on his three year old daughter. 
MITCHELL stares at the little girl, his face registering a wistful smile.  PETER is having a hard time trying to find the towel from the toddler's bag and keeping an eye on her at the same time. 
MITCHELL Need a hand? 
PETER Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there... 
MITCHELL comes forward and searches through the toddler's bag. 
MITCHELL You always think you're prepared for these things. 
PETER Tell me about it. 
MITCHELL How old is she? 
PETER Almost three. 
MITCHELL (finding a towel) Is this it? 
PETER Perfect. 
MITCHELL Here we go. 
PETER Thanks. 
PETER lays the towel across the counter, and dries the little girl.  MITCHELL watches as PETER puts a new diaper on her.  The toddler stares up at MITCHELL, her eyes are playful. 
MITCHELL stares at the girl's face. 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
TIME CUT back to MITCHELL honking the horn of his car, trying to get someone's attention.  No response.  MITCHELL picks up his cell phone, and dials the operator. 
MITCHELL Yes, operator, I'm in a strange situation.  I'm calling from my car, and I appear to be stuck in a car wash...A car wash, yes...Is there anyway you could...Hello?...Hello?... 
The line has died. 
MITCHELL searches for an umbrella, finds one, and tries to get out of the car without getting soaked. 
ANGLE ON 
MITCHELL as he leaves the car, trying to protect himself from the onslaught of water with his umbrella.  He is immediately soaked by a large mop.  The camera watches MITCHELL as he makes his way towards light at the end of the wash. 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT 
MITCHELL walks into the office of the car wash.  No one is there.  There is an ominous buzz coming from another room. 
MITCHELL moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto repair establishment.  He moves into a larger room, full of discarded auto parts.  The buzzing noise is coming from an electric guitar, which has been left on, and is on the verge of screeching feedback. 
RISA You don't know that. 
MITCHELL Have they ever been busted? 
RISA No. 
WENDELL You don't know is what you mean. 
MITCHELL regards the tension between RISA and WENDELL as he continues to make notes. 
MITCHELL'S cell phone rings.  He answers it. 
MITCHELL Yes, I'll accept the charges. 
MITCHELL stands up. 
MITCHELL (CONT'D) Do you mind if I step outside for a moment?  It's a private call. 
The WALKERS nod as MITCHELL moves outside. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK 
MITCHELL speaks into his cellular phone. 
MITCHELL Zoe...Zoe, where are you? 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY 
A newscaster is giving a report on the television screen of a first class airplane cabin.  The image is silent. 
This scene takes place two years after the accident. 
MITCHELL STEPHENS is playing with his headset, which doesn't seem to be working.  He summons a STEWARDESS over. 
MITCHELL I'm not getting any sound. 
The STEWARDESS checks the headset and confirms the problem. 
STEWARDESS I'll find you another pair. 
The STEWARDESS leaves. 
A young woman seated beside MITCHELL hands him her headset. 
ALISON You can have mine. 
MITCHELL takes ALISON'S headset.  Their eyes lock for a moment. 
ALISON (CONT'D) Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones. 
MITCHELL Alison Jones. 
ALISON 
I was a friend of Zoe's.  We went to school together.  I used to come to your house. 
MITCHELL (pretending to remember) Yes. 
ALISON Ally.  That was my nickname. 
MITCHELL Ally.  That's right. 
ALISON How are you? 
MITCHELL I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you? 
ALISON I'm fine.  Still working with my father. 
MITCHELL frequently looks over to ABBOTT during his conversations with DOLORES.  ABBOTT is always watching him like a hawk, making MITCHELL uneasy. 
DOLORES Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'. 
MITCHELL What do you mean by that, Dolores? 
DOLORES About the Ottos? 
MITCHELL Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'? 
DOLORES I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing... 
MITCHELL Do they have any reputation for drugs? 
DOLORES No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers. 
MITCHELL And they loved Bear. 
DOLORES Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott. 
MITCHELL turns around to find the picture of BEAR. 
It is right behind ABBOTT'S head, so MITCHELL has to divide his attention between the cute PHOTOGRAPH of BEAR clutching a prize rabbit at last year's county fair, and ABBOTT'S glaring eyes. 
ANGLE ON 
The PHOTOGRAPHS of various children with their pets.  Some have ribbons. 
DOLORES (CONT'D) (voice over) Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show. 
MITCHELL For rabbits? 
DOLORES (nodding) 
Abbott used to breed them 'til he had the stroke.  Bear won first prize.  Just look at the smile on his face. 
DOLORES He was one of those children that bring out the best in people.  He would have been a wonderful man. 
ANGLE ON 
MITCHELL as he stares at the photo of BEAR. 
CUT TO 
EXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING 
The camera is outside the bus, looking at BEAR as he finishes waving to his parents. 
ANGLE ON 
BEAR'S P.O.V. of WANDA and HARTLEY disappearing as the bus pulls away. 
CUT TO 
INT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING 
The camera moves inside the crowded bus, peering at the childrens' activity as they play with each other in the bus. 
ANGLE ON 
JESSICA and MASON ANSEL are seated at the back of the bus, looking out the rear window, waving at someone. 
CUT TO 
EXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING 
JESSICA and MASON are seen waving at... 
BILLY ANSEL, driving behind them in his pick up truck.  He waves back at his children. 
DOLORES (voice over) Billy Ansel started honking at us up around Upper Hat Creek.  He always started to do that when he caught up to the bus.  He'd wave at his kids, Jessica and Mason, who always sat at 
HELICOPTER AERIAL SHOT 
The bus and the pick-up are travelling through a beautiful mountain pass. 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY 
MITCHELL continues his conversation with ALISON as they eat dinner. 
ALISON I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay. 
MITCHELL Are you still in touch? 
ALISON Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago. 
MITCHELL Which one? 
ALISON Which one? 
MITCHELL Which clinic? 
ALISON I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach. 
MITCHELL Sunnyridge.  That was a long time 
ago. 
Beat.  ALISON proceeds cautiously. 
ALISON So there were others? 
MITCHELL (as he eats) Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units... 
ALISON Then...when did she get better? 
MITCHELL She didn't. 
ALISON But you said... 
MITCHELL That's where I'm going.  To see her. 
ALISON She's in trouble? 
MITCHELL Yes. (beat) Do you find there's something strange about this meat? 
ALISON stares at her plate.  MITCHELL summons the STEWARDESS. 
STEWARDESS Some more wine? 
MITCHELL I'm afraid this meat is overdone. 
STEWARDESS I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish? 
MITCHELL What is it? 
STEWARDESS Poached salmon. 
MITCHELL considers this.  He is polite, but slightly edgy. 
MITCHELL Do you have a cold plate? 
STEWARDESS We do. 
MITCHELL Is there shrimp on it? 
STEWARDESS Yes. 
MITCHELL If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp... 
STEWARDESS (smiling) I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate. 
WANDA You've been retained? 
MITCHELL Yes. 
WANDA Their child died, and they got a lawyer. 
Pause.  MITCHELL assesses WANDA'S energy. 
MITCHELL It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief. 
WANDA Who did they get for that? 
MITCHELL You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your 
weapon against whoever caused that bus to go off the road. 
WANDA Dolores? 
MITCHELL It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus. 
WANDA You think someone else caused the accident? 
MITCHELL Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before. 
HARTLEY returns with the tea. 
HARTLEY But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to... 
MITCHELL How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning? 
MITCHELL takes the cup of tea. 
MITCHELL (CONT'D) Someone calculated ahead of time what it would cost to sacrifice safety.  It's the darkest, most cynical thing to imagine, but it's 
absolutely true.  And now, it's up to me to make them build that bus with an extra bolt, or add an extra yard of guard rail.  It's the only way we can ensure moral responsibility in this society.  By what I do. 
Pause. 
WANDA So you're just the thing we need. 
MITCHELL Excuse me? 
WANDA Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best? 
MITCHELL Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best. 
As we're sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief-stricken as yourselves.  And this makes me very, very mad.  It's why I came all the way up here.  If everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school.  I promise you that I will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job. 
MITCHELL Who is responsible for this tragedy. Then, in your name and the Walkers' name and the name of whoever decides to join us, I shall sue.  I shall sue for negligence until they bleed. 
Pause. 
WANDA I want that person to go to jail. For the rest of his life.  I want him to die there.  I don't want his money. 
MITCHELL nods sympathetically. 
MITCHELL It's unlikely that anyone will go to prison, Mrs. Otto.  But he or his company will pay in other ways.  And we must make them pay.  Not for the 
money or to compensate you for the loss of your son.  That can't be done.  But to protect other innocent children.  You see, I'm not just here to speak for your anger, but for the future as well. (beat) What we're talking about is an ongoing relationship to time. 
Pause.  HARTLEY looks at MITCHELL'S teacup. 
HARTLEY I didn't ask if you wanted milk. 
MITCHELL No.  A little sugar though. 
HARTLEY We've only got honey. 
MITCHELL I'll...take it straight. 
MITCHELL maintains his eye contact with WANDA. 
CUT TO 
INT. GAS STATION -- DUSK 
BILLY is playing his electric guitar in the same garage that MITCHELL walked into at the beginning of the film. 
This is the gas station/repair shop/car wash that BILLY runs. 
BILLY checks his watch, and takes his guitar off.  He leaves the garage. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK 
BILLY is walking along a path behind the hotel, making sure that he is not seen.  He sneaks into Room 11. 
CUT TO 
INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING 
BILLY is sitting in a chair in Room 11, smoking a cigarette. The room is dark.  After a while, RISA enters through the door and slips inside. 
RISA Have you been waiting long? 
BILLY A while. 
RISA Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking. 
BILLY gets up to put out his cigarette in the toilet.  He notices some work tools in the washroom. 
BILLY What's all this? 
RISA 
Wendell put some fresh enamel on that break in the tub. 
BILLY Does this mean I can't take a shower? 
RISA No.  It should be dry by now. 
BILLY nods.  He turns around, looks at RISA, and begins to unbutton her shirt.  RISA stops him, smiles, and kisses BILLY.  After a moment, she pulls away, unbuckles her belt, and slips off her jeans.  She moves to the bed. 
BILLY What time's he coming home? 
RISA When the game's over, I guess. 
BILLY moves to the radio and turns it on, tuning into a hockey game.  RISA laughs.  He lowers the volume.  RISA takes off her shirt, and moves behind BILLY, kissing his neck.  BILLY closes his eyes. 
CUT TO 
INT. BILLY'S HOUSE. -- EVENING 
JESSICA and MASON, BILLY'S children, are being read to sleep by NICOLE.  She reads from Robert Browning's THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN. 
NICOLE The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty... 
MASON What's a ditty again? 
NICOLE It's like a song. 
MASON Oh. 
NICOLE 
When begins my ditty, Almost five hundred years ago, To see the townsfolk suffer so From vermin, was a pity... 
MASON What's vermin again? 
NICOLE Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats... 
MASON Nicole? 
CUT TO 
INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING 
Present time.  Night.  RISA is sitting on the bed, naked, her legs crossed.  She looks to the side, lost in thought. 
BILLY is behind her, putting on his clothes. 
BILLY What are you thinking? 
RISA Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me. 
BILLY That's because he misses you. 
RISA Yes. 
BILLY It's natural. 
RISA Your kids never cry. 
BILLY Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus. 
RISA They can look forward to that. 
BILLY Sure. 
RISA Just like we look forward to this. 
BILLY looks at RISA and smiles at her with affection.  He moves to the door. 
RISA (CONT'D) You're leaving. 
BILLY I better get back. 
RISA nods. 
RISA Good night, Billy. 
BILLY Good night. 
BILLY leaves.  RISA, still naked, moves to the washroom. She stares into the tub, noticing that the white enamel that WENDELL has applied has been washed away from BILLY'S shower. 
RISA picks up a tube of the enamel, and begins to re-apply it. 
CUT TO 
INT. BILLY'S HOUSE. -- EVENING 
NICOLE shows BILLY the clothes she has chosen.  BILLY stares at the selection. 
NICOLE Are you sure? 
BILLY Yeah. 
NICOLE It just seems...kind of weird. 
BILLY Why? 
NICOLE I don't know. 
BILLY Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it. 
NICOLE No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her. 
BILLY And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or... 
BILLY trails off, suddenly consumed with sadness. 
NICOLE What do you mean 'outgrown it'? 
BILLY I'm not sure. 
OMITTED 
DOLORES (voice over) They had walked to their places on the main road from the smaller lanes 
DOLORES and private roadways that run off it.  Bright little clusters of three and four children - like berries waiting to be plucked. 
CUT TO 
INT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY 
DOLORES is continuing her conversation with MITCHELL. 
DOLORES (smiling to herself) That's the way I thought of them sometimes. 
MITCHELL Berries. 
DOLORES Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children. 
Pause.  MITCHELL stares at DOLORES, disturbed by this image. DOLORES looks back at him. 
DOLORES (CONT'D) Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. 
MITCHELL Berry-picking. 
DOLORES Yes.  The old-fashioned way. 
MITCHELL And what's that? 
DOLORES With our hands. 
MITCHELL nods, stealing a glance ABBOTT, who stares at him intensely. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING 
The bus pulls up across the road from the Bide-A-Wile Motel. DOLORES watches as RISA walks her little boy, SEAN, across the road to the bus. 
DOLORES (voice over) Anyhow, my next stop was across from the Bide-A-Wile, which is owned and operated by Risa and Wendell Walker. 
Risa walked her little boy, Sean, across the road, which was customary.  Sean had some kind of learning disability. 
DOLORES He was behind all the other kids his age in school and was too fragile and nervous to play sports. 
CUT TO 
INT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY 
DOLORES continues to talk to MITCHELL, who takes notes. 
DOLORES (smiling) A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six. 
MITCHELL Were his parents...attentive to him? 
DOLORES What do you mean? 
MITCHELL You mentioned that he had a learning disability. 
DOLORES That's right. 
MITCHELL Did his parents attend to that? 
DOLORES What do you mean? 
MITCHELL Did they give him special care? 
DOLORES The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING 
EXT. BILLY'S PICK-UP -- MORNING 
BILLY waving back at his children.  His expression suddenly changes as he sees... 
CUT TO 
EXT. ROAD. -- MORNING 
From BILLY'S point of view, the schoolbus smashes through the guardrail and the snowbank.  It plummets down the embankment to the frozen-over pond. 
Still upright, the bus slides across the ice to the far side.  The ice lets go and the rear half of the yellow bus is swallowed at once by the freezing water.  The sound of the ice breaking is terrifying. 
DOLORES (voice over) It emerged from the blowing snow on the right side of the road.  It might have been a dog or a small deer or maybe even a lost child.  It might have been an optical illusion or a mirage.  Whatever it was, for the rest of my life I will remember that red-brown blur... 
An eerie silence as the camera stares at the scene of the accident. 
CUT TO 
INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- MORNING 
The camera is high above the bed, looking down on a sleeping family. 
This is the same image as from the beginning of the film. 
A FATHER, a MOTHER, and a THREE YEAR OLD GIRL, naked in bed. 
MITCHELL (voice over) Every time I get on one of these flights to rescue Zoe, I remember the summer we almost lost her.  She was three years old.  It happened in the morning, at this cottage we used to rent.  We were all sleeping together in bed.  It was a wonderful time in our lives.  We still thought we had a future together, the three of us.  Did you ever visit the cottage? 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT 
MITCHELL is telling the story to ALISON. 
ALISON I...don't think so. 
MITCHELL I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face. 
ALISON What happened? 
MITCHELL I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was. 
ALISON stares at MITCHELL, taken by his need to chronicle and detail this irrelevant stranger. 
CUT TO 
INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- MORNING 
FATHER (YOUNG MITCHELL) is on the phone.  The camera is behind his head. 
In front of him, MOTHER (KLARA) is breast-feeding the THREE YEAR OLD GIRL (ZOE). 
MITCHELL (voice over) He surmised that there was a nest of baby black widow spiders in the mattress.  He told me they had to be babies, or else with Zoe's body 
weight she'd be dead.  He told me I had to rush her to the hospital.  He was alone.  There was no ambulance available.  'Now you listen', he said, 'There's a good chance you can get her to me before her throat closes, but the important thing is to keep her calm.'  He asked if there was one of us she was more relaxed with than the other.  I said, 'Yes, with me.' 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT 
MITCHELL continues telling the story to ALISON. 
MITCHELL Which was true enough, especially at that moment.  Klara was wild-eyed with fear, and her fear was contagious.  I was a better actor than she was, that's all.  Zoe loved us equally then.  Just like she hates us both equally now. (beat) The doctor told me that I should hold her in my lap, and let Klara drive to the hospital.  He asked me to bring a small, sharp knife.  It had to be clean.  There was no time to sterilize properly.  He explained how to perform an emergency tracheotomy.  How to cut into my daughter's throat and windpipe without causing her to bleed to death.  He told me there'd be a lot of blood.  I said I didn't think I could do it.  'If her throat closes up and stops her breathing, you'll have to, Mr. Stephens.  You'll have a minute and a half, two minutes maybe, and she'll probably be unconscious when you do it.  But if you can keep her calm and relaxed, if you don't let her little heart beat too fast and spread the poison around, then you might just make it over here first.  You get going now', and he hung up. 
CUT TO 
INT. CAR -- MORNING 
A little girl staring innocently into the lens as a male voice sings a lullaby to her. 
It is now recognized as MITCHELL'S voice, singing to his daughter as she is driven to the hospital. 
RISA ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough. 
BILLY You believe that? 
RISA I have to. 
BILLY Why? 
RISA Because I have to. 
BILLY Well I don't. 
BILLY gets up to leave. 
RISA Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed? 
BILLY Yes. 
RISA Why did you do that, Billy? 
BILLY You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing. 
RISA is crying.  BILLY opens the door. 
BILLY (CONT'D) You know what I'm going to miss? More than making love?  It's the nights you couldn't get away from Wendell.  It's the nights I'd sit in that chair for an hour.  Smoking cigarettes and remembering my life before... 
BILLY stares at RISA painfully, then leaves. 
CUT TO 
EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT 
MITCHELL is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder. 
The bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact.  Most of the windows in the rear have gone.  There is a ghostly quality to this image, as though the video light is searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck. 
MITCHELL turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus.  He hears a truck approaching the garage from the distance.  It's BILLY ANSEL.  MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the truck. 
BILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows over the inside passenger seats.  BILLY stares at the bus a long time.  MITCHELL approaches him. 
MITCHELL I'm here about your children, Mr. Ansel. 
BILLY takes a moment, then turns around to face MITCHELL. The two men stare at each other. 
MITCHELL (CONT'D) My name is... 
BILLY Mister, I don't want to know your name. 
MITCHELL I understand. 
BILLY No you don't. 
MITCHELL I can help you. 
BILLY Not unless you can raise the dead. 
MITCHELL hands BILLY a card. 
MITCHELL Here.  You may change your mind. 
BILLY looks at the card. 
BILLY Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do. 
MITCHELL No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you. 
BILLY Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help. 
MITCHELL You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group. 
BILLY Case? 
SAM leaves again. 
JENNY Mommy says you need to lock the boys out. 
NICOLE What boys? 
JENNY I don't know. 
NICOLE stares at JENNY, as MARY comes back into the room. 
MARY So do you like your new room? 
NICOLE It's interesting. 
MARY Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect. 
NICOLE I feel like a princess. 
SAM comes back and begins to work on the door.  NICOLE watches him.  She notices a new computer on a desk. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) Is this mine? 
MARY Yes.  It's a present. 
NICOLE From you? 
MARY No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were. 
NICOLE Who's Mr. Stephens? 
SAM He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer. 
NICOLE You and Mom have a lawyer? 
SAM Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too. 
NICOLE My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer? 
MARY Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something? 
NICOLE No.  What's this lawyer business? 
MARY turns to JENNY. 
MARY Jenny, why don't you go and play outside? 
JENNY looks at NICOLE. 
JENNY He's given me some stuff too.  Toys, and some books... 
MARY Jenny. 
JENNY turns to leave.  When she's outside, MARY continues. 
MARY (CONT'D) He's a very kind man.  And he knew that you'd need a computer for doing schoolwork. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BURNELL HOME. PORCH -- DAY 
NICOLE wheels her chair to the exterior porch, where she watches her sister climb a tree.  SAM follows her outside. 
SAM It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included. 
NICOLE But you didn't lose me. 
MARY No, honey.  And we will thank the Lord for that every day and night 
for the rest of our lives.  But you almost died, and you were badly injured, and you won't be...you can't... 
NICOLE I can't walk anymore. 
NICOLE I won't lie. 
MITCHELL I don't want you to lie. 
NICOLE The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame. 
MITCHELL There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this. 
NICOLE You seem very sure about that. 
MITCHELL I'm absolutely positive. 
NICOLE turns to face SAM.  She stares at him. 
NICOLE No matter what I'm asked, I'll tell the truth. 
SAM looks back, expressionless. 
MITCHELL That's fine.  I want you to be absolutely truthful.  And I'll be right there to advise and help you. And there'll be a court stenographer there to make a record of it, and 
that's what'll go to the judge, before the trial is set.  It'll be the same for everybody.  They'll be deposing the Ottos and the Walkers, the bus driver... 
NICOLE Dolores. 
MITCHELL Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last. 
NICOLE Why? 
MITCHELL So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that? 
NICOLE nods. 
SAM When do they award damages? 
MITCHELL Depends.  This could drag on for quite a while.  But we'll be there at the end, Sam.  Don't you worry. 
NICOLE (voice over) At that moment, I hated my parents - Daddy for what he knew and had done, 
NICOLE and even Mom for what she didn't know and hadn't done.  You told me it wasn't going to be easy.  But as I sat there, staring at Daddy, I knew it was going to be the easiest thing in my life. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING 
REPLAY of the scene of SEAN WALKER entering the bus.  He turns around to face his mother. 
SEAN 
I want to stay with you. 
RISA Go on now.  Go on. 
SEAN hesitantly turns to face the inside of the bus.  He sees NICOLE BURNELL, who pats the seat beside her. 
MASON leaves his place beside NICOLE to make way for SEAN. 
NICOLE C'mon, Sean, sit next to me. 
ANGLE ON 
DOLORES as she watches SEAN move towards NICOLE. 
CUT TO 
INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY 
DOLORES gives her deposition.  A stenographer takes notes. MITCHELL listens, along with SCHWARTZ, the opposing lawyer. 
DOLORES He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened. 
MITCHELL Why would he be frightened? 
MARY That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us. 
SAM Did he say what about? 
MARY No. 
SAM Was he drinking?  Could you tell? 
MARY Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed. 
JENNY Mom... 
SAM Come on, Jen.  I let you watch your nature show. 
JENNY reluctantly kisses her father goodnight, then NICOLE. As she leaves the room, MARY starts clearing the table. 
SAM (CONT'D) Is he coming over now?  Right away? 
MARY That's what he said. 
SAM is anxious.  He looks over to NICOLE. 
SAM What are you up to, Nicole? 
NICOLE Nothing. 
SAM Nothing good on your T.V.? 
NICOLE As opposed to this T.V.? 
NICOLE stares at SAM. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) Besides, I'd like to see Billy. 
NICOLE stares at the television. 
ANGLE ON 
On the television screen, an image of a studio audience applauding.  The image is silent.  The T.V. is on MUTE. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) That wasn't true.  I didn't want to be seen by anyone whose kids had been killed by the accident. Especially not Billy Ansel. 
NICOLE turns her attention back to her parents. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) Actually, now that I think about it, I'd just as soon stay in my room. 
NICOLE shoves her wheelchair towards her room, as the camera remains on her face. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) I remembered all the times I had tucked Jessica and Mason into bed. How they loved to have me read to them before they slept.  There was nothing for me to say to Billy, except I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that your children died when my parent's children didn't. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT 
BILLY pulls up to the BURNELL home.  He gets out of his pick up and approaches the house. 
CUT TO 
INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT 
From her room, NICOLE watches as BILLY approaches the house. 
He leaves her view as a knock is heard at the door.  NICOLE wheels over to the door and presses her ear to the door so that she can hear the conversation. 
CUT TO 
INT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN. -- NIGHT 
SAM Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off. 
MARY Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left. 
SAM It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole. 
BILLY I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. (beat) That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community. 
SAM I'm sorry. 
BILLY stares at SAM. 
BILLY I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away. 
MARY Billy, please.  The children. 
BILLY The children. 
BILLY looks at SAM and MARY, s strange smile on his face. He moves to leave.  He pauses at the door of the kitchen. 
BILLY (CONT'D) How is Nicole?  Is she around? 
MARY She's resting.  In her room. 
BILLY Say hello for me. 
CUT TO 
EXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT 
BILLY walks to his car.  SAM and MARY watch him from the porch/ramp. 
SAM (calling out) We're getting on with our lives, Billy.  Maybe it's time you got on with yours. 
BILLY turns around, looks at SAM one final time, then moves to his pick up. 
CUT TO 
INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT 
NICOLE is watching BILLY from her window.  She is crying. 
ANGLE ON 
NICOLE'S P.O.V. of BILLY driving away. 
CUT TO 
INT. BURNELL HOME.  NICOLE'S BEDROOM. -- NIGHT 
NICOLE is lying in her bed.  A knock at the door.  SAM enters the dark bedroom and sits on the bed beside her. 
SAM Are you sleeping? 
NICOLE No. 
SAM Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over. 
NICOLE Great. 
SAM You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to. 
NICOLE 
We used to talk a lot, didn't we, Daddy.  About all the things you were going to do for me. 
SAM What do you mean? 
NICOLE I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now? 
SAM turns away from NICOLE. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely. 
SAM Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you? 
Worried about this new information. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) It was when Sean Walker got on.  He was crying and didn't want to leave his mother.  Mason Ansel was sitting beside me.  I asked him to move, so I could quiet Sean down.  When the bus started up, a car came around 
the corner and almost hit Sean's mother.  She was okay, but it really scared Sean, because he watched it out the window. 
SCHWARTZ And was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did? 
Pause.  MITCHELL is nervous. 
NICOLE No, she hadn't even started to move the bus.  It was the car's fault. 
MITCHELL is relieved. 
SCHWARTZ There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior? 
MITCHELL I object to that form of question. Note that. 
NICOLE (answering the question) No. 
SCHWARTZ Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up? 
NICOLE Yes. 
SCHWARTZ You remember that much? 
NICOLE As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it. 
MITCHELL is worried. 
MITCHELL Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.' 
SCHWARTZ Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto 
the Marlowe Road at what's called Wilmot Springs? 
NICOLE Yes. 
NICOLE There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly. 
SCHWARTZ (eyebrows raised) You are? 
NICOLE Yes. 
MITCHELL (worried) Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'. 
SCHWARTZ And what was the weather like at this time? 
NICOLE It was snowing. 
MITCHELL Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question. 
SCHWARTZ I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time? 
NICOLE Before the actual accident? 
SCHWARTZ Yes. 
NICOLE stares at her father as she responds. 
NICOLE I was scared. 
SCHWARTZ Why were you scared? 
SCHWARTZ This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking? 
NICOLE Yes, I understand. 
SCHWARTZ Why were you scared? 
NICOLE Dolores was driving too fast. 
MITCHELL (in a low voice) You'd make a great poker player, kid. 
NICOLE wheels herself over to her father. 
NICOLE Let's go, Daddy. 
EXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY 
NICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.  She stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps. 
NICOLE (voice over) Daddy took a long time.  I guess he wanted to have a few words with you. He must have tried to tell you that I was lying.  Then you would tell Daddy that it didn't matter if I was lying or not, the lawsuit is dead. 
As NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and MITCHELL arguing is seen. 
The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice over. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) Everyone's lawsuit is dead.  Forget it.  Tell the others to forget it. It's over.  Right now, Sam, the thing you've got to worry about is why she lied.  A kid who'd do that to her own father is not normal, Sam. 
SAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down at the driver's seat.  NICOLE stares at him as he starts the car. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) But Daddy knows who lied.  He knows who the liar is.  He knows who's normal. 
SAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (speaking to SAM) I hope he lets us keep the computer. 
SAM turns to look at NICOLE. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) I'd like an ice cream. 
CUT TO 
INT. AIRPORT. -- MORNING 
MITCHELL is at the baggage section of the arrival area, waiting for his luggage. 
He watches PETER, the man he met in the washroom changing his daughter, playing with the little girl. 
PETER is full of love as he swings the little girl into the air as she laughs. 
MITCHELL is caught in a daydream, smiling at the happy image of father and daughter.  ALISON approaches him. 
ALISON Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens. 
MITCHELL Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally. 
ALISON Alison. 
MITCHELL Alison. 
ALISON Say hi to Zoe. 
MITCHELL I will. 
ALISON I hope she gets better. 
MITCHELL I'll tell her that. 
ALISON shakes MITCHELL'S hand, and leaves. 
CUT TO 
EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY 
SAM wheels NICOLE along a path away from the same concession stand that was seen at the beginning of the film.  NICOLE is licking an ice-cream cone.  Around them, people are setting up the bandstand. 
NICOLE Daddy, can we come to the fair? 
SAM Yes. 
NICOLE How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.

THOR 
Written by 
Ashley Miller & Zack Stentz 
FADE IN: 
On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars. Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come. 
1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1 
A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves down the street and heads out of town. 
2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2 
The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point at the sky. JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from spare parts of other devices. 
JANE Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as well, rubbing his head. 
JANE (CONT'D) Oh-- watch your head. 
SELVIG Thanks. So what's this "anomaly" of yours supposed to look like? 
JANE It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon-- 
SELVIG 
(GENTLY TEASING) "Racing "round Orion?" I've always said you should have been a poet. Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A. 
JANE Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin. 
JANE (CONT'D) Not until you see it! 
SELVIG (re: the gloves) I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile. 
JANE Thank you. 
SELVIG For what? 
JANE The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2. 
JANE (CONT'D) It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat. 
DARCY (O.S.) Can I turn on the radio? 
JANE (an edge to her voice) Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, "All agriculture, all the time." Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle. 
3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3 
The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the frustrated Jane with sympathy. 
JANE The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns. 
JANE (CONT'D) The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror. She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert. 
DARCY Jane? Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of champagne begins to vibrate. 
JANE There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A. 
DARCY I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment... The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3. They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane. 
DARCY (CONT'D) Jane? 
JANE What?! 
DARCY I think you want to see this. Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over the desert -- 
MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded. 
JANE Holy. Shatner. 
SELVIG That's your "subtle" aurora?! 
JANE No-- yes! Let's go! 
4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4 
SELVIG Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her. 
JANE Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm, and into: 
13 EXT. SPACE 13 
EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard. 
HEIMDALL (V.O.) Questions, they've always asked questions -- this race called man, on this planet they call earth. Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6. We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds, cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our galaxy. 
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) In ages past, they looked to us as gods, for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity. We tried to show them how their world was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil... We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense, sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching out into the black void of space. 
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in a universe of wonder, beauty, and terror that they barely comprehended. We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like a galaxy, slowly spinning before us. 
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) But for all their thirst for knowledge, they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams. Where did he come from? He came from us, the proudest race of warriors the Worlds have ever seen. He came from this -- the greatest Realm the universe has ever known. We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal what's on the other side: 
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) He came... from Asgard! 
14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14 
Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city, modern yet timeless. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A. 
15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15 
The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled out before it. We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE 
STANDS -- 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7. 
ODIN ALLFATHER Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony, land at his side. 
16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16 
Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror. 
ODIN Do you think he's ready? 
FRIGGA He thinks he is. He has his father's confidence. 
ODIN He'll need his father's wisdom. 
FRIGGA And his humility? Odin reacts. 
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Thor won't be alone. Loki will be at his side to give him counsel. Have faith in your sons. 
ODIN Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8. Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more. A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own. 
ODIN (CONT'D) 
(QUIETLY) ...if we only had more time. 
FRIGGA For once, our son needs something we cannot provide. 
ODIN I can fight it a little longer... 
FRIGGA No. You've put it off too long! I worry for you. He touches her cheek. 
ODIN I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me? 
FRIGGA Always. 
ODIN Not today. Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king. He pulls her close, and they kiss. 
17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17 
Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the fire lit room. Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder. Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform. An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine. He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly below. 
THOR Another! 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A. The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR. He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of the Hall. We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his horned headpiece. Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room. 
LOKI 
(TO THOR) Nervous, brother? 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9. 
THOR Have you ever known me to be nervous? 
SIF Keep your mouth shut. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12. 
19 INT. VAULT - DAY 19 
Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready, stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath the palace. A cold BREEZE blows past them. 
19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A 
Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety. 
FRIGGA It's all right to be nervous. 
THOR Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous! 
FRIGGA You may be able to fool the rest of 
ASGARD -- 
THOR ...but never you. I know. 
FRIGGA Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had. 
THOR And what is that? 
FRIGGA Me for a mother. She smiles. 
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Now don't keep your father waiting. Frigga leaves. 
20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20 
Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn, the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into formation. They part to reveal -- 
ODIN 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A. Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a Ruler of Asgard. Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall, casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased. A murmur spreads through the crowd. 
VOLSTAGG (sotto, to Loki) Where is he? 
LOKI He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval. 
VOLSTAGG What? 
SIF He wants to make an entrance. 
FANDRAL Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens. 
LOKI I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13. Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level -- 
MJOLNIR Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy. 
SIF Oh, please. Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display. 
21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21 
As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing something's not right. They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a pedestal. LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons. 
22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22 
Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father. Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at her. She can't help but smile. Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless authority. He raises Gungnir before him. 
ODIN Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born. 
(MORE) 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A. 
ODIN (CONT'D) So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14. 
23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23 
The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large and BLUE-SKINNED. One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind it. As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them. They turn back around. Now it's their turn to SCREAM. 
24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24 
The Ceremony continues. 
ODIN Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall. Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son with pride. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15. 
THOR As King of Asgard, I would-- 
ODIN You are not King. Not yet. Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin watches him go. 
26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26 
Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the massive tables. From across the room, Loki watches him. 
AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in search of his dinner. 
SIF Redecorating, are we? Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast. 
VOLSTAGG What's this -- ?! 
HOGUN I told you they'd cancel it. 
FANDRAL We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing. 
VOLSTAGG All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart! Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki calmly moves towards him. 
THOR It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18. 
LOKI Who said I was wise? 
THOR (re: the empty hall) This was to be my day of triumph. 
LOKI It will come. In time. 
(ADMITS) If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything. If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army? 
THOR Yes, exactly! 
LOKI But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned. 
LOKI (CONT'D) No... stop there! I know that look! 
THOR It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders. 
LOKI It's madness! 
VOLSTAGG Madness? What sort of madness? 
LOKI Nothing! Thor was making a jest! 
THOR The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19. 
FANDRAL What?! 
SIF Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break. Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings. 
FANDRAL This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim. 
VOLSTAGG And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will! 
THOR My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers. 
SIF It is forbidden! Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction. 
THOR My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral. 
THOR (CONT'D) Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil? 
FANDRAL You did. 
THOR 
(TO HOGUN) Who led you into the most glorious of battles... 
(TO VOLSTAGG) ...and to delicacies so succulent, you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla? 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A. 
VOLSTAGG/HOGUN You did. / You did. He turns to Sif. 
THOR And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known? 
SIF I did. 
THOR 
(QUICKLY) True. But I supported you... (then, to the others) My friends, trust me now. We must do this. The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no convincing him. 
Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus at the center of the room and readies the Observatory. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23. 
HEIMDALL Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim. 
THOR I have no plans to die today. 
HEIMDALL None do. Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up. 
31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31 
The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into the Observatory. 
32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32 
Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES, the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it. The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and his five comrades stand. 
HEIMDALL All is ready. You may pass. 
VOLSTAGG Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us? 
HEIMDALL To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it. 
VOLSTAGG Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A. 
THOR Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex. 
33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33 
A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are imprinted on the ice around them. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24. Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond. 
THOR Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims: 
VOLSTAGG This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing! 
FANDRAL You bathe? Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance. 
HOGUN We shouldn't be here. 
THOR Too late now. 
FANDRAL Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice. Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious. 
LOKI Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother. 
THOR For what? 
LOKI To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25. 
VOLSTAGG I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part. 
THOR We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow. 
SIF He's just got to swing his hammer... 
34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34 
The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland, shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers. Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades. 
THOR It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world? 
FANDRAL Adventuring? Is that what we're doing? 
THOR What would you call it? 
FANDRAL Freezing. 
VOLSTAGG Starving. 
SIF Whining. 
THOR How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan. 
HOGUN No, not that! 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A. 
SIF Please don't make us sing again! 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B. 
THOR (CONT'D) Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp. 
THOR (CONT'D) (re: the fallen Brute) Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead. 
SIF (to Hogun, re: knife) I'm so glad I taught him how to do that! Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in. 
VOLSTAGG You may want to put some ice on that! The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) You may be taller, but I'm wider! Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying. Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) It's not too late for you to surrender. Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C. Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's ice helmet and dropping him to the ground. Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small FLASK. Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells to his comrades. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Don't let them grab hold of you! He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the battle. Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) (on his belly) Thank you, my lady. But I nearly had him! 
SIF Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29. A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground. Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes. 
VOLSTAGG Hang on! Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs. 
HOGUN Watch the legs! 
VOLSTAGG 
(REALIZING) Right. Sorry. Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally freeing Hogun's feet. Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant. 
FANDRAL You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away. 
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Fair enough. Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's sword and snaps it in half. 
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword? Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon. The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air, forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral, rendering him helpless. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A. Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly- unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights them off. Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral. 
VOLSTAGG That's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade. 
FANDRAL I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it? 
VOLSTAGG Just try not to bleed. 
FANDRAL How's the face? 
VOLSTAGG Flawless. Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30. Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts the Jotuns around him. 
THOR Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet. 
LOKI That can't be good. 
VOLSTAGG Yes, it could! Might be an early spring! They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31. 
LOKI Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle. 
THOR Then go! 
SIF There are too many of them! 
THOR I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them. 
SIF Thor! But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting. 
VOLSTAGG Run! Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a 
MOMENT -- 
THOR'S FIST Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns. He opens his hand, beckoning. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might. KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32. But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground beneath them, exposing the black void of space below. 
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) What's Thor done? 
LOKI Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades. 
35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A 
Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37 
Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS into him, as we: 
CUT TO BLACK. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36. After a beat, we hear familiar voices. 
DARCY (V.O.) I think that was legally your fault. 
JANE (V.O.) Get the first aid kit. 
(THEN) Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. 
THOR'S POV Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him, concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful. 
DARCY (O.S.) Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR. 
END THOR'S POV 
TIME CUT TO: Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her. 
JANE 
(TO SELVIG) Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise. Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength. 
JANE (CONT'D) Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground. 
THOR Hammer... 
DARCY Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious. Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines her flashlight down at the sand. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A. 
JANE Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away. 
JANE (CONT'D) We've got to move fast before anything changes. 
(MORE) 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37. 
JANE (CONT'D) We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky. 
SELVIG Jane, we need get him to a hospital. Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister. 
JANE Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain. 
JANE (CONT'D) 
(RE: THOR) Look at him, he's fine. Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily. 
THOR Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge! 
JANE (off Selvig's look) Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here. 
SELVIG You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated. 
THOR You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor. 
SELVIG It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A. 
THOR Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38. 
JANE Erik, just back away... 
SELVIG (to Thor, calming) You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo. 
THOR What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim? 
DARCY Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon, unsure what to make of it. 
THOR You dare threaten Thor with so puny 
A-- Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked. 
DARCY What? He was freaking me out. 
38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38 
THOR Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it? 
DARCY I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many. 
JANE 
(TO THOR) Let's get you some clothes. 
53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53 
Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a ROARING central fire. Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades, the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch. Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound. Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant. Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to its normal color. 
VOLSTAGG We should never have let him go. 
SIF There was no stopping him. 
FANDRAL At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone. 
VOLSTAGG How did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm. 
LOKI I told him. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A. 
FANDRAL What? 
LOKI I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46. 
VOLSTAGG You told the guard? 
LOKI I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did. 
SIF Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind! 
LOKI And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him. 
SIF He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor. 
VOLSTAGG True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives. 
HOGUN Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun. 
FANDRAL Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous? 
HOGUN A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication. 
VOLSTAGG No! Surely not! 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A. 
FANDRAL Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47. 
SIF Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow? 
VOLSTAGG The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King. 
SIF We should go to the Allfather. 
FANDRAL And tell him what? "Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!" 
SIF It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger. 
54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54 
Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters sitting on its stand. He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, across his body. The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48. 
ODIN (O.S.) Stop! Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin eyes Loki with dismay. 
LOKI Am I cursed? 
ODIN No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father. 
LOKI What am I? 
ODIN You're my son. 
LOKI What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth. 
LOKI (CONT'D) The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer. 
JANE (CONT'D) My ex. Thor stares at her a beat. 
JANE (CONT'D) They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry. 
THOR They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall. 
JANE You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo. 
JANE (CONT'D) What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive. 
THOR What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious. 
SELVIG (amused, skeptical) The Bifrost... Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the book. 
JANE What exactly is the Bifrost? 
THOR 
(IGNORING HER) This mortal form has grown weak. 
JANE 
BUT-- 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52A. 
JANE (CONT'D) Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart. 
61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61 
Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight. Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks softly to him. 
FRIGGA I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family. 
LOKI So why did he lie? 
FRIGGA He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that. Loki takes this in, stares at Odin. 
FRIGGA (CONT'D) 
(RE: ODIN) You can speak to him. He can see and hear us, even now. 
LOKI How long will it last? 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53. 
FRIGGA I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared. 
LOKI I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored. 
FRIGGA But he's put it off for so long now, I fear... Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her eyes. 
FRIGGA (CONT'D) You're a good son. Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he really feels. 
FRIGGA (CONT'D) We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother. Loki looks to Frigga, concerned. 
LOKI What hope is there for Thor? 
FRIGGA There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home. Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching. 
THE EINHERJAR GUARD Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is baffled. 
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Thor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A. The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels before Loki, offers the spear to him. 
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Make your father proud. Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the feel of it in his hand. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54. 
62 INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62 
Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates -- pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him. Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready. 
JANE Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away. 
JANE (CONT'D) Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud. 
DARCY And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry. Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of coffee. 
THOR (re: coffee mug) This drink. I like it. 
DARCY (to Thor, re: coffee) Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town. Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it. 
THOR 
THOR Yes. He stops walking. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57. 
THOR (CONT'D) If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know. 
JANE Everything? 
THOR All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others. 
DARCY "Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?" Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed, 
WHEN: 
SELVIG Jane. He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much care for him. 
SELVIG (CONT'D) 
(TO JANE) Please don't do this. 
JANE You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater. 
SELVIG I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him. 
JANE He's promised us answers. 
SELVIG He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost." "Mjolnir." These are the stories I grew up with as a child! 
JANE I'd just be driving him out there, that's all. 
SELVIG It's dangerous. He's dangerous. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58. After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and Darcy. 
JANE I'm sorry. I can't take you. 
THOR I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it. 
JANE That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them. 
THOR Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved. 
SELVIG Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street. 
64 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 64 
Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne Room. 
65 INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 65 
Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59. 
SIF Allfather, we must speak with you 
URGENTLY-- But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see -- 
LOKI Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them. 
VOLSTAGG What is this? 
LOKI My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard. 
FANDRAL Where is Odin? 
LOKI Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again. 
SIF We would speak with her. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices. 
LOKI She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your "urgent" matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly. 
SIF We would ask you to end Thor's banishment. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60. 
LOKI My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this. 
LOKI (CONT'D) All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard. 
FANDRAL Of course. Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki stares after them. 
66 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66 
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices, partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine from her lab. 
THOR I need a horse. 
PET STORE CLERK Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just dogs, cats, birds. 
THOR Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63. 
JANE You still want a lift? 
68A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A 
It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book -- "THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS" -- to a group of kids. 
LIBRARIAN 
(READING) "And though they're large, giants can be quiet. You have to listen carefully for the sound of their footsteps -- because they may be closer than you think." Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid pleasantly. 
LIBRARIAN (CONT'D) Joshua, come sit down. It's story time. The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading -- 
"MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD." He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on Scandinavian Mythology. It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group of VIKINGS kneel reverently. He eyes the illustration, pondering. 
69 OMITTED 69 
70 EXT. DESERT - DUSK 70 
Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky. 
71 INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 71 
Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A. 
JANE I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement. 
THOR Many times. You're brave to do it. 
JANE They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose. 
THOR But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm. 
JANE "This Realm?" Why do you talk like that? 
THOR You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself. 
JANE Yeah. Just a little. 
THOR Good strange or bad strange? 
JANE I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car. 
JANE (CONT'D) Sorry. She glances back at him. He's confident, determined. 
JANE (CONT'D) Who are you? Really? 
THOR You'll see soon enough. 
JANE You promised me answers. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B. Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence. 
THOR What you seek -- it's a bridge. 
JANE A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge? 
THOR More like a rainbow bridge. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64. A beat. 
JANE God, I hope you're not crazy. 
71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A 
As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside, revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move closer, we see the glow comes from -- 
A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers, barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the complex. Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the crater. Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work. Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the center of it all -- Mjolnir. 
72 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72 
Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base. 
JANE That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her. 
THOR You're going to need this. 
SITWELL (to the Techie) Get Coulson. Sitwell punches an alarm. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66A. 
78 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 78 
As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life. 
78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A 
A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight. She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's recorded message. 
SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE) You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message. His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently. 
JANE Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base. 
JANE (CONT'D) But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She hangs up. 
79 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79 
Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the lit up site uneasily. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67. 
80 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80 
A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him. As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the ground. Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by. Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main entrance tube to the center of the site. A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing the ATV's spotlight. Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself. The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it. Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance. 
80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A 
The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches the crater lip. The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the tunnel, sending sparks everywhere. The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67A. 
81 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 81 
Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert. Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.

82B EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 82B 
Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash. He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour. 
82C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE 82C 
As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads inside. 
82D INT. ENTRANCE TUBE 82D 
Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS round the corner. Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him. Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase. Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to tunnels to find a way towards it. 
82E EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 82E 
Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor. Coulson activates his radio. 
COULSON I want eyes up high. With a gun. Now!

82G INT. TUNNEL 82G 
As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him, on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him. Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him into the approaching Agents, scattering them. Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents give chase.

SELVIG Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A. On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her cellphone. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75. The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS." Coulson eyes the screen. After a beat, he turns back to Selvig. 
COULSON It says here he's an M.D. 
SELVIG He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really. 
(THEN) If you would just release him to me, I promise to keep an eye on him. Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to an AGENT nearby. 
COULSON Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here. The Techie looks to him, surprised. 
COULSON (CONT'D) 
(TO SELVIG) Make sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again. Selvig shakes his hand. 
SELVIG Thank you. 
92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A 
Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a seated Thor. 
SELVIG Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are! Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug. 
SELVIG (CONT'D) It's going to be all right, my friend. Come on, I'm taking you home. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A. He leads the bewildered Thor out the door. 
92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B 
As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand- written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes it from the pile and pockets it. 
92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C 
Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV record. A security warning over the image clearly reads "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA." He knows it's been a ruse all along. He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security Room, then follows them outside. 
93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93 
Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig. 
COULSON Just keep him away from the bars. 
SELVIG I will! 
THOR 
(TO SELVIG) Where are we going? Selvig drops his cool demeanor. 
SELVIG To get a drink. Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE. 
COULSON Follow them. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76. 
94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94 
Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy surface of the planet. 
95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95 
Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling. Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides. Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly. 
LAUFEY Tell me why I shouldn't kill you. 
LOKI I've come alone and unarmed. 
LAUFEY To what end? 
LOKI To make you another proposition. 
LAUFEY 
(REALIZING) So you're the one who let us into Asgard. 
LOKI You're welcome. 
LAUFEY My men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki calmly stands his ground. 
LOKI You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins. 
LOKI (CONT'D) Hello, Father. Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son. 
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) You were in the diner with that hot girl. Thor doesn't like where this is going. 
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me. He laughs. Thor is annoyed. 
THOR I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A. 
DRUNK TOWNIE And you should shut the hell up, princess. Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting. 
THOR I will not fight him. 
DRUNK TOWNIE Then it'll be easy to kick your ass. Selvig stands, steps between the two men. 
SELVIG Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads. Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81. 
SELVIG (CONT'D) 
(TO THOR) Another drink? 
98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98 
Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically in time with the song. 
THOR/SELVIG 
(SINGING) "The mood is good, our hearts are full, there's magic in the air. / It's all because we're here tonight, and haven't got a care. / So raise a glass, and toast to life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed!" Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap. Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a straight dead weight with a CLUNK. WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell, Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to walk up the street towards Jane's trailer. 
99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99 
The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane lies on her bed, trying to read. She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to the door and opens it to find -- 
THOR Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder. 
JANE Erik! 
(TO THOR) Is he all right? 
THOR He's fine. Not injured at all. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A. As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway. Selvig GROANS. 
THOR (CONT'D) Sorry, my friend. 
JANE What happened? 
THOR We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82. 
JANE Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes. 
SELVIG I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder. 
(THEN) But you ought to be. Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him. Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around. 
THOR These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her. 
JANE Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away. 
JANE (CONT'D) Can we go outside? 
100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100 
Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set up, a couple chairs, some blankets. 
JANE I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy. 
(THEN) I come up here a lot, now that I think about it. Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A. 
JANE (CONT'D) I'm glad you're safe. 
THOR You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve. 
JANE I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her 
NOTEBOOK. 
JANE (CONT'D) I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful. 
THOR It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry. 
JANE That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe? 
VOLSTAGG Exactly! Those lovely herring people. They worshipped us! Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder. 
THOR My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come. 
FANDRAL We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving. 
THOR You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks. 
SIF Thor... your father still lives. Thor reacts to the revelation. 
119 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 119 
A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings. Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an Agent. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 92. 
COULSON Get somebody from Linguistics out here. Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost storm ROARS in the sky above. Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the desert floor. Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom. 
120 OMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 119 120 
121 INT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 121 
Thor and the others see the Bifrost storm forming in the distance. 
DARCY Was somebody else coming? Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground. 
122 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 122 
From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it moves towards them. 
SHIELD AGENT 
(RE: DESTROYER) Is that one of Stark's? 
COULSON I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93. Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the Destroyer. 
COULSON (CONT'D) Hello! You're using unregistered weapons technology. Please identify yourself. We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up inside. 
COULSON (CONT'D) Incoming! As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return fire. 
123 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 123 
Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as Thor turns to Jane. 
THOR Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety. 
JANE What about you? 
THOR I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor. 
THOR (CONT'D) I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side. 
VOLSTAGG You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed! 
FANDRAL Or one of us, trying to protect you. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 94. 
SIF The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us. Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the oncoming threat. 
THOR 
(TO SIF) You're right. Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy. 
THOR (CONT'D) Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer. 
124 OMITTED 124 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 95. 
125 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 125 
Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant apparatus slows to a stop. 
LOKI Father. Welcome to Asgard. 
125A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 125A 
The site looks like the aftermath of a war zone. The smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about. 
126 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 126 
THOR But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins. 
THOR (CONT'D) Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless. 
THOR (CONT'D) Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B. 
THOR (CONT'D) Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99. Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms. The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK of breaking bones as Thor goes flying. Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy. The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street, a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back. 
SELVIG Jane, no! He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, watching the scene -- 
133 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 133 
Odin lies in the Odinsleep. A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100. 
134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134 
Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to unleash its fiery blast. 
135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135 
Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear, burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up. Clouds form in the sky above. Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies straight up into the air like a rocket. 
136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136 
The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when -- 
KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see -- 
JANE Oh. My. God. 
THE MIGHTY THOR Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand -- the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir down onto the ground. 
KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale force winds. Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101. It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him. Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the Destroyer. Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it. Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him. A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS. 
COULSON Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me. 
137 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 137 
Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS. Darcy turns to Volstagg. 
DARCY So, how can you speak our language? 
VOLSTAGG Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours. Thor calls up to the sky. 
THOR Heimdall! Open the Bifrost! 
138 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 138 
Heimdall stands frozen. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102. 
139 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 139 
Thor looks to the others with concern. 
THOR He would open it if he could. I fear the worst. 
VOLSTAGG Then we're trapped here forever. 
FANDRAL Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm. 
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Are all earth maidens as fair as you? Darcy enjoys the attention. 
DARCY No. Thor shouts back up to the sky. 
THOR Heimdall! 
140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140 
From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him. Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice. Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the Observatory. 
141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141 
The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD Agent's machine gun. 
VOLSTAGG Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose. Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy. 
149 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 149 
Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting pools below. 
150 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 150 
Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory. 
151 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 151 
Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret spins, points. 
152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152 
Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He looks to where the Bifrost is aimed. 
THOR Jotunheim... 
153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153 
Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory. He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway. 
154 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 154 
Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A. He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it. 
LOKI All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107. 
LOKI (CONT'D) You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart. 
THOR Why have you done this? 
LOKI To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done. 
THOR He won't! You can't kill an entire race! 
LOKI What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands. 
THOR I've changed. 
LOKI So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir. 
LOKI (CONT'D) Fight me. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended. 
THOR Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become? 
LOKI I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me! 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108. With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground. Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki. 
THOR I will not fight you, brother. 
LOKI I am not your brother. I never was. 
THOR Loki, this is madness... Loki grins. 
LOKI Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet. 
LOKI (CONT'D) What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman. Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right. 
LOKI (CONT'D) It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself. That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself. 
155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155 
It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart. JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking ice. 
156 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 156 
Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around it. 
SELVIG Jane? 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108A. 
JANE Something's wrong. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109. 
157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157 
Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his hand. The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too powerful. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides towards the Bifrost.

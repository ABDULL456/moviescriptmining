SHOOTING SCRIPT 
April 11, 1991 
THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/6/90 
FADE IN: 
A1   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE            A1 
A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy." They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they pompously begin their umpteenth verse, THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows, weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter. 
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF 
where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY, PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler, gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH over the edge. 
AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE 
BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
1    INT. DIM HALLWAY - SEVEN O'CLOCK A.M.                      1 
C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK -- 
The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour. In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage. One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward seven o'clock. 
IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and down. Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine. The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL LURCH appears and begins sweeping. Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back of the clock. Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall. 
LOW TRACKING SHOT 
follows Thing along the hallway.

3    INT. PUGSLEY'S ROOM - SAME TIME                             3 
Pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized chemistry set. The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's collected -- "Bridge Out!", "Detour! Excavation Ahead!", "Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!" SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked in the corner. 
In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING 
FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA. 
This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has every chance of growing up to be the public monster his parents would be proud of. He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin- ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down. He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma- tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

A5   INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME                                     A5 
Solemn and mournful, ten-year-old Wednesday has black hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A 
STRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR. 
The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in. Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string. 
WEDNESDAY 
Thank you, Grandmama. In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic. 
GRANNY 
You kids are going to have to kill your own breakfast this morning. Wednesday opens a cigar box. Inside the box are assorted human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a collection of glass eyes. Wednesday drops her tooth in the box.

A6   INT. GOMEZ AND MORTICIA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME              A6 
Gomez takes Morticia in his arms. As she languidly drapes herself across his chest, she is caught in a sudden shaft of sunlight. She squints. On the bedside table beside her, Morticia's OVERSIZED CARNIVOROUS 
ORCHID WILTS. 
MORTICIA 
Gomez... the sun... il me perce comme un poignard. 
GOMEZ 
GOMEZ 
(disturbed) Granny - where's your fog?

Standing beside the front door is LURCH, the gigantic family butler, a reanimated stitched-together behemoth. He holds two brown paper lunch bags in his enormous hands. The bags' contents wriggle, eager to escape. 
WEDNESDAY 
(taking her bag) Thank you, Lurch.

Morticia, wearing gardening gloves, is snipping the blossoms off her roses. Gomez sits at a table, playing CHESS with Thing. 
GOMEZ 
It's a milestone, Tish. This very evening -- our twenty-fifth seance. All those years, gnawed by guilt, undone by woe, burning with uncertainty... 
MORTICIA 
(yearningly) Oh Gomez, don't torture yourself. That's my job. 
GOMEZ 
(lustfully) Tish... 
MORTICIA 
Imagine, Darling, if Fester did come back. Half-alive, barely human, a rotting shell... 
GOMEZ 
Don't tease.

14    EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE ADDAMS' GROUNDS - SAME TIME          14 
TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET, approach "GATE," a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be startled by "Gate." Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent. High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap- pointed in Tully than he is in himself. Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat. 
TULLY 
Let me go! Ignoring Tully, Margaret continues stiffly up the walk. 
TULLY 
(to Gate) Gimme that! Stop it! I'm warning you! It's not a good day!

Gomez moves a chess piece. Thing gestures out the window. Gomez and Morticia both look out. As they do, Thing moves two chess pieces, cheating. 
What are you doing? 
TULLY 
Relaxing.   Taking a little sun. 
ABIGAIL 
Have you gone mad? 
TULLY 
Au contraire. Tully closes the book and smugly unfurls a LEGAL DOCUMENT.

Morticia and Granny stand in the middle of the dripping dankness. Stalagmites. Stalactites. Granny's torch casts scary shadows on the cave walls. 
GRANNY 
(calling out) Wednesday! Wednesday! 
MORTICIA 
A two-story NEON ARROW points the way to this bungalow court -- Bright and awful ersatz western. LOG CABINS OF SIMULATED WOOD surround the TEEPEE-SHAPED OFFICE. The Addams' Duesenberg is parked in front of the furthest cabin. The asphalt has been ripped up in big chunks and Lurch's tree is parked next to the Addams' new home.

C.U. DRESSING TABLE MIRROR 
Morticia leans into frame. With an icepick and a hammer, she deftly makes a large spidery CRACK in the round mirror. Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork. Granny joins her. 
GRANNY 
I like it. Her mother pats her consolingly. 
MORTICIA 
Just as long as we're together, n'est pas, mon cher? As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow -- all ersatz cowboy and Indian mixed with chrome-plated plastic and orange shag carpet. 
GOMEZ 
sits slumped in a   chair made from wagon wheel and nauga- hyde. It's as if    all of his insane, vibrant energy has been leeched from   him. He's a broken man. He looks back at her as if he's   never heard French. 
GOMEZ 
Huh? Wednesday tends to him.    She and her mother exchange a worried look. 
PUGSLEY 
comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel soap. 
PUGSLEY 
This place isn't so bad. They even put candy in the bathroom. 
MORTICIA 
That's the soap, dear.

PUGSLEY 
Oh. He takes another greedy bite. Wednesday pats her father's arm. 
MORTICIA 
We are Addamses, and we will not submit. Who recalls the fable of the tortoise and the hare? The swift, yet lazy little cottontail, and his slow but determined companion? What does that story teach us, as Addamses? 
GRANNY 
Kill the hare. Skin it.   Boil it. 
WEDNESDAY 
Put the tortoise on the highway. 
PUGSLEY 
During rush hour. 
MORTICIA 
Yes! We will survive! Poison us, strangle us, break our bones - we will come back for more. And why? 
GRANNY 
Because we like it!

MORTICIA 
Autographs. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER 
Well, what about your husband? Is he currently employed? 
MORTICIA 
He's... he's going through a bad patch at the moment. But it's not his fault. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER 
(with some bitterness) Of course not. What is he - A loafer? A hopeless layabout? A shiftless dreamer? 
MORTICIA 
(wistfully) Not anymore. The Personnel Officer shoots Morticia a doubtful glance, and begins rifling through her card file.

FESTER 
(sadly) I don't know... 
ABIGAIL 
Acapulco? Cancun? (she snaps her fingers in the air, castanet- style, trying to be festive) Ariba! Ariba!

Morticia is telling a story to a group of TODDLERS, who have gathered in a circle around her, sitting on carpet squares. The room is sunny and cheerful, with crayon drawings taped to the walls. 
MORTICIA 
... and so the witch lured Hansel and Gretel into the candy house, by promising them more sweets. And she told them to look in the oven, and she was about to push them in, when, low and behold, Hansel pushed the poor, defenseless witch into the oven instead. Where she was burned alive, writhing in agony. Now, boys and girls, what do you think that feels like? After a beat, all the toddlers begin to CRY and WAIL.

PULL BACK to the motel room. Gomez lets the phone drop. Morticia, seated on the edge of the box spring, tries to comfort him. Pugsley, Wednesday and Lurch are seated nearby, very worried about Gomez, as at a death watch. Gomez is now surrounded by junk food, and a mountain of junk food wrappers, bags and styrofoam containers. Ritually, as handmaidens, Morticia brings Gomez the remote control for the TV, and Wednesday brings him a copy of TV Guide. Pugsley brings Gomez a bag of "Doritos", and Lurch brings him a canister of "Pringles". 
Gomez uses the remote to switch channels.   An episode of "The Cosby Show" comes on. 
GOMEZ 
Re-run. He switches off the set and stares at the blank screen. 
PUGSLEY 
I don't understand. All he does is watch TV and eat. 
MORTICIA 
I know - Gomez, let's go for a drive. The whole family. 
GOMEZ 
(not even turning) A drive? And miss "Matlock"? Granny opens the door and sticks her head in. 
GRANNY 
Dinner's going to be late. She slams the door.   We hear her whistling.

ABIGAIL 
(to Gomez) That's right! Now get moving - Addams, take him to the vault. And if you're not back in one hour... (the pistol aimed at Morticia, and using her accent) I displace her. Gomez is near enough now to take Morticia's hand, on the torture wheel. 
GOMEZ 
Tish - seeing you like this.   My blood boils. 
MORTICIA 
As does mine. 
GOMEZ 
(touching the torture wheel) This wheel of pain...

Leather straps, red-hot pokers...

Later, my dearest. ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers.

Keep the book closed, Gordon - listen to mother!

I'll never listen to you - not ever again!

GOMEZ 
Well, it's their loss. I even made finger sandwiches. Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear. 
FESTER 
(petting Thing) Oh, calm down. 
PUGSLEY (O.S.) 
Here we come! 
Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down onto his feet. 
GOMEZ 
Pugsley, old man! 
MORTICIA 
(delighted) Look at you. 
PUGSLEY 
(to Uncle Fester) How do you like it? Fester is very touched; he picks Pugsley up.

FESTER 
What can I say? He's going to break hearts. 
GOMEZ 
Let's get a picture!     Lurch? 
MORTICIA 
Oh yes - in the den.

WEDNESDAY 
Children begging in the streets. 
FESTER 
I'm so glad I can share this night with my family - my real family. Now that I've got my memory back. 
MORTICIA 
That unfortunate woman. Filled with evil. (shaking her head, sadly) But not enough. 
PUGSLEY 
(to Fester) She wasn't your mother.     She just said that. 
COUSIN IT 
Ooot oot gleep. 
GOMEZ 
(to It) You remember, old sport - she really did find him tangled in a tuna net, twenty-five years ago. With amnesia. 
WEDNESDAY 
From the Bermuda Triangle. 
COUSIN IT 
Ooot oot oot. 
MORTICIA 
How true.   Stranger things have happened. 
MARGARET 
I'm sorry, and I'm not bitter, but I blame Tully. 
COUSIN IT 
Ooot blipper gleep. 
MARGARET 
(the coquette) Oh, stop. I'm blushing. 
Of course - "Wake The Dead." 
FESTER 
(delighted, to Gomez remembering this childhood favorite) "Wake The Dead"! 
GOMEZ 
(equally excited) "Wake The Dead"! Out to the cemetery! Come on, everyone! Everyone starts to exit, chattering happily. 
MARGARET 
(to Granny) I've never played this before - how does it go? 
GRANNY 
Did you bring a shovel?

PUGSLEY 
Uncle Fester, will you be on my team? 
WEDNESDAY 
No, mine! 
FESTER 
(to Wednesday) I tell you what - we'll give you a head start. Three skulls and a pelvis - how's that? Pugsley and Wednesday cheer and run out.   Fester faces Gomez. 
FESTER 
My own dear brother - who could be more precious? 
GOMEZ 
Blood is thicker than water, old man. 
MORTICIA 
(touched by the brothers devotion) And just as refreshing. Gomez offers his hand.   Fester takes it, in a manly handshake.

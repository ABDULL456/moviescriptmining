FADE IN: 
INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY 
The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas. 
A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve. 
Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes, also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser. 
LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music. She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties. 
Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit. 
LETTY Listen, Beast. What have I told you about linen? 
The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill" from the counter and checks the time against her watch. 
She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can. 
LETTY (looking at Beast) It's liver saute. 
Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can. 
LETTY 
Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But you're going to have to eat the liver tomorrow. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME 
Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME 
Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves. 
EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 
A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door. She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to turn the handle. 
Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody nose, runs up to her, bawling. 
CHANDRA Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer. 
Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door. 
LETTY (to Chandra) Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip your head back. 
She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel, staining it for all eternity. 
Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes. 
LETTY Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch it. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER 
PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and two other BOARD MEMBERS. 
Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her foot. Johansen clears his throat. 
JOHANSEN Well, I have a full calendar today, and I'm afraid... 
The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her blood-smeared lapel. 
LETTY Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry I'm late. It's very nice to meet you. 
Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending down to shake hands with Johansen and the others. 
PRINCIPAL GAIL The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave. 
LETTY I do apologize.    A student had a crisis. 
MRS. MONTES A crisis, you say? 
LETTY A bloody nose... 
There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase and reveals the stain. 
One WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth. Other DINERS follow suit. Ruth grins back and starts to giggle. 
MRS. MAYER I'm so happy for you.     It's just wonderful. 
Mrs. Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin. 
MRS. MAYER My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness. 
LETTY Wow.   Congratulations. 
Ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty. 
RUTH (to Letty) Can you believe it? 
Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse. She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and her mother, who peers at it with approval. 
MRS. MAYER Tell us every detail. 
LETTY You've only known Jake a few months. 
RUTH Three and a week. (screaming again) Isn't it great? 
MRS. MAYER My goodness. What about an engagement party? We must start planning. (signaling a waiter) Champagne. Girls, we need some champagne. 
Off Letty's frozen smile, we 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. PAUL LASCHER, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off his expensive suit. 
He opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly pressed T-shirt. He smooths out another shirt he has accidently rumpled in the process. 
PAUL So, another one bites the dust. 
LETTY It's not another one. It's my sister. (beat) Aren't you happy for her? 
PAUL She's only known the guy a few months. 
Paul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk. 
PAUL Can I put these here for tonight? 
LETTY (pointing to the closet) In there's better. (beat) It's kind of romantic, don't you think? 
PAUL I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well. 
Paul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow. 
LETTY Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter. 
PAUL The receptionist said you called earlier about something. 
Letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul. 
LETTY My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it. 
PAUL Good going. I knew you could do it. 
Paul kisses Letty on the cheek. 
PAUL It looks like we're both bucking for advancement. 
LETTY Yeah? 
PAUL Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate. 
Letty hugs Paul. 
LETTY Congratulations.    We should celebrate. 
PAUL I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark. 
LETTY I mean tonight. 
Letty sensually caresses his shoulders. 
LETTY Like right now... 
PAUL Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow? 
LETTY Oh, ok.   Maybe. 
PAUL But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across? 
LETTY (beat) Sure. Of course. 
Letty continues coloring her multiplication chart. 
Zach approaches the board and begins to write, "I am..."    He doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off. 
LETTY Neater, Zach. 
Zach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches "am." 
LETTY Zach, you know the line by the "a" has to come straight down or it looks like an "o." 
Zach looks back toward his classmates for help. 
LETTY What's wrong, Zach? 
Letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." She erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect. L LETTY Try again, Zach.    Like that. 
Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes. He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and, above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at him. 
Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good "a." 
LETTY I don't believe it.    You still can't do it. 
ZACH I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer? 
LETTY No, it's not OK. You'll never get to college on OK. 
Letty's fingers press into Zach's arm. A tear slides ominously down his cheek. 
LETTY It has to be good, Zach.   Do you understand me? 
Zach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around, unsure, confused. 
Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and looks at the children again. 
She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands. Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a deep breath and raises her head. 
LETTY I'm very, very sorry, Zach. 
Zach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste. 
LETTY You know what, guys? Wednesday's not a grammar day. It's a collage day. It's a collage ON THE WALL day. 
Letty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some paste. She motions for the students to join her. 
The children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind. 
LETTY And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be in charge of paste. 
INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Letty lies in bed. The alarm clock BLASTS opera. Letty fumbles for the switch. She can't turn it off. She yanks out the cord. L Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the second clock before it rings. She goes to the KITCHEN and snaps off the alarm, then heads down the HALLWAY and shuts that alarm off, as well. 
Letty hurries back to her BEDROOM and crawls into bed.   Paul, toweling his hair dry, walks in. 
PAUL What are you doing?    You're going to be late. 
LETTY I'm calling in sick. 
Paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead. 
PAUL You don't have a fever. 
LETTY I don't feel like going to work today. 
PAUL Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late? 
LETTY It'll be OK. 
PAUL But what about that math project? 
LETTY Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime? 
PAUL Forget I asked. 
LETTY I'm sorry. (beat) I'm just...I'm so tired lately. 
PAUL Maybe you ought to see a doctor. 
LETTY No, it's not like that. 
Letty starts to cry. 
LETTY It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. (MORE) 
LETTY(cont'd) And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner. 
PAUL You can get out of the dinner. 
LETTY No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come. 
PAUL Come on, Letty.   It'll get done. 
PAUL Letty? 
Letty stands still, fixated on the olive bottle. 
PAUL Let?       L LETTY Olives Aux Herbes De Provence.    I got the wrong kind of olives. 
Ruth holds up a glass. 
RUTH What's all the dreck? 
LETTY Sage, rosemary... (in a sarcastic French accent) Les Herbes. 
RUTH It'll be fine. 
LETTY No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate. 
Jake enters.   The three turn on him. 
LETTY/PAUL/RUTH You can't leave them alone./Get back in there./Are you nuts? 
Jake whirls around and exits. 
Letty looks for olives, banging open the cupboards one after the other. Quicker and quicker. More and more frantic. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Jake, Mr. Mayer, Monica and Mrs. Mayer stare at each other, listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the kitchen. 
JAKE What do you think of those Lakers? 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
Letty paws through her purse. 
PAUL What are you doing? 
LETTY (wild-eyed) Can you loan me a 20? 
PAUL Sure. Why? 
LETTY I'm going to the store. 
PAUL I think you're overreacting. 
Letty turns her best school marm look on Paul. He hands over a crisp bill. 
RUTH Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle... 
LETTY I'll be back before you can say souffle. 
Letty leaves from the kitchen's back door. Ruth heads to the living room. Paul leans wearily against the counter, savoring one of the herb-filled martinis. 
INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT 
Fluorescent lights beat down on Letty. She races through the aisles. She clutches her keys in one hand, a $20 bill in the other. Letty careens around a corner. At the last second, she avoids smacking into another shopper. She stops. L LETTY'S POV: 
Shelf after shelf of olives...black olives...all black. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
Letty darts up and down the aisle, searching, searching. Nothing. 
Letty scurries to the front of the store. She taps a STORE CLERK on the shoulder. Six people waiting in line mutter, annoyed. 
LETTY I can't find martini olives.     All you have are black. 
STORE CLERK (without looking up) Aisle 2A. 
Letty whips down an aisle.    She starts to sweat. 
An OLD LADY blocks her path. 
OLD LADY Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the cat food. 
Letty pauses.    She reaches up and hands the woman a can of food. 
OLD LADY And a turkey and giblets, too, please. She does like her turkey. 
Letty grabs another can, throws it in the Old Lady's cart and darts away while the Old Lady continues to talk. 
LETTY'S POV: 
The sign for Aisle 2A.    Olives.   Lots of them.   Green.   All shapes. All sizes. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
Letty's shoulders relax.    She scans the shelf. 
LETTY's POV: 
Letty pulls herself up to a sitting position. 
MICHAEL Do you mind if I call you Letitia? 
LETTY Letty. 
MICHAEL (consulting his notes) First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are? 
LETTY I answered these questions last night. 
MICHAEL I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night. 
LETTY Hillview Psychiatric Hospital. 
MICHAEL Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to remember three items. I'm going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes. They are chair, cup and ball. Did you get that? 
Letty nods. 
MICHAEL OK, let's subtract 6 from a succession of numbers starting with 
LETTY 
MICHAEL And 85 minus 6? 
LETTY 
Michael waits. 
LETTY No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous. 
MICHAEL It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing. L Letty smiles uncomfortably. 
MICHAEL Now the three things I asked you to remember. 
LETTY Chair, cup and ball. 
MICHAEL Terrific. 
Letty smiles, a real smile this time. 
MICHAEL Let me shift gears here a minute... (beat) Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't? 
LETTY No. 
MICHAEL What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again? 
Letty shakes her head "no." 
MICHAEL How about arranging your possessions in a certain way? 
Letty pauses. 
MICHAEL Yes?   Go right ahead. 
LETTY Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear. 
Michael leans closer. 
MICHAEL How do you sort it--by lace and cotton? 
LETTY By color. 
MICHAEL What if it's got a pattern? 
LETTY Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem. 
MICHAEL I see. (looking at his notes) How long has it been since you've done something you've enjoyed, Letty? 
LETTY (beat) A while, I guess. 
MICHAEL That must be really difficult. 
Letty tears up.   Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm. 
MICHAEL Hey, it'll be OK.   We'll make sure of that. 
Letty gives him an appreciative look. 
MICHAEL For now, why don't you just take it easy while I confer with my colleagues. A nurse should be in shortly. 
INT. LETTY'S ROOM - LATER 
Letty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed. She writes in her organizer. DR. ROBERT EMLEE, early 40s and in jeans, enters with his own organizer. 
DR. EMLEE Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you... 
LETTY I did this already. 
DR. EMLEE It's hospital policy... 
INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Letty lags behind NURSE GATES, early 30s and in civilian clothes, as they walk down the hall. 
NURSE GATES Treatment schedules are posted on the bulletin board. Dinner at 6, lights out at 10 and no fraternizing between patients. 
Letty nods. 
NURSE GATES (pointing as she goes) That's the rec room. We show movies there on Wednesdays and Fridays...And this is the dining hall. 
Letty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room, an upscale version of a college cafeteria. Groups of people eat and talk. A paper airplane sails from one table to another. 
LETTY I'm really not that hungry. 
NURSE GATES Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people. 
LETTY You know, my mom's coming to get me tomorrow. I'll be leaving. 
NURSE GATES It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here with you. 
INT. DINING HALL - SAME 
Nurse Gates guides Letty to a table where John, Mrs. Hallstrom, Marie and Thomas sit. 
THOMAS So I said to my publisher this afternoon, I said, don't you even-- 
NURSE GATES (interrupts) Hi, gang. I want to introduce you to Letty. (to Letty) Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and Marie, and John and Thomas. 
THOMAS (to Letty) Just discussing my pesky publisher. May I ask what you do when you're not vacationing? 
MARIE (to Thomas) Let the poor girl get some food, for Heaven's sake. 
LETTY I'm a teacher. 
THOMAS As you may have gathered, I'm a writer. 
John snorts. Thomas ignores him.   Mrs. Hallstrom stares down at her plate. 
THOMAS I don't like to say novelist. That sounds a little grandiose, but I am on my third novel and... 
NURSE GATES Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas, but we really should get some food... 
Nurse Gates leads Letty to a table, and hands her a plate. Letty looks up to see Michael at the other end of the table, doing a card trick for two OTHER PATIENTS. 
MICHAEL (to patients) Now I'm going to say that the card you picked was the Ace of Spades. 
He flips the top card up and it's the Ace of Spades.       The patients chortle. 
NURSE GATES Michael. 
Michael turns toward the nurse. 
NURSE GATES Michael, this is Letty.      She just arrived yesterday. 
Letty stares at Michael coldly. 
LETTY We've met. (to Michael) I missed you during rounds this morning. 
Letty turns and leaves, carrying her empty plate with her. 
NURSE GATES (to Michael) This doctor thing has got to stop. 
Nurses Gates hurries after Letty. 
EXT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Letty stands outside the waiting room door.       She tucks her blouse into her jeans and enters. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Letty's mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that looks much like the library of an English country manor. She springs up as soon as she spots Letty. They rush to each other. Letty's mother strokes her hair. M RS. MAYER I'm here, Sweetheart.      I'm here. It's going to be OK. 
LETTY I'm sorry.     I'm so sorry. 
MRS. MAYER Oh, Letty, what happened? 
LETTY Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... (MORE) 
LETTY(cont'd) They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened. 
MRS. MAYER I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says... 
LETTY I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors... 
MRS. MAYER Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing. 
LETTY I just want to go home.   Can we go home now? 
MRS. MAYER I think the best thing for you right now is to stay here and get well. 
PATIENTS Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael. 
MICHAEL Oh, no, you're perfectly sane. That's why you're here. 
Letty looks like she's been slapped. She thinks for a moment. The patients wait, breathless, for her retort. 
LETTY Go fuck yourself. 
Michael grins at Letty. She turns, and strides down the hall. There's a smattering of applause. It grows stronger. 
We see Letty's eyes fill with tears as, behind her, the patients yell. 
PATIENTS Bravo./Encore./Re-match. 
INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Letty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns. She gets out of bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself together. She slumps to the floor and starts to cry. 
INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY D r. Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding chairs. Michael, who sits next to Emlee, practices rolling a quarter back and forth across his fingers. 
Letty sits across from Michael and Emlee, her legs and arms crossed tightly. The group concentrates on Mrs. Hallstrom. 
MRS. HALLSTROM I can't stop thinking about the things I did wrong when my daughter was little. 
DR. EMLEE And how's that make you feel? 
MRS. HALLSTROM I just feel like sleeping.    All the time. 
THOMAS Hell's bells, you can count me in on that. I haven't had enough Z's since I ran those sleep disorder experiments at Stanford back in the 70s. 
MARIE We really miss doing things with you, Mrs. Hallstrom. 
Michael, sitting next to Mrs. Hallstrom, squeezes her arm. 
MRS. HALLSTROM Maybe when I hit my manic phase again. 
Group members smile. 
JOHN I've noticed Letty doesn't much like to do things with us. 
The group looks expectantly at Letty. 
LETTY Oh, no. Of course I do. 
JOHN Then why are you so defensive? 
MICHAEL (to John) I don't think we need to sacrifice Letty to pep up a slow session. 
JOHN (to Michael) You're the one who told everyone about her panties. 
Michael grimaces at John.   Letty's head is bent down. 
DR. EMLEE Maybe you'd like to share some of your feelings about OCD or depression with us, Letty. 
Letty eyes the doctor.   She's dangerously close to tears. 
LETTY Do we have to talk about this? 
DR. EMLEE I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others. 
Michael reaches his hand behind Dr. Emlee's head, catching Letty's eye in the process. Michael pulls a silver dollar out of Emlee's ear. 
Letty looks but doesn't respond. The other patients ignore Michael. Emlee is oblivious. 
DR. EMLEE You never know, Letty, how the person sitting next to you may be able to shed light on one of your problems... 
Michael goes for a bigger trick. Reaching again behind the doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers. Letty, almost against her will, smiles. 
DR. EMLEE ...by revealing something that's going on in his or her own life. 
Michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's head. Letty's smile broadens. 
DR. EMLEE (responding to her smile) There, now, I knew you'd feel better once we discussed group process. Let's talk a little about your OCD. 
INT. LIBRARY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Letty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks. Michael turns the corner, thumbing through a dog-eared book. Letty spots him and moves away. Michael sidles up next to her. M ICHAEL Looking for a romance? 
LETTY Excuse me? 
MICHAEL What are you looking to read? 
LETTY Anything interesting. 
Michael holds out his book to her. 
MICHAEL This is good. 
Letty glances at the title, "101 MAGIC TRICKS." 
PAUL I just wish we'd done it sooner. 
Paul takes Letty's hand in his. 
PAUL Will you marry me? 
Paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on Letty's finger. She stares at it, mesmerized. 
PAUL I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry. 
LETTY (by rote) Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients. 
PAUL I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines. (beat) L Letty? 
LETTY It's, it's really nice, Paul. 
PAUL You can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want. 
LETTY No, you've done a perfect job. 
PAUL So, what do you say, Let? 
Letty looks him in the eyes for the first time. 
LETTY Do you think, really, that it's OK to get engaged when I'm in here? 
PAUL Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind. 
LETTY No, no. 
PAUL So will you? 
LETTY (working up a smile) Of course. Yes. I will.     I do. 
Paul and Letty kiss, then hug. 
EXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - LATER 
It's completely dark. Letty sits in the same position we saw her in hours ago. Michael walks up to her. 
MICHAEL You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner. 
LETTY I wasn't hungry. 
MICHAEL John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk. 
LETTY (smiling) Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night. 
MICHAEL Was it bad news--the visit from Peter? 
LETTY Paul. 
MICHAEL He looked pretty serious. 
LETTY He asked me to marry him. 
MICHAEL Very romantic setting. 
LETTY It was romantic.   He's very romantic. 
MICHAEL So are you engaged, or what? 
Letty holds out her hand, where the diamond glistens. Michael bends forward to look at the ring, caressing her hand as he does so. 
Letty pulls away. The ring is gone. 
LETTY What have you done with the ring? 
MICHAEL It's magic. 
Letty stands up. 
LETTY This isn't funny.   Paul would kill me. 
Michael holds his hands in fists toward Letty. 
MICHAEL Guess which hand. 
LETTY Enough with the abracadabra. 
MICHAEL Guess. 
LETTY T he left one. 
Michael opens his hand.   It's empty.   Michael addresses an imaginary audience. 
MICHAEL (to audience) The fair maiden guesses incorrectly. Should we give her one more try? (to Letty) The audience says one more try. What guess you now? 
LETTY The right one. 
Mrs. Hallstrom gives an eraser to the nurse. 
NURSE GATES Come on. Come with me, Mrs. Hallstrom. 
Nurse Gates leads Mrs. Hallstrom away as the older woman continues tossing erasers down the hall. 
Marie stares at Michael's shorts. 
MARIE Hot boxers. 
Michael smiles awkwardly at Letty. She returns to her room. 
INT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME 
Letty climbs into bed. She opens the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Tiffany's ring box. There, cradled in the satin lining, is the diamond from Paul. Right beside it is Michael's Cracker Jack special. L Letty puts on Paul's ring. She studies her hand. With an air of secrecy, she slips on Michael's ring. She quickly takes it off. Wearing Paul's ring, she turns off the light and snuggles into bed. 
EXT. GARDEN, HILLV IEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned hedges and tea roses. Letty and Ruth power-walk down a cobblestone path, heading away from the English Tudor hospital that looms large in the background. 
Letty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the University of South Carolina Cocks. 
LETTY I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt. 
RUTH Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here. 
LETTY That settles it. I'm never leaving. 
RUTH I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster. 
LETTY You're slowing. 
RUTH (picking up the pace) Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white. 
Letty checks her stop watch. 
RUTH What do you think? 
LETTY Ecru. 
RUTH And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print? 
Letty completely stops and faces Ruth. 
LETTY Do we have to talk wedding details? 
RUTH Oh, no, of course not. 
LETTY I mean, you can always send me fabric samples to look at or pictures of dresses. But, it's been so long since we've seen each other. 
RUTH Of course. You're right. Besides, we should be talking about your engagement. 
They start walking again. 
LETTY Tell me more about Beast beating up that other cat. 
RUTH Bloody furry mess, like I said. (beat) Aren't you so excited about Paul? beat) Letty? 
Ruth stops this time. 
RUTH What's going on with you, Letty? 
LETTY Ruthie, do you ever wonder if you'll meet someone else...someone besides Jake? 
Power walking's forgotten.   Ruth and Letty start to amble. 
RUTH What's his name, Letty? 
LETTY I didn't say... 
RUTH Don't even try.    What's his name? 
INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Nurse Gates passes by the open door, and pokes her head in. 
NURSE GATES Lights out, Letty. 
Letty closes the door. She pulls a nightshirt from a drawer, disrupting a perfectly-folded T-shirt. Letty bends down to straighten it, but changes her mind. She shuts the drawer. 
Letty puts on the nightshirt, crawls into bed and snaps off the light. She fluffs her pillow, and turns over. She rolls back. 
Letty turns on the light. She goes to the drawer, opens it, pulls out the T-shirt and refolds it. She shuts the drawer. Letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork. 
It's a fight with the drawer. Opened and closed. Until Letty takes a deep breath, pulls it open a final time, hesitantly ruffles the T-shirt and slams the drawer shut. 
She runs to bed and hops in, turning off the light and burying her head under the pillow. 
A few moments pass. 
NURSE GATES It's OK.   It's good to let it out. 
Michael passes the open door with the pizza box and points down the hall. Letty stares right through him. 
NURSE GATES Did you ever tell Paul how you felt? 
LETTY He was graduating from law school, and he just assumed I was OK with dropping out. (beat) We never really talked about it. But I know he was disappointed in me. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LINEN CLOSET - LATER 
The roomy closet houses an inconceivable number of white sheets and towels, arranged on wide, tall shelves. 
The pizza, cokes and a candle sit in the middle of the floor, which Michael has draped with a sheet. Michael stares at the dwindling candle.                                  C UT TO: 
INT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME 
LETTY I mean I'm just not sure I want the same things now that I did even a month ago. 
Nurse Gates nods sympathetically. 
LETTY Is that so wrong? 
Michael passes the open door again, waving his hands wildly to attract Letty's attention. She doesn't notice him. 
NURSE GATES You can only do what feels best to you now. 
LETTY I guess so. I think that's right. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LINEN CLOSET - SAME 
Michael blows out the candle. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME 
Letty blows her nose as she walks Nurse Gates to the door. 
LETTY You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things. 
NURSE GATES I'm glad. 
LETTY And if I need to talk again... 
NURSE GATES Yes, of course. Whenever you want. 
Letty gives Nurse Gates a hug. 
INT. LINEN CLOSET - SAME 
TAPS on the door. Michael looks up. He jumps to his feet and lets Letty in, gesturing for her to sit. They lean against a stack of pillows. 
LETTY Sorry I'm late... 
Michael puts his finger to Letty's lips. 
MICHAEL Shhh. 
A SERIES OF SHOTS THAT FADE INTO EACH OTHER: 
A.) The two munch on pizza. Michael picks off black olives and hands them to Letty, who plops them on top of her pizza. 
B.) Michael hands Letty a cigarette. She gestures no.       He lights one for himself and begins blowing smoke rings. 
C.) Michael offers Letty pizza.     She clutches her stomach to show that she's full. 
D.) Letty indicates she wants a cigarette. Michael demonstrates how to smoke, affecting the style of a 1930s movie star. Letty follows suit. E .) Letty grabs a pillow and hits Michael over the head. He pulls the pillow away from her. Letty stands up, grabs another pillow and hits Michael again. He whacks her in the back of the knees and she falls on top of him. 
Enough of the fighting.    They kiss.   Michael strokes the back of Letty's neck. 
FOOTSTEPS approach the door and stop. Michael and Letty stop kissing and look at the door. The FOOTSTEPS continue on. 
Michael pulls Letty's shirt up. She starts to pull it over her head, but can't get it all the way off in the cramped space. Michael kisses Letty's mouth through the shirt. She GIGGLES. Michael helps Letty off with the shirt. 
He kisses her chest.    Letty bites him lightly on the shoulder. 
Michael pulls away in surprise, grinning. Letty reaches up and bites him again. Michael bites her back. 
Letty reaches her hands behind her head, searching for something to hold onto. She grabs a stack of sheets, which topple onto Michael. 
Michael sits up, trying to clear the sheets off himself and Letty. Letty pushes him down and crawls on top of him. 
CLOSE ON her hands as they unbutton Michael's Levis, and we 
FADE OUT 
LETTY Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions. 
MICHAEL Fuck.    That's all true. 
Letty laughs. 
MICHAEL Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes. 
LETTY What are the delusions like? 
MICHAEL I think people are after me, crap like that. (beat) (MORE) 
MICHAEL(cont'd) When I was 18, my mom came home and found me sitting naked on the kitchen table. I thought I was God. 
He waits for Letty to register the information. 
MICHAEL Shocking, huh? 
LETTY Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store. 
MICHAEL I wish I could have seen that. 
LETTY I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent. 
MICHAEL M y Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light. (beat) But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones. 
Lying on their backs, Michael and Letty stare up at the leaves overhead. 
MICHAEL (with a start) Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up. 
LETTY Break up?    They wish. 
Michael and Letty hug. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Nurse Gates pours tablets from a potpourri of pill bottles into little paper cups. A Federal Express delivery man with a bunch of boxes stops at the station. 
DELIVERY MAN I need a signature, please. 
Nurse Gates looks at the form. 
NURSE GATES What is all this stuff? 
DELIVERY MAN I just deliver it, Ma'am. 
NURSE GATES Well, who exactly is it for? 
DELIVERY MAN A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom. 
NURSE GATES I see. Can you wait a moment? 
Nurse Gates locks the medication in a cupboard, and hurries down the hallway. 
INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - SAME 
Our usual cast of characters. 
DR. EMLEE But how does that make you feel, John, what Letty said about your hostility? 
JOHN She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. 
Nurse Gates barrels in.   The group looks up. 
NURSE GATES I'm sorry, Doctor. I just need a moment with Mrs. Hallstrom. 
DR. EMLEE What seems to be the problem? 
NURSE GATES They say she ordered...Mrs. Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of stuff, because Federal Express... M rs. Hallstrom's face glows. 
MRS. HALLSTROM It's here, everyone. Come along. It's here. 
She runs out. Nurse Gates follows her. A moment passes.    The patients look expectantly at Dr. Emlee. 
DR. EMLEE Oh, fine, let's see. 
They storm the door. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - SAME 
By the time the patients round the corner, the Federal Express man is leaving, and Mrs. Hallstrom has ripped open one of the boxes. She clutches a handful of jewelry. 
MRS. HALLSTROM For you, John. And, Letty. And, Michael, I know you'll love these. 
She hands Michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings. He clips them on. Letty and several others carry necklaces. Thomas sports a rhinestone tiara. The patients compare jewelry. 
DR. EMLEE Mrs. Hallstrom, you ordered all this? 
JOHN (to Mrs. Hallstrom) Thomas got a crown and all I got was a lousy bracelet? 
Thomas, who sits across the room, looks up from his book. 
MRS. MAYER (whispering) I'm only looking out for you. 
LETTY (yelling) And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke. 
Letty races out the door and into the garden. In the distance, Michael spots her and jogs over. Letty's mother watches them. Thomas approaches Mrs. Mayer. 
THOMAS Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I couldn't help overhearing. I just wanted to say, not that it's any of my business... 
MRS. MAYER Yes? 
THOMAS I think, really, I think I'd go with the cream damask. I NT. REC ROOM - LATER 
Letty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining hall. Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits where we last saw her. 
NURSE GATES It's OK to be upset. 
MRS. HALLSTROM (gaily) Upset? Why of course not. My goodness, no. I'm sure she just got hung up. 
Letty and Michael stop. 
MICHAEL Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa. 
MRS. HALLSTROM That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do. 
LETTY If you change your mind, we'll be in the dining hall. 
Michael and Letty walk on, exchanging a sad look. 
INT. DINING HALL - LATER 
Mr. Santucci and Mrs. Santucci sit at the heads of the table. Letty sits between Rosa and Michael. 
ROSA (to Letty) What do you need now? (to Mr. Santucci) Send down the lamb. This girl's as thin as a stick. 
LETTY Oh, no.   I'm stuffed. 
ROSA Tell her to eat, Frank. 
MR. SANTUCCI Mangia.   Mangia. 
MICHAEL (whispering to Letty) You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's lamb. 
ROSA Or my eggplant. I make the best eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I use, it's so fresh it sweats. 
Letty heaps more food on her plate. 
MRS. SANTUCCI Michael says you're a teacher. 
LETTY I was. I'm hoping I'll still have a job when I get out. 
Mrs. Hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her Christmas stocking cap. She starts to dispense erasers. 
LETTY What's she doing? 
Mrs. Hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on Grandma Rosa. She hands Rosa the gift meant for her daughter. 
MRS. HALLSTROM Rosa, Rosa, you must have this, Rosa. 
ROSA Grazie. 
MICHAEL Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please. 
But, by this point, Mrs. Hallstrom's already bounded away, divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered parents and delighted children. 
She clambers onto a table in the middle of the room. Marie gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help. 
MRS. HALLSTROM Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho, ho, ho. 
LETTY Michael, we've got to stop her. 
Michael pushes back his chair.   He's trapped between the table and the wall. 
MRS. HALLSTROM My goodness, it's so very warm in here. So warm. 
She takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking man. But she doesn't stop there. With haphazard abandon, she begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt. 
MRS. HALLSTROM Way, way, way too warm for December. Now, let's sing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way... 
The group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior. Then, almost as one, the patients spring into action. 
Michael bolts over his dining table and runs to Mrs. Hallstrom. He jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her. 
By this time, John, Thomas and Letty have surrounded her in a protective enclave. Michael sets Mrs. Hallstrom on the ground. She looks up at the group, and continues belting out I "Jingle Bells." 
NT. LINEN CLOSET - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Letty and Michael lie on the floor next to each other, trading puffs on a cigarette. The glowing ember is the only light in the room. 
JUDGE MILTON Where will you live upon release? 
JOHN Live? 
John's mother nods encouragingly at him. 
JUDGE MILTON Where do you plan to reside, Mr. Lockyer? 
JOHN With my mother. 
JUDGE MILTON Is your mother here today? 
John points to her.   John's mother waves at the judge. 
JOHN That's the bitch. That cock- sucking bitch. She put me here. She did. She's the Satan that did this all. 
As bailiffs remove John from the stand, Michael offers a wan smile to his family. 
INT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER 
Michael, outwardly poised and collected, sits on the stand. His hands are clenched in tight fists. 
JUDGE MILTON The records indicate no major episodes in the past four months. And it seems you have the support of the staff. 
MICHAEL Yes, Sir. 
JUDGE MILTON But I see you've been in and out of the hospital more than ten times. 
MICHAEL Eleven, Your Honor.   But I'm on a new medication now. 
JUDGE MILTON Do you feel ready to re-enter the world? 
MICHAEL Yes, Sir. My family is    prepared to support me until I find   a job. They've already located   an apartment for me that's   very near them. 
JUDGE MILTON Very well, then. By order of the court, you are released. I wish you good luck. 
Michael's shoulders relax. He opens his fist. Inside is the Cracker Jack ring, and the magenta circle it has imprinted on his palm. 
EXT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER 
Michael walks to the car with his mother, father and grandmother, who keeps tousling his hair with pride. 
INT. VISITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Letty stands awkwardly in front of Paul, who sits in a wingback chair. 
PAUL What's so urgent?   You've got me worried. 
LETTY I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how. 
Paul stands. 
PAUL You can tell me anything. (beat) Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure? 
LETTY No... 
PAUL That's a load off my mind. 
LETTY Paul, I want to break off the engagement. P AUL You what? 
LETTY I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you. 
PAUL Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems. 
LETTY I've met someone else. 
PAUL Who? 
LETTY It doesn't matter who. 
PAUL Have you been seeing another teacher? 
LETTY No. 
PAUL It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin. 
LETTY He's a patient here. 
Paul considers this a moment. 
PAUL Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking? 
LETTY I love him. 
PAUL You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love? 
LETTY Here's the ring. 
PAUL No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses. 
MARIE I'll put in 5 that it's a straight diagnosis of depressive personality. 
LETTY Are you kidding? With those glazed eyes? I'm willing to bet 10 there was some break with reality going on there. Psychosis. Without a doubt, psychosis. 
INT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Letty is curled up in a chair opposite Dr. Emlee. 
LETTY But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work. 
DR. EMLEE Have you been in contact with the principal about your job? 
LETTY I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out. 
DR. EMLEE Then, you should call. 
LETTY What? 
DR. EMLEE I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well. 
LETTY Are you saying I'm through with therapy? 
DR. EMLEE Let's not be hasty. (beat) I'm saying we should plan a release date for early next week. 
Off Letty's excited face, we 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TARGET - DAY 
Crowds, crowds and more crowds. Michael pulls unsuccessfully at a shopping cart that is stuck to another. 
A MATRONLY WOMAN walks up, nudges Michael out of the way and yanks the cart out of its row. She rolls it toward Michael, grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store. M ichael takes several deep breaths. With trepidation in his step, he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store... 
EXT. TARGET - 30 MINUTES LATER 
Michael emerges from the store, quite pleased with himself that he made it out alive. He commands a cart heaped full of useless gadgets and trinkets, a half dozen picture frames and about 20 decorative pillows. 
EXT. GROUNDS - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Letty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens. 
MRS. MAYER Must you walk so quickly? 
LETTY It's good exercise, Mom. 
MRS. MAYER I've got 26 years on you. If we could just slow down, we could talk so much easier. 
Letty slackens her pace. 
MRS. MAYER I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will. 
LETTY I've already made arrangements. 
MRS. MAYER Ruthie mentioned that Michael might be coming for you. 
Letty stops and wags her finger at her mother. 
LETTY Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael. 
MRS. MAYER Not even if it's something positive? 
LETTY Nyet.   That's the condition. 
Mother and daughter keep walking in silence. 
MRS. MAYER Have you spoken to Paul at all? 
LETTY One more and you're out. 
MRS. MAYER Honestly, Letty. 
LETTY A deal's a deal. 
The two walk on in silence. 
Silence. 
More silence. 
MRS. MAYER Have you heard the figure on how much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay in taxes this year? 
Letty stops walking. She turns a sunny smile on her mother, then hugs her.      L LETTY I knew you had it in you. 
INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Letty neatly folds garments and lays them in a suitcase.    Dr. Emlee looks on. 
DR. EMLEE So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me. 
LETTY I love your apartment. 
MICHAEL Really? 
LETTY You'll never get rid of me. 
Michael kisses Letty on the lips. 
LETTY What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate? 
MICHAEL Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here. 
Off Letty's look of surprise, we watch Michael open a cupboard door. The shelves are filled from top to bottom with cans of Spaghetti-O's. 
Letty squeezes Michael in a bear hug. 
INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Letty, in a T-shirt, and Michael, in boxers, lounge on the futon. They watch both TVs -- one tuned-in to Jay Leno, the other to David Letterman. 
Michael eats from a can of Spaghetti-O's. Letty reaches over with her fork and snags a mouthful from Michael's can. 
LETTY How can you not like the Top 10 List? 
MICHAEL I like it.     But Headlines are better. 
LETTY You're so wrong. 
Letty takes her remote and increases the volume on her TV. As Letterman gets louder, Michael zaps his volume. 
It's a war. Letterman then Leno get LOUDER and LOUDER and LOUDER until Letty makes a might lunge. She wrests Michael's remote from him. Letty MUTES both TVs. 
MICHAEL Hey. 
LETTY It's sex time. 
Michael mockingly checks his watch.    Letty climbs on top of him. Michael rolls on top of her. 
MICHAEL I think it's my turn. 
CLOSE on their faces as Michael gently licks the side of Letty's mouth. 
LETTY Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face? 
MICHAEL No. 
Michael licks Letty's nose. 
LETTY Michael. 
MICHAEL Shhhh. 
Michael and Letty look into each other's eyes, bathed in the blue light thrown off by the twin televisions. 
Michael places a pillow gently beneath Letty's head.    He caresses her face. 
Letty's eyes are alive to every look, every touch. Michael kisses her slowly on the forehead, the nose, and the lips. 
CLOSE on Letty's hands as she reaches up to stroke Michael's forehead and caress his temple. 
CLOSER on her hands as Letty runs them through Michael's hair, then twists a curly lock around her finger. 
SOFT MOANS as we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
CLOSE on Letty's hand, resting on the comforter on Michael's bed. The alarm clock RINGS. Letty's hand slaps it into submission. 
INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Letty's still in bed, a look of bliss across her face. 
MICHAEL Letty?   Rise and shine. 
LETTY'S POV: 
Michael's face fills her vision. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
Letty's eyes close. 
LETTY Not yet. 
MICHAEL I'll be forced to tickle you. 
Letty opens one eye and glares at him. L LETTY Go away. 
Michael heads toward the D.J. and confers with him.    Mr. Mayer walks up to Letty. 
MR. MAYER It's good to see you so happy. 
LETTY Thanks, dad. 
Michael then walks back to Letty and pulls her out onto the dance floor as "Twist and Shout" BOOMS OUT from the speakers. 
Letty's mother departs the dance floor, grimacing. Ruth shoots Michael a look of pure pleasure. And everyone begins twisting, as we 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Completely dark.   Silent. 
Letty, in a nightshirt, wanders in, and stumbles through the room. She fumbles for the switch on the floor lamp. 
The light comes on, illuminating a small circle.    Just outside of it sits Michael. H e stares straight ahead.    Letty kneels down in front of him. 
LETTY Michael? (beat) Michael? You should come to bed. 
Michael remains focused on the space directly in front of him. 
LETTY Did you take the aspirin and water? You don't want to feel awful in the morning. (beat) I'll get you some. 
Letty begins to stand up. The movement breaks Michael's trance. He pulls her back down. 
LETTY What is it? Are you OK? 
MICHAEL (strangely calm) Always the drugs. 
LETTY What? 
MICHAEL I saw you talking to my Mom. 
LETTY We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad. 
MICHAEL Why'd you tell her I wasn't taking my meds? 
LETTY What do you mean not taking your meds? 
MICHAEL Why'd you tell? 
LETTY I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly. 
Michael beats his hand on the floor. 
MICHAEL Silly?   Silly am I? 
LETTY Michael, take it easy. 
MICHAEL Silly, silly, silly. 
LETTY I think I should call someone. 
Michael reaches out, grabs the floor lamp, and pushes it over. He lurches to his feet and pulls Letty to a standing position. 
MICHAEL (screaming) Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom. 
LETTY Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK. 
Michael knocks some flowers over, then rips apart a pillow. 
Letty hovers in back of him.     He pauses.   She puts her hand on his back. 
Michael whirls around.   He slaps Letty's hand away. She stumbles backward. 
LETTY Michael, stop. 
He stares in her direction, but he doesn't respond.      Letty can't make a connection. 
Michael shoves his fist through a window. 
Letty grabs the phone. 
MICHAEL Not my Mom. Not my silly silly Mom. 
Letty runs with the phone. Michael follows her. Letty trips. She rights herself. She locks herself in the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM, MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME M ichael POUNDS on the bathroom door.     Letty dials 9-1-1. 
LETTY I've got an emergency.    I'm at... 
Michael HOWLS -- a long, piercing inhuman sound. 
LETTY 1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2. My boyfriend's out of control. 
On the other side of the door, Michael SCREAMS.    Another window SHATTERS. 
LETTY Michael.   Yes. 
PAUL I just wondered, well, if this meant there was a chance for us. Because I think about you a lot, and I still feel... 
LETTY Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over. (beat) And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things. 
PAUL I think I've heard this speech before. 
LETTY I'm really sorry. 
Letty reaches up to hug him.    He quickly disengages himself. P AUL I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind... 
LETTY Sure, I understand. 
Paul starts down the path. 
LETTY Wait. Wait. 
Letty runs up to Paul. 
LETTY I need to give you this. 
Letty hands Paul the engagement ring. He takes it and continues walking as she stares after him. 
EXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Letty walks up the steps to the imposing facility. We follow her journey through the VISITING ROOM, past families conversing with patients, to the NURSES' STATION. 
Letty walks up to Nurse Gates, who gives her a quick hug. John and Bill watch as Letty signs the visitors' register. 
NURSE GATES He's in Jamie's old room. 
Letty walks down the HALLWAY and pauses outside Michael's door. She KNOCKS. 
MICHAEL (OS) Come in. 
INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME 
Michael is in the middle of taping up the same Houdini poster we saw in his last room when Letty enters. 
LETTY Hi. 
MICHAEL Hey. 
Letty and Michael kiss awkwardly.    Dead silence. 
LETTY/MICHAEL (TOGETHER) How are you? 
They smile nervously. 
LETTY I guess we need to talk. 
MICHAEL I guess so. 
LETTY It's hard to know where to start. 
MICHAEL Pretend like I'm your shrink. 
Letty rolls her eyes. 
MICHAEL Sorry.   I'll be quiet. 
LETTY I think about you all the time. 
MICHAEL I sure know what that feels like. 
LETTY And all the plans we have. 
MICHAEL Yeah, the plans. 
Letty looks out the window. 
LETTY I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see... 
MICHAEL Letty, please. L LETTY What? 
MICHAEL Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me. 
LETTY Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications. 
MICHAEL But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that. 
LETTY Well then why'd it happen? 
MICHAEL I don't know. I don't fucking know. 
Letty and Michael glare at each other.    Letty looks away. 
LETTY I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.

Some   of   them   want   to   use you Some   of   them   want   to   get used by you Some   of   them   want   to   abuse you Some   of   them   want   to   be abused

Some years from this exact moment... 
1   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  1 
DARKNESS - NOW 
The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face. 
They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel- eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL. 
ZERO IN on TWO: KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes burning with internalized emotion... 
... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell - both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around. 
Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their swagger seems to mask FEAR. 
KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell.   The GIRL makes eye contact w/ him. 
SANDRA Sandra. 
KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic. 
SANDRA (cont'd) My name is Sandra. 
GUARD Shut the fuck up. 
Because he can, the GUARD takes a swing at KABLE'S head with a BILLY CLUB... CRACK!

KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach. 
SANDRA (to the GUARD, a snarl) Putcher dick away... 
GUARD Get some. 
CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!!     SANDRA is buckled over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat, head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints, every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART... He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle herself. 
The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN - growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting out all thought... until... 
2   INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY                                                    2 
POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL towards dirty white DAYLIGHT... 
NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound of his boots bouncing off the concrete... 
Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke, sky... 
Our POV WHITES OUT as we... 
3   EXT. SPAWN POINT #1 - CONTINUOUS                                        3 
... smash into the DAYLIGHT. 
Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers disappear into the grey mist. 
4   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                            4 
KABLE emerges from the smoke into...

... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella 
In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE - accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin, then snap into place. GO TIME. 
5   OTHER SPAWN POINTS                                                  5 
Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out. 
6   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                             6 
What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head. 
7   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER                                     7 
Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's QUICK... 
A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH. 
He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN. 
12   INT. SAVE POINT #1                                                12 
KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING DOWN. 
The battle is over - session complete. 
13   EXT. SAVE POINT #1                                                13 
KABLE steps out.    The LEDS on his weapon blink off in sequence... 
ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's. 
[I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage. 
GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by participating to commute their sentences] 
A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from him. 
HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON, POINTS IT AT A GUARD'S HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER -

NOTHING. The GUARD doesn't even flinch. The WEAPON is DEAD, dormant; they all knew it. 
The GUARDS have a good LAUGH... KABLE is CLUBBED from behind - we... 
FADE TO BLACK. 
14   INT. TRAIN - LATER                                                        14 
Back on the rattling TRAIN, where we started. The SURVIVING SOLDIERS - both BROWN and BLUE - are shackled to the rail - wounded, exhausted, hollow eyed. 
BLUE SOLDIER 1 Good run, Kable. 
KABLE only looks to the floor. 
KABLE (quietly) My name's Tillman. 
BROWN SOLDIER 1 Whatever your name is. You got to the save point fast. 
BROWN SOLDIER 2 So the fuck what? No one's getting out of here alive. 
BLUE SOLDIER 1 I am.   I'm going to make it. 
The cynical BROWN just shakes his head. 
BROWN SOLDIER 2 Sure you will. 
BLUE SOLDIER 1 (tuning the BROWN out, turning his attention to KABLE) They say you only got three battles left til you get out... 
KABLE says nothing. 
The CAMERA pushes in on a TATTOO on his forearm: a simple outline of a black box with the words inside: I AM RIGHT HERE WITH YOU. 
[MUSIC: Aldo Nova, "LIFE IS JUST A FANTASY" kicks in...]

15   INT. LAB - TIME INDETERMINATE                                        15 
A spartan, underground LAB. 
A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE; on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic FLIES. 
He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he could ever touch it. 
Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK. 
CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air. There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end. 
The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the lens up to his eyes. Switch to: 
POV of the FLY CAM: the TECH'S face, extreme wide angle, examining. The image flickers, glitches - then CUTS TO: 
WHITE NOISE. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
16   INT. TELNET CONTROL ROOM - DAY                                       16 
A CONSOLE of MONITORS cut from FUZZ to GRAPHICS.         TECH GUYS and PRODUCERS scramble... it's SHOWTIME. 
OFFSCREEN VOICE Counting down five... four... three... two... 
FREEZE on CASTLE... the IMAGE DISTORTS in THREE DIMENSIONS, offset red and blue channels shifting. 
VOICEOVER Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess... and controversy - SLAYERS. 
SLAYERS LOGO over a slo-mo shot of BROWN and BLUE soldiers walking towards CAMERA - BADASS, with BIG MOTHERFUCKING WEAPONS slung at their sides... 
VOICEOVER (cont'd) If society let us live thru others... SLAYERS would let us die thru others. 
Slick edited COMBAT FOOTAGE from the BATTLEFIELD. Explosions, flame throwers, bullet hits... DUDES screaming, unloading MASS ROUNDS... 
VOICEOVER (cont'd) Slayers gives the gamer full control of a flesh and blood human being in full scale, kill-or-be- killed combat. And when we say flesh and blood, we mean flesh - 
A QUICK CUT of a BROWN'S ARM BEING BLOWN OFF.

19   INT. TELNET - INTERVIEW STUDIO LIVE - CONTINUOUS                       19 
CASTLE is opposite GINA PARKER SMITH, both identified by translucent animated CHYRONS. CASTLE is older now than in the earlier clip; early 40s - his body is more solid; hair cut shorter, conservative. But the eyes still SPARKLE. 
GINA PARKER SMITH Slayers. 
KEN CASTLE (big smile) Slayers. 
CASTLE'S accent is like pure Georgia honey.           He's a rock- ribbed charmer. 
GINA PARKER SMITH (down to business) Why isn't it murder? 
She leans in, playing the role of hard-hitting reporter to a T. 
KEN CASTLE Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - (points for emphasis) ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal. 
GINA PARKER SMITH I see - and has any one of these men or women ever actually survived long enough to be set free? 
KEN just smiles, locks in on her eyes.

KEN CASTLE I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.

PRODUCER (to BOARD OP) What'd he say? 
21   INT. TELNET - INTERVIEW STUDIO LIVE - CONTINUOUS                 21 
GINA PARKER SMITH ... in an election tainted by suspected digital fraud... (changing gears) let's talk about the so-called generi-cons. 
VIDEO: a montage of slayers "civilians" - the bum shaking a can in the midst of chaos, a group of pedestrians walking robotically into a wall of flame, store clerks "air-bagging" groceries... 
GINA PARKER SMITH (cont'd) Sent into the slayers environment with a set of pre-programmed actions, with no way to react and no one controlling them - their chances of survival are next to nil. 
KEN CASTLE There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session. 
VIDEO: the East Indian Female generi-con from the first battle gets smeared by a truck.

23   INT. TELNET - INTERVIEW STUDIO LIVE                                         23 
THROW TO the LIVE STUDIO BROADCAST - 
GINA PARKER SMITH (leaning in) Mr. Castle - how the hell does it work? 
KEN CASTLE Simple. 
A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - and then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) It begins with a single nano-cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain -- this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies... 
KEN has GINA's hand in his hand, beaming. Her demeanor has changed; she's like a LITTLE GIRL with her DAD at the fair. 
KEN CASTLE Good little talk. 
GINA PARKER SMITH My pleasure. Shit, can I tell you? I CAN. NOT. wait for the next Slayers. Kable has been unbelievable. His arms are just so... well, I know it's awful. 
27   INT. STUDIO BOOTH, OFF CAMERA - SIMULTANEOUS                     27 
PRODUCER What the hell is that? 
The WORLDLINK GRAPHIC GLITCHES OUT, replaced by a BLUE SCREEN - like an old school COMPUTER CRASH. THEN - 
One letter at a time, in retro Apple chicago font, accompanied by the exaggerated sound of COMPUTER KEYSTROKE CLICKS: 
HUMANZ

Then a VOICE - deep, but speaking ARTIFICIALLY QUICKLY - like in radio commercials, where they use time-compression software to remove the silences between the words. 
HUMANZ BROTHER Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer, better world. He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue. 
Everyone in the STUDIO is speechless, watching the monitors - including CASTLE; actually, he LOVES it... he's laughing his ass off. 
PRODUCER Mr. Castle, we have no idea... 
KEN CASTLE Shush! 
ON THE SCREEN, the humanz logo dissolves, 8-bit ARCADE STYLE, replaced by: 
THE EVOLUTION OF MAN ACCORDING TO CASTLE 
Underneath is the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION showing the progression from primitive EARLY MAN to the erect MODERN HUMAN. In a crude ANIMATION the progression CONTINUES: MODERN MAN bends back over on his hands and knees; in the final stage he's wearing a DOG COLLAR, getting fucked in the ass - then fed through a MEAT GRINDER, packaged & sold as HAMBURGER. 
KEN looks over at the PRODUCER. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) That's a God damn hoot. 
PRODUCER (to his techies) Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes... (to CASTLE) Sorry, Mr. Castle, we can't hard- line a live broadcast. It's impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in.

KEN CASTLE Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall. 
The screen CUTS TO BLACK, COLOR-BARS blink, then an advertisement streams in. 
KEN stands, holding GINA'S hand, kisses it. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) (to GINA) What about your firewall, sugar - wonder if I might breach it one of these sunny days. 
He gives her a ROGUISH WINK. 
GINA PARKER SMITH You're bad. 
BOARD OP He's good. 
On the monitors, we transition back into a paid commercial: a VICTORIA'S SECRET PORN-looking GIRL in HANDCUFFS turns to CAMERA. 
PORN GIRL Wanna blow off a little steam? 
CUT TO: 
28   EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY                                         28 
A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood sprays on white. 
We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in the same white powder - they look like tribesmen. 
One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly        * enjoying the show. 
DISTINCTIVE PRISONER                            * Fuck him up. 
The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant towers mark the perimeter. 
(CONTINUED) 
WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 28   CONTINUED:                                                      28 
Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind. 
The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops moving. 
The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain. 
A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners. They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive. 
In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes. 
This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider. 
PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she draws out a little blood. 
KABLE yanks his hand back out. 
WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd) Need to prove it's authentic. Makes it worth more. 
KABLE Why would anyone want my name? 
WOMAN (O.S.) You don't even know what's going on out there, do you? (beat) Damn... 
At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel. 
WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd) Gotta go. 
KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a lifeline is slipping away... 
KABLE Wait. (he holds the wrinkled photo to the window) How did you get this picture?            Have you seen them? 
He peers through the little window at the top of the door, but she's GONE... 
Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was being beaten down.

33   EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - DAY                                      33 
A desolate white RUNNING TRACK; a guard TOWER overlooks... the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE. 
He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're right there with him, CLOSE-UP - profile, full speed... we hear the HARD BREATHING, the feet pounding dirt, like we're INSIDE HIS HEAD.

TED NUGENT, in BROWN camo, lines up a BLUE SNIPER in a 3rd story window with a CROSS-BOW. He releases the arrow and pins the BLUE's HEAD to the window sill. 
TED NUGENT Damn, I gonna have to eat you now, son. 
An UPSIDE-DOWN CAR comes SLIDING down the street on it's hood and slams into TED NUGENT, VAPORIZING him... 
PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us... 
We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops, belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs... ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs... 
They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING PARTY!!! 
We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated, but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened, off-kilter. 
On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS... 
A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS, totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS, out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but STILL GRINNING ecstatically... 
A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED... 
People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on the ground... and in the middle of it all...

This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt, fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.

She spots a GUY standing by himself near a giant sculpture. She walks over to him; the BIRD flutters away. 
The GUY is young and attractive, dressed in casual business attire. He is wearing a PLASTIC PIG SNOUT on his face, tied with an elastic band. 
GUY Hey. 
He smiles like a Driver's License photo. 
CUT TO: 
56   INT. GORGE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                            56 
CLOSE-UP of LIPS, profile - by the looks of it, an OVERWEIGHT MALE... sweat, stubble. The ROOM is DARK - lit by the AMBIENT GLOW of a VIDEO SCREEN. 
GORGE Hi. 
57   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                               57 
ANGIE echoes, practically overlapping. 
ANGIE Hi. 
We will continue to CUT between the two locations. 
GUY So what's your damage? 
He WINKS. 
ANGIE strikes an exaggeratedly DEMURE, FLIRTATIOUS POSE - then immediately snaps back to NEUTRALITY. 
GORGE/ANGIE You know, just hanging out. (beat) Looking to meet people. 
GUY Lucky you...

A CLOSE-UP of LIPS to match GORGE'S, but facing the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. An extremely butch, masculine FEMALE; trace of a mustache. 
DALE You met me. 
59   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                               59 
GUY (echoing) You met me. 
ANGIE laughs, a beat LATE. Across the street a WOMAN has hiked up her skirt, squatted down and is TAKING A PEE on the sidewalk. 
GORGE/ANGIE I'm Nika. 
DALE/GUY I'm Dale. (looks her up and down) I like your fur. 
GORGE/ANGIE Do you want to go somewhere? 
She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time. 
DALE/GUY We are somewhere. 
He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the other. 
He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her; SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders... 
HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in his ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least. 
KABLE Freak. 
FREEK is there. 
FREEK Tillmans. 
KABLE Who the hell is that? 
FREEK New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people...

Now HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD gestures him to follow. 
HISPANIC GUARD (O.C.) Hey Kable. 
KABLE turns to look. 
HISPANIC GUARD (cont'd) Let's go. Upgrades. 
CUT TO: 
63   EXT. PRISON, TRAINING RANGE    - NIGHT                        63 
KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot. 
KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET... 
We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out VICINITIES. 
HISPANIC GUARD Who aims? 
KABLE (caught off guard) What? 
HISPANIC GUARD Who aims... the slayer? Or the player? 
KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN. 
KABLE Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye. 
HISPANIC GUARD That's tripped. 
(CONTINUED)

KABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being grateful for the human interaction. 
KABLE Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot. (beat) But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way. 
HISPANIC GUARD Why? 
KABLE There's a delay... 
HISPANIC GUARD Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping... 
KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN. 
KABLE Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls - 
He pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK. 
KABLE (cont'd) It's just me. 
64   INT. PRISON LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT                                   64 
KABLE is ALONE, toweling off - privilege of being a TOP SLAYER. 
We see now   the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in dark, ugly   BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has absorbed -   including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE AND YELLOW   from the most recent session. 
From down the row of lockers, a WHISPER: 
HACKMAN Hey. Kable.

KABLE turns to look. HACKMAN'S head is POKED OUT sideways from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away. 
KABLE Not interested. 
HACKMAN No. Wait. Look. 
He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD. 
HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) I just deleted someone. 
WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 65   CONTINUED: (2)                                                     65 
CASTLE Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con... 
CASTLE 2 Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect? 
CASTLE 3 (musing) His instincts give him an edge. 
CASTLE 2 And in the hands of a talented player... 
CASTLE 3 Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him. 
CASTLE 2 Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem... (makes a throat slashing motion) You know, off camera? 
CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2. 
CASTLE YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down. 
CASTLE 3 One thing I know is what makes people tick. 
Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He stares into the void, calm and utterly in control. 
The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK... 
DISSOLVE TO:

KABLE is SPRINTING down the TUNNEL towards DAYLIGHT.          The VOICE comes from the rear surrounds: 
VOICE (O.S.) Kable, dude. It's me. 
KABLE shakes his head, thinking he's HEARING THINGS. 
KABLE Who? 
SIMON (O.S.) Simon. (beat) I'm playing you, dummy. 
KABLE knifes through the tunnel EXIT... 
68   EXT. SPAWN POINT #3 - CONTINUOUS                                       68 
We are in the OVER-THE-SHOULDER POV of the FLY CAM as KABLE breaks daylight and slides down the hillside... superimposed over the IMAGE: SIMON'S REFLECTED FACE... the CAMERA pans, centers and FOCUSES IN on the REFLECTION... 
SNIPER BULLETS whistle by; KABLE DUCKS, ROLLS... the CAMERA PULLS BACK... OUT OF THE SCREEN... 
69   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                         69

KABLE LANDS in the ROCKSTAR POSE. SIMON mirrors him in front of the GIANT SCREEN - whatever SIMON does, KABLE echoes. 
70   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS                                70 
KABLE makes it to cover, HEART SLAMMING.           We hear the distant THUMPS of MORTARS LAUNCHING. 
KABLE How come I can hear you? 
SIMON (O.S.) It's a mod.

SIMON (O.S.) I know. 
71   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                   71 
SIMON POP-LOCKS - the breakdance arm wave. 
SIMON It's cool, yeah? 
72   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS                            72 
KABLE finishes the POP-LOCK - it's goofy. 
A SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and scrambles for better cover. 
KABLE No. Pay attention to the game. 
They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN. 
Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE, TRIANGULATING. 
90   EXT. SPAWN POINT #4 - MOMENTS LATER                                90 
KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the bottom. 
SIMON (O.S.) (sarcastic) I can see turning you loose was a great idea. 
KABLE (woozy) What happened. 
SIMON (O.S.) YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it. 
KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA, which is kicking in INSTANTLY... 
KABLE No shit... 
SIMON (O.S.) Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up... 
An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING, DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD... 
91   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                       91 
He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his vision doubles and bleeds... 
SIMON (O.S.) What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something! 
BLUES. Lots of them.        KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING NOTHING.

92   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                        92 
KABLE is running erratically at least... hard to HIT... but definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE. 
A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet; the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting air... 
SIMON (O.S.) (frustrated) Fuck it. 
We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER... 
KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss cheese. 
Too close. 
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) (the voice of reason) Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together! 
KABLE Blow me. 
He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the UNDERGROUND GARAGE. 
SIMON (O.S.) Dammit! 
93   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER                      93 
KABLE slams open a door marked P4 and stumbles into the CAR GRAVEYARD... 
Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT, NO GOOD... he stumbles to the next, then another... another... his head hits a passenger side window, SPIDERWEBBING IT...

FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY, PRISTINE. 
Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model, which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH A BUILDING OR TWO. 
KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED under the cap is a prominent WARNING: 
Ethanol Only 
SIMON (O.S.) Kable. Dude. What are you doing? 
KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat. 
Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK. 
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) What the hell? 
He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING. His head is clearing. 
KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless. 
KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK... 
BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard. 
KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HACKMAN and six other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast. 
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) GO, GO, GO! 
KABLE'S TRUCK HICCUPS - FUEL is on EMPTY, but still charging ahead. 
105   INT/EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                                 105 
A LOW CONCRETE WALL surrounds the perimeter, and it's COMING UP FAST; beyond it: more abandoned urban wasteland. 
KABLE has got too much speed at this point to do anything but slam the thing SIDEWAYS into a SICK POWER SLIDE - the TRUCK hits the barrier and FLIPS OVER IT, CORKSCREWING four times before GRINDING TO A STOP on it's hood. The AIRBAGS DEPLOY, smashing KABLE into his seat... 
106   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA - SUBWAY ENTRANCE                                  106 
KABLE scrambles out of the vehicle; he spots a half collapsed SUBWAY ENTRANCE and runs for it...

Behind him, two SMART MISSILES are streaking high across the grey sky... they change direction and DOUBLE THEIR SPEED - it's fucking HORRIFIC... and CONVERGE on the downed TRUCK in an EYEBLINK. 
BOOM. 
108   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA - SUBWAY ENTRANCE                                  108 
KABLE is LIFTED OFF HIS FEET and blown into the SUBWAY ENTRANCE, which COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.

FEMALE NEWS HOST To recap: initial reports are that Kable, the most recognizable face of the Slayers phenomenon next to Ken Castle himself - is officially listed as fragged...

KABLE is standing across the street from a BEAT DOWN BROWNSTONE, watching the second floor window. 
A funky OFF-ROAD MOTOCROSS BIKE buzzes by him and up onto the sidewalk, FARTING SMOKE. KABLE IGNORES the RIDER, who parks, gets off, loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side. 
TRACE She's not home. 
KABLE turns - the RIDER is a green-eyed 22 year-old girl w/ black rimmed WEEZER glasses; SMART AND CUTE as hell... this is TRACE. 
TRACE (cont'd) But Castle's personal security will be, soon enough - trust me, you don't want to meet them. (beat) You know, it's pretty obvious that you'd come here first.

HUMANZ DUDE Because Castle's scared of you. 
HUMANZ BROTHER It ain't just a game, you know, Tillman. Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be human. 
TRACE Right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice. 
HUMANZ DUDE But this is only the beginning. 
HUMANZ BROTHER Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line. 
TRACE So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again... 
HUMANZ BROTHER This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us.

The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We only see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup. 
The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he can manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls. 
When AGENT KEITH speaks, he is calm, conversational.

AGENT KEITH Sure. On the outside.        Now look at these.

ANGIE EXITS the ELEVATOR on the 3rd floor - a modern, minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind. 
They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it WHISPERS OPEN. 
ANGIE snaps a heel; they stumble in. 
123   INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                                 123 
ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC blend of GIRLIE/GEEKY/PORN. Shafts of NICOTINE SUNLIGHT filter through patterned curtains. 
She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE follows... he licks his lips - an automatic gesture - and begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees, back to him, doesn't even bother to look, until...

RICK RAPE Urkk. 
She TURNS. 
KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BARBELL - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT - KKRRUNCH. 
ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR with EMOTION. 
KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... then falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS. 
GORGE is paralyzed. 
GORGE/ANGIE Please don't kill me. 
ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes.     KABLE just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation. 
GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd) I'll do anything. 
KABLE Don't say that. 
GORGE holds out his hands; ANGIE'S fingers caress KABLE'S chest and move toward his crotch... 
KABLE (cont'd) Stop. 
He pushes her hands away, gently. 
KABLE (cont'd) This isn't you. 
ANGIE'S eyes WELL UP with TEARS. 
KABLE (cont'd) (trying to contain his RAGE) God damn it... YOU - in there... controlling her... let her talk, motherfucker. 
GORGE swallows; KABLE is staring straight into his eyeballs.

GORGE/ANGIE I can't. 
KABLE buries his face in his hands; it's TEARING HIM UP. 
GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd) She has to say what I tell her. 
KABLE looks deep into ANGIE'S eyes. 
KABLE (almost whispering) You can hear me, baby. I know you can. 
He WIPES AWAY A TEAR from her cheek with his thumb.     After all he's been through he begins to BREAK DOWN. 
KABLE (cont'd) I love you... love you... 
GORGE/ANGIE I love you too. 
KABLE (snapping) SHUT UP!!! 
He's SCREAMING directly at GORGE, who cowers in his chair as if KABLE were in the room with him. 
KABLE (cont'd) Say anything else and I'll find you... I'll rip you TO FUCKING PIECES, do you understand me? 
GORGE/ANGIE nods. 
KABLE (cont'd) (to ANGIE) I'm getting you out of here. 
124   INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY                             124 
KABLE pulls ANGIE out the door and down the hall, in tactical mode, WEAPON ready... he heads to the ELEVATOR, punches up a ride. No sign of trouble. 
KABLE (quiet) I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off... the program... 
(CONTINUED) 
This thing is FUCKING HUGE... in the DARK it's impossible to tell just how big... hundreds of writhing SOCIETY DUDES, CHICKS and OTHER... DAY-GLO, moving spotlights, strobes... the BUBBLE GIRLS from CRANK make an appearance... along with the DISCOVERY CHANNEL SKATERS from the PARK, now in GOTHED-UP GEAR... 
KABLE gathers it all... he takes ANGIE'S arm and begins to wade through the CHAOS... the BLOOD SPATTERS on his face POP in sharp, inverse DAY-GLO, like HARTIGAN'S SCAR in SIN CITY... 
A SKATER GIRL takes a hold of the glowing, smoking barrel of KABLE'S WEAPON and starts to SKATE CIRCLES around him, ring- around-the-rosie... he wrenches it hard, sending her flying into a crowd that goes down like BOWLING PINS. 
They continue MOVING... KABLE happens to notice RED LASERS moving through the DARK... probing... RAVE LIGHTS? No... 
THOOM.   THOOM THOOM. 
LIGHTNING FLASHES, EXPLOSIONS... a RAVER nearby disintegrates, BLOOD and GUTS a DAY GLO VOLCANO.      DANCERS slip and FALL ON THEIR ASSES in the viscera. 
The SLAYERS are moving thru the RAVE, hunting. Everyone but KABLE and ANGIE are so out of it they don't even notice. 
KABLE (to GORGE) You. Run. 
ANGIE runs. 
KABLE goes COMMANDO, evading the HUNTERS, ducking under EXPLODING SHIT... he moves to FLANK them...

the DJ is DECAPITATED by a stray 50 caliber round but the GROOVE DON'T STOP... 
LIGHTNING STRIKES FREEZE the ACTION as KABLE engages the BLUES, one by one... he takes out THREE of them with CLOSE RANGE BLASTS and another HAND-TO-HAND-TO-HEADSNAP - then notices more BLUES moving in... too many... 
He catches up to ANGIE and they make for an EXIT, any EXIT... 
132   INT. RAVE - LOUNGE AREA                                          132

A SCOOBY DOO-looking VAN pulls up to the CURB in front of them; the back doors SWING OPEN. 
GINA PARKER SMITH I can get you out. 
Not much choice. KABLE and ANGIE climb in. The ELECTRIC VAN drives quietly away, attracting no attention.

KABLE slumps against the wall of the VAN, cradling ANGIE in his arms - exhausted. ANGIE'S eyes are POST-TRAUMATIC, searching. 
GINA is PUMPED. 
GINA PARKER SMITH I can't believe it's you. This is... (gathering herself) Listen: you can trust me, Kable.

CLOSE-UP: a LANCET is prepared... it PUNCTURES SKIN and SUCKS. 
ANGIE is lying on a      black leather couch, unconscious - breathing deeply...      TRACE pops the LANCET out of ANGIE'S fingertip and plops      a RED DROP into a glass tube of liquid. KABLE kneels beside      ANGIE, stroking her hair. 
HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are all there. 
KABLE Now what? 
HUMANZ DUDE (shrugs) The crack works - you're the proof... we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go. 
GINA PARKER SMITH (thinking out loud) It's an anti-spyware program. 
HUMANZ DUDE Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive. 
GINA'S not buying this I.T. GUY shit. 
GINA PARKER SMITH Fuck that. I'd make you cut it out of me. 
TRACE gives her a glance: dumb bitch. 
CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD is standing in the room, silhouettes in the dark - scary.

A screen glitches - pixellated, fucked up, highly compressed, like an internet feed through a busted satellite. We begin to make out a coherent image: 
It is a POV, walking, of an industrial corridor.            Cameras mounted and doors with square glass windows. 
We back away from the screen to reveal - 
HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are watching the image on a LO-FI computer monitor. HUMANZ DUDE runs his fingers along a touchpad, MOVING FREQUENCIES around on a WAVEFORM MONITOR, trying to dial the picture in better. 
We see KABLE through an OBSERVATION WINDOW, slumped over in a chair... DREAMING? Or just CONCENTRATING? 
GINA PARKER SMITH What are we looking at? 
HUMANZ BROTHER His memories... translated as raw audiovisual data. 
GINA PARKER SMITH I read something about this. But that tech is supposed to be a decade away... 
HUMANZ DUDE smirks, shakes his head. 
HUMANZ DUDE Current exponential rate of growth, I can't imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come around. 
He bangs on a key, beating up the interface. 
HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd) They'll have better shit than this in Best Buy within 18 months.

A WHITE, MINIMAL ROOM - TABLE, TWO CHAIRS. We may recognize it from the VIDEO the humanz sent to SIMON. In one chair: a MAN, 30s, beard and mustache grown out thick; in UNIFORM. KABLE sits down in the other. 
SCOTCH Tillman. Never thought I'd be so glad to see your ugly grille. 
KABLE Scotch. 
SCOTCH (mimicking him) Scotch. (back in character) I'll tell you what man: this place sucks.

SCOTCH (confused) OK. (beat) Tillman... dude. Are you good? 
KABLE I'm fine. 
SCOTCH Uh huh. You don't look good. 
KABLE I'm sorry. 
KABLE'S "sorry" seems to refer to something only KABLE knows. 
ANGIE I missed you... so much... 
KABLE (softly) Delia. 
ANGIE says nothing, just holds him tighter. KABLE pushes her             * hair back - he searches her eyes, desperate with emotion.                * 
KABLE (cont'd) Baby... what did they do?                                   *

TRACE (cont'd) The foster parent paid good money to remain anonymous... to make sure the girl would be untraceable. But there's always a data trail, if you know where to look. (shrugs) We do.

KABLE Where is she?

JUST THEN: matching BLACK SUVs pull up to the curb just TEN FEET from where she stands. 
CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD piles out... GINA sees them, recognizes them from the interview with CASTLE; she TURNS AWAY just in time to avoid being recognized by a GEEK as he scans the crowd. 
But they're not after her... they head straight for the ALLEY.

It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up electronics and garbage. The wall-sized screens are all running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD, repeated in columns, by the thousands - scrolling fast, a digital waterfall of words, white on black: 
CHEATER

SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus, in a state of mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING.

He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING LOOP... then once again, attempting to activate SLAYERS control; the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we last saw on GORGE'S screen. 
Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY: it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away. 
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? Use your mentality, wake up to reality... But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP - before I give in Cause I've got you, under my skin... 
KABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have taken care of that. 
KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out they're flesh and blood after all. 
CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces... it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS, right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men, blood on his hands.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd) ... you just want your little sugar pie, I know. So don't do anything stupido. My house, my rules. 
CASTLE walks away, leaving his back open to KABLE seemingly without concern, toward a side door. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) Come on, I want to show you something.

Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile: 
CASTLE walks along, confidently, KABLE following. The background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE. 
KEN CASTLE I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is... 
Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH rising majestically in the dark heavens. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) Of course, soon enough they'd be whistling my tune like everybody else... but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention... (MORE) (CONTINUED)

159   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                      159 
They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard, bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on. 
At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in a FLEX BRACE. 
The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS. 
KEN CASTLE But mine's different. (taps his FOREHEAD) Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in... (taps KABLE'S forehead ) your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it. 
CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him... HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters... 
CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs over, picks up the ball and resumes shooting. 
KABLE (sarcastic) Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.

CASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER. 
KEN CASTLE You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me. 
He sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY FROM HIS FACE. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) See, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates... (KABLE coughs) Inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time I could have 100 million people converted - ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents - and not one would be the wiser. 
Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently TURNS TOWARD US. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do. 
HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, at a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE KNIFE... 
KEN CASTLE(cont'd) For instance. 
KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style. KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it - but leaving his face UNPROTECTED... 
HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face, connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with a sickening POP. 
KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT. 
ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at            * her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain              * against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...                     *

The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away...

Suddenly: 
KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short... 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) (freaked) What the hell was that? 
The GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning. Not even KABLE understands this.

162   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                    162 
SIMON is on his feet, in full BADASS GAMER MODE. 
His body is positioned exactly like KABLE'S - right hand gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust; left hand clutching CASTLE'S THROAT... he FORCES HIS RIGHT HAND FORWARD... 
CUT BACK TO: 
WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 
163   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                 163 
... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is the one struggling for control; he claws weakly at KABLE'S hand, trying to loosen it off his neck... 
KEN CASTLE (panicking) JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN RETARDS! 
GEEK (irritated) Working on it... 
KABLE'S eyes are locked in on CASTLE'S... straining with everything he has... his strength and will overpowering CASTLE, but- 
KEN CASTLE (like he's explaining the obvious to a child) I think it. 
KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the knife away from CASTLE'S belly. 
KEN CASTLE (cont'd) You... fucking... do it... 
CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained... CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back - every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin & Yang, veins rising in his neck... 
Then KABLE senses an opportunity: 
KABLE Look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real. 
CASTLE laughs... BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of course he can't help but picture it... 
... and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE... 
GEEK LEADER (blank) Oops.

... CASTLE focuses, trying to pull it back out, but KABLE shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND. 
The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw           * her arms around her daughter.                                           * 
164   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                    164 
SIMON (triumphant) YES!!! 
He drops down into the badass, ROCKSTAR pose... 
165   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - SIMULTANEOUS                                165 
... and KABLE does the same.                                            * 
KABLE Damn it, kid...

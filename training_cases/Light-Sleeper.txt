CUT TO: 
JEALOUS 
Five p.m. A Clinton transient hotel. 
Inside hotel room, LETOUR meets with JEALOUS, a twenty-five- year-old drug intermediary in leather jacket. JOHN counts hundred-dollar bills, hands them to JEALOUS. 
JEALOUS Are they "faced"? 
LETOUR Don't bore me. 
JEALOUS rearranges the hundreds: 
JEALOUS Is it so much work to face them the same direction? You don't do it, I got to. It's time -- my time -- 
LETOUR (overlap) Jees -- 
JEALOUS We've been through all this. (LETOUR shrugs) This nineteen-gram shit is a drag. 
LETOUR We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety. 
JEALOUS I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted. She's something. 
LETOUR Never made any big money either. 
JEALOUS Sure. 
LETOUR She blows it. 
JEALOUS You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her? 
LETOUR She always says that. We'll see, Jealous. 
JEALOUS She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you. 
LETOUR No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again -- not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording. 
JEALOUS Yeah. 
LETOUR reaches for the door. 
JEALOUS Tour. 
LETOUR What? 
JEALOUS Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled. 
LETOUR Why? 
JEALOUS You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel -- nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her? 
LETOUR (shrugs) I look like an encyclopedia? Who knows? (opens door) Thanks for the warning. 
CUT TO: 
LETOUR Of what? 
ANN The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "Almilk" formula. I remixed it. 
LETOUR (smells her) Very nice. 
ANN Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California. (fishes menus from desk) What should we order? 
LETOUR How about Indian? 
ANN Darling, it's Saturday. 
ROBERT Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while. 
The phone rings. Ann's voice repeats a recorded message: 
ANN'S VOICE "Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think." 
Answering machine beeps. MAN'S VOICE speaks from the tiny speaker: "Ann, this is Ed. Call me. 749-2876." 
ANN (to ROBERT) Answer that. He'll call back every five minutes. 
ROBERT (walking) The night begins. 
The phone rings again: another message as ANN examines the menu. 
ANN "Ped Srilom"? -- it's Northeastern. Duck. 
LETOUR (glancing) I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk Ob." 
ROBERT (out of shot from phone) Me too. 
LETOUR Use it for facial cream. 
ROBERT (out of shot) Remove unsightly hair! 
ANN Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel. 
LETOUR Forgive us. 
ROBERT (returns) Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top Lady. God knows what happened to his shit yesterday. 
ANN (to LETOUR) You take it -- call in. 
LETOUR It was supposed to be light tonight. 
ROBERT Don't you watch TV? 
LETOUR Don't have one. 
ROBERT Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain -- 
ANN Good for the trees -- 
ROBERT Some farmer whacked his numerology on us. 
LETOUR I still deal a little, but I'm straight -- that part's true. Believe me. 
MARIANNE (to DRIVER) Stop here. Now. Stop! 
LETOUR I won't say anything. I promise. I'll just sit here. I'll just give you a ride. 
The car pulls over. MARIANNE opens the door, gets out. 
MARIANNE Goodbye, John. 
LETOUR Where do you live? (door slams) Mari... 
She fades into the rain. JOHN watches, aching. 
DRIVER Sir? 
LETOUR Eighty-third Street. 
The sedan continues uptown. 
CUT TO: 
MEMORIES 
John's apartment. Pre-dawn. His diary lies open on the desk. LETOUR sits clothed on the futon, drinking white wine. He pages through a cheap, half-filled photo album. He touches snapshots, 3Ã—5's from another time: 
-- JOHN and MARIANNE, arm in arm, on a Florida beach 
-- MARIANNE, surprised by the camera, snorting coke at a party 
-- JOHN, MARIANNE, and ANN posing, smiling, same party 
-- JOHN and MARIANNE kissing over birthday cake, same party 
-- MARIANNE IN MOROCCO BAZAAR 
-- JOHN blowing a kiss in Fez airport 
CUT TO: 
PSYCHIC HEALING 
LeTour's narration continues over embossed card on an entry table: Teresa Aronow, Psychic Reading, 37 Jones Street, New York, N.Y. 10012, (212)473-4297. VOICES under narration: 
TERESA (out of shot) Coffee? 
LETOUR (out of shot) Thanks. 
TERESA (out of shot) Black? 
LETOUR (out of shot) Yeah. 
TERESA (out of shot) Here. 
JOHN accepts a coffee mug, sits on a sofa across from TERESA. Sunlight falls through crocheted curtains. 
LETOUR Yes. 
TERESA This was very important in your life. 
LETOUR Yes. 
TERESA You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters. 
LETOUR Teresa? 
TERESA What is it? 
LETOUR I'm thirty-eight years old. (beat) Forty. 
TERESA You're young. 
LETOUR I have trouble sleeping. (TERESA waits) Look. What do you see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck? 
TERESA I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you. 
CUT TO: 
MONEY CHANGER 
Ann's apartment. The night has already begun. ANN sits on the floor beside a YOUNG HASID counting money. He wears Orthodox garb: black hat, black coat, peyas. Tibetan bells reverb from speakers as the Bergmanesque cambist runs faced twenty-dollar bills through a battery-operated counting machine, places stacks of cash on the floor. ROBERT returns a call from the kitchen; LETOUR emerges from the bathroom, wiping his hands. 
ANN (to LETOUR and ROBERT) Your pay's on the table. 
JOHN walks to the cosmetics corner, finds an envelope with his name on it, looks inside: $500 in twenties. He pockets the money. 
LETOUR sits as HASID double-checks the total: cash covers the available floor space. 
YOUNG HASID (dialogue punctuates action) One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to you -- add tens or whatever if you want. 
Opening a satchel, he removes bound $100s, counts off 130 as ANN adds up commission in small bills. He loads the satchel: 
YOUNG HASID Same time? 
ANN (nods) Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while. We'll order kosher. We'll tell you dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism. 
The HASID laughs. He likes her. 
YOUNG HASID (passes hundreds) I'm late already. I only come 'cause I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? I don't want to see you hurt. Find a man. You should do something else. 
ANN (offers commission) Invest in my cosmetics line. 
YOUNG HASID (takes money) Don't mix business with friendship. 
ANN follows him to the door. 
YOUNG HASID Shalom. 
ANN Shalom. (opens door) See you next week. (calls after him) Don't eat any hot dogs! 
ANN closes door. 
TIS You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down. 
LETOUR (hands him valium) Here. 
TIS Make it two. 
LETOUR obliges. TIS pops a blue without water, pockets the other. 
TIS Thanks. 
LETOUR She okay? 
TIS Who? 
LETOUR The girl. 
TIS Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage. 
LETOUR You need a lawyer? 
TIS (gestures toward suited man) He's here. Thanks. 
TIS folds a bill into John's hand. 
LETOUR Any time. 
TIS turns, steps away. LETOUR walks down the long corridor. Curious, reflective, he slows past open doors. Friends, family, patients sit in blue light. Each room a drama. 
He heads down a duplicate corridor. A VOICE turns his head: 
RANDI John! 
He turns to see RANDI JOST, thirty, Marianne's younger sister. She wears running shoes, jeans, red sweater. 
LETOUR Randi? 
RANDI (kisses him) I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. It's been so long. You look great. 
LETOUR (deactivates beeper) You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why are you here? 
RANDI Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne tell you? 
LETOUR Serious? 
RANDI (nods) More chemo. 
LETOUR Can I see her? 
RANDI She's sleeping. She sleeps most of the time. She'd like it, though. She still talks about you. 
LETOUR (sad) I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman. I was crazy about her. God. 
MARIANNE, head down, approaches. Looking up, she finds herself unexpectedly beside JOHN and RANDI: 
RANDI It's John. What a coincidence. 
MARIANNE ("no") Not this time. His new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral. 
LETOUR What have you been doing? Where do you live? 
MARIANNE It's... (deciding) I don't want you to know about my life. 
LETOUR Anything? You married? Have children? A dog? (smile) House plants? 
MARIANNE Details just open the door. 
LETOUR The door to what? (no answer) It's not like we're strangers. We were married. 
MARIANNE We were not. 
LETOUR There was a ceremony. 
MARIANNE He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer. 
LETOUR He was also a minister. "Universal Harmony." 
MARIANNE He was a Pisces. 
LETOUR You're a Pisces. 
MARIANNE It was not legal. 
LETOUR In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're still -- 
MARIANNE I was on the cusp. 
LETOUR We were happy. 
MARIANNE We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down. 
LETOUR There were good times. Area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends -- we were magical. 
MARIANNE You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God. 
LETOUR You exaggerate. 
MARIANNE In rehab they call this "euphoric recall." You only remember the highs, never the lows. 
LETOUR We were happy. 
MARIANNE I was drowning. 
LETOUR It wasn't me -- 
MARIANNE You watched -- 
LETOUR You jumped -- 
MARIANNE You did nothing -- "It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible" -- you still think like that. (shakes head) Actions have consequences; so do -- 
LETOUR (overlap) I -- 
CUT TO: 
NEW DIARY 
Later. LeTour's sedan pulls up near Palio, a midtown restaurant. 
JOHN steps around garbage bags, enters. 
Inside, JOHN "maps" bar, greets the MAÃŽTRE D'. LETOUR spots the FRENCH (LaCroix and Montana) COUPLE in the dining section, catches the man's eye. He nods to the MAÃŽTRE D', makes his way toward their table. 
He joins the FRENCH COUPLE, declines a drink, exchanges drugs/money amid air kisses. 
Late night. Fog hangs over 22nd Street: Chelsea's deserted. Homeless men behind windbreaks of trash. 
John's apartment. He writes bareback at the desk. He completes his composition book diary mid-sentence, closes it, discards it. He lifts a new book from the floor, opens it on the desk, continues. 
He fills his glass with wine: 
LETOUR (voice over) I can always find another way to make a living. I never planned this in the first place -- not like Ann. She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just wanted to be around her. She'd sit up listening to coke stories. Now it's me and Robert. The whole crowd was the same age. Everybody's younger now. She made me. 
LETOUR pulls his weekly pay from his pants, puts five twenties in an envelope. He addresses the envelope. "Linda Wichel, 1012B-2 A Street, Sacramento, California," stamps it. 
Dissolves: (1) LETOUR vanishes from his desk, (2) materializes fetally on his futon, bareback, slacks, boots, anxious, awaiting sleep. 
LeTour's diary contains parallel columns of names: one headed "People Who Are Left Handed," the other, "People Whose Eyes Don't Match." 
CUT TO: 
CÃ”TE BASQUE 
Midday. JOHN, wearing a black tweed jacket, tie, khaki slacks, mails the Sacramento letter, enters CÃ”TE BASQUE, a hoity- toity 55th Street restaurant. 
Midmeal. ANN and LETOUR sit in a prominent booth; power moguls confer quietly. A deferential WAITER brings fresh berries, retrieves empty salmon plates. 
ANN You have any money saved? 
LETOUR There's some. Not much. A thousand or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure. 
ANN What do you do with your money? 
The CHEF stops by, asks if the meal was satisfactory. ANN assures him it was, kisses his hand. The CHEF nods, gratified. JOHN resumes the conversation: 
LETOUR I don't know. It's not that much in the first place -- as you know. 
ANN (counterpoint) It's tax free -- 
LETOUR Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- what about your money? 
ANN Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother." All the money I've made, all the money I've spent -- it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything. 
LETOUR I wish I could help. 
ANN You still go to meetings? 
LETOUR No, but I'm okay. What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days? 
CUT TO: 
GENERAL HOSPITAL 
Afternoon. St. Luke's. LETOUR, wearing tweed jacket, walks down the corridor, checks room numbers. A NURSE passes. He stops at a room, pushes the door a crack, peeks inside, quietly enters. 
Inside the hospital room, MRS. JOST, sixty-five, lies sedated, attached to IV tubes and a respirator. Flowers wreathe the bed. 
RANDI sleeps in a chair by the window. 
LETOUR looks from MRS. JOST to RANDI and back again: a vibrant woman reduced to a shell. He soundlessly eases into a vacant chair. 
His mind goes back. 
RANDI twists fitfully in her chair. A stuffed bear peeks over family photos on the window sill. 
MARIANNE steps into the doorway, stops, frozen -- watching the tableau: JOHN, RANDI, her mother. Her face is ravaged: the death watch has taken its toll. LETOUR reaches his arm, touches the hospital bed. 
MARIANNE tiptoes behind JOHN. He turns, stands. 
LETOUR (soft) I'm sorry. I... 
She puts her finger to her lips. He nods. She steps closer, holds him politely. His cheek nestles in her neck. 
They turn toward the door, step into the corridor, walk arm in arm as if supporting each other. 
LETOUR (after a moment) I always thought my father would die first. He would die, then my mother and I would reconcile. Just her and me. I hated him for living. 
MARIANNE It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a feeling. 
LETOUR My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded. (beat) I miss you. 
They stop. She kisses him. 
MARIANNE You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another. (he kisses her) I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too busy hating you. 
LETOUR I thought I was just killing myself. 
She runs her hands under his shirt, up his back. 
LETOUR Selfish. 
MARIANNE I remember. 
LETOUR What? 
MARIANNE What it felt like. (kisses his face) What this tasted like. 
He slips his hands under her blouse, caresses her breasts. 
LETOUR I see you and my heart starts thumping. 
MARIANNE John. 
They kiss deeper, bodies grinding. The painful present fades. A NURSE approaches with WHEELCHAIR PATIENT. She tries to pass one side of JOHN and MARIANNE, tries the other side, is blocked again. The NURSE stops, stares at their soap opera. 
LETOUR I love you. 
LETOUR is alone. He pulls his pants on. Looking for his socks, he peruses Marianne's personal things. He examines her cosmetics, her underclothes. He dabs her perfume on his cheek. 
Buttoning his shirt, he retrieves his beeper from suit jacket. Activated, it disgorges messages. He checks his watch: 9:00 p.m. 
CUT TO: 
GET ON OUT 
Nine-thirty: Ann's apartment building. Trash stacked high. 
LETOUR presses the buzzer. 
LETOUR, exhausted, unfocused, enters Ann's apartment. ANN is immediately upon him: 
ANN Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee? 
LETOUR There was a mix-up -- 
ANN How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks. 
LETOUR Where's Robert? 
ANN Busting his ass. He's out doing your job. 
LETOUR It was a confusion. 
ANN Get confused on your day off. 
LETOUR When is that? 
ANN Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it. 
LETOUR (pecks her cheek) I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me. 
CUT TO: 
AU BAR 
LeTour's sedan waits between limos. 
Inside, JOHN passes the MAÃŽTRE D', looks around: he's known here. Au Bar, a restaurant/club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. m., caters to the young, the rich, the European. 
He spots TIS with THOMAS, twenty-five, his handsome trainer, and TWO MODELS at a second-floor table. They exchange nods. 
LETOUR scans the room: suspicion is second nature. 
A laughing man (GUIDONE) at the bar catches his eye. He seems to blend: Italian, twenty-eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, accent -- but something's not right. His black shoes have rubber soles. LETOUR looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. The ITALIAN turns; LETOUR glimpses his face: too pale. The ITALIAN averts his eyes. Glancing back, LETOUR walks up the stairs to Tis' table. 
TIS Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. They're here for a show. 
The MODELS respond in respective accents. THOMAS extends his hand. JOHN shakes, remains standing. 
LETOUR EnchantÃ©. (to TIS) How'd it turn out? 
CUT TO: 
PHONE CALLS 
Midday. Twenty-second Street. A helter-skelter of daytime activity unseen before. 
John's apartment. Sunlight fills the studio apartment. LETOUR, unshaven in T-shirt and slacks, sets the phone on the desk beside his open composition book. He pauses, dials. 
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Paramount Hotel. 
LETOUR Marianne Jost. 
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Just a moment. 
JOHN waits, closes his diary. 
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) I'm sorry. Ms. Jost checked out this morning. 
LETOUR She was there yesterday. 
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) She checked out this morning. 
LETOUR Did she leave a forwarding number? 
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) No. 
LETOUR Thank you. 
He hangs up, thinks, redials. 
ST. LUKE'S SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) St. Luke's -- Roosevelt Hospital. 
LETOUR Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She's a patient. 
ST. LUKE'S SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Just a moment. 
A long silence. JOHN looks out the window. A MEDICAL STAFF VOICE from the hospital: 
MEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) Who is this calling? 
LETOUR (thinking) Skyline Floral. We're trying to confirm a delivery. 
MEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) Mrs. Jost passed away last night. 
LETOUR Are the funeral arrangements local? 
MEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) Just a sec -- yes, Plaza Memorial. 
LETOUR Thank you. 
MEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) You're welcome. 
JOHN hangs up, paces, sits. 
CUT TO: 
CUT TO: 
INTERVENTION 
Eddie's high-rise apartment. EDDIE is worse, if anything. He's been scoring on the street: broken pipes and vials crunch underfoot. 
EDDIE and LETOUR argue ("Fuck you!" "Fuck you!"). EDDIE spits, pushes TOUR, JOHN pushes back. Eddie's feet tangle. He trips, FALLS. A bottle SMASHES. 
JOHN goes to the phone, checks Eddie's directory, dials. 
EDDIE (on floor) You gotta get permission? Check with Mama? 
LETOUR I'm calling your brother. 
EDDIE Huh? 
LETOUR Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm gonna ask him to come over. (EDDIE protests) You've told me so much about him. 
EDDIE (panicked) No, don't. Please, I'll give you money, anything. He doesn't understand. Whose side are you on? 
LETOUR (on phone) Is this Martin Jeer? (beat) Thank you. 
EDDIE, woozy, tries to stand. 
EDDIE I shoulda never called. 
LETOUR (to EDDIE) I recommend Hazelden. It has the best all-around program. (on phone) Martin Jeer? (beat) I'm here with your brother Ed. (beat) Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's a medical emergency. You're going to have to come. 
EDDIE lurches toward LETOUR. JOHN -- flash of anger -- bootkicks him in the head! Eddie's cheek hits the carpet. 
LETOUR (on phone) He'll be here. 
JOHN, cooling down, measures his breaths. A spring can only be wound so tight. 
CUT TO: 
LEXINGTON AVENUE 
LETOUR walks from his sedan around the corner to the Lexington Avenue entrance to Grace Towers, a pre-war apartment building. In the lobby, he gives his name to the SECURITY GUARD, is directed to the express elevator. 
He exits on the thirtieth floor; footsteps muted by thick carpet. 
Victorian prints on dark blue walls. He looks about, approaches a door, presses the buzzer. 
THOMAS opens the door; JOHN enters Tis' opulent apartment. 
Salle and Clemente hang on the walls; New York twinkles outside panoramic windows. A pipe and syringe lie atop art books. TIS, in jogging sweats, comes from the bedroom to greet him. 
TIS Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen, right? 
LETOUR Thirty-eight hundred -- got any hundreds? 
TIS Some, not the whole thing. (to THOMAS) You got hundreds? 
THOMAS No. 
LETOUR Yes. 
Pause. More police cars. The EMS siren starts up; the ambulance speeds downtown past LeTour's sedan. No reaction. CARLOS turns off the engine. 
LETOUR Downtown. 
CARLOS Yes. 
CARLOS starts the car, pulls into traffic. 
CUT TO: 
TWENTY-TWO MINUTES 
John's apartment. Late night. LETOUR, barefoot, T-shirt, slacks, stands flat against the wall. 
WINS broadcasts twenty-four hour news on the boombox. ("Give us twenty-two minutes and we'll give you the world.") Sports, ads, bullshit -- LETOUR hears what he's been waiting for: 
NEWSCASTER (out of shot -- radio) This story is just in. A woman has fallen thirty stories to her death from a posh Grace Towers apartment on Lexington Avenue. Police are withholding identification pending the notification of the next of kin. The incident happened about ten p.m. According to the sources on the scene there was no one else in the posh Grace Towers apartment when the fall occurred. We will bring you more details as we get them. (teletype efx) An end to the sanitation strike seems imminent. Negotiations at the Helmsley Palace are continuing to this hour... 
Actions have consequences. 
CUT TO: 
MOTHER TERESA 
First light. Jones Street. LETOUR, sleepless, pounds on Teresa's door. No answer. Knocks again. Again. 
Noises from inside. A sleepy voice: 
TERESA (out of shot) Who is it? 
LETOUR John. John LeTour. Can I see you? 
TERESA (out of shot) What time is it? 
LETOUR It's important, Teresa. 
TERESA (out of shot) Call. Make an appointment. 
LETOUR Open the door. You're awake anyway. (no answer) Teresa. 
TERESA, wearing oriental bathrobe, unlatches the door. JOHN enters, turns to her. The door closes. 
LETOUR Read me. What do you see? 
TERESA Do I know you? 
LETOUR We had a session last week. What do you see? 
TERESA (remembering name) John? 
LETOUR Yes. Look at me. 
TERESA takes a moment to concentrate. 
GUIDONE (out of shot) The jumper. Druggie. 
LETOUR The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else. 
GUIDONE (out of shot) Who? 
LETOUR Who lives in the apartment? 
GUIDONE (out of shot) You there? 
LETOUR That's all I know. You asked me to tell you something. I told you something. 
Hangs up. 
CUT TO: 
A LITTLE SLEEP 
Noon. LETOUR enters a West Village apartment building. 
He presses an intercom button. Robert's voice answers: 
ROBERT (out of shot) Who is it? 
LETOUR Jack. Let me in. 
The door buzzes. 
ROBERT opens the door to his overdecorated apartment. JOHN looks around. TONY, Robert's younger, unattractive lover, sips coffee at the table. 
ROBERT Where have you been? We were worried. 
LETOUR I need some sleep -- not much. I don't want to go home just yet. A little sleep first. Can I crash here? Nice place. 
ROBERT It's hideous. I did it years ago. I've got to throw everything out. You haven't been here? (noticing TONY) Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you about him. You should talk. He's the lapidopterist -- gems. 
TONY (corrects him) Lapidarian. 
ROBERT Same thing. 
LETOUR Can I? 
ROBERT Sure. 
LETOUR What do you know about Tis? What's his relationship to Ann? 
ROBERT They go way back -- before me. Did you cross him? 
LETOUR No. 
ROBERT Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection. She needs that score. What happened? 
LETOUR Nothing. 
ROBERT Don't mess with him. 
LETOUR Burning Spear. 
MANUEL How'd you get in? 
LETOUR C-C. 
MANUEL You buying? 
LETOUR How's product? 
MANUEL (gesture: "primo") How much? 
LETOUR I got a problem. I need a piece. 
MANUEL Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy? 
LETOUR A gun. 
MANUEL When? 
LETOUR Now. Anything. (MANUEL is silent) Am I speaking too fast? 
MANUEL How much you spend? 
LETOUR The rate. What you got? 
MANUEL calls over a TEENAGE DOMINICAN, explains the situation in Spanish. The DOMINICAN replies; MANUEL turns back to JOHN: 
MANUEL He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective Special. Nobody wants 'em. Fresh from a cop. 
LETOUR How much? 
MANUEL (consults DOMINICAN) Four -- including me. 
LETOUR You're fucking me. 
MANUEL ("so what?") Street price. 
LETOUR Where is it? 
MANUEL Sigame. 
They lead him to an even darker back room. The DOMINICAN retrieves an automatic pistol from a trash pail, hands it to MANUEL. JOHN counts cash from Tis' roll; MANNY hefts the piece. 
MANUEL The hundreds -- Franklins. 
Bills and guns exchanged. 
LETOUR How do you use this? 
MANUEL Automatic. 
LETOUR I don't have much use for a gun. Never used one like this. 
MANUEL (translates for DOMINICAN) Cono! 
LETOUR It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff. Did Marianne mention him yesterday? 
RANDI ("no") It was his apartment. What are you thinking? 
LETOUR I don't know. 
RANDI She jumped. (LETOUR hangs on every word) You loved her, but she -- this sounds terrible but it's true -- she was... she ruined everything... bad luck. 
LETOUR (heard enough) When's the funeral -- your mother's? 
RANDI Tomorrow. Will you come? 
LETOUR (vague) Well, I got this thing to do. It's -- I don't know if I can get away. 
RANDI Try? For me. 
LETOUR I'll try. 
CUT TO: 
PRODIGAL SON 
Ann's apartment. Eight p.m. ANN greets LETOUR with a hug. 
ANN The Prodigal Son. 
LETOUR Sorry about last night. Something came up. 
ANN Where were you? 
LETOUR T.C.T.E. 
ROBERT "Too Complicated To Explain." 
LETOUR (enters bedroom) I'm $500 short from last night. I'll get it, you can take it from my salary. 
ANN (stung) This is family. Are you saying that to hurt me? (LETOUR returns) It's not money. 
LETOUR (chagrined) Sorry. 
ROBERT Look at this. ("Akasha" visual) We had a graphic artist make it up -- you know, Billy, Five Towns. 
ANN The label for the cosmetics line. 
LETOUR (examines it) Classy. Sorta -- Katmandu... 
ANN (corrects him) Kathmandu. 
LETOUR I love it. 
ROBERT Tis called twice. He wants you to come by. 
LETOUR (wary) Me? 
ANN Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't. 
LETOUR (overlapping) You made me -- 
ANN -- never washed -- 
LETOUR -- khaki pants. 
ANN I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous. (beat) It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything. 
JOHN wonders: The Big Goodbye? Is she acting at Tis' behest? 
LETOUR I gotta stop home a second. 
ANN Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you. 
"They're?" 
LETOUR You know I got a bad vibe about Tis. 
ANN (unconvincing) Chill. This is routine. 
LETOUR I want to get my lucky jacket. 
ANN Oh. Okay. 
The sedan continues south. It turns, stops in front of John's Chelsea apartment building. 
JOHN hops out, goes in. 
Inside John's apartment he -- a man possessed -- pulls his black tweed from the closet, throws it on the futon. He rolls up his shirt, reaches under the futon, removes the .38. 
He straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his chest, end to end over the .38. He tucks in his shirt, puts on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it doesn't. A pause to appreciate. 
LETOUR closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle. He slaps cologne on his cheeks -- annointing; heads toward the door. 
Outside, LETOUR emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops beside ANN. The sedan drives off. Back seat: 
ANN That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it? 
LETOUR Ann, you got some mouth on you. 
ANN You don't want to know where it's been. (sniffs him) Cologne? 
LETOUR For you. 
ANN Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals. 
LETOUR pulls out a slip of paper, writes a name and address: "Linda Wichel, 1012B-2 A Street, Sacramento, California." 
ANN What's that? 
LETOUR Do me a favor. 
ANN What? 
LETOUR Don't ask why, just promise. 
ANN And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass! (she spits on his shirt, knees him in the crotch, yanks his gun, throws it beside the gut- clutching CUBAN. She crosses the room, YELLING:) That's it! TIS! Shitball! I know you're fucking there! Let this be a lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this! (to LETOUR) Let's go. 
THOMAS and the CUBAN TEEN retrieve their guns; ANN unlocks the door. 
THOMAS (pointing gun) Hold it! Stop right there. 
She turns defiantly. TIS enters from bedroom: 
TIS (to THOMAS) No! (to ANN) Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point -- I apologize. 
TIS looks to THOMAS and the CUBAN: they lower their weapons. He only means to threaten LETOUR. 
TIS (about THOMAS and CUBAN) Assholes. What a nightmare. (to ANN) We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, you're upset. I just need to talk to Tour a second. About a police matter. (to LETOUR) Right? 
LETOUR (to ANN) Go on. 
She hesitates. 
TIS Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb -- 
ANN gets it. Fear hits: 
ANN (to TIS) We came together, we're leaving together. (to LETOUR) Johnny, come with me. 
Opens door. 
TIS (a command) Thomas. 
THOMAS fixes his gun on ANN. 
TIS (to ANN) Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave. (to LETOUR) I had nothing to do with Marianne -- she jumped: she was there, then she was gone. (nods ANN to leave) Nothing will happen to Tour. 
ANN computes, bolts out, flees, SCREAMING at the top of her lungs: 
ANN (out of shot) Fire! Fire! Fire! 
The fire bell rings. 
THOMAS, TIS, and the CUBAN stare dumbfounded. 
LETOUR reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point-blank into the Cuban's chest. BLAM! Shirt fabric flares, flies: the CUBAN falls with blank expression. 
THOMAS, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at LETOUR. 
JOHN fires back. Both are hit. TIS ducks into the bedroom. 
THOMAS and LETOUR fire again, again -- hitting, missing. A bullet hits its mark: THOMAS, frozen, grabs his blood-spurting throat, slumps to floor. 
LETOUR bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. His shirt soaks red; he struggles to stand. CUBAN and THOMAS -- both dead. LETOUR checks the .38: five rounds fired -- one left. 
LETOUR staggers into the bedroom, finds TIS frantically searching an open suitcase. Off-screen VOICES under the fire bell. 
TIS (desperate) I didn't -- 
LETOUR steps to TIS, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. Exit debris hits the wall. He is dead.

NET CORRESPONDENT We 've just landes here on whar cap troopres are calling "Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery division... It 's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we iGKKKKKK ! 
Blood hits the lens as the Correspondent is cut in half. The CAMERA catches a glimpse of HUGE CLAWS as Cap Trooper JOHNNY RICO , 18, blows away SOMETHING BIG big with his pulse cannon. 
JOHNNY Com'on, let's go !	ON THE BOUNCE 
The cap troopers move out, among them DIZZY FLORES, 18, ACE LEVY, 19, and KITTEN SMITH, 18. The CAMERA pauses, unsure. 
FED NET CENTRAL (O.S.) FOLLOW THEM...! GO ! GO ! 
The CAMERA follows. The PULSE of BUG BATTERIES is blinding. Cap Troopers scream as they are torn apart right and left by an enemy seen only in disorientating glimpses. 
JOHNNY THIS WAY ! 
The group splits into two, and the CAMERA follows Johnny. Something slices Kitten Smith, and he goes down screaming. 
JOHNNY KITTEN ! 
Johnny stops to help his comrade. A CLAW slashes into him. 
JOHNNY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Now something grabs the CAMERA, spinning it around. We glimpse the hideous jaws of an ARACHNID WARRIOR. 
CAMERAMAN (O.S.) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
The CAMERA hits the ground. Johnny, badly wounded, bleeding from the mouth, crawls into CAMERA, trying to get away from the dark INSECT SHAPES that close in on him. 
JOHNNY Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me... 
His eyes glaze over as he remembers 
FLASHBACK: 
6	INT	NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ 
is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her. 
RASCZAK (O.S.) The end of another school year, and for me no doubt another failure... Rico, pay attention ! 
The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused. 
JOHNNY Sorry, Mr. Rasczak. 
Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends. 
JOHNNY Did you read her mind ? 
CARL Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. 
It's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny. 
JOHNNY Yeah, but I want Carmen. 
CARL You got it bad. 
Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off. 
CARL Don't forget about this afternoon. (to Carmen) He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss. 
Carmen blushes, covers. CARMEN She's flying starships ! 
JOHNNY Who ? 
CARMEN Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical 
JOHNNY I have good reflexes. 
Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm. 
CARMEN C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology. 
9	INT	BIOLOGY LAB  -- DAY - THE BIOLOGY TEACHER 
is an older woman, very spry, also blind. Johnny, Carmen and other students gather around covered lab tables. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER For our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. You may begin. 
The students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60 centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection. 
CARMEN Eeuch ! 
JOHNNY Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society. 
JOHNNY Better put your goggles on. 
Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly. 
CARMEN But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society. 
She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space. 
Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out. 
JOHNNY Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal... 
CARMEN Excuse me...! 
She heads for the door, hand over her mouth. 
10	EXT	CIVIC PARK - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN 
walk home from school together. 
JOHNNY 35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers. 
CARMEN Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing. 
JOHNNY Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math. 
CARMEN Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers. 
JOHNNY Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ? 
CARMEN I don't want everyone to see. 
JOHNNY Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? 
CARMEN How come that's all you talk about anymore ? 
JOHNNY It's all I think about anymore. 
Indeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand. 
11	EXT	PUPLIC TRANSPORTATION - DAY - CARMEN 
CARL Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention. 
Carl puts a card up. 
JOHNNY Queen of hearts. 
The computer indicates a match. Johnny peers around at the monitor. It is the Queen of hearts. 
CARL Well, what do you know about that ! 
13	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - STANDS - DAY - CARMEN 
and other students wearing orange and black sing the "Uni High Song". The SCOREBOARD says:	REGIONAL FINAL. Across the field, fans wear red and gold and sing another song. 
14	INT	LOCKER ROOM - DAY - JOHNNY 
and other UNI HIGH TIGERS, all exceptionally robust young man and women, suit up in their orange and black uniforms. 
DIZZY Tesla's tough. They tumble good and they hit HARD. 
Dizzy bounces a JUMP SHOE to Johnny. The spring fires and vaults it high into the air. Johnny catches it, puts it on, smiles cocky at the TESLA GIANTS who suit up in red and gold. 
JOHNNY We tumble good, too. 
15	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - WHAM ! -- TIGERS AND GIANTS 
collide. Powered by jump shoes, the play is gymnastic. Johnny moves the ball , flips high in the air over the Giant defensive line, makes ten meters before he is brought down. 
16	EXT	STANDS - DAY - THE CROWD 
cheers as Johnny runs back to join his team. He sees Carmen waving, glad that Johnny has seen her among all the people. 
17	EXT	HUDDLE - DAY - JOHNNY and other Tigers listen as quarterback Dizzy calls the plays. 
DIZZY Kick three, fade left. On two. 
They make fists, then breal for thevline of scrimmage. 
18	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY - THE TIGERS have the ball. The Giant's QUARTERBACKassigns ZANDER BARCALOW, 18, handsome, super-confident, to guard Johnny. 
ZANDER Time's running out. 
Zander points. The SCOREBOARD shows	TIGERS 19,	GIANTS 20, three minutes and counting on the clock. Johnny grins. 
JOHNNY A lot can happen in three minutes. 
DIZZY Hut... hut ! 
Johnny takes the handoff, flips over a gauntlet of Giant guards. Zander hurls himself at Johnny, misses. Johnny scores. Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe. 
19	EXT	SIDELINES - DAY-ZANDER 
looks up and sees Carmen, smiling as she offers him a hand. She helps him up. He holds her hand longer than necessary. 
CARMEN Are you alright ? 
ZANDER I'm getting better. 
20	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - JOHNNY 
runs back to join his team as the crowd cheers. The Tigers lead 21-20. Johnny frowns when he sees Carmen talking to Zander on the sidelines, shaking his head, smiling. 
21	EXT	SIDELINE - DAY - ZANDER 
finds his shoe, straps it on. 
ZANDER So what are you doing later ? 
CARMEN Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ? 
ZANDER I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow. 
Zander heads for the field. Carmen follows, interested. 
CARMEN You're going to the Academy ? That's where I want to go. I'd love to talk to you abou that. 
A REFEREE blows his whistle at Zander, signalling impatiently. 
ZANDER I'm all ears. 
CARMEN Don't you have to finish the game ? 
22	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY-THE GIANTS 
are in possession. Zander lands hard in front of Johnny. 
JOHNNY Don't get any ideas. She's my girl. 
ZANDER You can never be sure. 
JOHNNY Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now ! 
Johnny stomps out, the transporter goes ZAPPP ! 
MOTHER Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach ! 
FATHER Teenagers ! 
27	INT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - EVERYONE 
at the "Farewell Dance" is dressed up. Rasczak and other TEACHERS chaperon. A spotlight finds the BAND LEADER. 
BAND LEADER Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so let's turn down the lights and make it a slow one. 
The lights go down. Dizzy, dressed pretty, brightens when she sees Johnny standing alone near the dance floor. 
DIZZY Hey, Rico, wanna dance ? 
JOHNNY Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen... 
DIZZY Too bad for her if she's not around. 
Dizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close. 
DIZZY You know, it's sad... Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight. There is an invitation here. Johnny doesn't take it. 
JOHNNY You still gonna play for Brazil ? 
DIZZY Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start. 
JOHNNY Well, anyone who gets you is lucky. 
DIZZY How come we never got together ? 
Dizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully. He's distracted. Carmen crosses the room, stunning in her formal. 
JOHNNY Can't we just be friends, Diz ? 
DIZZY Sure. 
JOHNNY Uh, look, Diz... 
DIZZY Guess you gotta go. 
JOHNNY You're the best. 
Johnny heads for Carmen. Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with. Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly. 
28	INT	GYMNASIUM - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT - CARMEN AND JOHNNY 
dance. Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids. 
JOHNNY Isn't it great to be in love ? 
CARMEN How do I know if this is love ? JOHNNY It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't... 
CARL Outa the way you two ! 
Carl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer. Johnny goes in for the kiss again. 
CARMEN Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation... 
JOHNNY Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet. 
Johnny's confidence makes her smile. Johnny moves in to kiss her, but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak. 
JOHNNY Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak. 
CARMEN I'll meet you outside. 
Johnny heads over to Rasczak. 
JOHNNY Mister Rasczak ? 
RASCZAK What is it, Rico ? 
JOHNNY I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year. 
RASCZAK (smiling) Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something. 
JOHNNY I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen. 
RASCZAK Good for you. Go find out. 
JOHNNY Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ? 
RASCZAK Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico. 
29	EXT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - JOHNNY walks out and finds Carmen talking with Zander. He wears the blue uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee. Carmen examines his FLEET PIN, a pair of silver wings. 
RECRUITING SERGEANT Fresh meat for the grinder, eh ? 
CARL That's us. Where do we sign ? 
He turns in his chair to grab the forms. Johnny and his friends see that he is also missing both legs. The Recruiting Sergeant catches them looking, smiles even wider. 
RECRUITING SERGEANT Here and here and here. 
As he signs, Johnny looks at the campaign ribbons on the Recruiting Sergeant's chest. We hear MUSIC: 	"The Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays softly in honor of distant battles. 
RECRUITING SERGEANT Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service. Follow the blue line. 
35	INT	PROCESSING HALL - DAY - JOHNNY, CARMEN AND CARL 
are routed into different lines, joining other hopeful civilians. A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker. 
COLONEL There is no guarantee of service. We don't need all of you. It costs a great deal to train human beings for useful tasks. Many jobs are hazardous to your health. If you are chosen and do not wish to serve you may resign at anytime simply by completing form 1240/A. Thank you for exercising you constitutonal rights. 
36	INT	CHANGING ROOM -- DAY -- JOHNNY 
and others in the line strip down. The guy in front of Johnny is DON, 18, athletic and cheerful. 
DON They took my sister, they'll take anybody. 
37	INT	TESTING FACILITY -- DAY -- JOHNNY 
grimaces as a TECHNICIAN installs an INTERFACE PLATE on his side, drawing fluids. 
DON Oh, this is the part that hurts ! 
A PSYCH OFFICER sits down across from each candidate. 
PSYCH OFFICER No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ? 
JOHNNY Here in Buenos Aires. 
The Psych Officer checks Johnny's response on a meter. 
38	INT	VARIOUS TESTING STATIONS - DAY - JOHNNY 
is poked and prodded, subjected to aural, visual and pharmacological stimuli, and scanned from head to toe. 
PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.) Are your parents currently citizens ? 
JOHNNY (V.O.) No, sir. 
PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.) Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ? 
JOHNNY (V.O.) Courage, I guess. 
PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.) Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because... 
JOHNNY (V.O.) I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir. 
39	INT	DEBRIEF - DAY - JOHNNY 
sits across from a MAJOR who views a list on a monitor Johnny can't see. 
MAJOR I'm happy to tell you that you've been accepted for Federal Service. 
JOHNNY Wow, that's great. 
MAJOR Looks like you're quite an athlete. Boy, look at those reaction stats. 
The Major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list: MOBILE INFANTERY. 
MAJOR My job is to dertermine what you're best suited for. 
JOHNNY I want to be a pilot, sir. 
MAJOR Sorry, son, no way. Your school records say you don't have the math skills. 
Johnny swallows this. He knew it was coming. The Major deletes "Pilot" from the list, then several other items. 
MAJOR That rules out the scientific and engineering applications, and I'm afraid we reserve non-military options for candidates who are frankly less able-bodied than you are, son... 
He turns the monitor around and shows Johnny the list. The only thing left is MOBILE INFANTERY. 
MAJOR It looks like the only thing you're good for is cannon fodder. I'm putting you down for the Mobile Infantery. 
40	INT	AUDITORIUM - DAY - CARMEN 
proudly takes the Federal Service oath with about twenty-five other people, a gleaming silver FLEET PIN on her chest. She looks around for Johnny, sees him grinning at her. 
JOHNNY ET AL ...of my own free will, without promise, coercion, or inducement, after having been duly advised and warned of the meaning and consequence of this oath, do now enroll in the Federal Service of the Terran Federation for not less than two years and as much longer as may be required by the needs of the Service... 
41	INT	FEDERAL BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN 
walk out together happily, hand in hand. 
ZIM (V.O.) You will not like me. 
53	INT	HYPERPHYSICAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS - DAY - ZIM 
watches the recruits face simulated 3-D OFF-WORLD FOES. In one room, CYCLOPS SOLDIERS of Antilles, in another, red DEATH WALKERS, and in a third, screeching ARACHNID WARRIORS. 
ZIM (V.O.) But if you survive you will thank me because you will be born again hard. You will be a new person. You will be a Cap Trooper. And then, MAYBE, you'll  be good enough... 
54	EXT	COMBAT KNIFE PRACTICE - DAY - ZIM 
throws a knife, buries the point in a narrow post. 
ZIM (V.O.) ...to serve in my family. 
ACE Sir, I don't understands who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway... All you gotta do is push a button, sir ! 
Zim yanks the knife out of the post. 
ZIM Put your hand on the post, private. 
Ace obeys. Zim throws, sticks his hand to the post. 
ACE AWK ! 
ZIM The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand. MEDIC ! 
Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post. A recruit trots up. Johnny stares, surprised. It's Dizzy. 
DIZZY Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty , sir. 
She snaps Zim a salute and hands him her orders. 
ZIM I see you specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training group... 
Dizzy grins self-consciously at Johnny. 
DIZZY Sir, I heard it was the best, sir ! 
ZIM It is the best... BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH ? ON YOUR BELLY AND GIVE ME FIFTY, RECRUIT ! 
Dizzy hits the deck and starts doing push-ups, counting off as MEDICS arrive and go to work on Ace's hand. 
55	INT	MESS HALL - DAY - THE RECRUITES 
line up for mess piled four-square together on a single plate, meat on the bottom, ice cream on top. 
ACE I'd like to disable Zim...! 
KATRINA Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out for talking like that... 
DJANA'D They can kick you out for anything. Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory Performance... 
KITTEN SMITH Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye ! 
Ace cuts into the front off the mess line. 
ACE Aw, you either got what it takes or you don't. 
DJANA'D C'mon Ace, wait your turn ! 
ACE At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck. 
JOHNNY Better get in line like everyone else, Ace. 
Silence. There could be a fight. Zim, standing nearby, watches with interest. Ace opens his hand. 
ACE You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies. 
JOHNNY What an honor... 
ACE Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me ! 
Ace makes a big friendly show of trading places with Johnny. 
BRECKINRIDGE Come on, Ace, back off the line ! Bacl off the line ! 
Now everyone's laughing, pushing Ace to the back of the line. Johnny has his grub. Dizzy comes up with her tray. 
DIZZY Hey, amigo, come chow with me. 
JOHNNY No thanks, Diz. 
DIZZY What's your malfunction, Rico ? 
JOHNNY You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along. 
DIZZY What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ? 
JOHNNY You saying you didn't ? 
JOHNNY Sir, thank you, sir ! 
ZIM Don't stand there dumb... GO ! 
Johnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth. 
JOHNNY YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...! 
Next in line, Ace scowls. 
72	INT	BARRACKS - NIGHT - THE RECRUITS 
have some free time. Johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons that designate him as Squad Leader. 
KITTEN SMITH Look at him. Do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself ? 
ACE Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose, I guess. 
JOHNNY I just want you guys to know that I'll never do anything that I haven't asked you to do first. 
Johnny approaches Dizzy. 
JOHNNY Couldn't've done it without you, Diz. Friends ? 
Dizzy smiles, shakes. 
DIZZY Yeah, sure... friends. 
Bronski walks through with the mail. 
BRONSKI Levy... Shujumi... Rico. 
Johnny grabs the E-disk, pops it into his handcam. The Fleet Mail logo appears: APPROVED MESSAGE 
JOHNNY Bet it's from my girl. 
Johnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, in her quarters aboard starship Athena. 
CARMEN Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every moment here. 
ACE Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that ! 
JOHNNY Shhhh...! 
CARMEN I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will. 
Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously. 
JOHNNY All it takes is the love of a good woman... 
The image changes abrupltly. Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit. She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck. Outside , the rings of Saturn sparkle in bright solar light. 
CARMEN Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had to show you. It's great to be out here on my own. I'm just not some little girl from Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the universe... (she sighs) And that's also the problem because I don't really want to get married, Johnny. I don't want to have kids. I want a command, a ship of my own, and you know, I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me. 
Johnny is stunned. All the other recruits suddenly seem to have something else to do. 
CARMEN I know that's not what you wanted to hear... but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry. I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me, so I'll know that we'll always be friends. 
The Fleet Mail logo appears again:	END OF MESSAGE. Johnny shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder. 
ACE Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out. 
JOHNNY It's what I deserve. ACE Whad'ya talkin  about ? 
JOHNNY I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool. 
ACE You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around. 
Johnny smiles in spite of himself. 
JOHNNY Thanks, Ace. 
Johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin. Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him. 
73	EXT	LIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS 
arm their Marauder power suits. Zim and Bronski wear Command model suits with rank designations. Johnny checks weapons, scans the electronics on each squad member's power suit. 
ZIM With the Marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME CARE on my firing line. Do you get me ? 
RECRUITS Sir, yes, sir ! 
ZIM The live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide. If you do not hit your target, it will shoot you... 
Fifty blackened AUTOMATED TARGET DRONES fitted with pulse guns are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story building facades. 
ZIM The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ? 
JOHNNY Sir, yes, sir ! 
Johnny takes it in his mouth. His tear away shirt is torn away. Johnny stands at the post alone. Corporal Bronski, a big man with an unhappy task, unrolls his whip. 
C.O. You may carry out the sentence. 
BRONSKI One. CRACK !	Johnny's face wrenched by pain, spontanous tears, a terrible sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece. 
BRONSKI Two. CRACK !	Again. Dizzy flinches for Johnny. 
BRONSKI Three. 
CRACK !	Ace looks away. 
BRONSKI Four. 
CRACK !	Zim watches without any apparent emotion. 
BRONSKI Five. 
CRACK !	Johnny faints, sagging against his tether. 
FADE OUT

79	INT	ATHENA - COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT CYCLE - CARMEN 
works alone on the empty bridge. She yawns. Zander brings coffee for himself and Carmen. 
CARMEN Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever. 
ZANDER Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with. 
He caresses her hair. She kisses his hand. Zander notices the plot map. 
ZANDER Profile's wrong... there. 
CARMEN No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way. 
ZANDER Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ? 
CARMEN Hey, check it. 
Zander slides into his chair, runs a check. 
ZANDER You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said... 
CARMEN Don't change the subject. Am I right ? 
ZANDER Well, whad'ya know... 
CARMEN Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ? 
ZANDER She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together. 
CARMEN You and me, huh ? 
Zander turns his chair so they are very close, moves a finger along her hand, up her arm and playfully around her breasts. 
ZANDER I have a feeling about us. We're good together, way ahead of the curve in every department. I seem to be able to anticipate your needs. You know what I want... 
Carmen grabs him between his legs. 
CARMEN No, what do you want ? 
Zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately. She brteaks it off, gets serious for amoment. 
CARMEN I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet... 
ZANDER Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle. 
They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound. Captain Deladier appears on the hot screen, still waking up. 
DELADIER Report. 
ZANDER Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... 
Carmen and Zander frantically check their displays. 
CARMEN WHERE IS IT ? 
ZANDER THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG ! 
CARMEN It looks like an... asteroid. 
DELADIER In this part of the system ? 
Carmen and Zander see it through the front screens:		A huge ASTEROID tumbles directly towards them at terrific speed. 
MOTHER This time of the year...? 
The transmission ends abruptly. A phone company logo appears: TRANSMISSION TERMINATED. 
VU-PHONE VOICE Your transmission has been terminated due to atmospheric interference. Please try your call again later. 
Johnny zips his duffel, hefts it gingerly over his shoulder. 
JOHNNY Well, see ya. 
DIZZY You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny. 
JOHNNY What's that, Diz ? 
DIZZY That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen ! 
Dizzy turns on her heel and marches away. 
86	INT	THE C.O.'S OFFICE - DAY - JOHNNY 
signs form 1240/A. Zim stands as witness. 
C.O. Now you, Sergeant. 
Zim signs bitterly. The C.O. sighs. 
C.O. That's it, son. You can go. 
The C.O. and Zim turn to other things. Johnny picks up his duffel and heads out the door. 
87	EXT	PARADE GROUND - DAY - JOHNNY 
walks alone, sad. A skimmer hums by overhead and he looks after it. Out across the parade ground he sees the glint of Marauder power suits as recruits tumble the obstacle course. 
88	EXT	WASHOUT LANE -- DAY - JOHNNY 
reaches the little white fence that leads to the transporter. He turns back for one last look and notices people running to the Comminications shack. Kitten Smith runs by. 
JOHNNY Hey, Kitten, what's going on ? 
KITTEN It's war ! 
89	EXT	COMMUNICATION - DAY - JOHNNY 
joins others to see what's on the Federal Net. Recruits, non-coms, and officers gather	without any sense of military decorum. People cry openly, among them Corporal Bronski. 
OFFICIAL VOICE ... early estimates. Millions dead, a city in ruins... 
On screen, the smoldering ruins of what was once a huge city. 
JOHNNY Oh, jeez, is that Geneva ? 
KATRINA Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny. 
OFFICIAL VOICE ... Buenos Aires has been wiped of the Earth. Nothing lives in what was once called the Latin Paradise... 
Johnny is horrified. Dizzy is suddenly standing next to him. 
DIZZY Aw, Johnny, geez... It's home. 
OFFICIAL VOICE The Federal Court met moments ago and voted unanimously for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat. 
Johnny sets his jaw, turns and runs for the C.O.'s office. 
90	INT	C.O.'S OFFICE -DAY - THE C.O: AND ZIM 
and other staffers watch the grim news unfold. Animation illustrates the insect treachery. 
OFFICIAL VOICE The meteor derived from here, near Klendathu, in the Arachnid's home system... 
ZIM I'm serious, sir. I'll go anywhere. I want combat. 
C.O. Forget it, Zim. We're gonna need you here. The only way you'll get a combat assignment is if you bust yourself to private. You get me ? 
ZIM Yes, sir, I get you. 
C.O. What can I do for you, Rico ? 
JOHNNY Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir. 
C.O. Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal. 
JOHNNY Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. (then) Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir. 
Zim picks up Johnny's 1240/A off the C.O.'s desk. 
ZIM Is that your signature, Rico ? 
JOHNNY Sir, yes it is, sir. 
The veteran pays his tab and heads out. 
ACE I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together. 
JOHNNY What do I want with a scar ? 
DIZZY What, your skin's too pretty ? C'mon, everyone's doing it ! 
CARMEN (V.O.) Hey	Johnny !	Johnny Rico ! 
Johnny looks up and sees Carmen. She lloks graet in uniform with the hat and the lieutenant's bars on her shoulders. 
JOHNNY Carmen... ? 
Johnny remembers himself, snaps to attention, salutes. Dizzy and the others follow suit. Carmen salutes back, sheepish. 
CARMEN Oh... at ease. Guess I oughta lose the hat when I'm off duty, eh ? 
Dizzy, disgusted, turns back to Ace and Kitten Smith. Carmen tucks her hat under her arm. Her hair is very short. JOHNNY What happened to your hair ? 
CARMEN What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ? 
JOHNNY It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ? 
Carmen shakes her head, sadly. 
CARMEN It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying. 
JOHNNY I try just to be happy I'm still alive. 
CARMEN You don't look very happy to see me. 
JOHNNY Should I be ? 
CARMEN Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us. 
Zander leaves a group of FLEET OFFICERS to join them. 
ZANDER Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ? 
CARMEN Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now. 
Zander puts his arm around Carmen, gives her a squeeze. 
ZANDER Best in the Fleet ! 
JOHNNY I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ? 
Johnny turns to leave. 
CARMEN Johnny, wait... 
ZANDER Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. 
Johnny turns back to face Zander. 
JOHNNY You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ? 
ZANDER You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ? 
JOHNNY Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers. 
Everyone can see what's about to happen. A circle is forming, Fleet on one side, Mobile Infantery on the other. 
ZANDER Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here. 
CARMEN Zander, please... Let's go ! 
Zander takes off his hat. 
ZANDER It's alright. What's he gonna do ? 
WHAM !	Johnny punches him right in the nose. Zander goes down, bleeding. Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny. 
ACE Whoa, easy there, buddy... Nice punch. 
Zander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but Fleet Officers pull him back. Carmen looks at Johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist. 
CARMEN What's wrong with you ? 
JOHNNY Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch. 
Carmen turns away, stung. Johnny immediately regrets. Dizzy, for her part, couldn't be happier. 
DIZZY Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and Fleet weren't meant to mix ! 
98	INT	LASER PARLOR - NIGHT CYCLE - JOHNNY grinds his teeth as a laser mounted on a robot arm finishes slicing an intricate pattern into his arm. 
JOHNNY It hurts...! 
104	EXT	KLENDATHU - HIGH ATMOSPERE - NIGHT - THE CAPSULES 
burn when they hit atmosphere, outer skin tearing away in big silver sheets.

106	INT	RODGER YOUNG - COMMAND AND CONTROL - CARMEN 
watches nervously as deadly bursts of bug plasma fill the heavens around the battle group. Below, the surface of Klendathu fairly bistles with outgoing defensive fire. 
DELADIER This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...! 
ZANDER That's it, we're empty ma'am ! 
Out the front screens, a blast from below hits George Marshall amidships and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn. 
DELADIER Someone made a big goddam mistake ! Get us out of here, Number 1 ! 
Carmen dodges past burning ships, avoids collision with Dauntless, and then KA-WHAM !	they're hit. Carmen flies out of her station and into CAMERA hard. 
107	EXT	KLENDATHU - CLOUD LAYER - NIGHT - THE SECOND SKIN 
tears away. Johnny is sitting on air. 
GUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in fifteen seconds... deploying chute now... 
The chute pops. Across the sky, lit by outgoing bug plasma, he can see hundreds of cap troopers in ordered rows drifting down into the cloud layer. It's quiet in the clouds, then: 
108	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - FROM THE AIR - JOHNNY 
looks down as he passes out of the clouds and sees the battlefield. Plasma blasts exploode into the sky. THOUSANDS OF BUGS boil out of the ground to defend against the invader. 
GUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in five... four ... three... 
Johnny burns his chute off, drops the last hundred feet and lands on the bounce. 
109	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY'S POV - THE FLASH PULSE of bug batteries, screaming voices on the com, concussions shaking the ground. None of it compares to the sound of his own racing HEARTBEAT. Lieutenant Willy shouts. 
LIEUTENANT WILLY Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions from theAAAAAAAA ! 
A HOPPER (an airborne Arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and "pop out" wings for gliding) lands on Lieutenant Willy and cracks his head like a nut. 
ACE KILL IT ! 
Johnny and Ace open fire, backing away. Pulse rounds tear it apart, bug guts gushing. 
JOHNNY Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...? 
ACE I didn't see him ! 
Now comes a flood of WORKERS building ever advancing fortifications, and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS. 
KITTEN SMITH Here they come...! 
DIZZY Ace, what're we doing ? 
ACE I uh... uh... 
Dizzy and the others open fire simultanously. The whole area goes white hot in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects. 
SHUJUMI You want some ? Here's some ! C'MON ! 
JOHNNY Don't waste your ammon on the workers ! 
Shujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs. 
SHUJUMI AAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
He fights, screaming. A claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off. 
KATRINA Let's get out of here ! 
Now the ground opens behind her and a huge (6 meters) TANKER BUG lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes. 
DIZZY Look out ! 
The tanker bug sprays and hits Katrina. She screams, as her legs melt out from under her. 
KATRINA AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Warriors converge to feed on her. Ace wants to help her, but Johnny blocks him. 
JOHNNY C'mon, Katrina was right. We gotta get out of here ! 
110	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY 
The cao troopers let the bugs have it, but the insects keep coming, the living crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a TANKER BUG. 
JOHNNY WATCH OUT ! 
The tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole. Rasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus an arm, screaming. 
BIRDIE AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Johnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns with surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his pulse cannon. 
RASCZAK Sugar, in for pick up ! 
Rasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP ! The big bug explodes. 
RASCZAK Gas that hole and close it ! 
The Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down beside Rasczak. 
RASCZAK Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ? 
JOHNNY Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team. 
RASCZAK I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better. 
Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past to meet an arriving skimmer. 
RASCZAK Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes with a factory guarantee ! 
Dizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back. 
DIZZY Way to go, amigo ! 
JOHNNY I'm gonna need a squad leader. 
ACE No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material. 
JOHNNY What about it, Diz ? 
DIZZY (a snappy salute) Looks like I'm your girl, sir. 
Tac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air. Flaming debris rains down. 
RASCZAK Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's our trash ! 
Roughnecks head out on the bounce. 
126	EXT	TANGO URILLA - RIDGE - DAY - JOHNNY 
and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular pit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving. 
JOHNNY What kind of stinkin' bug is that ? 
Johnny jumps the magnification on his "head up". Down in the pit, a giant translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery. 
SUGAR WATKINS You never seen how they do it before ? 
Johnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly. 
ACE Agghh ! It's making me sick...! 
The plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction. 
SUGAR WATKINS It's gonna pop ! 
WOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew. 
GILLESPIE Sir, look ! 
Sergeant Gillespie points. A hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position. 
RASCZAK We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ? 
GILLESPIE Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...? 
Rasczak moves off down the line giving orders. 
RASCZAK Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower ! 
GILLESPIE Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir. 
RASCZAK They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ? 
DIZZY That'd be me, sir. 
RASCZAK Heat it up. 
Dizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL. 
RASCZAK Roughnecks, you may fire at will. 
is in holo conference with an INTELLIGENCE OFFICER 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement... 
RASCZAK I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P. 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment. 
RASCZAK Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed... 
The Intelligence Officer reddens. 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job. 
RASCZAK My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap- 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders ! 
VOICE (O.S.) That'll be all, Major. Dismissed. 
The Intelligence Officer disappears abruptly. A new hologram appears. Rasczak's jaw drops. It's his former student Carl Jenkins, now a Colonel, weary and pissed off. 
CARL This conference is over. Do your duty, Lieutenant. That's an order. 
Rasczak recovers, salutes stiffly. 
RASCZAK Yes, sir. 
132	INT	PRE-FAB SLEEPING UNIT - DAY - JOHNNY AND DIZZY 
are making love. The door pops open. Rasczak stands there. Dizzy ducks under the covers. Johnny manages a salute. 
RASCZAK Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics. 
JOHNNY Yes, sir ! 
RASCZAK Who's that with you ? 
Dizzy shows herself, grinning. 
RASCZAK Report in ten minutes. 
Rasczak slams the door shut on them. They fall back into one anothers arms, laughing as they resume lovemaking. 
DIZZY Planet P ? What kind of name is that ? 
JOHNNY They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. 
133	EXT	PLANET P - BAD LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS 
move through canyons of towering wind-carved rock formations. Gillespie carries the communications package. 
GILLESPIE I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder. 
RASCZAK Keep trying, Sergeant. 
134	EXT	CANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS 
walk in a column far below. Something is watching from the above... HOPPERS, lots of them, moving from rock to rock for better position. 
135	EXT	CANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - ACE sees something out of the corner of his eye. 
JOHNNY BUGS...! 
The hoppers hit. Several Roughnecks go down. Everyone opens up. Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits. Roughnecks set them on fire when they hit the ground. 
DIZZY Johnny, watch out ! 
A burning bug hurls itself at Johnny. Johnny jumps out of the way as Dizzy fires, blowing it apart. The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere above them in the rocks. 
RASCZAK LET'S GO ! ON THE BOUNCE ! 
136	EXT	FLAT LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS 
move out into the open. In the distance they see 4th Brigade HQ, a walled compound and partially constructed landing pad. 
RASCZAK Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ? 
GILLESPIE AAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Two hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs join to feast. 
RASCZAK Throw a rifle ! 
Dizzy tosses her Morita to Rasczak. Gillespie writhes in the hopper's claws. Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie. 
RASCZAK I expext any one here to do the same for me... Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy prepare for rear guard action. The rest of you make for 4th Brigade. 
Johnny and the others cover the Roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down on the flat lands from the canyon walls. 
RASCZAK The distress call... The bugs wanted us to rescue you...! 
GENERAL OWEN Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were biding their time... waiting for the most opportune moment ! 
Rasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com. 
RASCZAK To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak. Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are going to be attacked...! 
GENERAL OWEN They weren't gonna do it to me. Oh no ! I know too many secrets ! 
Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt. 
SUGAR WATKINS (O.S.) Fire in the hole ! 
An explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole. 
143	EXT	OFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - GENERAL OWEN 
blinks as he steps out into the light. Roughnecks snap to attention. General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and begins to keen, collapsing to his knees. 
GENERAL OWEN Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my boys and girls...! 
The Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before. Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard. 
LT. RASCZAK Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and you're not ! 
GENERAL OWEN I know... I wish you'd shoot me... 
LT. RASCZAK I oughta ! 
And it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down next to Johnny and Rasczak. 
ACE Lieutenant, we got trouble ! 
144	EXT	RAMPARTS - DAY - RASCZAK 
and Johnny join other stunned Roughnecks to see THOUSANDS OF BUGS on the march from every direction. Bug batteries open up in the distance. 
RASCZAK Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ? 
JOHNNY What's going on, Diz ? 
DIZZY (O.S.) I got power ! Gimme a minute ! 
Johnny runs for the communications room. 
JOHNNY We don't have a minute ! 
145	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - DAY - DIZZY

DIZZY What frequency ? 
JOHNNY All bands. 
DIZZY Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group... 
RODGER YOUNG (O.S.) This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear ! 
JOHNNY SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now ! 
RODGER YOUNG (O.S.) What is your position ? 
JOHNNY Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission ! 
RODGER YOUNG (O.S.) Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy ! 
JOHNNY Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy ! 
Johnny races out the door. 
146	EXT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE COMPOUND 
is white hot as Roughnecks on the walls unload nukes. Johnny crosses the compound, lands next to Rasczak on the wall. 
JOHNNY Boat coming down, sir ! 
The Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes. 
ROUGHNECKS I'm empty...all nuked out... Me, too ! 
Johnny scans the battlefield. Nukes have turned the surface into dark glass. Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath millions of marching feet. 
ACE Jeez, we musta killed a million already...! 
JOHNNY Not enough, I guess. 
Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below, stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers. 
slams into the cockpit. Out the front screen, violent bursts of BUG PLASMA fill the sky as they break atmosphere. 
JOHNNY Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock...! 
The co-pilot turns around. It's Zander. His eyes narrow. 
ZANDER On whose authority, Corporal ? 
JOHNNY This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission. 
The pilot turns around. It's Carmen. 
CARMEN Johnny...! I thought you were dead ! 
JOHNNY I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! 
Johnny leaves. Carmen punches up Fleet Command. 
CARMEN Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard Planet P-11... 
149	INT	BOAT - CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY returns to Dizzy's side as the medics struggle to save her. Blood pours out of her mouth. Her body thrashes. 
DIZZY JOHNNY HEH HEH CAN'T HEH BREATHE GOD JOHNNY CAN'T HEH HEH HEH HEH...! 
Dizzy dies. A Medic slaps her. Her head lolls, mouth open, eyes blank. They drop her and move on to the next casualty. Johnny sits there, stunned. Carmen enters from the cockpit. 
CARMEN Negative on your request. Fleet Command has the battle group on standby... 
Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck. 
CARMEN ...I'm sorry. 
JOHNNY We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit. 
CARMEN No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. 
She points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires. 
CARMEN I thought you were KIA, Johnny... 
JOHNNY That was just a mix up. 
CARMEN You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it. 
JOHNNY What happened to your eye ? 
Carmen touches the scar over her eye. 
CARMEN Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K. 
JOHNNY I like it. It's kinda...you.

ZANDER Where are you going ? 
CARMEN A funeral. 
ZANDER That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ? 
CARMEN Yeah. 
ZANDER How do you feel about him now ? 
CARMEN I don't know, Zander. 
ZANDER I do. 
152	INT	RODGER YOUNG - GUNNERY DECK - CARMEN 
enters as Johnny speaks. Dizzy is laid out in dress gray. The surviving Roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects. 
JOHNNY Dizzy bought the farm. She was my good friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets... But in war, we must go on without our friends. We take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death. Let me tell you what it is: Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting. 
Several INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS march into the bay. 
JOHNNY Officer on deck ! 
Everyone snaps to attention. Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room. His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, nods to Carmen. 
CARL Please continue, Sergeant. 
JOHNNY Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death. 
A HERCULES CARGO BOAT hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high ground Johnny has intended forb his H.Q. Johnny scowls, marches over to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER. 
JOHNNY Would'ya mind moving your boat ? 
FLEET OFFICER Better talk to the boss. 
The cargo bays open to deploy FLEET SKIMMERS. Zander jumps down to oversee the operation. 
JOHNNY You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant ! 
ZANDER This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ? 
JOHNNY You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down - 
Suddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty. Zander and Johnny share a look of concern. 
ZANDER Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! (to his crew chief) I'll take the first group. 
JOHNNY Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !

DELADIER Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order ! 
CARMEN No way, ma'am !

JOHNNY What's your problem now, Lieutenant ? 
ZANDER The Rodger Young just burned up... 
Johnny's face falls. 
JOHNNY Any survivors ? 
Zander points. Far in the distance, a glowing pod plummets toward the planet. Johnny tracks it on his "head up". 
Johnny and Zander stare each other down. 
ZANDER Let's go. JOHNNY Move out. 
Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and the others fall in behind him. 
ACE Bug hunt !

ACE Yes, sir ! 
Warriors appear in the tunnel behind them. 
JOHNNY Sugar, close the tunnel...!

Sugar Watkins fires an H.E. round and seals the tunnel. 
173	INT	BUG CITY - FEEDING PIT - DAY - CARMEN 
opens her eyes. She can hear BUGS CLICKING. She's in a pit filled with human dead. A nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade Off in the dark she hears HUMAN MOANING. 
She crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound. The moaning turns to SCREAMING. It's coming from outside the pit. She pulls herself up to peer over the edge. 
174	INT	BUG CITY - THE ROYAL COURT - DAY - CARMEN 
sees hundred of bugs at work, WARRIORS, WORKERS and dozens of small (2 meters) CHARIOT BUGS. Aworker walks pas, stepping on her, but pays her no attention. 
She sees the source of the screaming:	Captain Deladier is hold between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees, 
DELADIER NAAAAAAAA...! OH PLEASE... 
The BRAIN BUG is huge (5 meters) and pulpy. I has vestigial legs that cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of chariot bugs. 
DELADIER ...OH GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAA...! 
A thorn-like PALP unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes, driving deep into Deladier's head and sucks her brains out. 
DELADIER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Carmen watches horrified as Deladier dies. The suddenly a warrior grabs her from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into her limbs. 
CARMEN AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Now the brain bug comes for her. She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape. All she wants to do is die. 
Suddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen. Carmen hears it. A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. Johnny enters the chamber alone. 
The warriors move toward him. He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks. The warriors freeze. 
JOHNNY You know what this is...? 
Johnny makes an explosive sound. The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp. 
JOHNNY Sure you do... You're a big fat smart bug, aren't you ? 
Johnny moves toward Carmen. The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him. The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, his finger on the nuke's trigger. 
JOHNNY I'll take you with me. 
The Brain Bug clicks. The warriors back off. Carmen collapses. Johnny reaches for her. 
JOHNNY Take my hand ! 
Chariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole. Workers seal the hole behind it with amazing speed. Johnny drags Carmen back toward the tunnel he entered from. The warriors charge. 
JOHNNY Roughnecks...NOW ! 
Johnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into the chamber, guns blazing. The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to bug and Roughneck alike. 
Sugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off. Zander takes a claw through the gut. 
ZANDER AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
He blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves them back inside and keeps on fighting. A warrior rears up over Johnny and Carmen. 
JOHNNY Weapon ! 
Ace throws him a Morita. Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the bug's nerve stem. He struggles out from under the dead warrior. Every bug in the chamber is dead. 
JOHNNY Are you hurt ?

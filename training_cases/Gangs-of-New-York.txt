Gangs of New York 
Gangs of New York by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan. 3rd Draft (1993). More info about this movie on imdb.com INT. ROOM OLD BREWERY DAY 
Half in shadow, a man named VALLON, dressed in black, fastens a clean white clerical collar around his thick neck. He raises a jagged razor to his face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does not flinch. The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND we hear. VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelve years old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and excitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket. 
VALLON No. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son. 
He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father. From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son. Amsterdam squeezes tight. VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human. MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a hymn. 
CUT TO 
2 INT. HALLWAY 
VALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping up with him. They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches of LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched across his path. 
CUT TO 
3 INT. ROOM 
Another room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of a Madonna and child painted on the wall. A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethal point. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It occupies only half of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY. Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an unlucky rabbit. Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body. He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves. 
CUT TO 
4 INT. HALLWAY 
Jack falls into step beside VALLON and Amsterdam. He holds the pike with the dead rabbit high, next to VALLON's cross. 
HAPPY JACK Did you bring the boy for a charm, Priest? 
VALLON No, Jack. For a baptism. 
Now a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up by suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS. MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous. Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIOR wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of chain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it were a twig. 
RABBIT WARRIOR We'll send a few across the river today, Priest. 
He joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and half again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of destruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, like Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink. The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dart around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals frightened in a burrow. 
CUT TO 
5 INT. ROOM 
Vast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on... ... the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead. Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it as he stands up. He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew into his rat. Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or, more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries. Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after them. The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front: Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog. 
SHANG What's the fight? 
AMSTERDAM The Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans, same as ever. But it'll all be settled today. 
SHANG Are you Native or Rabbit? 
AMSTERDAM (points to rabbit on pike) What do you think? 
SHANG Looks alright. I'll stand by you, then. 
CUT TO 
6 INT. HALLWAY 
The group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel. In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN (MONK EASTMAN). VALLON stops near the door. 
VALLON 
I don't know you. 
MAN (lightly) I suppose there's to be a fight. 
VALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice. 
VALLON Derry? 
MAN Donnegal. Name's Monk Eastman. 
VALLON And you want to fight, Mr. Eastman? 
MONK lf there's money in it. 
VALLON Fight for the Natives. They have a proper war chest. 
MONK Well, I might at that. But I thought I'd ask you first, seeing as how I'm not quite a Native American myself. 
VALLON Let's see your skills, and we'll talk of payment later. 
MONK Fine. But if you like what you see, pay me double. Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHT streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man, in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes his head look even bigger. 
VALLON (as the door splinters settle) Stand with us then. 
CUT TO 
7 EXT. STREET DAY (WINTER) 
WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet. VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints Brewery. It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage. WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument erected to some forgotten war hero. The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or never came at all. VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His battalion of irregulars waits for his signal. Now... very, very slowly...from around both sides of the monument comes ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles. Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather. 
VALLON Bill Poole! on whose challenge are we assembled? A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward. He is young, lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is real. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved, instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE. 
On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight. They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team. 
BILL THE BUTCHER On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all who holds sway. 
VALLON Bene. 
BILL THE BUTCHER By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in our wounds. 
NEW YORK CITY 1844 
8 EXT. HARBOR DAY WINTER (MATTE) 
The same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look (MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city. The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north of the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity Church. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financial district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points . The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square. Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer buildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor. The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the creaking of masts in the winter WIND. 
CUT TO 
9 EXT. HARBOR DAY 
A closer view - The TITLE fades off. We see an imposing edifice on the edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: "IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA." The sun has nearly set. A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of the Castle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just about make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNY SIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness. Abruptly, he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. In SLOW MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current, each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle. 
POLICEMAN Where's your family, sonny? 
Johnny sees a POLICEMAN scrutinizing him. 
JOHNNY (lilting brogue) My mother's just there. 
He gestures toward a ship, where MEN are unloading cargo. In a hoist, they are lowering a thin pine COFFIN to dockside. 
JOHNNY On the trip, her insides all broke up. She wasn't dead and there was three others fighting for her bed. 
POLICEMAN And your father? Where's he, then? 
JOHNNY I never knew him. 
POLICEMAN (taking Johnny's hand) 
We better see to you, then. 
CUT TO 
10 EXT. STREET NIGHT 
The Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the TEEMING streets of the Five Points. 
POLICEMAN Where all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five Points. But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the Battery and the Bowery. Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up. SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall. In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for charity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE for a meager scrap of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a carriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of her face. 
POLICEMAN Streets hereabouts are lively of an evening. The city comes here to sport. But there's places to put up a boy on his own. 
Three WOMEN, exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall. Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longer striking. Johnny STARES; there is something not right about these faces. 
JOHNNY And those? What are those? 
POLICEMAN Well, those. Those are, as you might say, a sort of... 
We SEE one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: under thickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE. 
POLICEMAN ... sort of whatnot. 
TRANSVESTITE Say, policeman. I'll buy your bonny friend. 
The Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong WHACK with his nightstick. The Transvestite screams and falls ... and Johnny RUNS. 
POLICEMAN Hey! 
But Johnny's off, already lost in the mad street life. 
CUT TO 
INT. MORTUARY NIGHT 
A funeral chapel. 
Vallan's body lies in state. He is wearing his gang regalia, and all the Dead Rabbits FILE PAST his coffin in solemn tribute. A WOMAN bends down and kisses the body. Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which he has obviously inherited. As a disreputable looking Minister mutters PRAYERS, Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam. 
HAPPY JACK We passed the plate amongst ourselves. Come up with enough ned to carry all this, and carry you a while, too. 
He stuffs some money in Amsterdam's pocket. 
AMSTERDAM Where will my father rest? 
HAPPY JACK Potters Field, with everyone else. 
AMSTERDAM My father won't be buried with everyone else. He'll lie separate in fresh ground, facing east. 
HAPPY JACK What difference where he faces? 
AMSTERDAM He'll face east for the second coming of Christ. 
HAPPY JACK Fine, son. When Jesus gets to the Battery you show Him the way from there. 
The Minister finishes the service. MR. CORNELIUS, a funeral director who resembles one of his own customers, ushers in a WOMAN (MAGGIE) pulling a lovely 10 year old GIRL (JENNY EVERDEKNE) by the hand. The woman is obviously drunk, the girl frightened. 
MR. CORNELIUS Will you have music, entlegen 
WOMAN (MAGGIE) My daughter'11 do any song you like. 
HAPPY JACK Not tonight, Maggie, we got... 
Monk Eastman interrupts from the Background. 
MONK How much? 
MAGGIE Any ned in your pocket, sir. 
MONK hands MAGGIE some coins. 
MONK She sing sweet as she looks? 
MAGGIE Pure celestial, sir. (to girl) Go on, Jenny. 
AMSTERDAM Later. 
He turns with the plank in his hand and starts to RUN back through the crowd. 
JOHNNY Hey! 
Johnny manages to GRAB the other end of the plank. But Amsterdam's so strong he YANKS him right along. The Crowd YELLS as it parts for Amsterdam, who CHARGES through using the plank like a battering ram, with Johnny on the far end, born along by stubbornness and momentum... ... toward Mr. Cornelius' window. Amsterdam SHATTERS the window and the Crowd SCATTERS in a blizzard of GLASS. Amsterdam stumbles into the window and against the coffin, which falls over, spilling Vallon's BODY, knocking the boy over. Amsterdam picks himself up as Johnny stands frozen. 
AMSTERDAM Help me. 
He starts to pull his fatherls body from the window. 
AMSTERDAM Come on! Help me, goddamn it! 
In a daze, Johnny steps forward and HELPS Amsterdam pulls the body onto the street. 
Now: the SOUND of WHISTLES and WHEELS and RUNNING HORSES as a wagon full of POLICE arrives on the scene. Behind them, the Crowd returns, yelling insults. 
The police RUN toward the window. Mr. Cornelius dithers at the front of the crowd. 
Amsterdam and Johnny exchange a look. Then Johnny RUNS for it. Amsterdam stays with the body... 
... as the cops close in, SWINGING clubs. Amsterdam's grabbed and hit a couple of times. The Crowd yells. A COP swings his arm back to give Amsterdam a good wallop... 
... and someone grabs his arm: Bill The Butcher. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Easy, crusher. What's this all about? 
CRUSHER Ask the boy. 
AMSTERDAM I paid Cornelius for my father to rest in honor. He told me I had to wait on a permit, but he only wanted time to... 
BILL picks up the Tammany sign from the ground. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Make another Arrangement, looks like. For advertising. (to cop) Better go along. I'll see to all this. 
COP The boy... 
BILL THE BUTCHER Take the little malefactor. The Cops YANK the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and DRAG him off to their wagon. Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Give the boy what he paid for. 
CUT TO 
17 EXT. STREET/PARADISE SQUARE DAY 
Amsterdam is HURLED into the police wagon. The door is locked behind him. He pulls himselt to his feet, looks out the tiny barred window, SEES ... 
... Dead Rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession. SEVERAL help LOAD Vallon's body back into the coffin and place it onto Mr. Cornelius' fancy funeral wagon. Monk Eastman LEAPS up onto the wagon and closes the coffin lid tight. 
There are PEDDLERS everywhere. One dispenses drinks from a portable samovar. A SAILOR hawks ships in a bottle, repeatedly shouting the same advertisement: "Encourage the work of a landswamped sailor!" A SILHOUETTE ARTIST offers to draw portraits of passersby. Funeral music is furnished by STREET MUSICIANS: a drummer, a fiddle player, and a horn player, with a couple of BUSKERS performing along side for good measure. Mr. Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the square. The gang FOLLOWS solemnly behind. 
And across the square, the police wagon carrying Amsterdam starts MOVING OFF in the opposite direction. He keeps looking out the tiny wagon window. The funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to normal. Peddlers' CRIES once again fill the air. The Buskers start PLAYING a snappier tune. SNOW begins to fall. 
CUT TO 
18 INT- TOMBS DAY 
A huge, awful prison building modeled on an Egyptian mausoleum. Amsterdam--trying to hide his growing fear--waits on line with other PRISONERS, all of them older than he. At the head of the line, prisoners are being processed by a JAILER and a couple of COPS. Each prisoner is asked several cursory questions, then told to strip. Every one of the men is SCARRED in some way. AMSTERDAM nears the front of the line. The MAN just ahead of him undresses. His left buttock is missing, and his back is covered with whip scars. A PRISONER behind Amsterdam WHISPERS loud enough for Amsterdam to hear... 
PRISONER Ain't his first Tombs trip. 
ANSTERDAM steps up to the desk. The JAILER hardly takes notice of him. 
JAILER What do they call you? 
And this is the first time in the film we have heard his name. 
AMSTERDAM Amsterdam. 
The JAILER looks him over. 
JAILER Your full name. 
AMSTERDAM Vallon. 
The JAILER writes this down with a scratchy pen. 
JAILER First name? 
AMSTERDAM I told you. 
JAILER (skeptical, resigned) Address? 
AMSTERDAM Got none. 
JAILER I'll put city. Now what's your age? (Amsterdam shrugs.) Maybe twelve. Got a family? 
AMSTERDAM No more. 
JAILER Well, where was they from when you had one? 
AMSTERDAM (beat) City. 
JAILER (writing) Disrobe. 
As Amsterdam obeys, the Jailer turns to the Cop in the leather helmet standing at his side. 
JAILER What's the charge, Asbury? 
COP Theft. Assault. Creating a ... 
BOSS TWEED But you don't understand at all. 
Bill keeps walking. 
BOSS TWEED There's a whole city to share and all you see is your own narrow streets. 
BILL THE BUTCHER (turns now) You just stay out of my place. 
BOSS TWEED Yes, alright. Gladly. It's all blackjack jobs and panel games and killings for a fiver. 
Bill waits for Tweed to continue. But Tweed stoops and tries to soothe a canary in a cage. 
BILL THE BUTCHER It's good work. 
BOSS TWEED As far as it goes. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You wouldn't be talking to me otherwise. 
BOSS TWEED But we're talking about different things, Bill. You describe the present. I see the possibilities. Look to the future. There is so much more. 
The Butcher starts to look interested. 
CUT TO 
25 INT. TWEED'S OFFICE NIGHT 
Later. The Natives have cleared out; only Tweed and the Butcher remain. The cages have been restored to their proper places and the room has been straightened. Bill stands beside the door, while Tweed relaxes in a chair. 
BOSS TWEED There's things demanding to be done that no police force can do, not even an obedient one. There's contributions from every dive and brothel. Loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected. 
BOSS TWEED (Cont'd) And now you and your Natives have emerged as the foremost force in the Five Points, I'm prepared to extend you an opportunity. You can work for Tammany... 
BILL THE BUTCHER We work for no one. 
BOSS TWEED ... beside Tammany... in the performance of these civic obligations. And for a satisfactory... I'm prepared even to say equitable... financial participation. It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized. But then, the founding fathers never imagined the city New York has become. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and muscle work. Might build you up. 
BOSS TWEED We'd like to. I do miss it. But it's wiser for men in the public life to give an appearance of probity. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Then get cops to do it. 
BOSS TWEED Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while it's being broken. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Appearance means nothing. 
BOSS TWEED Perhaps not within the Points. But the smart man could go higher. 
Bill looks at Tweed for a long moment. The he SHOVES himself away from the wall, pulls away the chair on which Tweed has been resting his feet and sits down close to him. 
BILL THE BUTCHER If you can talk plain, maybe we can do business. 
26 EXT. STREET NIGHT 
A small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid FIRE-WAGON labeled "Americus Co./Tammany Hall." Curious SPECTATORS and panic-stricken RESIDENTS crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in FLAMES. As Johnny presses through the crowd to get a good look at the fire, Tweed, in a white coat and fancy fire helmet, steps off the fire wagon to address an ONLOOKER. 
TWEED Anyone inside? 
ONLOOKER No, praise God, but all we own... 
TWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity, then sits on it. 
ONLOOKER Well? 
TWEED Waiting on reinforcements. 
The SOUND of another bell, nearby. Down the street from the opposite direction come TWO MORE FIRE-WAGONS. The crowd starts cheering. Tweed does not move from the plug. 
TWEED That's not them. It's only the Black Jokes. Seems your fire interrupted their festivities. 
The wagons pull up next to the fire plug. Each of them has the words "Black Joke Fire Co." written large on the side, but the FIREMEN wear party costumes, not regular uniforms. Some are dressed as British Redcoats, still others as Indians. The FLAMES continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from the plug. He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an Indian chief. 
CHIEF May I point out that the building is burning to ashes? 
TWEED Certainly. And may I then remind you, Pocahontas, that this entire area is the province of the Americus company, and you will kindly keep your distance. Impasse. The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each other. The building continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed atop the fire plug. As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second BELL sounds. Tweed's "reinforcements" have arrived: the Native Americans, led by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt. Now the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK. As the Crowd CHEERS, Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug. 
TWEED Alright, boys! To work! 
The MEN of the Americus Co. give a great SHOUT and start firefighting: a hose is hitched up to the plug, buckets are filled, a primitive pump sends water spluttering everywhere. But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow frustrated. Tweed realizes this immediately. 
TWEED Next building over, boys! Mustn't let it spread! 
The men charge into a neighboring building, STOMPING down doors, CLIMBING through windows and SWINGING AXES with gusto, all to save a building that is in no danger at all. A local poll named DANIEL KILLORAN detaches himself from the crowd and approaches Tweed, giving him a hearty SLAP on the back. 
KILLORAN Another proud night for Tammany, Bill. 
TWEED Just tell them... (lowers his voice) ... to take enough to share. And not to steal so in the open. 
Indeed, the Men are leaving the building with lots of LOOT. CITIZENS who question their right to do this are promptly KNOCKED DOWN. Killoran GRABS Bill The Butcher as he rushes by. 
TWEED Jesus! Boss says to tell you to fight the fire from the front and loot out the back. 
Bill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry WOMAN approaches Tweed. 
TEARFUL WOMAN The Black Joke could have saved my house! 
TWEED Black Joke had no business here, Madam. 
TEARFUL WOMAN Their business was to save my house! 
TWEED Tammany's your business. When we're here to call upon there's no need of other. We understand loss, Madam, and take care of our own. 
SHEENY MIKE We can't go back to Corlears Hook, they'll be watching... 
SHANG We'll make for Blackwells. 
JIMMY SPOILS And which way's that through this fog? 
Johnny throws his hands up for quiet. From close by comes the SOUND of COP'S VOICES. They are near. Very near. The boys stay as still as they can... ... and the VOICES recede again in the thick fog. 
JIMMY SPOILS Should have asked them directions as they drifted by, Shang. 
SHANG You'd have liked that, wouldn't you Coal Face? You're the only one they'd miss in the dark. 
SHEENY MIKE Let's quiet, or we'll all be found out! 
As the BOYS stay still, their boat DRIFTS against an outcropping of land and STOPS. 
SHANG Alright. We lay up here till first light. Then we run back across the river. 
JIMMY SPOILS (contemptuously) River pirates! 
Spoils settles back and tries to sleep. Johnny watches Shang in the bow. Shang is too agitated to notice Johnny's stare. He looks away, waiting for the sun. 
CUT TO 
34 EXT- BLACKWELLS ISLAND DAWN 
Shang drowses in the boat, fighting fatigue, then succumbing to it. But h's brought awake suddenly by a loud SPLASH. He looks in the direction of the noise, SEES ... ... the BODY of the slaughtered ship's captain floating away in the company. He starts to cry out but Amsterdam GRABS him, locking his throat in the crook of his arm. 
AMSTERDAM (to everyone) 
Push off! Or his pipe snaps! The other boys are too stunned to resist. They push the boat away from the island. 
AMSTERDAM Head straight out, then turn for the current. 
He pushes Shang away from him. The two boys stare at each ather, finally remembering... 
SHANG (breathing hard) Figured you for dead. 
AMSTERDAM Close enough. 
SHANG This is my crew. And welcome to join, if you've the mettle. We're river pirates and quick thieves and street brawlers... 
AMSTERDAM (casual disdain) You're lost. 
SHANG Yeah? You've no business saying anything against us! Do you know how much you cost us? You know how much that body's worth? 
AMSTERDAM I doubt it's worth the water it's floating in. 
SHANG Fifteen dollars! Fifteen dollars from them medical ghouis. 
AMSTERDAM I'll make it back for you whatever it is, once we're in the city. Just keep sailing, or we're all done for. 
SHANG (beat; to crew) Go ahead then. (beat; to Amsterdam) He was in his prime. He'd have fetched thirty dollars easy. 
CUT TO 
35 INT. HIDEOUT DAY 
A ramshackle room near the docks. It is part meeting hall, part living quarters for the gang, and part clearing house forstolen goods. SHANG presides over a boisterous meeting. 
JIMMY SPOILS You're as flat as Broadway going north. We can't run the river no more. We're poaching the Natives and the Harbor cops are looking for us. 
SHANG The cops can go to blazes. Who cares about them? 
SHEENY MIKE Youlre all sand when it comes to cops, Shang. But do you have the sand to go against the Natives? 
SHANG It ain't the time to go against the Natives. We've got to build first. Then we go. 
JIMMY SPOILS If we go like we did in the river, all of us'll sink. 
Amsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with contemptuous detachment. Johnny sits next to him. 
AMSTERDAM Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives? 
JOHNNY I don't know. He acts like it. 
AMSTERDAM If he only acts, held be better on the stage. (looks away) Like her. 
His tone of voice has changed. Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's ravishing. Amsterdam STARES, as if he's trying to see into her heart. Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang. 
JOHNNY Jenny Everdeane. Shang turned her into the best bludget in the Points. 
Jenny gives Shang silk scarfs, wallets and several purses from her coat. 
AMSTERDAM Shes his mort, is she, as well as his best provider? 
JOHNNY Yeah. But Jenny says she's anyone's she chooses. 
Jenny's haul is impressive. Shang picks a BRIGHT RED SILK SCARF with a distinctive PAISLEY design from the pile of stolen goods. He examines it with a shrewd, appreciative eye. 
SHANG That's the prize of the month. Spice Islands silk. 
He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH, then throws his arm about Jenny in a proprietary way. 
SHANG You'll learn our way if you're going to be one of us, Amsterdam. 
Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now. 
SHANG Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang. Morts more than men, being morts. 
AMSTERDAM Yeah? And why is that? 
Johnny STOPS and Amsterdam continues on by himself. 
CUT TO 
39 INT. MAIN ROOM/OLD BREWERY 
Echoing. Dank. Amsterdam holds a candle high for light. RATS skitter. He crosses the main floor, enters one of the side tunnels. 
CUT TO 
40 INT. ROOM/OLD BREWERY 
A tiny room we recognize from the first scene: this is the place where Amsterdam lived with his father. He crouches and TEARS UP some floorboards, then quickly LOWERS HIMSELF into the hole. 
CUT TO 
41 INT. UNDER FLOOR/OLD BR.EWERY 
A short tunnel under the Brewery floor, the kind a kid might make. Amsterdam has trouble crawling through it. DIRT and ROCK sprinkle him until he finds what he wants stuck in a shallow hole; a battered leather MONEY PURSE; and a PAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE. 
Amsterdam snaps open the purse to make sure the little bit of MONEY is still there, then turns his attention to the package. He TEARS it open. Inside is the PIRATE KNIFE that Bill the Butcher used to kill Amsterdam's father. 
Amsterdam handles the knife carefully as he opens it. The candle light makes the blade GLEAMS. 
CUT TO 
42 EXT. ALLEY/OLD BREWERY DAY 
A shock of summer SUNLIGHT as Amsterdam emerges from one of the back entrances of the Brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted barrels, broken glass and insensible drunks. 
Amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley, letting his eyes adjust to the bright light. Ahead of him, he SEES ... 
Shang Draper, in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not recognize. The man is bareheaded, and has a deep scar running back to front clear down the center of his bald head. Amsterdam waits, WATCHES. 
Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it to the Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded a business deal, and the Second Man walks away. 
Amsterdam PRESSES himself close to the door as Shang LOOKS AROUND... doesn't see Amsterdam... and walks off in the opposite direction, across Paradise Square. 
CUT TO 
43 INT- RECEPTION ROOM AND TWEED'S OFFICE DAY 
The main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange. Bill the Butcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated political dealings of dubious virtue. 
Bill knocks on the door to Tweed's private office while he's opening it. Inside is Boss Tweed, seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive sauna. Around him are various PETITIONERS, and his assistant Daniel Killoran. 
TWEED I dread city stimmers. They bring illness and beget vermin. 
PETITIONER #l (GLEASON) My plague box fends off all pestilence. Its elixir combats ill humors... 
KILLORAN We can't have every citizen of the Five Points boxed up like cargo. 
TWEED But the season is vicious, and I must take thought of our constituents. Mr. Gleason, I'd like you to shake hands with Mr. Barnett Baff... 
Gleason, dubious, shakes hands with PETITIONER #2 as Bill the Butcher looks on with amusement. 
TWEED A friend and owner of an estimable carting service. Work out an arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of Mr. Gleason's wondrous elixir outside this excellent box. At a cost, Mr. Gleason, of how much the barrel ... 
GLEASON (figuring rapidly) Oh, perhaps twenty-five dollars. 
TWEED ...and how much, Mr. Baff, for haulage and distribution... 
BAFF The same again. At least. 
TWEED At least. That's a price of fifty dollars. And greedy, low piracy at that (Gleason and Baff splutter) But a price that Tammany, in its generosity, will meet. Merely submit a bill for a hundred. We'll each have half. And I'll retain this box for further experiment. Hello, Bill. 
Killoran LEADS the astonished Gleason and Baff away as Bill APPROACHES. 
TWEED Bolt the door. 
Bill complies. As Tweed speaks and the anti-plague VAPORS SWIRL around his head, he keeps his eyes closed. 
TWEED Scotchy Lavelle's gone wrong in his accounts. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I know. Scotchy's a good man. 
TWEED Not good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from Sparrow's and use it for his own. (opens his eyes) You got to give him over, Bill. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I can't do that. No matter what he steals, I still get more from him than any two others. As do you. 
TWEED Alright then. What about Charles McGloin? He's running a panel game off to one side. Did you know that? (Bill shrugs) I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens pouring in here complaining about crime and corruption all over the Points. They accuse Tammany of carelesoness. Some even suspect ... a few practically suggest. (eying Bill significantly) ... our complicity with this rampant criminality. We must show them Tammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an example. BILL THE BUTCHER (beat) Charles McGloin will do. 
TWEED I'll set the trial for Friday. 
CUT TO 
44 EXT- TOMBS DAY 
CAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slits that pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underway directly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for the gallows by having a hood tied to his head. 
The CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS, "HOKEY-POKEY" (i.e., ice cream) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to the holiday spirit. 
Jenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups of raucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with a GENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on. 
Further back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her go through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION as he realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in the Five Points. He starts to FOLLOW her. 
Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's so intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform, the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd. 
ASSISTANT HANGMAN Those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward. 
44 CONTINUED: 
CUT TO 
47 EXT. BROADWAY DAY 
As Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's main thoroughfare. 
JENNY Are you a spy, then? 
AMSTERDAM Got no one to spy for. I'm an appreciator, you might say. 
JENNY Appreciator of what? 
AMSTERDAM A good touch. 
She STOPS in the street, looks him straight in the eye. 
JENNY Don't bother with the chat. If you want me, we come to a business arrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide how you suit me. Then I do it or not. 
AMSTERDAM Just take a minute, I was Just... 
JENNY I know what you was just. I had years already of what you was just. You know how I got so good at thieving? So's I wouldn't have to lay down for everyone who had the ned. Now I do it when I want to for how much I want to. Otherwise I don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell with anyone's rules but my own. AMSTERDAM What about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your day, the better his. It don't seem gute right. 
JENNY (a little curious now) What's it to you? 
AMSTERDAM Give him this. 
He hands her the RED SILK SCARF. She recognizes it instantly as the same one she gave Shang. 
AMSTERDAM 
And you can keep a little more of what you earned. 
JENNY How'd you come by this? 
AMSTERDAM I got my own touch. 
JENNY Are you making me a present, or making an Arrangement? 
AMSTERDAM It's your rules, right? So you decide. 
She looks at him for a moment, then starts to TIE the scarf around her neck like a kerchief. 
CUT TO 
48 INT. HIDEOUT 
A gentlemen's WALLET skims across a pitted wooden table, straight into Shang's hand. Jenny is giving him her CUT. He opens the wallet, looks up at Jenny. No more goods are forthcoming. Amsterdam, hanging back, watches them both. 
Shang SEES the RED SILK SCARF, tied around her neck. 
SHANG Pretty slim cut for a hanging day. Where'd you get that? 
JENNY From Amsterdam. 
SHANG (beat) It don't suit you. 
CUT TO 
49 EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT 
A SWELTERING evening. The streets are jammed with REVELERS and RESIDENTS. Some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air. Happy Jack Mulraney leads a group of apprehensive UPTOWN CITIZENS past drunks and whores. 
JACK Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions. 
CITIZEN Nothing but our safety, of course. 
JACK All's snug around Paradise Square in my company, squire. See there. 
He gestures toward the street, down which one oi Mr. Barnett Baff's CARTS is being drawn by a team of WHEEZING NAGS. 
The cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as "an anti-pestilence influenza-thwarting solution... a service of Tammany Hall." As the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing RESIDENTS, HOSES spurt waves of solution all over the streets. Many people are SOAKED. Jack and his Citizens jump back just in time.' 
JACK Tammany makes the streets nanitary, I make 'am safe. 
WOMAN CITIZEN (apprehensive) Even against them? 
A small distance behind the anti-plague cart, moving in rough formation, come some of Shang's mob, heading aimlessly across the Square cruising for action 
JACK Against them especially. Let me demonstrate. 
Jack takes out his GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN, which he HANGS carefully over a nearby lamppost. Then, very casually, he leads the Citizens off. 
JACK We'll be back for this at our leisure. 
WOMAN CITIZEN You dare leave it here? 
JACK Safe as a vault, lady. Since all knows it's mine. 
The Gang draws abreast of the lamppost. No one makes a move to take the watch until one of the YOUNGEST BOYS reaches out ... but 
Shang knocks his hand away. Jack, at a distance, NODS approvingly. 
SHANG You know that's Jack's. 
BOY So what? 
AMSTERDAM It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then. Not here, like some war flag. SHANG That watch is a small price for free run of the Points. 
AMSTERDAM If it's free, how come we pay so much? Wo shouldn't pay for what's our due. 
SHANG We don't tight when we don't have to. It's not warring that counts. It's the living day to day. 
AMSTERDAM This mob ever have a proper name? 
JOHNNY We was called after Shang when we was named at all. 
AMSTERDAM We're the Dead Rabbits from now. They were the best. They were history. They were legend, and we'll live up to them. 
CUT TO 
55 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT 
Amsterdam sits on an empty pier, watching the ships in the river. There's a SUDDEN RUSTLING NOISE as a NOOSE coils around his neck. 
It's Jenny. She's slipped the SILK Amsterdam gave her close to his throat, and she's TIGHTENING it. Amsterdam starts to resist. Then he sees how's she's looking at him. 
She uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers. She KISSES him. 
AMSTERDAM What's this then? 
JENNY Payment for the silk. 
Then DROPS the silk from his throat and starts to touch him. Then his hands are under her skirt. Then, under the cloudy moonlight, they start to make love. 
CUT TO 
56 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT 
Later. Amsterdam pulls Happy Jack's uniform COAT over Jenny to keep her warm in the chill air. 
JENNY You were waiting for me out here, weren't you? 
AMSTERDAM Maybe I was, yeah. 
JENNY You was that sure of me? 
AMSTERDAM Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting don't cost nothing. 
JENNY It don't do to be sure. I could go away just as easy. 
AMSTERDAM Alright. 
He sweeps the coat away from her body, allowing her to leave. 
JENNY I'll say when I want to, not you. 
AMSTERDAM Stay then. (beat; smile) One way or another, I get what I want. 
JENNY (looking at him) Yeah. If it was just a shag you wanted. 
AMSTERDAM You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune? Go ahead then. Tell me what I'm wanting. 
JENNY You got blood in your eye for someone. 
AMSTERDAM It's just I can't look away, that's all. 
JENNY Who from? 
AMSTERDAM Bill Poole. 
JENNY You better get someone else in your sights. No one's ever taken him. 
AMSTERDAM 'Cause he's mine, that's why. I'll take his one eye, and then the rest of him, piece by small piece. 
JENNY You have a plan for this? You going to raise a militia? I'll wager Bill the Butcher don't even know about you or care if he does. 
AMSTERDAM He'll know about me soon enough. 
JENNY And after the Butcher? 
AMSTERDAM You. 
JENNY Is that so? 
AMSTERDAM You'll be in love with me. 
JENNY Love you? You just had me. You can have a mort any time you want. So why look for more than that. 
AMSTERDAM That's taking love, not giving it. I want it to be just you and me, no one else for either. 
JENNY Why? 
AMSTERDAM 'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other. 
JENNY I don't know I want to mean something, to you or anybody. Can there be good in that? 
He stares at her. 
AMSTERDAM We'll see. 
Jenny pulls the coat tighter around her. 
JENNY It'll take a while if we do. If we ever do. 
AMSTERDAM And what about the meantime? 
JENNY Meantime's business. 
CUT TO 
57 EXT PARADISE SQUARE DAY 
A CROWD gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points. A beefy SPEAKER is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James W. Barker, a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the Know-Nothing Party. Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's unsavory likeness. A couple of BUSKERS provide a musical score for the political spiel. 
PAGODA SPECTATOR Watch this careful. I've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's Museum. 
The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED. Bill has one weapon left... in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's his CLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment. 
The Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. The only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the Groper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver. 
Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing, figures distance .... and starts THROWING it in the air... 
... CATCHING it by the handle ... then throwing it again... higher, FASTER and HARDER with every toss. 
BILL THE BUTCHER (in full control) What's it so quiet for? I don't need quiet. 
The Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH... 
... and Bill catches the cleaver again. But EVERY TIME he throws it and every time he catches it by its handle ... 
... he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper. Now... standing very close... he gives the cleaver a mighty toss ... 
... sending it SPINNING high in the air... up past the cages ... past the second-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators ... until it SLOWS ... seems to HANG in the air... then starts its descent... 
... FALLING FASTER... towards Bill's waiting, STEADY HAND. 
The Groper SCREAMS in fear. Bill SMILES confidently, holding his hand out until ... just as smoothly, just as confidently... 
... he PULLS his hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact on the SPLAYED HAND of the Groper, cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist. The Groper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bill's amazing feat. One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand. 
Bill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese Dancer. 
BILL THE BUTCHER There's for your beauty and your song. 
The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF. Bill TOSSES the hand to the floor and walks back to his table. The Crowd PARTS, murmuring compliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN the Butcher's implements. 
Now two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd and FIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand. 
The Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE: the Groper's unconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand. The Crowd looks like a wave bearing the body toward the door. The Groper's stump BLEEDS on them as he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable sacrament. 
Bill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and is about to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others. 
AMSTERDAM Mr. Poole! 
Bill turns, searching out the voice ... 
AMSTERDAM Bill Poole! 
And SEES Amsterdam, standing at his own table. His attitude is calm, smiling, respectful. But his eyes are demonic. 
AMSTERDAM My compliments on your exhibition, sir. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Thank you, sir. 
AMSTERDAM It was like watching a dance. (Bill nods his thanks) Some great grand goddamned dance. (Bill looks at him more closely) You know me, sir. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Do I? Are you missing a finger? 
Appreciative laughter from the crowd. 
AMSTERDAM No. A father. 
The laughter turns a little uneasy. Bill the Butcher sizes up the younger man. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Do you have a name? 
AMSTERDAM Amsterdam. 
BILL THE BUTCHER That's a New York name. (suddenly smiles) shall we drink to it? 
AMSTERDAM Indeed. (they drink) And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that? 
BILL THE BUTCHER Priest Vallon's son? (Amsterdam nods) Of course I'll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man. 
AMSTERDAM Not worthy of you. Those dogs ain't worthy of you. You ain't worth what they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you. 
DEAD QUIET. Absolute. Breathless. Only the Chinese Gamblers at their fan-tan ignore this confrontation. 
BILL THE BUTCHER What do you want, boyo? 
AMSTERDAM I got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father. 
Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill his father almost 12 years before. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport. Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch. 
And Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his hand like lightning. 
And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glasses flying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD... 
... and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the table at Amsterdam...sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING. 
Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill the Butcher... 
... who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each other... 
... PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam. 
And neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaks the Butcher's CLINCH... HITS him once in the face... then a second time ... and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers. 
And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Still arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor below, sees the fight... and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny WATCHES her go ... looks at the fight again, for a second... then follows Jenny to the main floor. 
The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head with the wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN. 
In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike. 
JENNY Go easy! Go easy. It's over. 
JOHNNY He knew what he was doing, hitting you. 
JENNY Let's get him up. 
She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back to his feet. 
JENNY (Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face) Therels too damn little of him left to know anything. 
They start across Paradise Square, holding him up... 
... as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them... all growing smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the Five Points... 
... and the Bouncer CLOSES the door. 
DISSOLVE TO 
66 INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY 
Another DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or so has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face still shows the marks of Bill's beating. 
Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor, giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos says .... 
DON WHISKERANDOS Someone's here for you. 
MONK EASTMAN That so? What's he look like? 
DON WHISKERANDOS He looks pretty damned sorry. 
MONK EASTMAN (looks at Amsterdam) Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave? 
AMSTERDAM No thanks. 
MONK EASTMAN Face is too sore, eh? I understand. 
AMSTERDAM No. I'm beholden enough to you as it is. I don't like to be beholden. 
MONK EASTMAN We're all even, son. There's nothing more between us. 
AMSTERDAM I'd like it if there was. 
MONK EASTMAN Are you proposing employment? 
AMSTERDAM A collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make another move. I figure you're the one to make us strong. There's a lot we can learn from you. 
MONK EASTMAN Boyo, I'm a freebooter and a mercenary, not a teacher. I can't learn nothing from you and I can't earn nothing from you either. 
AMSTERDAM The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again. We're going to reign over the Points. 
MONK EASTMAN And Bill Poole's Natives? What will they have to say? 
AMSTERDAM Nothing. They won't have tongues left to speak. 
MONK EASTMAN Don't worry about what theylll have in their mouths. You think about what they got in their hands. (beat) Listen, son... take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your father. Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance. Anger spoils an edge. 
AMSTERDAM Then you say no? 
Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honor above the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, like NOTCHES- 
MONK EASTMAN You see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and fifty cents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight more notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can accommodate you alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it on your own. 
AMSTERDAM Everything I got is still to come. So I guess it's on my own, then. 
MONK EASTMAN Fair enough. You'll find independence a fine thing, a fierce thing. Although I do hold money preferable to all. (Amsterdam turns to leave) 
But I'm sure we'll have news of each other. 
AMSTERDAM Bound to. 
As he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to Don Whiskerandos for another hot towel. 
CUT TO 
67 EXT. STREETS OFF PARADISE SQUARE DAY 
A large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks of coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the front seat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweed distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon. 
BOSS TWEED (to the people as they grab the coal) Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your heart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote of all you good people... 
As he continues, Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits down beside him. Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You sent me word. 
BOSS TWEED We could use help here. Grab a sack. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I keep my hands clean. 
BOSS TWEED (now he looks at him) So I've observed. 
BILL THE BUTCHER (tense) Better be on your mark to talk like that to me. It was you stopped me at the Pagoda. I would have cut Monk inside out. 
BOSS TWEED What if you hadn't? Think of the embarrassment. And what if you had? Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead and make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails. 
BILL THE BUTCHER It touches my heart how you always. have our best interests in mind. 
BOSS TWEED Our mutual interests. That's why I want you to contact Monk Eastman. (Bill's incredulous) I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US. 
BILL THE BUTCHER What? 
BOSS TWEED Oh, not Tammany, of course not. We could no more have him there than you. But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our Arrangement and ... well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us all. 
Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects each with the composure of a princess. 
Now it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and stands behind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room's tense... until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head. 
Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, he walks back to the GANG. 
Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyes fixed on Jenny. 
Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS her head. Yes. Him. 
A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds out her arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as other COUPLES join them. 
AMSTERDAM So you accept? 
JENNY What? 
AMSTERDAM You accept to be my mort and no one else's. 
JENNY (teasing) No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got some of the face the Butcher gave you. 
AMSTERDAM (going along with the joke) It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around. 
JENNY Maybe you'll look better later. 
The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers, distributing LIGHTED CANDLES, which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around the floor. 
AMSTERDAM I will if we're together later. (she smiles) And what about after that? After tonight? 
JENNY I chose you just for tonight. If that's not good enough I'll go with someone else. 
She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light FLICKERS on Amsterdam's face. 
AMSTERDAM I'll have tonight. But after this don't come to me no more till you're ready. No more. 
His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. Jenny NODS and they DANCE AWAY ... 
... losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding candles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a study in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OF YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet. 
CUT TO 
70 INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT 
In the hallway. JOHNNY stands pressed against a door. 
JOHNNY (whispering) Amsterdam. (louder; hissing) Amsterdam! 
AMSTERDAM (V.O.) Who is it? 
JOHNNY Me. 
AMSTERDAM Come on in. 
JOHNNY I don't want to come in! You come out. 
AMSTERDAM Just a damn minute. 
AMSTERDAM comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy. We see Jenny asleep on the floor inside. 
AMSTERDAM What do you want? 
CUT TO 
71 EXT. PIER/DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT 
Just before dawn. The streets are empty, the river is quiet. AMSTERDAM follows JOHNNY out of the house. 
JOHNNY I'm going to fight you. 
AMSTERDAM Oh, Jesus, Johnny, I'm tired. How about sometime else? 
JOHNNY Now. 
AMSTERDAM You want to tell me what this fight's over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny? (Johnny turns, determined) Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this? 
JOHNNY So when I lose no one will see. 
And he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAM stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knocking him down. 
The two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such extravagant energy that they soon... 
... ROLL OFF the pier... 
CUT TO 
72 EXT. PIER DAWN 
... onto the muddy ground underneath the pier. They LAND with a shuddering SPLASH in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting .... 
... as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like wild beasts disturbed in their burrow. 
Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill. But Johnny has the fury. All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically, making the match nearly even. 
The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or emotion, just an edge of curiosity. 
Amsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one knee in the mud. But Johnny will not go down. Amsterdam, hurt himself, just stares at Johnny in wonderment. 
AMSTERDAM Satisfied? 
JOHNNY Satisfied? It wasn't me that's been dancing and shagging all night. 
And he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who half-staggers out of the way. The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he falls in the mud again, this time on all fours. Amsterdam SINKS down beside him. 
BOSS TWEED I suppose you can at that. Take with one hand, flay with the other. Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart. 
Killoran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly, discreetly in his ear. Tweed EXCUSES himself, rises quickly and WALKS across the restaurant floor... 
... past the Band and the Dancing Giris ... 
... to the swinging doors of the kitchen. As he pushes open the SWINGING DOOR, his face has lost its humor. 
CUT TO 
75 INT. KITCHEN/RESTAURANT/PARK ROW 
A madhouse of activity. WAITERS in black suits, vests and serving outfits STREAM by carrying huge TRAYS of food while the KITCHEN STAFF works double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume. 
As Boss Tweed walks in, Bill the Butcher PLUCKS a piece of roasted poultry off a tray as it's carried out the door. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I'm not good enough for your table, so I eat where I can. (takes a big bite) It's good, what is it? 
BOSS TWEED Pheasant. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Is that like pigeon? I killed a pigeon once but it didn't taste nothing like this. 
BOSS TWEED You killed a bull this morning. I told you to make an Arrangement with him, and you come back with his blood on your hands. 
BILL THE BUTCHER (chewing his food) He insulted me. He aggravated me. I couldn't stand for that, for no one. 
BOSS TWEED You stand for anything if I tell you. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You think I should be afraid of you. You act like lightning strikes when you talk. 
As they talk, and the tension builds between them, the two men are constantly BUFFETED by the swinging doors and the unending stream of WAITERS. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I never was afraid of you, so don't think I was or act like I was, you ain't earned it. 
BOSS TWEED What did you earn us, killing Monk? 
BILL THE BUTCHER Where'd you earn the right to ask that question? You raised some dust in the streets a while back, but no more. You got power but you ain't got muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior. 
BOSS TWEED I see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The Book, "If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out." I followed that law with my own knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and he let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out both eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart. When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire. 
BOSS TWEED (measured, conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill. That's how we help each other. If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing else. But Bill, I'm only saying... I'm counselinm... look in the distance. You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always remember who the host is. It's not a matter of courage welre talking. It's manners. 
Bill grabs another piece of food from a tray. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Howls these manners? 
BOSS TWEED Fine, if you're hungry. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I'm always hungry. 
BOSS TWEED I've always told you, Bill. There's plenty for all, and more for us together than separate. We'll dine together sometime. 
Bill the Butcher nods, appeased, and leaves, swaggering his way through the kitchen chaos, making everyone get out of his way. Boss Tweed watches him go, his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage. 
CUT TO 
76 INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW 
Later. Everyone's gone except some WAITERS, cleaning up, and Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran, who sit at the end of the banquet table. Leftover plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and, as he talks, he PICKS from them. 
BOSS TWEED Let me put this to you, Daniel. Now that the Butcher has killed the single most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--who is there to take his place? (as Killoran starts to answer) Of course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be killed, but he must be checked. 
KILLARAN It could be a police matter. 
BOSS TWEED Impossible! Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the Butcher have blood ties to the gangs. They can't be trusted. And any cops that can be trusted are too craven to be any use. If Bill's to be checked, it must come from within the Points, not without. 
KILLORAN The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections. That Amsterdam boy has sand. 
BOSS TWEED That so? The last time I saw him he was under the Butcher's knife looking like a fine filet. Who else is there? 
KILLORAN Well, the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point. There's Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the Plug Uglies, but there's none that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits, or the stake, neither. 
BOSS TWEED What would that be? 
KILLORAN The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher. He's sworn revenge for the death of his father, and he's got the heart to carry it forward. He'll have the skill and power soon enough. 
BOSS TWEED Blood will make a man intrepid. Bring them along, then. Nurture the Rabbits with neglect. Let them roam where they like. 
KILLORAN And if they roam into some portion of our own revenues? 
BOSS TWEED I'd tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use. They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied. 
KILLORAN Bill's got to be a lot more than occupied. 
BOSS TWEED I'll hold Bill in check. If he becomes unwieldy ... well, damn it all, Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old musket. What do you think of that, eh? 
Boss Tweed gets up from the table. A WAITER is DIMMING the gaslights, filling the room with deep shadows. 
KILLORAN It'd be gratifying, Mr. Tweed. Even edifying. 
BOSS TWEED But poor politics, eh? Well, we musn't have that. (as he walks away) I do miss those roistering days, though. Oh, and bring some of that food for the canaries. 
CUT TO 
77 EXT. STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE DAY 
The sharply-angled turn of Doyers Street, nicknamed "The Bloody Angle." SOUND of a horse and cart as we see a row of UPTURNED mostly WOMEN and YOUNG CHILDREN. 
A NATIVE AMERICAN drives a cart carrying large barrels of MILK. A SECOND NATIVE rides beside him on the seat, holding a rifle, looking impassively at the faces turned up to him. A WOMAN holding a BABY in one arm and a CHILD by the hand steps in front of them. They almost run her down. 
JOHNNY It's not just citizens in there? 
GENT 1 Of course it is. 
JOHNNY with arms? 
GENT 2 From their damned gang. Some of them live there. 
AMSTERDAM Some of who? 
GENT 2 
The Native Americans. 
JOHNNY We didn't contract for that. 
GENT 1 We'll pay extra for the danger. 
AMSTERDAM No danger. But you will pay extra. (turns; to gang) Let's go and greet some Natives. 
Under SCATTERED RIFLE FIRE and a barrage of ROCKS, the GANG STORMS the building, charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were attacking a medieval fortress. ARMS reach out from windows to try and pull them off. The Rabbits respond with knives and PISTOL SHOTS. As they charge inside, the CAMERA RISES to an OVERHEAD shot and we ... 
DISSOLVE TO 
86 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY 
Later. The same OVERHEAD ANGLE. BODIES litter the street everywhere. Some dead and wounded Rabbits lie near NATIVES who have gone to their reward. Some BUILDING RESIDENTS wander the street in a daze. JOHNNY is collecting money from the Two Gents, who look very pleased as Amsterdam approaches with Jenny. He's carrying a rifle he took from the building. 
AMSTERDAM (to Gents) Alright, then? 
GENT 2 Very much alright. Quite a spectacle. 
AMSTERDAM Oh really? Just the entertainment you favor, is it? Pardon me for a moment, gents. (he turns to Jenny) You wanted to settle, you and me. That's so, isn't it? You did agree, did you not. 
JENNY I did, yes. 
AMSTERDAM Good, because I didn't want to act hasty. I can never tell for sure what you're thinking, and sometimes I'm not always sure what you're saying... 
GENT 2 (interrupting) Excuse me, we have to finish and... 
AMSTERDAM (to Gent 2) Excuse me. We'll conclude in a moment. (back to Jenny) Where do you settle? 
JENNY Amsterdam, what are you saying? 
AMSTERDAM I'm asking, where does anyone settle? 
JENNY I don't know, you mean a place, a home? 
AMSTERDAM A home yes. 
GENT 1 Excuse me, but we really must conclude. 
AMSTERDAM (ignoring him) Well, I'm saying to you then, Jenny Everdeane, welcome home. 
No one sees it coming. Amsterdam FLASHES around, swinging the BUTT of his rifle into Gent l's midsection, doubling him over and sending him breathless to the ground. Amsterdam SPINS again and swings the butt into Gent 2's face, knocking him cold. 
AMSTERDAM Fine place. Room enough for all. (to Johnny) Get them out of here. 
GENT 2 They'll come back looking for you. 
AMSTERDAM With whose help? The Natives? They won't help these flourishing bastards even for ned. (to Jenny) Tell any who wants they can stay. If they can't pay rent they can join the gang. But make sure the best rooms go to us. Look around ... 
JENNY (interrupting) I know this building. 
CUT TO 
87 INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER 
As Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel. The place is like a weird catacomb: it is narrow and dank, filled with bones of dead animals, of the two- and four-legged variety. 
JENNY These lead all under the Square, into the Brewery and out again from there. They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the mission. Pass me the candle. 
Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to see... 
... that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation of Jacob's Ladder. It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a better world--or worse. Trophies from many gangs--including the bones and skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as if this were a catacomb in Palermo. 
Stooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross. A slab of slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible, is the name "Maggie Everdeane." 
JENNY We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we went to the Brewery. One day she slept so drunk she never woke and I brought her back here. Dug this myself. (beat) Families. Give here what I gave you. 
Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of Blackbeard's treasure box. She opens it and holds the candle close: inside is the swag from all her cat burglaries. There's a lot of it, GLITTERING with promise in the GUTTERING flame. Jenny starts to dig in her mother's grave. 
JENNY She'll keep an eye on this for us. How about some help? 
He KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones. 
AMSTERDAM You trusting me with your treasure, then? 
JENNY Just take another look at it to remind you. I can always do fine on my own. 
Amsterdam reaches inside the chest, pulls out a ring and SLIPS it onto Jenny's dirt-covered finger. She KISSES him. 
JENNY What's mine is yours, is that it? 
AMSTERDAM I could use this, too. 
From the bag he holds up a small GOLD CROSS. 
JENNY You making an offering to the Reverend Raleigh? 
Amsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts to dig again. 
CUT TO 
96 EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY 
START CLOSE ON: telegraph wire, HUMMING with the election returns. And, below it--far below--Johnny, Killoran and a couple of TAMMANY BOYOS, looking up at the wire. 
BOYO 1 I ain't goin' up there. I got my election suit on. 
JOHNNY This election'll be over unless we get up there. 
KILLORAN "We?" This was your notion, you go up there. 
BOYO 2 (looking at polling place) Him. He looks likely, and he ain't workin'. 
He points over at Sheeny Mike Kurtz, who is observing the action at the polls. 
JOHNNY (calls to him) Sheeny Mike, you want to make ... (to Boyo 1) ...how much? 
BOYO 1 A dollar. 
JOHNNY (to Sheeny Mike) Five dollars? Just to help us? 
SHEENY MIKE (a bit wary) What's the pitch, Johnny? Amsterdam wouldn't like it, working with Tammany. 
BOYO 2 Well, now, if Amsterdam wouldn't like it ... 
JOHNNY (interrupting) He knows about it. Welre working a whole new scheme. But I won't tell him youlre helping, if that's the way you want it. And you can keep the full five. Just start climbing. 
SHEENY MIKE (beat) Where's the ned? 
Boyo 2 hands Sheeny Mike five bucks, which he pockets as Boyo 1 gives him a large pair of SHEARS. Mike wipes his palms on his pants and STARTS UP the pole. 
For Killoran and the Tammany Boyos, this is like a circus stunt. They watch Mike's ascent with pleasure. 
Sheeny Mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole. He turns to look at Johnny and the Tammany group below. A couple of SPECTATORS have stopped to watch as well. 
Mike gets to the top of the pole, REACHES OUT--STRETCHES OUT-toward the telegraph wire with the shears... 
... strains... reaches ... MAKES THE CUT. 
On the ground, Johnny looks relieved. The Boyos offer a partmocking round of applause. 
In the spirit of things, Sheeny Mike TURNS to acknowledge the applause. Just briefly. But long enough so he's distracted. He sees the upturned FACES fill suddenly with fear, and he TURNS when he HEA.RS a sharp, odd WHISTLING NOISE. 
A LIVE TELEGRAPH WIRE is coming at him. He doesn't even have time to scream. The wire hits him, whipping around him as JOLTS OF NT leap through his body and he FALLS to the ground. 
CUT TO 
97 EXT. PARADISE SQUA.RE DAY 
HANDS pick up the lifeless body of Sheeny Mike and start to carry it off... past Amsterdam and Jenny, who stand on one side of it, watching... and Johnny, who is on the other. 
JOHNNY He was working a Tammany job, Tammany will see to him. 
AMSTERDAM He wasn't Tammany. Not like you. 
JOHNNY He made the right choice. 
AMSTERDAM You don't know what you're saying! You killed one of our own. One of your family! 
JOHNNY (slowly) I didn't know he was going to die, Amsterdam. And don't tell me what's my own and what isn't. You're not my family. And I swear, I swear on the Virgin Mother's eyes ... I know what I'm doing, Amsterdam. It's you that's always been blind. (they look at each other) I'll say my farewells. 
Johnny KNEELS down beside Mike's body, brushes the hair from his brow. 
JOHNNY You still smell like drink. 
He nods to the Rabbits to carry the body on and, as he RISES a half-dozen NEWSBOYS DASH into the square, carrying fresh copies of the Tribune and crying... 
NEWSBOYS New Tammany victory! Fernando Wood elected to third term! Tammany ticket prevails by narrow margin! Boss Tweed vows Armageddon for crime! 
JOHNNY (looking at Amsterdam and Jenny) Can't you hear the future? 
He walks away from the gang, through the rushing Newspaper Boys. 
CUT TO 
98 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA 
The place has been cleared out for a war council: Amsterdam with a couple of Dead Rabbits, and Bill the Butcher with a few Natives. They sit at a round poker table with a green felt top. 
JIMMY SPOILS We say the Square is the place. Let Barnum sell the tickets for a share of the price... 
NATIVE SECOND (interrupting) A small share. 
JIMMY SPOILS And the Rabbits and Natives will split the majority portion equal. 
NATIVE SECOND Who works the crowd? 
AMSTERDAM Nobody. This is a day of honor. No pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I'll cut their hands off. After the fight. 
NATIVE SECOND We got to fix positions for everyone so there won't be no other fighting. I know for fact the Roach Guards has sworn blood against the Black Birds, and the Forty Thieves don't tolerate the Chichesters. 
As these delicate negotiations continue, the only two outsiders in the place, Mother Joyce and a Bartender, are listening intently on the far side of the room. 
BARTENDER Amsterdam will make the Butcher a fine banquet. 
MOTHER JOYCE My ned's on the boy. He's got the youth, and he's got the hunger. 
BARTENDER Is he so hungry you'll put up a hundred? 
LITTLE GIRL Cops has everything closed to the north, and the militia's coming. 
CUT TO 
103 EXT. STREET/FIVE POINTS NIGHT 
As Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets. She sees: MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS. 
BOY My Daddy don't have to die for you! Why should he fight and die for you? 
Jenny looks ahead, sees: the river, in the distance. And flames. She runs forward, STUMBLES. Some of the swag FALLS to the street. She SCRAMBLES to pick it up as Rioters rush by her. 
CUT TO 
104 EXT. PIERS HUDSON RIVER NIGHT 
MATTE: The surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame. The piers are BURNING. The docks are ash. 
SAILORS battle a MOB for possession of a small rowboat. As they fight, the boat starts to DRIFT. Jenny spots it, RUNS for it 
... but so does ANOTHER GIRL. Younger than Tenny--20 maybe, Jennyls age when Amsterdam fell in love with her. They both get to the boat at the same time. Each grips it by a gunwale, and they STARE at each other like two jungle beasts over a kill. 
JENNY I'd kill you for this. 
The Girl lunges at her with a knite, and Jenny SHOOTS. The GIRL slides into the flame-reflecting Hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava. 
Jenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row. We stay CLOSE on her ... working the oars clumsily, furiously ... moving the boat across the water, trying to get away from the city... 
... and we go WIDER now. A huge line of IRON--like the side of a glacier... bisects the frame, then starts to move. Jenny turns, SEES it. It is ... 
... the looming hull of an ironclad war ship (MATTE). It LOBS cannon fire into the city, setting off tremendous explosions. Jenny TURNS back for the shore... 
... as cannonballs land, devastating rioters. 
CUT TO 
105 EXT. SHORE/RIVER NIGHT 
MATTE: Police and MILITIA push the rioters back toward the river like rats. A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst... 
... injuring many more cops and militia than rioters. The rioters rally, RUN over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers. Now the advantage is theirs; cops and militia are in retreat. 
Jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland. 
CUT TO 
106 EXT. DOYERS STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE NIGHT 
Further from the docks. Shells still exploding in the distance. Jenny moves with the marauding mob, recognizes Doyers Street. She splits away from the mob, moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody Angle. And STOPS. 
Weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings. SMOKE and EERIE LIGHT. The angle is lined with lampposts. And from every lamppost dangles the BODY of a black man. Or woman. Or child. Some are still smouldering. 
At the base of a lamppost, a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-tied CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it. One of the Rioters sees Jenny, grins and holds out the TORCH he's holding. She shakes her head and starts to BACK out of the alley. 
The Rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse. The body IGNITES in flame. The RIOTERS pull on a rope and the body rises, burning, to the top of the lamppost ... 
... where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse refractions on walls all up and down the street. On the street, as the flames dance and the bodies burn, rioters DANCE and SING. Walpurgis Night. From these mad SHADOWS, we... 
DISSOLVE TO 
107 EXT. ROOF/JACOB-S LADDER NIGHT 
... the face of Amsterdam, stepping out of the SHADOWS of the roof. There are flames in the distance. The whole gang is assembled, facing him as he speaks. 
AMSTERDAM No we ain't going to fight, but we can take something for ourselves out of this. 
JIMMY SPOILS I want to know who hung them bodies in the Bloody Angle. I want to address who done it. 
AMSTERDAM Five thousand people in the street done it! Boss Tweed done it! Abe Lincoln done it! There's nothing you can do about any one of them but stay with us. You'll have a little of your own back. 
JIMMY SPOILS How's that? 
AMSTERDAM These riots are a gift. They... 
... he PAUSES just for a moment as he sees a hand on the last rung of the outside ladder leading to the roof: it's Jenny, returning. 
AMSTERDAM ... they've made everything clear, as you might say. (to Jenny) Are you with us, then? 
JENNY Until I can get out. I'll go with you... (straight at Amsterdam) ...meantime. 
AMSTERDAM Good. We're going for the Armory at Canal Street. 
JIMMY SPOILS The Armory! We'll have to beat the militia to get there. 
AMSTERDAM There's a way through the lines. Jen, did you see the cops and militia? 
JENNY I can show you from here where they are. I doubt they'll get to the Armory in force before midday tomorrow. 
AMSTERDAM We'll get there first. We'll take everything we can carry, and destroy the rest so no one else has the use of it, the militia, the Natives, nobody. Then we'll turn to real business. We'll go down to the Battery. 
JIMMY SPOILS Why, we going to take a sail to Europe? 
AMSTERDAM No. But we could, after this. We're going... (slowly, savoring this) ...we're going to take the banks. The government banks. (awed silence from all) Are we not? 
JENNY (beat; steps forward) Seems we are. 
One by one, then in small groups, the entire gang FOLLOWS her. They are uncertain, reluctant, even frightened at the audacity of the scheme. But they stand with Amsterdam. 
CUT TO 
108 INT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT 
JOHNNY (interrupting) Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all! Tweed ain't going to wait around for you and Bill to settle yourselves. I'm telling you so you have a chance. 
AMSTERDAM Chance of what? 
JOHNNY A chance... a chance to do what you want. Bury the Butcher, draw what blood you got to. But you better make speed. The Natives will move on the Armory too. 
AMSTERDAM And what's any of it mean to you? 
JOHNNY It means whatever's left of friendship, I don't know. There's still part of me here. I don't want to see you lose everything in your life at once. 
AMSTERDAM I'm going to lose nothing. (beat) If you believe me, you can stay. 
JOHNNY I got to go. 
He turns so Amsterdam can't see his face and LEAVES- 
JENNY So Tammany's going to kill the Butcher. That puts you and Tweed on the same side. Does that make the path clear enough to suit you? 
From Amsterdam's face, trying to work out all the new angles, we... 
DISSOLVE TO 
111 INT. NATIVE AMERICAN HIDEOUT 
... Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as ... 
... the barrels of two dozen RIFLES SURROUND the edges the screen, boxing Amsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame. 
And Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment. We are, for the first time, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapes and vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather and use. Some of them go back to the early days of the republic. There is not an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Murder Me? No one's going to murder me. 
AMSTERDAM Then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill, because that's the only way you'll ever see it coming. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I don't believe it, and I don't believe it's you telling me. You got no reason to care about any danger to me. 
AMSTERDAM One reason. You're my kill, Butcher. No one else is going to have you, not Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No one--not even you, Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd do anything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You protect me? Get out of here and go to hell. 
AMSTERDAM Fine, so long as I pass you on my way. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Maybe I'd believe you more if I knew who was talking to you. 
AMSTERDAM Someone I credit. 
BILL THE BUTCHER That means nothing to me. None of this means nothing to me because I am Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough. 
AMSTERDAM You join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out of the Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me, then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street and the whole Points will be mine. 
BILL THE BUTCHER I relish the thought... just the thought... of cutting you up and opening you wide. So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine how I'm going to enjoy doing it. 
AMSTERDAM Why don't I make it easy for you, then. 
He TURNS his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through the entire gang of Natives. 
AMSTERDAM Same as you're making it easy for Tweed. 
He keeps walking... through the Natives ... dozens of ancient enemies glowering at him. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Amsterdam! (Amsterdam looks around) Don't be like your father. Don't make it too easy. 
Amsterdam struggles to keep his temper. But he turns and keeps walking through the enemy camp as we... 
DISSOLVE TO 
112 INT. JACOB'S LADDER 
....Amsterdam walking. But this time, he is WALKING among his gang. All the Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready. Jenny is beside him. Then Jimmy Spoils. Then a few others. 
As the group passes, others STAND and walk with them... 
... until the whole gang is rallied... 
... and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads under the building. 
DISSOLVE TO 
113 INT. BASEMENT 
As Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, past the graves, into a tunnel. Torchlight GUTTERS all around. Their steps echo like repeated rifle shots. 
DISSOLVE TO 
114 INT. TUNNEL 
The whole gang MARCHES down a tunnel under the Old Brewery. Except for Amsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas. Many have marks and gang insignia on their faces. All of them have weapons. A lot of weapons. 
Frightened FACES--people seeking shelter and safety from the riots--appear in the darkness, then vanish like ghosts. 
As the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that same march through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father. Amsterdam's face gives little away. But perhaps he is remembering that day too. 
DISSOLVE TO 
115 INT. TUNNEL 
The last tunnel.. Shreds of light from a door in the distance. Amsterdam walks up to the door and--just as Monk Eastman did years before--KICKS it down. Dim dawn LIGHT FLOODS the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out. 
CUT TO 
116 EXT. CANAL STREET DAWN 
... running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIA COMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, in their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in the street. 
120 CONTINUED: 
FIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia Commander. 
BILL THE BUTCHER We move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll break! 
MILITIA COMMANDER I can't spare the men or stand the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem out! 
BILL THE BUTCHER Tweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified Christ we will move! (turns to his men) Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright instead of die hunkered down, come with us! 
Bill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts to FOLLOW. 
BILL THE BUTCHER We'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on! 
The men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPS through the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever. 
Bill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion all around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatens to obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him. 
He has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Natives pass in front of him... he AIMS ... he's anxious, confused ... his HAND shakes ... he fires... too soon! ... 
... and HITS a Native, who falls dead. Right near Bill. 
The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyes lock. Johnny FIRES again ... WINGS Bill ... 
... and Bill SHOOTS him. Johnny FALLS with the first shot. Bill's above him now, looking down at him. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this? 
JOHNNY Tweed. 
Bill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You'd lie to save your friend. 
JOHNNY (in terrible pain) No. There's no friends for me. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Me the same. Pity us both. 
He EMPTIES his revolver into Johnny. 
BILL THE BUTCHER (to his men) Hold your fire! (toward the Armory) In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam! 
The Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward, gun in hand. But a Native STOPS him. 
Amsterdam's face APPEARS in a front window of the Armory. 
AMSTERDAM Go on, then, talk. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You and me. 
AMSTERDAM (beat) Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body. 
Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour... 
... and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militia watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep the Butcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves. 
And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory. 
CUT TO 
121 INT. ARMORY DAY 
As the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quickly behind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded everywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island. 
Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as Amsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap at his feet. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Your friend made different friends lately. 
AMSTERDAM Tammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive? 
BILL THE BUTCHER It don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The militia can move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door. 
AMSTERDAM I don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia unless you come with the Dead Rabbits. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You'd lay aside what's between us? 
AMSTERDAM I'm not forgetting where I put it. 
BILL THE BUTCHER If you do, I'll remind you. (he turns, leaves) 
AMSTERDAM What's your call, Bill? 
BILL THE BUTCHER I'm considering where's my better chance. 
He walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENS it himself and strides out into the street. 
CUT TO 
122 EXT./INT. ARMORY DAY 
Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines. 
From inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him. 
The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives. 
Amsterdam WATCHES intently. 
The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what they're saying. There is still no sound...

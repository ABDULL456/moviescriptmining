1 SUMMER. POSY DRAWING 1 
2 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 2 
Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time. 
TESS (V.O.) And love slipped the bonds of restraint... At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties, funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring at Andy. 
TESS (V.O.)(CONT'D) His touch was like a cosmic `yes'. Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad, writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work. 
EUSTACIA (V.O.) `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck you to hell!' Scott stepped back from the cell door as the gob of spit flew.' 
1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A 
Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ; a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes, books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian - Thomas Hardy. He is writing. 
GLEN (V.O.) This complex contemporary matrix is what Hardy meant by `the ache of modernism.' He regards it. 
GLEN Crap. He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'. 
NICHOLAS (V.O.) Inchcombe had seen it all before. He'd seasoned it: the metallic smell of blood and gunshot; forensics hunched like vultures. The dreadful mundanity of murder, he thought. 
3 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 3 
Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure. 
NICHOLAS (V.O.) He approached Patel, who was stricken. She was one for whom a corpse was still an obscenity. Inchcombe realised a disturbing truth. His lack of feeling was almost... (He stops writing. Sighs) 
NICHOLAS (CONT'D) Pathological... 
4 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PLAYGROUND. 4 
A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from a magazine. 
CASEY `I've been wearing the wrong size all my life,' said Katie. `I was always popping out. Turns out I'm a 30GG,' she says. `Now my bras finally fit - though Simon prefers me without one.' Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs. 
4A INT. DAY. KITCHEN. 4A 
A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty, she's now mumsy and countrified. She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection. Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up. 
BETH Do you think I should be reminding them to drink enough? It's very hot out there... 
MARY Beth - they're writers, not babies. You run round after `em too much. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 3. 
5 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 5 
Glen walks outside, breathing in the fresh air. Beth approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits. 
BETH Can I tempt you, Glen? 
GLEN Wow, thanks. Glen picks up a scone. 
BETH I often take something snacky down to Nicholas at this time of day. I know how the brain needs feeding. How are you settling in? 
GLEN Great. The last writer's retreat I stayed at kind of froze my balls off, you know? 
BETH Oh. 
GLEN Screeching firedoors, curried lasagne and a needy poet - from whom I still bear the scars. 
BETH We try to keep it peaceful here; far from the madding crowd. 
GLEN Well, it's paradise. 
6 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - VILLAGE STREET. TRIANGLE. 6 
The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's shatteringly dull. Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom is epic. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 4. 
An open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the junction. The tones of Classic FM blare out, much to the enjoyment of the middle aged couple within. 
CASEY Frock horrors. This weeks top of the shocks goes to Katie Pound in an off the shoulder lime by Roberto. 
JODY She looks like a bug. (Car hoots) Wankers! 
CASEY You wanna sack your stylist girl. 
JODY Bet they did that on purpose, dressed her up like an insect. Casey agrees. They zoom away. 
7 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS. 7 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6A. 
BETH Would you mind? And the writers are eating al fresco tonight; could you check there's no bird shit on the seats? Sorry. Beth looks distant, troubled. 
ANDY You OK? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7. 
BETH Yes. Nicholas and I are going out to dinner. As she walks away, Andy glances at the shed, a look of puzzled dislike on his face. 
9A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 9A 
Glen settles back in his chair. 
GLEN It's paradise... 
10 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 10 
Nicholas, dreading his predicament, is staring out at a cow's arse. The cow starts to piss. He shuts his eyes in desperation. 
10A I/E. DAY. TAMARA'S CAR. 10A Shooting from inside the car, we pass the sign "Ewedown". 
11 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET. 11 
The same car drives through the village. Jody and Casey appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it. They both land on the windscreen. 
JODY Fucking bingo! Jody and Casey run away, laughing. 
11A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 11A 
The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She looks around shocked, for the culprit. The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as well be a landfill site. 
TAMARA What a dump. As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7A. 
12 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 12 
Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move. 
12A DELETED 12A 
14 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 14 
At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown, neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of recent abandonment. Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She backs away. She doesn't know what to do. 
13 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 13 
Jody and Casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop. Three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the T-junction. One of them almost lands in the shop. An old lady comes out, shoo-ing them away. 
JODY We could walk up the garage. 
CASEY I'm supposed to be helping my mum up at Stonefield. 
JODY They keep you busy. 
CASEY Yeah. 
JODY You never stop, you! Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and Casey are not impressed. 
15 DELETED. 15 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 8. 
16 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 16 
The writers are sitting round a table lit with tea-lights in jars. Casey is helping her mum, Mary, an efficient local woman in her late thirties. She wobbles the heavy serving dishes dangerously. 
GLEN It was called `From Hearth to Heath - Doomsday and Revelation in Victorian verse.' 
TESS What was it about? 
GLEN Oh you know. Pale poets on laudanum, dark towers and sunless seas - a little sturm and drang in a teacup. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 9. 
At an upstairs window we can see Beth hold a dress up to herself and then abandon the idea. 
TESS Did it sell? 
GLEN Well my kind of books aren't about sales. I mean that's not why I write. So... no. 
TESS What are you working on next? Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a blouse. 
17 INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. BETH'S BEDROOM. 17 
Beth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror. She's full of hope that Nicholas will take her out - and dread that he'll find some excuse. 
18 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 18 
GLEN Thomas Hardy. 
DIGGORY Is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore? 
GLEN Excuse me but there is nothing dull about Hardy. That is a misconception. 
19E INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. KITCHEN. 19E 
In the kitchen, Andy picks up his plate and goes. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12. 
19F INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 19F 
Beth is incandescent. 
BETH How can you lie to my face? 
NICHOLAS Can we talk calmly about this? There are people out there - 
BETH You look me in the face and LIE! 
NICHOLAS For God's sake; we're surrounded by 
NOVELISTS - 
BETH You BASTARD! 
19G EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS (PATIO) 19G 
A thrilled intake of breath goes round the table. The writers (with the exception of Glen, who is mortified) are poised like scavengers, waiting for more. 
19H INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 19H 
NICHOLAS Beth, we're like a pair of compasses... 
BETH Don't you dare - 
NICHOLAS Joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam, in freedom - His phone beeps. 
BETH That's from her isn't it? Are you keeping her waiting? Nicholas finally snaps. 
NICHOLAS We've talked a lot about the creative mind and we agreed that it needs freedom to explore! 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12A. 
BETH (leaving the house) Take your freedom. I can't live like this any more. It makes me feel WORTHLESS! 
20 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO/PORCH). 20 
Casey gawps, fascinated. Nicholas is following Beth outside. Her agony travels through the quiet evening air. The writers are open-mouthed. 
NICHOLAS Calm yourself down! 
BETH (O.S.) Go set up home with Patel. See if she does your tax return. 
NICHOLAS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Will you please - 
BETH (O.S.) Do you love her?? Diggory's fork stays in mid-air. Glen is horribly fascinated. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13. 
NICHOLAS 
(FIRMLY) This is pointless. 
BETH Is she young? 
NICHOLAS For heaven's sake. 
BETH 
IS SHE? 
NICHOLAS 
YES! The guests are hanging on every word. Beth retreats back into the house. 
BETH (O.S.) If you leave here tonight to be with her... Don't come back. 
NICHOLAS Beth... For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise. 
NICHOLAS You're making fools of us both. Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit. 
BETH Liar. Glen cringes. Beth slams the door. Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the writers to get to his car. 
DIGGORY I didn't know they provided material too. 
20A INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 20A 
Beth, her back to the door, is regretting her gesture. 
20B EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO/PORCH). 20B 
EUSTACIA Beth does everything for him you 
KNOW; 
(MORE) 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13A. 
ZOE You're not staying with her? 
TAMARA She's. She died. Zoe finishes pouring the wine. 
ZOE Have that on me. And here's your key. Up the stairs, right in front. You can't miss it. Tamara utters her thanks, surprised at Zoe's kindness. She takes her drink and the key upstairs. Zoe remains, grinning. We see why. Andy Cobb has just walked in. Zoe pulls him a pint. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Didn't think I'd see you tonight. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 16. 
ANDY Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield. 
ZOE Tell me everything... Andy shakes his head. 
ANDY Marriage. Remind me never to try it. 
ZOE Andy, you're just a sex object. No one'd have you. He grins back at her. 
24 INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. TAMARA'S BATHROOM 24 
Tamara is in a deep bubble bath. She glances at herself in the mirror, scrutinising her beauty. She fingers her nose. Slowly a look of doubt steals over her - as if she's not quite comfortable in her own skin. 
25 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 25 
Glen is eating his breakfast looking at all the Hardiment's family memorabilia in the kitchen. Andy is eating toast. 
GLEN So the Hardiments have lived here centuries, huh? 
ANDY No, `bout twenty years. Still strangers by local standards. Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard. 
BETH Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I think she's coming into heat. She goes out. 
GLEN She's a nice lady. 
ANDY Yeah, I owe her a lot. 
GLEN Husband's a sleazebag, huh? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 17. 
ANDY We'd say prick here actually. Or wanker. 
GLEN That's good. We might even call him a Fuck. 
ANDY That's good too. 
26 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE CHICKEN RUN. 26 
Andy approaches Beth. She is cleaning out the hen coop with all the frenetic energy of an abandoned wife. 
BETH This is going rotten underneath. 
ANDY Shall we look at Ingrid? 
BETH It's falling apart. 
ANDY I can do that. Beth... Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears. 
ANDY (CONT'D) He won't last five minutes. Beth looks down embarrassed by (but grateful for) his support. 
26A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 26A 
Glen wanders into Beth's office. The wall in front of him is dominated by a framed newspaper profile of Nicholas, surrounded by framed covers of Inchcombe books. The whole room is a shrine to Nicholas' career. Glen is in the hall looking at Beth's prints and pictures; old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers who have stayed at the retreat. He stares at a print of farm workers in the nineteenth century. Glen sighs. 
GLEN (V.O.) I know why I'm drawn to Thomas Hardy. He writes about failure better than anyone else. I need this book to go well. I need a tiny reward for my endeavours... His stomach gurgles ominously. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 17A. 
GLEN (V.O.) I need a dump. 
27 DELETED. 27 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 18. 
28 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 28 
Glen walks down the corridor by the kitchen, to the downstairs cloakroom; a marvellous Victorian toilet of reassuring size. He shuts the door in relief. 
29 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM. 29 
Glen is on the loo. Even in this small room there are framed photographs of Nicholas receiving awards. He looks at them in wonder. 
NICHOLAS (O.S.) If that's the way you feel... Nadia, I'm devastated. Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas. 
NICHOLAS (O.S.) But if that's your decision, I'll have to learn to live with it. Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end the call. For Beth's benefit: 
NICHOLAS (Into his phone) I told you. I love my wife. Don't ever phone me again. Glen is shocked by this duplicity. 
NICHOLAS Beth... 
BETH (CONT'D) No don't touch me, don't you dare. Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them - too late. 
NICHOLAS I'm sorry. 
BETH Not good enough. Not any more. 
TAMARA Beaky?... We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood. 
48 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 48 
Glen is preparing to leave. 
GLEN You told her the truth... The time might come when she respects that. Andy, as your love guru, I suggest you ask Tamara for a date. But take a shower first, OK? 
ANDY 
(SMILING) Piss off, Glen. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33. 
49 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 49 
Tamara is in her shorts and boots, chucking empty bottles and old saucepans into the skip, like an Amazon. 
50 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 50 
Nicholas is at the hedge, looking down the valley towards Winnards Farm. He is watching Tamara like a hawk - as if he can't quite believe what he is seeing. 
51 1996. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 51 
Nicholas and Tamara are polishing Nicholas' car. 
TAMARA Boys know nothing. Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops work. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) I've been reading `Inchcombe's Dose.' 
NICHOLAS Have you? 
TAMARA The bit where Doctor Inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy's daughter. Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth closer to his. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) You describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile. So... She turns her head. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) Who did you base her on? 
NICHOLAS What? 
TAMARA Have you noticed me? Nicholas looks at her in surprise. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) Because I've noticed you... 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33A. 
She waits, hoping for a kiss, a hug, anything. She puts out a hand - almost touches him. He steps back. 
NICHOLAS Think it's time you went. Tamara is mortified. 
NICHOLAS (CONT'D) You're making yourself ridiculous. This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and throws it over the car - and Nicholas. 
TAMARA Nicholarse. 
NICHOLAS (CONT'D) Oh, grow up. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 34. 
52 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 52 
Nicholas is still staring at Tamara, who is jumping on the stuff in the skip. Glen is strolling up the hill from the pub. He follows Nicholas' gaze. 
GLEN A man can dream, huh? Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what he's talking about. 
53 INT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 53 
Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom. She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up. She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks lost. 
54 EXT. DAY. ANOTHER FARM - THE GOAT PEN. 54 
Tamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to Andy. He is watching Ingrid meet Darcy, a billy goat. 
ANDY Go on Ingrid; have some kids. 
TAMARA Pretty direct isn't he? He's not even bought her a coke. Andy turns. Sees her. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) And he stinks. 
ANDY She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to her. If she's ready she'll stand for him, if not she won't. 
TAMARA That's disturbing human. 
ANDY Refreshing basic. Darcy is up and at it. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 35. 
ANDY (CONT'D) Thought you'd have gone back to London by now. 
TAMARA I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for a while. Actually, I've got a proposition for you. Andy glances at the goats; bad idea. 
ANDY We should go for a drink sometime, Tam. You know, for old times sake. 
TAMARA So we can reminisce about how I smashed your nose? 
ANDY You didn't smash it. 
BETH As long as you're not working for her in the hours that I pay you. Without thinking, she has made Andy feel like a servant. 
ANDY Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 38. 
He walks on, leaving Beth feeling very uncomfortable - and somehow slightly bereft. 
57 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GROUNDS / KITCHEN. 57 
Andy comes in. He shouts into the house. 
ANDY Tam? Got some colour charts for you to see. He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill. 
TAMARA What would you choose for in here? 
ANDY Well... I'd have this one. And then upstairs in the bedroom - 
TAMARA 
OK. She starts gathering her things. 
ANDY So what d'you have to do to get a cup of tea round here? 
TAMARA Make it. 
(SHE POINTS) Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge. 
(SHE GRINS) I'm off to work. Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away. 
58 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE PERIMETER FENCE. 58 
Pounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A security guard is already running towards them. 
JODY This is our village. Our fucking field. 
GUARD 
OUT! 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 39. 
JODY 
COME ON YOU BASTARD LET US IN! Jody is ready for a fight but Casey pulls her back. 
59 CUT. 59 
60 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS 60 
Beth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched, breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She smiles. At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires. 
61 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE MAIN STAGE. 61 
Swipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime. There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford. The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer, Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic. He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is getting more and more furious. In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods. Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate the boys. Ben takes a microphone. 
BEN Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no more. Steve Culley is a cunt. Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar. 
PUBLICIST Ben! Ben! What's happening? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40. 
BEN He's seeing Fran. I won't work with that tosser again. 
FRAN Steve! Don't! Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben. 
STEVE You fucking baby. Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name. Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara. 
TAMARA Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe. 
BEN What? 
TAMARA I'm supposed to be interviewing you - for the Independent. She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) It was scheduled for later but maybe now's a better time... 
62 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 62 
Jody, Casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider. 
JODY They should let us in free. 
RYAN Too right. They come here, drink our water, use our fields, they leave all their crap in our drains - Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him. 
JODY Ben! Ben! She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving. 
CASEY What are you doing? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40A. 
JODY That was Ben from Swipe! Ben!! 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 41. 
Jody and Casey scream with delight, chasing the car. 
Nicholas and Glen are both walking in the field. They pass each other, each managing a painful smile. 
NICHOLAS How goes the opus? 
GLEN Fine Nicholas, just fine... Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen into deep anxiety. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 44. 
69 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 69 
Beth is mending the engine of her huge mower. Glen, now wearing a scarf, is sitting on the seat watching her work. 
GLEN It's his most obscure novel `The Well- Beloved'. Most people have never even heard of it. About this guy of twenty who falls in love with a beautiful young woman. Then when he's forty, he meets the woman's daughter and he falls in love with her. And finally, when he's sixty he meets the 
GRANDDAUGHTER - 
BETH Oh he doesn't. 
GLEN Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy was like that in his life, too. Even as he aged, he only had eyes for young women. Like, in one essential way he never grew up. 
BETH In his trousers. 
GLEN He was still at it in his eighties. You know? Snow on the rooftop but fire in the cellar... 
BETH Why won't it come for you Glen? The way you talk about it's so engaging. 
GLEN Yeah but there's an academic style, you know? 
BETH Who are you writing for? Who's your ideal reader? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 45. 
Glen can't answer. 
BETH Because if you wrote the way you spoke... it would make me want to read Hardy. 
GLEN Really? 
BETH Yes. If you wrote like you were talking to a friend... Pass me that thing. Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt. 
BETH Try it now. Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused. 
69A CUT 69A 
70 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE DINING ROOM. 70 
A cosy dinner for all the writers - more ladies in their forties and fifties. Nicholas is topping up his glass. 
NICHOLAS I simply pander to popular taste. 
CAITLIN Oh your books are far more than that. 
NICHOLAS Just airport fodder... Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich. 
CAITLIN Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe - for all his flaws - is a man with total integrity. 
GLEN Who did you base him on, Nicholas? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 46. 
NICHOLAS 
(IGNORING GLEN) My books don't say anything profound. I can't pretend to be an intellectual - not like Glen here, illuminating our ignorance with his critical glow - but I do love prose. And I think I can turn a reasonable story. Glen peers into the kitchen. Beth is serving desserts. 
GLEN Excuse me. He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like cups around a teapot. 
GLEN Let me help. 
BETH They need dusting with this. 
GLEN I went to my room and I wrote for three hours. The time just vanished. 
BETH That's great, that's brilliant. 
GLEN I feel like a man who's just passed a gargantuan stool. 
BETH Super. Sprig of mint on the top. Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens to Nicholas as he serves them. 
NICHOLAS The real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie. A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers. 
NICHOLAS (CONT'D) Because that's what storytellers are. Thieves and liars... 
GLEN (as he serves Nicholas) `The basis of all excellence is truth.' Samuel Johnson. Glen's intellect wins the day. Nicholas smarts. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 46A. 
71 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 71 
The room - her mother's - is empty except for a mattress on the floor, clothes rail, designer bean bag and desk. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 47. 
Tamara is sitting at it, tapping away on her PC, almost pained with concentration. Ben is bored. 
BEN Are you done yet? 
TAMARA What's this? 
BEN What's it look like? 
TAMARA Ben... For which finger?

PENNY Those girls could have aborted! 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50. 
BETH Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out. Nicholas is approaching. 
PENNY It beats me why you people want to live in the country. You've got no sense of responsibility. 
BETH It's not our dog! 
NICHOLAS Hello, Penny. How's tricks? Penny is suddenly all coy. 
PENNY Oh - Nicholas... 
NICHOLAS You're looking great. Terrific coat. 
PENNY What, this old thing? 
NICHOLAS You look like royalty. 
PENNY (laughs, delighted) Well, I try... Can't wait for your next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce- pot. Giles is always says `What are you reading Penny? You've got steam coming out of your ears...' She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding away with the dog, infuriated.

Ben has put a ring on Tamara's finger. 
TAMARA So what's the ring saying, Ben?

BEN (CONT'D) What's up? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50A. 
TAMARA I didn't know. 
BEN Didn't know what? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 51. 
TAMARA That you were in love with me. 
BEN The ring says I'm platinum with a long guarantee. So give me a reply. Tamara is grinning from ear to ear. 
TAMARA You're the best fun in the world. I'd love to marry you. She throws her arms around his neck. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) Can I say it then? 
BEN Say what? 
TAMARA I love you. Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings. 
BEN 
(ANSWERING IT) What? She's being proposed to. 
81 EXT. DAY. TEN MINUTES LATER. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 81 
Ben's Porsche skids to a halt, music blaring. Diggory is looking on in irate astonishment. The hat is on. 
BETH Shhh! There are writers here, trying to write. Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms. 
BETH This is a Buff Orpington. She's looking a bit peaky today. Not a great layer but she's very decorative. Beth puts down the hen. 
BETH We're fully organic - but I like to think that our champion product is the written word. Nicholas approaches, his hand held out, heartily. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 52. 
NICHOLAS The famous Ben - Swipe, eh? Ben just about manages to shake it. 
BEN Swipe's over. Thought the whole world knew that. 
NICHOLAS It wasn't on Newsnight, no. 
BETH Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't that lovely? He'd just popped the question when I rang. 
NICHOLAS She said yes? Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted. 
BETH We're delighted for you both. Boss leaps up, straining against a chain. 
BEN Why's he on a chain? 
CASEY Nice baby though. I'd like one that colour.

The bin is on fire. Casey chucks in the Pringles box. They warm their hands, watching one of the boys wheelie his bike and fall off right into a freezing puddle. Casey giggles. 
CASEY That Ryan... 
JODY What a dick. 
CASEY I think he's cute. 
JODY No you don't. Would you snog him? 
CASEY Maybe. 
JODY Be like having a slug in your mouth. Ben's yellow Porsche speeds right through the puddle, further soaking Ryan. Ben and Tamara are both wearing designer shades despite the gloom; Boss in the back. Jody and Casey are both on their feet in a second. 
JODY (CONT'D) Ben! Ben! 
CASEY 
BEN!!! 
RYAN Wankers. Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars. 
JODY Come on. 
88 MERGED WITH 87. 88 
89 EXT. DAY. 10 MINUTES LATER. WINNARDS FARM. 89

JODY She keeps this here for Andy. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 56A. 
CASEY What if she's got an alarm? 
JODY Soon find out. Jody opens the door. They go in. The alarm is hanging off the wall, the wires pulled out. Jody grins at Casey, satisfied. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 57. 
CASEY What if they come back? 
JODY If you're too chicken, go home. The girls wander in, awed. Jody turns and grins, her eyes like a cat's. 
90 INT. NIGHT. HADDITON - A BOOK SHOP. 90 
Nicholas is doing a book signing. There's a good crowd. 
NICHOLAS Is that Claire with an `i'? Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side. 
BETH What about you, Glen? Where will you be? 
GLEN In London with a collection of spare academics. I guess we'll be decking the halls in our own erudite way. 
BETH I'll miss our chats. 
GLEN I've been in a state of writerly bliss these last weeks. I hope I get to come back. 
BETH Me too. We'd love to have you. Glen doesn't want Beth to move away. 
GLEN (CONT'D) You know, this is the best mince pie I've ever had. 
BETH Oh? 
GLEN If it was possible to have an orgasm from mere food, this mince pie would do it. 
BETH 
(EMBARRASSED) Golly. She moves away. Glen heads for the wine, kicking himself. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 58. 
Tamara and Ben walk in. Ben looks at the country casuals in undisguised horror. 
BEN What the fuck are we doing here? 
TAMARA It's kind of research; I want to write about them. They're funny, Ben - come on. They move through the crowd. 
VINTNER The 2001 was the best. Someone just bought my last three cases... 
POSH HIPPY So I've got her this gorgeous Rajastani gagara skirt... Arriving at the mulled wine. 
TAMARA Besides, I want to show you off. 
BEN What am I - arm candy? 
TAMARA More like arm fungus with that face on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben, my fiance. 
BEN 
(DISGUSTED) Oh come off it. 
ANDY What? 
BEN It's fucking alive. 
ANDY Oh, you want it from Tesco, all plucked and headless sitting on a bandage. Ben's curiosity gets the better of him. 
BEN How d'you do it then? Andy points towards an upturned traffic cone, held in place by a metal frame. 
ANDY Gently put it's head down there; then quick in the skull with an air rifle. Pluck it while it's warm, little pot to catch all the blood - 
BEN Do you enjoy doing that? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 61A. 
ANDY No, but in my low wage economy, this flock's worth a lot. 
BEN You're a sick fuck, Andy. Andy has had enough. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62. 
ANDY Grow up. 
BEN 
(SQUARING UP) What did you say? Andy stands. He's at least two inches taller than Ben. 
ANDY I said grow up, little drummer boy. Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods. 
ANDY Tamara rang me this morning. Said to finish the house. It goes on the market in the spring and that's it; over. 
GLEN Why does the asshole always get the girl? He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back. 
ANDY Come on. Or you'll miss that train. 
94 INT. SIX WEEKS LATER. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 94 
Snow falling outside. Jody and Casey are in school uniform. Jody curled up on the bed; Casey at Tamara's PC. The room has been redecorated. 
JODY It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll be an event. I'll be wearing like a gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada. Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and... We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door frame, giving her a smouldering look. 
JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D) He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all taut over his buff bod and underneath Calvin Klein Boxers, black. Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if he's found the love of his life. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62A. 
JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D) And he'll have like one tattoo of my name and lush pecs and we'll have candles and white sheets and I'll smell of Allure by Chanel. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 63. 
Ben lifts Jody on to the bed. They marvel at each other. He bends down to kiss her. 
JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D) And he tries to stop himself but I'm a vision and he gets drawn into my power and it'll be like Uhhh... But also respectful. And my `V' plates will melt into nothing. She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC. 
JODY (CONT'D) Are you listening? 
CASEY I like this. 
JODY What? 
CASEY There's this bit right, where her dad takes her for dinner and she thinks it's some big treat but what he's doing, right, is telling her he's leaving them. And she, right, she's gutted and she yaks all her food into a napkin and puts it on his plate. 
JODY So? 
CASEY It's painful. But funny. It's about her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad, Jode.

Andy is on the phone, examining the decrepit shed. Nothing has changed in a decade.

TAMARA How many times? I didn't send it! Are you listening to me? BEN! WILL 
YOU STOP DRUMMING? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 68. 
He stops. He looks at her, betrayed. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) Why don't you believe me? I didn't write that email. 
BEN Explain it then. 
TAMARA Is this about Fran? 
BEN What's Fran got to do with it? 
TAMARA She's the reason you don't trust me. Just because she fucked around on you it doesn't mean that I will. Ben, furious, starts drumming again. Tamara boiling with frustration, walks away.

TAMARA Can you go to the farm? Just take a look, see if anyone's been in. 
ANDY No problem.

108 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 108

109C INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109C 
The inside of the house has been transformed by Andy. The drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone, replaced by warm tones which bring out the beauty of the house. Tamara wanders through. She turns around taking it all in. She never knew the house was so beautiful.

NICHOLAS So what about this shag I've been reading about? 
TAMARA Oh fuck off.

She looks in through the glass and sees Zoe up on the bar, clinging to Andy in a long embrace. Tamara is frozen. Andy kisses Zoe, long and tender. Tamara turns. She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare mutely as she drives away. 
114 INT. DAY. EWEDOWN. THE VILLAGE PUB. 114 
JODY D'you think he's in with a chance?

NICHOLAS God, it's like living with the effing moral police. Are you ever going to trust me? He goes.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 94. 
NICHOLAS Well, I suppose it has to come out sometime. 
TAMARA Does it? 
NICHOLAS It's a good thing. Feels like a relief. Means you and I can start to think about our plans. For the future... 
TAMARA Nicholas?... 
NICHOLAS I know it's been hard, sharing me with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm going to leave her. I want a new life - and I want it now. With you. Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts.

NICHOLAS It all runs very smoothly. I start a book in the summer, publish it the following spring. Bit of a factory, really. 
INTERVIEWER So you've just finished `Like The Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth adventure. Are you already planning the next? 
NICHOLAS There won't be a next one. Frankly I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In fact, I'm about to kill him off. There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death has been announced. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 95. 
INTERVIEWER That's a bombshell for your fans. 
NICHOLAS (all for Tamara) Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh pastures. 
LADY IN THE CROWD No! 
NICHOLAS Inchcombe will be meeting a very sticky end. And it's one murder I'm really looking forward to. 
LADY IN THE CROWD How could you? 
INTERVIEWER This might be a good moment to take a few questions. Yes, the lady in the apron... 
BETH You write a lot about adultery. Is that from personal experience? Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke. 
NICHOLAS Madam, what a saucy question! 
BETH Why do you cheat persistently on your wife? Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly humiliated. He decides not. 
NICHOLAS Because she lets me. Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it. 
156 EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE GROUNDS BY THE MARQUEE. 156 
Tamara is striding away from the Marquee, red with shame. Nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up. 
Casey is at the triangle leaving a message on Jody's phone. Boss is running round and round it. 
CASEY Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben must be - Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of apprehension.

BETH (CONT'D) They do, these men, second time round. They get all nappy-happy. I was barely twenty when I got pregnant. I've never done anything! Oh God! God! 
GLEN Yes you have. Look at this place! 
BETH I hate him - I've wasted my life! 
GLEN No... What about all the work you do here? 
BETH Breeding goats? Baking fucking biscuits? It's meaningless! Beth bawls. Glen holds her. 
GLEN Beth... When I was lost with my book you helped me more than you know. You asked who I was writing it for... He starts to really hold her. The sobbing subsides. 
GLEN You. He kisses her. Beth looks at Glen; a revelation. The future opens up. She kisses him back. 
NICHOLAS Excuse me. Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey. 
NICHOLAS (CONT'D) May I speak with my wife? Glen releases Beth. 
BETH No. You may not. She walks away.

160 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 160 
Beth walks outside towards the chicken coup. Nicholas pursues her. She sees Boss running across the grounds chasing birds. 
NICHOLAS It's over. 
BETH That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps he's come to beat the shit out of you - good! 
NICHOLAS Beth - I finished it. She's been chasing me; this wild crush - 
BETH 
LIAR - 
NICHOLAS There's something desperate about her, something almost unhinged - 
BETH Good God, even when you try and tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!! Nicholas is falling apart. 
BETH I want you to leave. I want a divorce. I want Stonefield. 
NICHOLAS Beth...Don't. You can't. 
BETH I will. 
(TO BOSS) And you - Go home! Bugger Off!! She throws a handful of chicken feed at him. Boss runs away. Beth storms off. Nicholas looks profoundly shocked; like a man who has just realised he's in danger of drowning.

BEN Right. Now put two sugars in and stir it. OK. That's a decent cup. Which is lucky Jody cos if it had been shit, I'd be on the phone to the extremely scary local cops right now. 
JODY Please don't tell my mum. 
BEN I knew it was boring round here but for fuck's sake... 
JODY I'm gonna get out as soon as I can. Going to work in Vegas - as a croupier. Vegas, or a cruise liner. 
BEN Aim high, that's what I say.

BETH Bitch. Tamara looks up. 
TAMARA Beth - no - 
BETH Brazen. That is brazen. Beth carries on walking towards her. 
TAMARA Beth. Don't. Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see. She throws her arms around her, protecting her. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) Don't look. Don't look... It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it. Another great wave of shock. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 107.

Tamara, ashen, is on the phone to emergency services. 
TAMARA You'll get to it through Byley farm. His skull is broken. It's smashed. No I haven't but... it's obvious. His wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from his face with water from the trough. 
TAMARA They're on their way... Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. She touches Beth's shoulder. 
TAMARA Beth? Help is coming - Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies out. It slams into Tamara's face. Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood. 
TAMARA It's broken! - She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the biggest wake-up call of her life. Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done - then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.

CAPOTE 
Written by 
Dan Futterman 
Based on the book "Capote: A Biography" by Gerald Clarke 
TITLE UP:         "Western Kansas, 1959" 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING 
The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs, motions for her to go inside. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
The girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen, the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them. 
INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS 
She walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room. 
INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope, SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream, 
CUT TO: 
EXT. KANSAS LANDSCAPE - DAY 
Trees ring the edge of a field. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. N.Y. CITYSCAPE, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
Buildings lit against the night sky. 
INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING/STAIRS - NIGHT 
Camera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs: Truman Capote, Barbara (very tall), Rose, Christopher, Williams. 
INT. SMALL, PACKED NEW YORK APARTMENT/KITCHEN - LATER 
The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing. 
TRUMAN So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot of his book, and he says to me: the writing's going well, but I just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't you call that a problem? 
Laughter. 
CHRISTOPHER Susan's father had a minor heart attack, so she's writing more erotic poems about death and sex. 
BARBARA It's so tiresome. 
WILLIAMS Hmm. What rhymes with angina? 
Laughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues talking, we come closer, hear their conversation. 
GRAYSON How's your writing? 
TRUMAN Oh, I've got a million ideas of what to write next -- I just have to choose one. 
GRAYSON Really? 
TRUMAN No. 
Their attention is pulled back into the group as: 
BARBARA Who would I want to play me? Natalie Wood. 
ROSE Too fat. 
BARBARA Audrey Hepburn? 
ROSE Not bad. Sort of middle-class. 
TRUMAN When a movie is made of my life I know exactly who I want as me... (beat) Marilyn Monroe. 
The PORTERS leave. Nelle is stunned. Truman fiddles with the trunk locks, his back to Nelle. Silence, then: 
NELLE You're pathetic. 
Truman doesn't answer. 
NELLE You're pathetic. 
TRUMAN What? 
NELLE You paid them to say that. 
Truman won't look at her. She whacks him. 
NELLE You paid them to say that! 
TRUMAN (squealing) How'd you know? How did you know?! 
NELLE "Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get." 
TRUMAN You think that was too much? (laughter) I thought that was a good line. 
More laughter. More smacking of Truman. Then it is quiet. 
NELLE Pathetic. 
INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - MORNING 
Nelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window at the Kansas plains. Truman's dressing, watching her. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
TRAVELING SHOTS of harvested FIELDS, grazing LIVESTOCK, solitary FARMHOUSES. 
The TRAIN chugs across the Kansas flatlands. 
SHOTS of SIGNS outside Garden City: "World's Largest Free Swimpool" and "Howdy, Stranger! Welcome to Garden City. A Friendly Place. " 
EXT. GARDEN CITY RENT-A-CAR - DAY 
Truman and Nelle rent a car. People stare. 
I/E. RENTAL CAR - DAY 
Nelle drives past the main square, Truman in the passenger seat. Truman looks at a photo in THE GARDEN CITY TELEGRAM. 
TRUMAN Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of Investigation. KBI. 
INT. LOBBY, WALKER HOTEL, GARDEN CITY - DAY 
Truman and Nelle check in. People stare. Nelle notices. 
EXT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, GARDEN CITY - CONTINUOUS 
Truman and Nelle trot up the COURTHOUSE STEPS. 
INT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 
Truman approaches the GUARD DESK. 
TRUMAN Mr. Alvin Dewey, please. 
GUARD Third floor. In what used to be the Sheriff's Office. 
Truman CURTSIES. 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY 
In the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken over the office. They are: HAROLD "Brother" NYE (34); and ROY "Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke. 
Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as: 
CHURCH The wife said no more smoking in the house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's got a couch upstairs in his apartment. I'll stay with him and Dorothy till we're done here." (to Walter) I've got my bag and a carton of cigarettes in the car. 
WALTER looks uncomfortable. Dewey shakes his head at Church. 
JOURNALIST #2 Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry, sexual molestation of the women? 
DEWEY No. 
JOURNALIST #2 Anything else stolen? 
DEWEY Kenyon's radio seems to be the only... 
JOURNALIST #3 The boy was sixteen? 
DEWEY Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen. 
JOURNALIST #2 It's her friend that found them? 
DEWEY Laura Kinney. 
JOURNALIST #2 Spell that? 
DEWEY I assume you're okay with the Laura part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave her be. 
Lots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself heard above the rest: 
OLD MAN There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, a whole bunch of Mexicans... 
DEWEY (standing, stubs out cigarette) George, it's good to see you again. I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos. We're going to find whoever did this. Four good people from our community are dead. Let's remember that. Okay with you? (holds up a notice) The West Kansas Farm Committee's offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest. Please print that. (moving to the exit) Thank you all for coming. 
The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed by Church and Nye. He's about to step out when Truman catches his eye. Dewey exits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 
Nelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back, looking out at the passing farms through the window. He speaks almost to himself. 
TRUMAN Mr. Dewey's protective of the Clutters. I wonder how well he knew them... 
Nelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice. 
TRUMAN He was foxy with that old man. (turns to Nelle) Are you ever gonna let me drive? 
NELLE Truman, you're a menace. You can barely see over the wheel. 
Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back. 
NELLE This make you miss Alabama? 
TRUMAN (rolling window down, shakes his head) Not even a little bit. 
He leans his head out, closes his eyes. 
EXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET 
Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway. 
CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse. 
FADE OUT. 
EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING 
A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth. 
TRUMAN Hello. 
Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up to a group of THREE GIRLS. 
NELLE Morning. 
GIRL #1 Hi. 
NELLE Can any of you tell me where I'd find Laura Kinney? 
GIRL #1 Oh, um... 
The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall, 
NELLE (gently) Is that her? With the tall boy? 
A SCHOOL BUS picks up a SMALL BOY at the intersection of a DIRT ROAD and the paved COUNTY ROAD. 
A SMALL BRIDGE over the Arkansas river. Below them, men are sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WALKER HOTEL, LOBBY - EARLY MORNING 
Nelle waits by the FRONT DESK. The ELEVATOR DOORS open and Truman emerges. He is DRESSED SOBERLY -- NO LONG SCARF, NO LONG COAT. He walks toward Nelle, then TURNS as if he's a runway model, walks away, turns again and walks back. He stops a few feet in front of her. Nelle refuses to smile. 
NELLE Let's go. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOLCOMB TOWN ROAD - EARLY MORNING 
Danny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his shoulder. Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance. 
NELLE Danny? (Danny stops) Would you mind terribly if I walked with you for a bit? 
He shrugs. They walk together. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Laura opens door to Truman and Nelle. 
INT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 
Nelle and Laura Kinney sit at the table. Truman stands at the counter. 
LAURA I thought you were from the FBI with your long coat. 
TRUMAN Is that so? 
LAURA That's why I ran off. 
TRUMAN I've been getting a lot of that lately. 
Truman smiles. Laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted. 
LAURA It's fine talking to you all. Practically nobody around here wants to talk since what happened. 
NELLE Folks have been through a rough patch. Including you. (Laura nods) Nancy was your best friend. 
LAURA She was my best friend. 
They're quiet for a few moments. 
NELLE How has Danny been? 
LAURA Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever happened to him before. Nancy just started wearing his ring again after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter was trying to get her to end it 'cause Danny's Catholic. 
NELLE What were the Clutters? 
LAURA Methodist. Danny was the last person at the house that night. That's why Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him -- they don't think he had anything to do with it -- just to see if he remembers anything unusual and all. 
NELLE People in town seem to wonder if he was involved. 
LAURA That's been real hard for Danny. 
TRUMAN Oh, it's the hardest -- when people have a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise. Since I was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way I look and the way I talk. They're always wrong. (looks at her) Do you know what I mean? 
Laura stares at him and nods. He's clearly struck a chord. 
LAURA I want to show you something. 
She goes in the door to the GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT. They see her through the LACE CURTAINS getting something from her DESK, which is stacked with books. Truman whispers to Nelle: 
TRUMAN Not one person here understands her. 
Laura returns. She hugs a SMALL BOOK to her chest. After a moment, she holds it out to them. 
LAURA Maybe you'll get a better picture of Nancy. And the family. 
NELLE What is this? 
Jazzy Christmas music on the RADIO. Nelle sits in the big armchair with a drink. She laughs. We HEAR Jack on the phone: 
JACK You're celebrating. 
We see Truman wearing a YELLOW SILK SHORT ROBE with white lace, bare legs. He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model. 
TRUMAN Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York? 
JACK Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird. You said it was good. 
TRUMAN And I was right. She just heard Lipincott wants to publish it. 
JACK (pause) Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell her congratulations. 
TRUMAN Congratulations. (covers phone, mouths to Nelle:) Jealous. 
JACK Just promise you'll be home by Christmas. 
TRUMAN I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it was hard at first, but now I'm practically the mayor. 
He vamps. Nelle laughs. 
JACK Alright. 
TRUMAN I want to come home -- I do. Though if they catch whoever did this, who knows what -- I'll probably be here til next Christmas. 
JACK Right. I'll let you go. 
TRUMAN Jack, we'll go away this spring to write. Maybe Spain... 
JACK Alright, Truman. 
TRUMAN Bye. (hangs up) The poor boy misses me. 
Goes to the mini-bar to fix a drink. 
NELLE Truman. 
TRUMAN Nelle. 
NELLE You remember when we were kids? 
TRUMAN I was never a kid. I was born fully formed. 
NELLE I had no idea what a homosexual was. But I knew whatever they were, you were one of 'em. 
Truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts the door. Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him. From the HALL, we hear a WOMAN SHRIEK, and a MAN saying: 
MAN IN HALL (O.S.) Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us. 
Truman runs back in, shuts door. They crack up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE, ESTABLISHING 
Tasteful Christmas lights strung on the BUSHES. A WREATH on the FRONT DOOR. 
INT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin. Drinks. A FULL ASHTRAY on the coffee table in front of Alvin. He's distracted, smoking. Marie holds a WOMEN'S MAGAZINE, checking what Truman says with what's written there. 
TRUMAN (quickly, as if reciting) -- girdle up -- no extra bulges -- if you're dressed right for him when he gets home, the evening should be smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals. 
MARIE I can't believe you got this whole page -- I only read it to you once! 
TRUMAN I've trained myself. 
NELLE ...trained myself. 
Truman looks at Nelle. 
TRUMAN I have 94 percent recall. 
NELLE ...94 percent recall. 
TRUMAN (laughing) You cut that out. 
Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut. 
FADE OUT: 
EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) - MORNING 
FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - PRIVATE". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door. 
DOROTHY Truman Capote. 
TRUMAN Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hard-working husband of yours. (holds up bag) So I have breakfast. (holds up paper) I have news. (book) And I have literature. My friend Jack mailed me the book you wanted. 
He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the inscription inside. 
DOROTHY "For the maiden of the Midwest, the priestess of the plains, the queen of the kitchen: my first novel. Truman." 
It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS. 
DOROTHY You're too much. Go on into the living room, lemme grab that -- it's been ringing all morning. 
INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen. 
INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.) 
Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several moments, Dorothy enters, flustered: 
DOROTHY Oh. Truman. I meant in there. (points to living room) I... um... 
Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs. 
DOROTHY It's the women's cell. It's hardly ever used. But they wanted to, um, separate... Please. Let's sit in the living room. I'll set up in the living room. 
She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS. 
DOROTHY Come. 
She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers. 
TRUMAN They put you in the women's cell. 
PERRY Among other indignities. 
Perry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are precisely enunciated. 
TRUMAN Well... she's a good cook. 
PERRY She's scared of me. 
TRUMAN I think so am I. A little bit. 
PERRY Are you? (a moment, then:) You have any aspirin? My legs -- 
Dorothy's in the doorway. 
DOROTHY Um. Truman? All set. 
Truman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry. 
TRUMAN I'm sorry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70). 
Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry -- 
TRUMAN (murmurs) His feet don't touch the floor. 
JUDGE TATE In the matter of the State of Kansas v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this Court has been informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks -- that defendants wish to waive their right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr. Hickock, is that your wish? 
Hickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands. 
TRUMAN Will you tell me if you need anything? I can have whatever you want sent from New York. (no answer) Will you do that? 
On Perry, considering whether to trust this man. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NEW YORKER, WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Phone RINGS, WILLIAM SHAWN answers (50, New Yorker editor, conservatively attired) at a desk looking onto 44th street. 
SHAWN William Shawn. 
TRUMAN (OVER PHONE) Gorgeous? 
SHAWN Truman. 
INTERCUT to Truman in a PHONE BOOTH outside the COURTHOUSE. 
INT. COURTHOUSE PHONEBOOTH - DAY 
TRUMAN I'm writing a book. It's too much for a single article -- this town, the killers most of all -- you will be stunned by Perry Smith -- 
SHAWN Why? What has he -- 
TRUMAN Not much yet, but I know. I can sense him. He's desperately lonely, frightened... I have questions -- are you ready? 
SHAWN Would it matter -- 
TRUMAN How much more money can you send me? How quickly can you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures? 
INTERCUT to WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE. On Shawn -- he doesn't know how to begin to respond. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HICKOCK'S JAIL CELL - DAY 
Perry has been placed in an adjoining cell for the afternoon. He COMBS his greased hair in a mirror. A camera FLASHES. 
Nelle and Truman sit outside the cells. Franklin Weeks dozes off to the side. RICHARD AVEDON -- small, dark, wiry, flamboyant -- is snapping photos of a bare-chested Hickock in the next cell, particularly his TATTOOS, while Hickock chatters away. 
HICKOCK Perry, honey. You look terrific... 
Perry is embarrassed, glances over at Truman. FLASH. 
HICKOCK Calm yourself down, sweetheart. 
Perry glances at Nelle. She MOTIONS to him that his SHIRT is buttoned wrong. Perry fixes it, looks back at her. 
Hickock notices Truman gazing at his tattoos -- the one on his CHEST: the word PEACE, with a cross radiating rays of light. 
HICKOCK Be patient, Capote. Maybe later they'll send you my skin. 
TRUMAN I have the perfect place for it, over the hearth. 
Hickock smiles. FLASH. Truman looks over at Perry, sitting alone. Truman starts to remove his TIE. 
PHOTOS, in quick succession: Of Hickock pulling up his sleeve to reveal his tattoos. Of Perry combing his HAIR. FLASH. The GRINNING CAT on Hickock's hand. FLASH. Perry looking directly at the camera. FLASH. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTHOUSE - MORNING, ONE MONTH LATER 
Series of shots in and around the courthouse: 
TITLE UP:             "One month later" 
An officer approaches down a long hallway. A janitor cleans the basin of the water fountain. Spectators are drawn into the courthouse. The officer opens the courtroom doors. A crescendo of sounds. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
Spectators take seats. The jury files back into the box. Perry and Dick chew gum. Perry wears TRUMAN'S TIE, and draws on a pad with a NEW SET OF COLORED PENCILS -- another PARROT, quite beautiful, now YELLOW. Nelle and Truman sit together. 
NELLE Where'd Perry get the art set? 
Truman shrugs. Nelle raises her eyebrows. Judge Tate GAVELS loudly, looks to the jury. 
JUDGE TATE Members of the jury. Have you reached a verdict? 
TRUMAN He's as short as I am. And almost as pretty. I'd be with him right now but he's being given new accommodations -- 
Guests laugh. 
TRUMAN Most people assume he's a monster. I don't see him that way. The book I'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity -- it's the book I was always meant to write... 
Nelle and Jack stand back, watching. 
JACK Watch out. This is the start of a great love affair. 
NELLE Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman. 
INT. LE PAVILLON RESTAURANT - DAY 
Truman is being interviewed over lunch. 
TRUMAN ...I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week. I had to break it to her that, of the four Matisses hanging on her wall, two were upside down. 
The REPORTER laughs. A waiter passes. Truman taps his glass. 
TRUMAN Another. (to reporter) To answer your question, I'm following "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing a different path -- by inventing an entirely new kind of writing: the non-fiction novel. 
REPORTER You have a subject? 
Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now. 
TRUMAN On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry -- it's not worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country -- the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men -- the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers -- and I'll spend more. (waiter brings his drink) Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of view about almost everything. I think those who read it will be similarly affected. (he sips) Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction -- 
REPORTER You're speaking of yourself. 
TRUMAN You're really very clever. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY 
Truman sits in bed, writing on a yellow LEGAL PAD, surrounded by PILES of notes. He squints his eyes, concentrating. Jack enters, delivers a CUP OF COFFEE. Truman doesn't notice. 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER 
Truman is rifling through the boxes, looking for particular notes. He can't find what he needs. The phone RINGS. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON 
Jack and Truman walk. 
TRUMAN Perry's decided to appeal. He claims their attorney was incompetent -- that he never raised the issue of temporary insanity. 
JACK So you find them a new lawyer. 
TRUMAN They're facing execution in six weeks, Jack. They need someone to argue whether or not that's right. 
JACK Okay. 
TRUMAN I'd also like to see them alive, yes, thank you very much. I need to hear their story. 
They walk in silence for a few moments. 
TRUMAN If you met him you'd understand. It's as if no-one's ever asked him a single question about himself. He's so... damaged -- and strange -- unexplored... (then) I don't trust this Hickock fellow. Perry's the only person who can describe to me what happened that night. I need to hear him say it. 
JACK Just be careful what you do to get what you want. 
TRUMAN I'm finding them a lawyer. 
JACK Truman. You're finding yourself a lawyer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR, DRIVING, TWO-LANE KANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY 
Truman drives alone, concentrating intently. He has to stretch to see over the dashboard. 
EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY (KSP), LANSING - DAY 
A turreted, Civil War-era fortress an hour's drive from Kansas City. Truman pulls up to the GUARDHOUSE. 
Truman sees Perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose. Perry's rather striking drawing of a LARGE YELLOW PARROT sits propped on his table. An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 
Camera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf. 
INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 
Truman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY 
Truman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels. 
TRUMAN (to Perry) I don't care what your plans are for yourself... 
He decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic BABY SPOON from the basket. 
TRUMAN But you're gonna wake up enough to tell me what you did with my tie. 
He spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away. Truman leans close to Perry, whispers: 
TRUMAN It's okay. It's Truman. It's your friend. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON) 
Perry sleeps. Truman stands against the wall watching him. He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. Truman touches it. 
INT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING) 
Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting. Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT) 
Perry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman. 
TRUMAN How'd you learn to draw like that? 
Perry closes his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR, DRIVING - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY) 
Truman drives through the KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY gate, waves to the Guard. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING 
Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly. 
PERRY Before she had us. Before she started drinking. 
TRUMAN Who took care of you as a child? 
PERRY Orphanage. Me and Linda. 
TRUMAN That's your sister? 
Perry nods. Truman waits for more. It doesn't come. 
TRUMAN We're not so different as you might think. I was abandoned repeatedly as a child. My mama'd drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met. Night after night she'd lock me in the hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what. I was terrified -- I'd scream my head off -- till finally I'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and fall asleep. After years of this she just left me with relatives in Alabama. 
PERRY Who raised you up? 
TRUMAN My Aunts. (Perry nods) That's when I met Nelle -- she lived next door. (looks again at the photo, hands it back) Your mother was Indian? 
PERRY Cherokee. 
TRUMAN Drinking was not a good thing for her. 
PERRY No tolerance for it. 
TRUMAN And your father? 
NELLE Christ. I guess it stopped being funny. 
TRUMAN I never said it was. (turns a page) Listen to this... 
EXT. KANSAS CITYSCAPE - VARIOUS (TWO WEEKS ELAPSE) 
INT. DINER, DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY - MORNING 
Truman is eating breakfast with Alvin Dewey. A WAITRESS refills their coffees. 
DEWEY (to waitress) Thanks. 
She leaves. An uncomfortable silence. Then: 
DEWEY You're nothing if not hard-working. 
TRUMAN You look good, healthy again. 
DEWEY Not a chance. 
Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack. 
TRUMAN I've decided on a title for my book. I think you'll like it -- very masculine. "In Cold Blood." 
DEWEY (lights the cigarette) That refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the criminals? 
TRUMAN The former, among other things. 
DEWEY I see. 
They eat for a moment. Then: 
TRUMAN I've been wanting to ask if you'll let me look at your investigation notes. 
DEWEY That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court -- 
TRUMAN I heard this morning. 
DEWEY -- on the issue of inadequate counsel. 
TRUMAN Alvin. Do you not want me to look at your notes? You are permitted to say no. 
DEWEY (rises, takes out wallet) I'll tell you what: if those boys get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down. 
Truman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not. Dewey puts money on the table. 
DEWEY I have to be in court at nine o'clock. 
He walks away. Over his shoulder: 
DEWEY Call Roy Church. He'll show you what you want to see. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY 
Truman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman. 
HICKOCK Hey, hey... 
Truman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past. He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER) is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments, then Perry looks at him. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER 
The Guard locks Truman inside with Perry. 
PERRY Thank you. 
Truman looks at the Guard -- he leaves. 
TRUMAN It was as much for me as for anyone. I couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon. 
PERRY We're going to be able to use your book for our case. You'll write we never got to raise our insanity plea. You wrote how terrible the lawyer was? 
TRUMAN I haven't written a word yet. 
Beat. 
NELLE (to Truman) When was the last time you wrote back to him? 
TRUMAN I don't know. 
JACK What's this? 
NELLE A letter for your boyfriend I was asked to deliver. 
TRUMAN From Perry. 
JACK Let's have it. 
Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads: 
NELLE "Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? Read this item in a medical dictionary: "Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, by fracture of the cervical vertebrae, by laceration of the trachea." Not too comforting as we lost our appeal. Missing you -- alone and desirous of your presence. Your amigo, Perry." 
Pause. 
TRUMAN Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday. 
JACK I was wondering why you were in such a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's not because I finished my little book. 
TRUMAN That's a terrible thing to say. 
Jack looks out at the ocean. 
TRUMAN (to no one in particular) I used to write him all the time. I've been so focused lately on the book. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY 
Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a waiting TAXI. 
TRUMAN Jack says I'm using Perry, but he also thinks I fell in love with him when I was in Kansas. How both of those things can be true is beyond me. 
NELLE Did you? Fall in love with him. 
Silence as they load the bags into the trunk. 
NELLE Truman? -- 
TRUMAN I don't know how to answer that... It's as if Perry and I started life in the same house. One day he stood up and walked out the back door while I walked out the front. With some different choices, he's the man I might have become. 
NELLE Are you kidding me? 
Truman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him. 
NELLE Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think he's what I like about you best. 
TRUMAN (smiles) I'll see you at the reading in New York. 
NELLE The sixteenth. 
Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window. 
NELLE Truman. Honestly. Are you going back to Kansas because you care about Perry or because you need information before he's killed? 
TRUMAN Can't it be both? 
NELLE No. I don't think it can be. 
She drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the bushes at the front gate. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY 
A Guard walks down the corridor carrying a SINGLE FLOWER. He delivers it to Perry, then walks off. Perry is confused. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching, but can't see who it is. 
HICKOCK (O.S.) Hey, buddy. Thanks. 
More footsteps. CAMERA on Perry as the footsteps finally arrive outside his cell. He's shocked. 
REVERSE onto Truman, looking tanned, healthy, very blond. He holds a STACK OF BOOKS with a BOW on top. He smiles. 
CUT TO: 
ANDREWS Alright now. 
HICKOCK ...or they won't be able to rope you under your fat fucking chin. 
Andrews is led past Perry's cell. He looks in at Perry. 
ANDREWS Next! 
Andrews shuffles down the hall. Perry watches him go. On Truman watching Perry. We hear the GATE slam shut. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THEATER - EVENING 
Packed. Nelle stands with William Shawn, who receives well- wishers. BEN BARON enters, seeing Nelle. 
BEN BARON (loudly, over the hubbub) Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle you sold your book for. 
Nelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of money brought up publicly. 
NELLE Well... 
Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn. 
NELLE What a gentleman. 
INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Truman sits alone. In the background, we can HEAR the noise of the huge crowd gathering in the theater. Truman wears his MOST STYLISH LITERARY OUTFIT: a gorgeous dark green Knize SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed GLASSES (which we've never seen him wear before). 
He's frozen with anticipation, nervousness. After several moments a THEATER ASSISTANT opens the door. 
YOUNG ASSISTANT Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything? 
TRUMAN No. (clears his throat) Thank you. 
The assistant leaves. We hear the crowd quiet down. Truman rises slowly, walks through the door to the backstage area. We hear William Shawn on stage. 
SHAWN (O.S.) Welcome New Yorkers... 
INT. WINGS/STAGE - NIGHT 
Shawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesn't come. Truman continues walking toward the backstage curtains. 
SHAWN (O.S.) Thank you for coming to the first public reading, the first offering of any kind, of Truman Capote's new work "In Cold Blood." Our magazine -- 
Truman walks on stage. Loud applause. Shawn sees him, slinks back to his seat. Truman walks over to the podium, takes in the enormous crowd. Once it is completely quiet: 
TRUMAN Hello. My name is Truman Capote. 
People laugh and applaud loudly. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - SAME TIME, NIGHT 
Perry, eating dinner alone at his table, looks up. We HEAR a LOUD ENGINE revving outside. 
EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME 
A FRONT-LOADER TRACTOR drives into the warehouse. A PRISON POLICE CAR parks outside the warehouse. Guards get the enormous Lowell Lee Andrews, shackled, from the back seat, walk him inside. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT 
C/U on Perry, now standing on his chair and watching out the tiny window. 
CUT TO: 
INT THEATER, NYC - NIGHT 
Truman on stage reading. 
TRUMAN Perry Smith's voice was both gentle and prim -- a voice that, though soft, manufactured each sound exactly -- ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - SAME TIME 
TRUMAN I think so. You know they're scheduled for next month? 
SHAWN Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many issues as it takes to publish. Three. As many as it takes. 
TRUMAN I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll get Perry to talk -- 
SHAWN Honestly, what's he got to lose? 
Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself. 
TRUMAN It really is too awful. Institutionalized sadism. 
Shawn nods. 
SHAWN You'll be able to finish now. 
TRUMAN As strange as it may sound to you, I'm going to miss him. 
FADE OUT. 
Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then passing. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY 
Truman, flushed, out of breath, stands outside Perry's cell. He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS. 
TRUMAN When did you hear? 
Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared enthusiasm. He smiles widely. 
PERRY Two days ago. 
The Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of the DOCUMENTS. 
PERRY It's what we've been waiting for. A stay of execution to make a federal appeal. 
Truman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly. 
PERRY All thanks to you. 
On Truman, shocked, being hugged. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER 
Truman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry -- hyped up, talking, walking around the cell. 
PERRY Kansas's had it in for me for ten years -- in prison the first time, at that trial, here. They can't corner me now. Not till the U.S. Government says so -- 
TRUMAN Perry, sit down. For a minute. (Perry sits) I need you to talk to me... 
PERRY We've got all the time in the world to talk. About everything. I've been thinking about Ricardo. You need to stop sending him those trashy books. I won't even mention the pornography. (getting up) I realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me, but those books only exacerbate the problem -- only 'heighten' or 'intensify' it. Maybe we should start him on a program... 
TRUMAN Perry. 
PERRY Give him the simple novels first -- 
TRUMAN Perry. 
Perry stops. 
TRUMAN I know what exacerbate means. 
PERRY Okay. I thought in case... 
TRUMAN There is not a word, or a sentence, or a concept, that you can illuminate for me. There is one singular reason that I keep coming here -- 
PERRY Truman -- 
TRUMAN ...November 14th, 1959. Three years ago. Three years. That's all I want to hear from you. 
Pause. 
PERRY I've asked you not to -- 
TRUMAN (stands up) This is ridiculous. (to the Guard) I'm ready. (to Perry) I have a plane to catch. I found your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful. 
The Guard unlocks the door. Perry STARTS TO MOVE toward it. The Guard SLAMS it shut. 
PERRY What's the name of your book? 
No response. Perry can barely control his anger. 
PERRY What's the name of your book? 
TRUMAN I don't... 
PERRY What's the name of your book? 
TRUMAN I don't know what you're talking about. 
Perry picks up a cut-out ARTICLE from the NY Times from his desk. He reads. 
PERRY "Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience from his non-fiction book IN COLD BLOOD." 
He looks at Truman. 
PERRY More? (reads) "The true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who brutally murdered a Kansas family three years ago." 
TRUMAN Who sent that to you? 
Perry doesn't answer. 
TRUMAN Who sent that to you? 
PERRY That's not your goddamn business. 
TRUMAN It is my business, because it's not true. The organizers of the reading needed a title. They picked one -- a sensational one, I admit -- to attract a crowd. 
PERRY They picked it. 
TRUMAN Yes. 
PERRY That's not your title. 
TRUMAN I haven't chosen one yet. 
Perry stares at him, not believing. 
TRUMAN How could I choose -- 
PERRY You pretend to be my friend... 
TRUMAN How could I choose a title when you still haven't told me what happened that night? How could I? I couldn't possibly. 
Long pause. Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts a PHOTO (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle.) 
TRUMAN I have something from your sister. 
He hands it through the bars to Perry. Perry takes it. 
TRUMAN She misses you. 
Perry looks at the photo. After a few moments, Truman turns to the Guard. 
TRUMAN It's alright. I'll go in. 
The Guard unlocks the cell. Truman enters. The Guard locks up, walks away. Perry is still looking at the PHOTO. 
TRUMAN I'm sorry. I should have told you what they made me call the book. (touches Perry's arm) I couldn't pretend to be your friend. The truth is, I can't help wanting to be. (silence, then:) You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to. 
Perry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a long time. 
PERRY Look at my belly. 
Perry sits on the bed. Then, almost to himself: 
PERRY There must be something wrong with us. To do what we did. 
Truman waits him out, sitting on the chair. Finally, Perry looks at him. When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely matter-of-fact. 
PERRY We heard there was ten thousand dollars in that house. Once we'd tied up everybody and searched all over, I knew the guy who told us about it was wrong. There wasn't any money. But Dick wouldn't believe it. He went tearing through the house again, banging on the walls, looking for a safe. He said when he was done, he was going to come up to Nancy's room and have his way with her. I wouldn't allow it. I told him that. I sat with Nancy. 
CUT TO: 
TRUMAN Added up, how much money did you get from the Clutters? 
Perry thinks. 
PERRY Between forty and fifty dollars. 
Truman nods. They sit there for a long time. 
FADE OUT: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAWN, CONTINUOUS 
FADE IN: Hands typing on a MANUAL TYPEWRITER. 
Truman typing at the desk. He stops, removes the page from the typewriter, places it on top of a SMALL STACK OF PAGES. He sits back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PLANE - DAY 
Truman in his seat, sips a drink. He looks out the window. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON 
Truman walks with his TRAVEL BAG on his shoulder. He takes out his KEYS and turns up the steps to his house. 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Truman opens the door. 
TRUMAN Jack. 
No answer. He walks down the hall to the BEDROOM. 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Truman enters, drops his travel bag on the bed, zips it open, removes a SMALL STACK OF TYPED PAGES. He walks to his desk. 
On the desk, we see a HUGE STACK OF TYPED PAGES with a title page on top which reads: IN COLD BLOOD. Truman lifts the HUGE STACK, places the SMALL STACK under it. He smooths out the pages, then steps back from it. He calls out: 
TRUMAN Jack. 
No answer. On Truman, standing in the middle of his room. He has finished all that he can finish, and is lost as to what to do next. 
FADE OUT. 
TITLE UP:          "One Year Later" 
OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE COME UP SLOWLY: 
TRUMAN (V.O.) ...I want to give it to you. The truth is, I'm desperate to be done with it... 
FADE IN: 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Truman on the PHONE, in pajamas, looking in the FRIDGE. 
TRUMAN Mr. Shawn, I... I've spent four years of my life on this book... They got a stay of execution yesterday... Another, yes.... 
He gets out a jar of BONNET BABY FOOD CUSTARD and starts to eat it. Truman finds a bottle of J&B on the counter and pours a shot in his custard. 
TRUMAN Supreme Court.... 
He stirs the custard, eats it. 
TRUMAN ...It's harrowing -- all I want is to write the ending and there's no fucking end in sight... No. No, I haven't been drinking again... 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER 
Truman sits on the bed with a glass of bourbon, staring at the television. An empty jar of BABY CUSTARD sits on the bedside table. 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER 
Truman on the bed, the television still on, another drink. We hear a DOORBELL. We hear Jack walk down the hall, answer the door, shut the door. Jack enters with a TELEGRAM. 
INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT 
Perry sits alone. The door opens and a Guard brings in his LAST MEAL: three hot dogs, french fries, an ice cream sundae, a strawberry soda. The Guard sets it down on the chair. 
PERRY Thank you. (then) You sent the telegram to his hotel? 
GUARD Hours ago. 
Perry looks at the CLOCK on the wall: it's after 8pm. 
PERRY May I make a phone call? 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, MUEHLEBACH HOTEL, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT 
PHONE ringing. The CLOCK rads 8:55pm. Empty drinks glasses, a custard jar. Truman lies curled in a fetal position on the BED. Shawn walks the floor, exasperated. 
SHAWN That's him again. 
Truman is immobile. Phone still rings. 
SHAWN We've never even met. It is utterly inappropriate for me to be talking to him. 
Shawn gives up, PICKS UP the phone. 
SHAWN Yes... I'm sorry, he's out, gone out... I'm not sure when... 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Krutch walks with a TELEGRAM PAGE in hand. A Guard follows. They pass a WALL CLOCK: 9:40pm. 
INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT 
Krutch and Guard enter Perry's cell. Perry hasn't touched his meal. 
KRUTCH You got a telex. 
Perry nods. Krutch reads: 
KRUTCH "Perry. Unable to visit today because not permitted. Always your friend, Truman." (apologetically) That's it. 
PERRY It's not true, is it? 
Krutch hesitates a moment, then SHAKES his head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NELLE'S KITCHEN, MONROEVILLE - MINUTES LATER 
Nelle on the PHONE looking at a TELEGRAM. The kitchen CLOCK reads 10:20pm. She waits a moment till the line is answered. 
NELLE (ON PHONE) Mr. Shawn? It's Nelle... I just got this telegram, has he seen it? 
INTERCUT with William Shawn on the phone in Truman's hotel room. A TELEGRAM lies on the DESK. Truman lies on the bed. 
INT. MUEHLEBACH HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT 
SHAWN (ON PHONE) He won't look at it. 
NELLE Would you put him on please? 
SHAWN He won't talk. 
NELLE (calmly) Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear, I need to speak to him. 
Shawn, terrifically uncomfortable, walks over to Truman and holds the phone out to him. 
SHAWN It's Nelle. 
A moment, then Truman takes the phone. On Truman's face. We hear, through the receiver, Nelle: 
NELLE (OVER PHONE) Truman. 
Truman finally breathes out. 
KRUTCH Time. 
Truman looks at the clock: 11:50pm. Truman turns to Perry and Dick. Perry stands. 
PERRY You'll be watching? 
TRUMAN I don't know. Do you want me to? 
PERRY I'd like to have a friend there. 
TRUMAN Okay. Then I will. 
Truman looks down, starts to cry. 
PERRY It's alright. 
TRUMAN I did everything I could. 
PERRY Okay. 
TRUMAN I truly did. 
PERRY I know. 
Truman nods, wipes his eyes. 
TRUMAN Goodbye, Perry. 
PERRY You're not rid of me yet. I'll see you in a few minutes. 
Truman goes. On Perry watching him leave. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Huge. Dirt floor. Wooden gallows. TWENTY MEN stand around, some smoking. Some are silent. Some whisper quietly. 
Journalists. Also, Alvin Dewey and the KBI men: Church and Nye. Krutch in front of the gallows with a CHAPLAIN. At the foot of the gallows steps, the EXECUTIONER -- thin, older, a too-large pin-striped suit and stained cowboy hat. Truman. William Shawn. 
HEADLIGHTS, then a PRISON CAR enters, stops. Dick is extracted from the back seat. He stands, looks at the CROWD, then at the GALLOWS. The Guards nudge him forward. 
INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
CLOCK reads 12:05pm. Perry sits alone looking at his hands. We HEAR A TRAP DOOR SPRING and CLATTER. Perry looks up. 
INT. PRISON CAR - NIGHT 
Light rain outside. Perry in the back seat being driven across the yard. He looks out his window, sees a PICKUP TRUCK drive out of the Corner Warehouse. On it: a BODY covered by a BLACK CLOTH. 
INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
The PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman. He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand: 
PERRY Nice to see you. 
Dewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led to the base of the gallows. 
KRUTCH Perry Edward Smith. (reads) "For the crime of murder in the first degree, by order of the Court of Finney County and the Supreme Court of the sovereign State of Kansas, you are sentenced to hang until you die." (then) You can say something if you want. 
PERRY (quietly, to Krutch) Is there anybody from the family here? 
KRUTCH No. 
Perry is disappointed by this information. 
PERRY Well. Tell them... (he look out at everyone) I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me... 
He stops. Several moments. 
Krutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows. 
CHAPLAIN Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. 
The Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK. 
Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the crowd, at Truman.

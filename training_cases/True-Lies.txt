JUNO Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces. 
HARRY I'd like that. 
23   INT. VAN - NIGHT 
Gib can't believe this conversation. 
GIB (to Faisil) Son of a bitch is with her two minutes and she's ready to bear his children (to Harry) What's your exit strategy Twinkle Toes? 
24   EXT. CHATEAU/ FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides confidently through.  He goes down the steps to the broad terrace above the motor court.  Behind Harry, a GUARD lowers his walky talky and starts after him. 
GUARD May I see your invitation, sir? 
Without turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast pocket.  A REMOTE DETONATOR. 
HARRY                                        * Here's my invitation.                                  * 
He pushes the button and--                                       * 
KABOOM!  The  second floor office windows blow out in a fiery explosion.  Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace before the guard can open fire. 
25   INT. / EXT. VAN - NIGHT 
Gib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away.  He starts the van. 
GIB Aw, shit.  Here we go-- 
26   EXT. CHATEAU AND GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees. Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing.  The snow explodes around him with bullet hits. 
TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect unison.  He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid- leap with a crack like a baseball bat.  The dogs drop to the snow, wobbling around like they're drunk. 
As Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes ahead, leaping directly for his throat.  Harry grabs the dog and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride.  Dog Fu.  The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch, looking down in amazement. 
27   EXT. PERIMETER WALL/ MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT 
Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow bank and sliding downhill.  He sprints down the gentle slope toward the highway. 
Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard station beside the main entrance. 
TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with lights.  They have lost Harry.  They stop.  A snowbank behind them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out.  He disables them both with vicious street-fighter moves.  Harry looks upslope as-- 
A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some on SNOWMOBILES.  A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of swirling snow.  Its xenon lights rake through the trees, casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow. 
ON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one of the disabled guards.  He pops the boots quickly into the bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL rifles slung across his back. 
The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through the forest.  Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols zig-zagging among the trees. 
Harry slashes expertly downhill.  He cuts a distinguished figure in his black tux.  Automatic weapons fire rips through the trees from behind him.  Harry is going flat-out.  The xenon light hits him.  A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the   * slope into white clouds around him.  Harry slashes, turns, weaving among the trees at breakneck speed.  A snowmobile is closing in, outflanking him.  He turns toward it, suddenly. Hits a mogul.  Uses the air to slash his skis right across the rider's face.  The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the night. 
28   INT. / EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 
GIB'S VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide. 
INSIDE Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on. All he can see are lights and gunfire. 
GIB Harry, what's your twenty?  I need a position, buddy-- 
Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from the slope above, RIGHT OVER THE VAN, and lands deftly downslope. 
GIB Uh... right!  I'll catch you on the next bend. 
Behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road.  Only about half can make the jump.  The rest crash horribly.  The helicopter thunders overhead. 
29   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT 
Harry sees the chopper start an attack run.  He comes out into the open, going straight downhill like a rocket.  The chopper gets suckered in...  trying to hit him, getting right down behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle.  P-P-P-POW!  He rakes a burst across the windshield.  The startled pilot swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him. 
K-WHACK!  The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank.  It slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering. 
Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right across Harry's path.  Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles, comes out of it...  running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots.  He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow. 
Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper, which still has its engine running.  The ski patrol opens fire from upslope.  Rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter. 
Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea.  He jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it. It slips over the edge.  He leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope. 
30   INT./ EXT. HELICOPTER - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT 
Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail- rotor to steer.  The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is skiing the damn thing down the mountain. 
The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its        * skids.  Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around it.  Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees.  A snowmobile hits a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine. 
GIB (OVER) Harry!  Where are you! 
HARRY In the helicopter. 
31   INT./ EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 
Gib slides the van around a curve. 
38   INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM/ BATHROOM - DAY 
Harry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but            * incredibly ugly dog, GIZMO, who skitters past him going the      * other way. 
HARRY Dana, don't forget to feed Gizmo!                      * 
Harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past Helen who is clearly rushing to get ready herself.  We get our first good look at Helen.  She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an outfit.  Her hair is wrapped in a towel.  To call her plain would be inaccurate.  She could be attractive if she put any effort into it, which doesn't occur to her. 
HARRY I'm late. 
HELEN Me too. 
They talk without looking at each other, the way people who have been together a long time do. 
HELEN How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous? 
HARRY Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount... 
She is already tuning him out.  And it hits us:  SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HARRY REALLY DOES. 
HELEN (barely listening) That's fabulous Harry. 
HARRY Yeah, it was wild. 
Harry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth. He smiles.  The best lies are told with enthusiasm. 
39   INT. FRONT HALLWAY, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Gib opens the door, knocks a bit, then strolls in like he lives there.  He is wearing dark Ray Bans, like he's doing a Roy Orbison impression.  Gizmo runs toward him, yapping, but Gib gives him the evil eye. 
GIB Come any closer I'll kill you. 
The dog backs up, whining plaintively.  Gib throws his jacket over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out a pack of CAMELS and sets it on the mantelpiece.  He adjusts its position carefully.  Hmmmm. 
40   INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Harry  and Helen maneuver around each other expertly.  She is doing her make-up. 
HELEN The plumber came yesterday.  He said they have to dig under the slab or something and it's going to be six hundred dollars to fix. 
Harry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in front of the mirror.  His mind is elsewhere.  He couldn't care less about there domestic problems. 
HARRY Uh huh.  Okay. 
HELEN It's not okay.  It's extortion. 
HARRY What did you tell him? 
HELEN I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks. 
HARRY Good thinking, honey. 
Harry kisses her on the cheek and exits. 
41   INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Gib enters and pours two cups of coffee.  Dana is drinking orange juice from the bottle at the fridge. 
GIB Hi, kid. 
DANA Hey, Gib.  What up? 
She EXITS, eating an uncooked pop-tart.  Harry comes in a second later and Gib hands him his coffee. 
HARRY Thanks dear. 
GIB Here, check these out. 
Gib hands Harry the glasses.  Harry studies them, seeing the VIRTUAL VIDEO DISPLAY inside the left lens of the Ray Bans. Harry glances down the hall, making sure no-one is looking, then he puts them on. 
HARRY'S POV - INSIDE THE GLASSES - A black and white video image of his own living room. 
GIB The CCD camera and transmitter and inside a pack of smokes. Slick little unit, huh? 
IN POV we see Dana enter the living room.  She looks around carefuly, then quickly lifts Gib's jacket and slips out his wallet.  She palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts the wallet back.  Pro moves. 
HARRY Son of a bitch! 
GIB What? 
Harry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen. Gib goes after him. 
42   EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
Dana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and runs to her boyfriend, TRENT, who is waiting for her in the driveway on his idling YAMAHA.  Trent is 16, dressed in grunge- rock style, trying to look tough.  Harry comes out the front door as Trent revs the motor. 
HARRY Dana!! 
She waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch and they shoot down the driveway. 
DANA (yelling over the engine) Can't stop, I'm late.  Bye, Dad! 
43   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR/ STREETS OF WASHINGTON - DAY 
Gib and Harry pass through the inner door of the sally port into a large austere atrium. 
ANGLE FROM ABOVE as they cross.  A huge graphic logo covers the floor.  Across the center is says OMEGA SECTOR.  In smaller print, around the perimeter, is the motto: "THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE". 
They enter a high-tech office space.  It is a maze of glass partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles. There is a hushed quality here.  People do not joke.  They do not hurry.  There are a lot of computer screens displaying information from around the world.  It looks like a combination of NASA mission control and FBI headquarters. 
Fast Faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned cubicle. 
HARRY Come on, Fize.  We're late for our butt-grinding. 
Faisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them. 
49   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
A dark and severe conference room, with large-screen computer displays at one end.  Glowering at one end of the long, polished table, is SPENCER TRILBY, the chief of Omega Sector. Visualize a cross between Colin Powel and J.  Edgar Hoover. 
TRILBY Jesus, Harry!  You guys really screwed the pooch last night. Please tell me how I can look at this, that it's not a total pooch- screw. 
HARRY Total is a strong word-- 
GIB There are degrees of totality. 
FAISIL It's a scale really, with "perfect mission" on one end and "total pooch-screw" on the other and we're more about here-- 
TRILBY Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you? 
FAISIL Yes. 
TRILBY So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?! 
FAISIL Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got. 
He hits a button and a photo of Khaled fills a wall-screen. 
FAISIL Jamal Khaled.  We think he's dirty so we raid his financial files...  Check it out... 
Faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the data for their raid. 
FAISIL One hundred million in wire transfers from the COMMERCE BANK                       * INTERNATIONAL--                                        * 
GIB Which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist                      * activities.  Something big is                          * going down -- 
FAISIL                                       * And we know that a week ago four                       * MIRV warheads were smuggled out                        * of the former Soviet Republic of                       * Kazakhstan .  .  . 
HARRY                                        * We think Khaled's group has                            * bought the nukes and is bringing                       * them to U.S.  soil.                                    * 
TRILBY                                       * So far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentleman.  Do you have                      * anything remotely substantial?                         * Don't be pumping beets up my ass                       * here.  Do you have hard data?                          * 
HARRY                                        * Not what  you'd call rock hard.                        * 
GIB                                          * It's pretty limp, actually.                            * 
TRILBY                                       * Then perhaps you better get some                       * ... before somebody parks a car                        * in front of the White House with a nuclear weapon in the trunk! 
50   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
It is the interior of a huge law office.  Helen works there as a paralegal.  She is going to the break room for coffee with her friend, ALLISON, a secretary.  Allison is black, younger then Helen, and still single. 
HELEN I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. 
ALLISON So I guess you didn't get away                         * for the weekend after all?                             * 
HELEN Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town. 
ALLISON I'm shocked. 
HELEN Yeah.  You know Harry. 
Helen's nerdy boss BRAD, comes up behind her, scowling. 
BRAD Helen, have you pulled those files yet?  I need them by lunch. 
HELEN I won't let you down, Brad. 
Brad leaves. 
HELEN                                        * (under her breath)                                * You little pencil-neck.                                * (to Allison)                                      * So... yo... sista!  D'you do                           * anything interesting? 
ALLISON                                      * Oh... Eric and I drove up to this                      * little romantic inn, and...                            * pretty much lapped champagne out of each other's navels for two days. 
HELEN You bitch. 
ALLISON Girlfriend, you got a man.  You                        * just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.                              * 
HELEN Harry only has two moods: busy...                      * and asleep. 
ALLISON Then you better do something to                        * jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion. 
They both crack up at that one. 
51   INT. OMEGA SECTOR (DATA CENTER) - DAY                            * 
Harry meets up with Gib and Faisil coming from the ANALYSIS      * Department.                                                      * 
There is definitely unholy magnetism here.  She indicates for Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of offices.  There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls. 
JUNO So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters? 
HARRY That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see. 
Juno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area. There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates.  An overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces.  There are massive columns, and statues two stories high.  Even the entire facade of a tomb. 
JUNO So what did these... people... say about me exactly? 
They stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment.  Most of the workers are middle-eastern. 
HARRY Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much. 
JUNO Those wimps.  It's because I use                       * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. (yelling in Arabic to two workmen) I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going. 
We realize that A WORKMAN is watching them intently from nearby.  He is an intense looking MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN in his mid- thirties. 
JUNO You see, a lot of these pieces are from ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia is twenty feet under the sand of                          * Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Not the most popular places lately.  So I've had to become an expert in international diplomacy. 
Juno stops and looks at Harry.  Her smile indicates the possibility of more than just business. 
JUNO Well, do you see anything you like, Mr. Renquist? 
CUT TO: 
57   INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY 
Harry, Gib and Fast Faisil are in a luxury suite at the MARQUIS HOTEL.  It is a corner suite, with a spectacular view of the city.  Faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an electronic DETECTOR. 
HARRY She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east. 
GIB She could be moving money, guns. Anything. 
FAISIL And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the                           * ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front. 
HARRY Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys. 
58   INT. JUNO'S WAREHOUSE - DAY 
WE FOLLOW the WORKMAN we saw watching Harry earlier.  He catches up with Juno, who is going through the doors to the office area.  His name is MALIK. 
MALIK Ms. Skinner?  Can I speak to you for a moment please, in your office? 
His manner is self-effacing.  Humble.  He doesn't meet her gaze.  She nods and they go into the private office. 
59   INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY 
MALIK comes in behind her and closes the door.  The moment they are away from public observation, his manner changes.  His humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he approaches her.  Without warning he SLAPS HER HARD ACROSS THE FACE. 
MALIK You stupid undisciplined bitch! 
Her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive. 
JUNO It's a good thing you pay me well. 
MALIK Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a-- 
JUNO No.  He checked out okay-- 
Malik slaps her again. 
MALIK That is for interrupting. (He backhands her) And that is for being wrong.  We do not tolerate mistakes. 
Juno bites her lip. 
JUNO What do you want me to do? 
MALIK Find out who this Renquist it. 
JUNO How? 
MALIK Use the gifts that Allah has given you. 
60   INT. TEKTEL SYSTEMS OFFICES - DUSK                               * 
The phone rings on the desk of CHARLENE, Harry's secretary at    * Tektel Systems, the permanent front-company for Omega Sector.    * 
SECRETARY Hello, Tektel Systems.  Mr.                            * Tasker's office. 
61   INT. TASKER HOUSE - DUSK 
Helen is in the kitchen, showing Dana how to put icing on a large birthday cake. 
HELEN Hi, Charlene?  It's Helen.  Is he there? 
62   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DUSK 
Charlene doesn't hesitate a microsecond. 
CHARLENE Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs. Tasker.  Let me try him in there. Hold please. 
She punches a key, engaging a digital scrambler and connecting to-- 
86   EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Malik sprints straight into traffic.  A car screeches, not stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood.  Harry leaps over the hoods of cars after him.  Malik sees Harry coming after him like a juggernaut. 
He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street, accelerating from a right-turn.  Malik runs at him, clothes- lining him right off the bike.  The terrorist picks up the nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps on.  He pops the clutch and takes off.  Harry pounds after him like a locomotive.  He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path into a large PARK.  Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal. 
87   EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
ON HARRY, running.  Ahead is a MOUNTED COP.  Harry doesn't break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse.  The cop turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet). 
HARRY Federal Officer in pursuit of suspect!  Sorry. 
Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop can get his gut out of the holster to stop him. 
MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki.  He looks back, amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse.  They scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs. 
TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park.  Malik leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees. Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling. Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it. He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the last bit of throttle out of it.  They are going flat out, through the trees, in a kinetic blur. 
88   EXT. STREET - NEAR MALL - NIGHT 
Gib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic.  The Unit Seven car pulls out as well, up the block. 
GIB Harry, what's your twenty? 
89   EXT. PARK/ STREETS - NIGHT 
Harry is legging the police horse hard.  He has his reigns in one hand, his Glock in the other.  It's the wild west. 
HARRY Westbound in the park... suspect is on a motorcycle... he's going to  come out on Franklin.  Hang on-- 
Harry leaps a park bench like he's in a steeple chase. 
HARRY (CONT'D) I want you on 14th in case he turns south.  And I need Seven on the north side to box him in. 
90   INT. /EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT 
Gib is weaving furiously through traffic.  He slides into a turn. 
GIB Copy that. 
HARRY And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired. 
ON GIB, mouthing "Your horse?" 
91   EXT. STREET - NEXT TO PARK - NIGHT 
Malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street. Cars skid around him, out of control.  He turns south.  Weaving through traffic.  Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and gallops among the spun-out cars.  He goes right over the hood on one which is blocking his path.  The driver ducks as the horse's hoof cracks the windshield. 
92   EXT. STREET/ HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT 
Up ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light.  Malik goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty.  Gib's car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes barrelling down the street toward him.  Gib cranks the wheel the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes.  Malik locks up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop.  Then the terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT REGENCY HOTEL. 
Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them. The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby. 
HARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him. 
93   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Acres of marble and red carpet.  Liveries porters.  Guests dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women. And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with Harry charging along behind him.  Malik guns it across the lounge, knocking over tables.  He gets air at the top of  the steps going up to the RESTAURANT. 
Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop.  He gathers the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the bassist, who is diving for the carpet.  Harry and horse land deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after Malik. 
94   INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Malik roars between the tables, looking around wildly for a way out.  Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier. Waiters, trays, dinners, tables... everything seems to be flying at once as people dive out of the way. 
95   INT. HOTEL - MAIN HALL - NIGHT 
MALIK skids out into the main hall by another door, and sees-- the ELEVATORS.  The door is just closing on one of them.  He guns it and slides through the doors. 
HARRY RIDES out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of Malik as the doors close. 
96   INT. SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just been boarded by an older couple.  He has to practically lie down on the horse to fit through the door.  The animal barely fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be-- 
A GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel as it rises, right to the top of the building.  Harry looks through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet away.  Malik is inside, punching a button.  He glances up and sees Harry.  There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's car ascends rapidly.  Malik's malevolent glare is etched on Harry's retinas. 
The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's panting, snorting horse.  It clomps around the tight elevator. The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall. 
HARRY Can you just press the top floor, please. 
The man nods mutely and complies.  Their elevator takes off, rising after Malik's. 
97   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 
Gib runs in with Faisil and Keough.  They follow the path of destruction, growing more and more amazed.  Gib yells to one of the porters. 
GIB The guy on the horse?! 
The porter points at the elevators. 
98   INT. / EXT. SCENIC ELEVATORS - NIGHT 
CUT TO: 
102   EXT. STREET/ NEAR HIGH-SCHOOL - DAY 
It is the following morning.  Harry and Gib are staked out watching the front of Dana's school.  Actually, Harry is staked out, scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars. 
Gib just keeps looking at his watch.  He picks up a cellular phone and pretends to call the office. 
GIB Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch -- 
HARRY (not listening) Okay.  Here she comes. 
103   EXT. STREET - DAY 
HARRY'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - We see Dana come out to the curb and meet Trent, who pulls up on his bike.  She gets on behind him, adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he launches out into traffic. 
104   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY 
Harry, who is behind the wheel, pulls out after her.  Trent weaves radically through the light traffic, going in between the cars. 
HARRY Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once. 
GIB Goddammit!  That's outrageous. 
Harry speeds up.  Somebody honks as he cuts them off to stay with Trent. 
105   EXT. MOTORCYCLE - DAY 
ON DANA AND TRENT as she looks back and sees Harry following her.  She is mortified that her father is actually tailing her 
DANA Oh my God!  I think that's my dad! 
TRENT Hang on! 
Trent downshifts and punches it.  The nimble little bike screams as it zips between cars. 
106   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY 
HARRY (clenching his jaw) So, you wanna play huh?  You little-- 
GIB (rolling his eyes) That's it.  Get 'im Harry (he draws a pistol) We'll teach that little puke not to signal. 
107   EXT. MOTORCYCLE 
BACK ON TRENT, who's actually a really good rider.  He zig-zags through the cars, cutting between them at the next light where Gib and Harry get blocked.  He cuts a sharp right turn and disappears. 
108   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY 
Harry is stuck in stopped traffic.  He pounds the wheel in frustration. 
GIB (exploding with laughter) Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny. 
HARRY Son of a bitch! 
GIB Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy? 
CUT TO: 
109   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / I.D. ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY 
Harry is sitting at a computer workstation, lit by the monitor screen.  Gib and Faisil look on as he clicks through HEADSHOTS of known terrorists.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  Harry is very focussed.  He stops.  He goes back one.  Studies the face. 
110   INT. ANALYSIS ROOM - TIGHT ON THE SCREEN - DAY 
A defiant looking Syrian with a full beard. 
HARRY holds up his hand, blocking out the beard, concentrating on the eyes. 
HARRY That's him. 
111   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Harry slaps photos down in front of Trilby. 
HARRY Abu Kaleem Malik. 
GIB (reading from a file) Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-                     * fundamentalist.  Linked to                             * numerous car-bombings, that cafe                       * bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.                       * 
FAISIL                                       * Now he's formed his own splinter faction called CRIMSON JIHAD. 
GIB                                          * Guess he thought the other terrorist groups were too warm and fuzzy for his taste. 
FAISIL They call him "The Sand Spider".                       * 
TRILBY Why? 
FAISIL (he shrugs) Probably because it sounds scary.                      * 
TRILBY This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was. 
HARRY We'll get him. 
TRILBY Yes.  You will. (meaning-- you damn well better) Harry, I still want you in charge, even though your cover is blown.  Just keep a low profile. (he slaps a newspaper on the table) I generally prefer it when my covert operations don't make the front page. 
GIB What'dya expect Harry?  She's a flesh and blood woman.  And you're never there.  It was only a matter of time. 
Harry sags.  His friend is right.  Gib opens the car door and helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time-- 
GIB I say we concentrate on work. That's how I always got through it whenever my life turned to dogshit.  Let's catch some terrorists and then you can beat the crap out of them.  You'll feel better. 
Gib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry. 
GIB Women.  Can't live with 'em. Can't kill 'em. 
118   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / LISTENING ROOM - DAY 
Harry and Gib are in the LISTENING ROOM.  Banks of tape-decks recording calls, rows of technicians in cubicles processing and collating transcripts. 
GIB He's giving us a blank check on                        * wiretaps.  So I've set 'em up on all of Juno's shipping agents, her clients, and Faisil made up                        * a list of possible contacts that Crimson Jihad might have in this country.  Now all we can do is                         * wait --                                                * 
He notices Harry is not listening. 
GIB Is this national security stuff boring you? 
HARRY Put a tap on her phone. 
GIB What're you talking about?  We have that. 
HARRY Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house. 
Gib gives Harry a stricken look, and glances around nervously. He pulls him into an empty office. 
GIB                                          * (a whispered hiss)                                * Okay .  .  .I have two words to                        * describe that idea.  In.  Sane. Unauthorized wiretap is a felony, pard. 
Harry grabs him and rams him up against the wall, his teeth clenched. 
HARRY Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now. 
GIB Sure, Harry.  I'm on it. 
Harry releases him and turns away.  Gib straightens his jacket, looking at his friend like he's completely losing it. 
119   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT 
That night Harry is actually there on time for dinner.  He glances at Dana, who has been eyeing him warily.  She looks at her peas. 
HARRY How was school today? 
DANA Fine. 
Harry takes a bite of his food, watching her.  Silence.  Helen glances at him. 
HELEN So.  You came by to see me today? 
She is a too casual, masking her nervousness. 
HARRY I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch. 
HELEN They must've just missed me. 
HARRY They said you had to run out. 
HELEN Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it. 
Harry watches her lying to him with some amazement.  You can see the jaw muscles clenching. 
HARRY So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay? 
HELEN Oh, sure.  Fine. (she gets up suddenly) I'll get some more gravy. 
DANA I'm done. 
Dana bolts.  She has eaten about four bites.  Harry sits at the table, alone.  He feels isolated, knowing that everybody is lying to everybody else.  He is a man without a center, lost. 
CUT TO: 
120   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ LISTENING ROOM - DAY 
TRACKING ALONG THE BANK OF RECORDERS.  Harry comes to a particular set of machines.  He reaches past the technician and picks up the hard-copy of the transcripts. 
ON HARRY walking and leafing through the phone transcripts. Gib watches him through a glass partition, shaking his head slowly.  Harry freezes, staring at the page and WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CONVERSATION OVERLAID: 
HELEN Hello? 
SIMON Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk? 
HELEN Yes.  Go ahead. 
121   INT. CAR - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - DAY 
A man in his mid-thirties, sitting in a car SOMEPLACE (DAY), speaks into a cellular phone.  This is SIMON.  He is dark haired, and fairly good-looking in an off-beat way.  He is unshaven and his clothes look slept in.  He glances around in a furtive manner. 
SIMON I can't talk long.  Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow?  I must see you. 
122   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
NOW WE SEE HELEN, at her office. 
HARRY (grinning) Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me. 
Simon leans forward, conspiratorially. 
SIMON Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them. 
HARRY So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it. 
SIMON Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours. 
HARRY Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run? 
SIMON Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios. 
HARRY Use 'em and lose 'em. 
SIMON Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower. 
HARRY What about the husbands? 
SIMON Dickless.  If they took care of                        * business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean? 
HARRY Those idiots. 
163   EXT. STREET/ VETTE - DAY 
They are cruising along, with Harry driving this time. 
HARRY You working on someone right now? 
SIMON I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great. 
Unconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter. 
HARRY What does she do? 
SIMON Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk. 
Harry takes a corner too fast.  The tires squealing. 
SIMON And she could be so hot, if she wanted to be.  She's like a dying plant that just needs a little water. 
When Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging...  they laugh together... then when he looks away Harry goes snake- eyed.  He could kill Simon with one punch.  He's visualizing his wife getting porked by this guy. 
HARRY But with you, she gets to be hot, right? 
SIMON Red hot.  Her thighs steam. 
They laugh together.  Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle. He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel.  Now for the big question: HAVE THEY OR HAVEN'T THEY? 
HARRY Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then? 
SIMON (yelling suddenly) Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn! 
164   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY 
Harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty.  He cranks the wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a smoking bootlegger-180.  It screeches backward, sliding right into its parking space perfectly. 
Simon is bugeyed.  But he is non-plussed for only about two seconds.  Then he's back to selling.  He scrambles out and goes around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke. 
SIMON See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork? 
HARRY Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me? 
Simon grins and winks. 
SIMON Because it's you. 
165   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT 
Dana is in the living room, watching TV when she sees her mother cross through, dressed to go out. 
HELEN Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late. 
DANA Where are you going? 
HELEN Out. 
Dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles. 
166   INT. ENTRY WAY - NIGHT 
ON HELEN, checking herself in the hall mirror.  She looks at her big dowdy purse.  Hating it suddenly.  She pulls her pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet for a small handbag, then charges out. 
167   OMITTED 
168   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - NIGHT 
Harry is driving.  Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his briefcase and hands them to him. 
GIB Here's today's transcripts. There's nothing interesting. 
SIMON Nothing from Simon? 
173   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
Helen pulls  her car under the bridge.  She checks her watch. Helen notices that her hand is shaking.  She looks around and    * the place seems deserted.  She is about to leave when she sees headlights flash briefly in the shadows. 
A red-and-white Vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up next to her.  Simon motions for her to get in quickly. 
174   EXT. PARKING LOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS - NIGHT 
LONGSHOT  on Simon and Helen in the Vette, coming out of the parking low under the bridge.  We are watching them through a sophisticated telephoto night-vision device. 
175   INT. UNIT TWO SEDAN - NIGHT 
Agent MORTON lowers the SCOPE and picks up his rover.  He puts   * the car in gear to follow. 
MORTON Two here.  Subject is southbound on Key Bridge.  A man and a woman                      * in the vehicle. 
HARRY (RADIO) Roger's two. 
175A   INT./EXT. SIMON'S CAR 
Simon makes a show of checking the mirrors. 
SIMON Now don't be alarmed... but if I'm spotter, it would be best if they don't see you.  You should keep your head down until we're out of the city. 
He pushes her head down onto his lap.  She crouches there, with her cheek against his thigh.  He's cruising along, loving it. 
176   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Gib is trying to watch the computerized city map on the screen, but Harry keeps cornering so fast he loses his place. 
MORTON (RADIO) The woman has her head in the guy's lap. 
Harry is doing a jaw-clenched slow burn. 
HARRY Roger, two.  One to Condor, do you have visual? 
thru   OMITTED 
184   EXT. HIGHWAY LEAVING CITY - NIGHT 
It is a highway heading away from the city.  IN A LONG LENS SHOT, the Vette appears over the brow of a hill.  A moment later A HELICOPTER rises up behind them, A DRAMATIC REVEAL.  It follows the Vette. 
CONDOR (VOICE OVER/RADIO) This is Condor.  We have the ball, repeat... we have a good lock-up on I.R. 
CUT TO: INFRARED VIEW of the Vette, from the helicopter's FLIR system.  The greenish, image-intensified view of the car is like daylight.

The headlights of the Vette light up a ratty single-wide mobile home, on the outskirts of a TRAILER PARK off the highway.  Simon and Helen get out of the car. 
SIMON My place in the city is too hot right now.  So is the penthouse in New York.  But this place is secure. 
He takes her inside.

INT. SIMON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                   190 
Helen feels awkward in the small, junky space.  A tape deck is playing cool jazz.  Simon hands her a glass of cheap wine. He clinks her glass with his. 
SIMON To our assignment. 
HELEN What is it you need me to do? 
SIMON Helen, I want you to be my wife. 
HELEN I'm married! 
SIMON (quickly) Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone. 
HELEN We're going to Paris? 
SIMON Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days. 
HELEN I don't know.  I have to think... 
SIMON Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable. 
He clears a place for her on the bed, shoving clothes and magazines out of the way.  She sits down and he tops off her glass from the wine bottle. 
191   EXT. BILLBOARD AND TRAILER PARK - NIGHT 
The agents have gathered behind a billboard.  Harry, Gib and     * the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits.  They finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski-       * masks.  They don them in perfect unison.  Commando precision. Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard, closing in on Simon's trailer. 
GIB That's not what it looked like when we found you. 
Harry scowls at Gib in the dark.  Helen flushes, remembering. 
HARRY How did you meet him? 
FLASHBACK SEQUENCE: 
202   INT. MALL - DAY/FLASHBACK 
We see Helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works, having a cappucino and a croissant. 
HELEN (V.O.) About two weeks ago I was at the mall, having coffee... 
Simon appears behind her, sort of stalking up to her.  He approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat next to her.  His manner is furtive.  He keeps looking around, as if for hidden assasins.  He hands her a briefcase. 
SIMON (speaking very low) Keep this for me.  I can't afford to be taken with it.  National security is at stake.  I'll contact you if a can.  Okay?  Oh-- 
He seems to suddenly spot something OFF CAMERA and dashes off the other way. 
203   EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY/FLASHBACK 
Helen walks back to her office building, carrying the briefcase.  She keeps looking over her shoulder. 
204   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK 
She has the briefcase on her desk while she works.  She keeps glancing at it as she types.  Finally she hunches over it and starts picking the locks with a paper clip. 
TIGHT ON SECOND LOCK, popping open. 
ON HELEN as she opens the case.  She gasps. 
INSIDE THE CASE are the following items:  A tiny camera, some loose tapes, some circuit diagrams, some transcripts that look like gibberish which must be ENCRYPTED, some street maps of Beirut, Rome and Berlin, and a Walther P.P.K.  PISTOL.  Helen, eyes wide, closes the case. 
205   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT 
Helen shrugs, finishing up her story. 
HELEN I should have gone to the police, I suppose. 
GIB But you didn't.  Why not? 
HELEN I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen. 
HARRY What did happen? 
HELEN Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park. 
206   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - SUNSET/FLASHBACK 
Through the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to Georgetown and Embassy Row.  Helen is sitting on a park bench when Simon shows up, sitting beside her.  She hands him the briefcase. 
SIMON Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name? 
HELEN Helen. 
SIMON You can call me Simon. (he touches her hand) You're very brave to do this... (then notices the locks have been opened) You opened it. 
HELEN I just glances inside. 
207   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - CLOSE UP ON SIMON 
CLOSE ON SIMON, looking right into her eyes. 
SIMON (solemn) Then you know. 
208   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT 
Harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes, picturing the whole thing. 
HARRY Why did you continue to see him? 
HELEN He needed my help. 
HARRY Not because you were attracted to him? 
HELEN No. 
HARRY You weren't attracted to him at all? 
HELEN Well, maybe a little. 
GIB Is this a common thing for you? Cheating? 
HELEN No!  Never! 
GIB So, it was your first time. 
HELEN I wasn't cheating! 
HARRY Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker. 
HELEN Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company. 
GIB Now what? 
HARRY (leaning forward to the mike) There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us. 
GIB (whispering to Harry) Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing? 
HARRY (like: isn't it obvious?) I'm giving her an assignment. (to Helen) I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed. 
HELEN Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see-- 
HARRY Yes or no. 
HELEN What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved? 
HARRY You will be contacted with the assignment. 
HELEN My husband can't know about this. 
HARRY No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that? 
HELEN I think so. 
HARRY Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most. 
HELEN (fearless) I can do it! 
HARRY The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be-- 
HELEN (excited) Natasha? 
HARRY No.  Doris. 
211   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
ON HELEN, not liking her wimpy code-name. 
212   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord.  The door slides open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands.  She is wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands. She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed off.  She watches it drive off into the night. 
213   EXT. ROCK QUARRY - NIGHT 
The van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry.  The door opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask.  Gib follows as Harry guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop.  Harry whips off the hood and Simon takes in his surroundings. 
SIMON Yeeaoowww!! 
HARRY You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos? 
SIMON Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your-- 
Harry whips off his ski-mask. 
SIMON -- face.  Shit!  Shit!! 
Simon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry.  Then it dawns...  He looks up, brightening hopefully. 
SIMON It's you!  Hey, you still interested in that Vette at all? 
GIB You can drop it now, Carlos.  The game is over.  Your career as an inter-national terrorist is too well documented. 
SIMON No... I sell cars.  That's all! Not even foreign cars.  Nothing international, I swear.  I'm no terrorist.  Everything I said was a lie... you have to believe me. I'm actually a complete coward. If I ever even saw a gun I'd-- 
Harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes. 
SIMON -- faint.  Aahhh!  Don't kill me. I'm not a spy.  I'm nothing.  I'm navel lint.  I have to lie to women to get laid.  And I don't score much.  It's pathetic. (he looks down) See, look... would a spy pee himself? 
Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling.  He pulls Simon away from the edge, then gestures with his gun. 
HARRY Beat it. 
SIMON No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me. 
Harry starts back to the truck.  Simon stays right with him, facing him, terrified to turn away.  Like a dog following him. 
SIMON Please don't.  You can have the car for free-- 
GIB Take off, dipshit! 
Gib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks THREE ROUNDS into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance backward.  The two agents get into the van and tear off in a cloud of dust.  Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles from nowhere. 
CUT TO: 
214   INT./ EXT. SEDAN - DAY 
TIGHT ON LOCATOR SCREEN as a blip moves across the grid of city streets.  Gib drives while Harry watches the screen. 
HARRY We should pick up visual at the next light. 
The scrambler phone in Harry's briefcase rings.  He picks it up. 
HARRY Morning, boss.

DANA Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history. 
223   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT 
The image of a family dinner.  Helen is avoiding Harry's eyes. Harry looks over at Dana and she gives him a tiny smile.  Then she rises from her half-finished dinner and heads out of the kitchen. 
DANA I'm done. 
HELEN Where are you off to young lady? 
DANA (pointing toward her room) I have a book report. 
Helen watches her go.  That's strange. 
HARRY So last night was pretty exciting, huh? 
HELEN (alarmed) What? (then smoothly--) Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there. 
Harry smiles, reaching for more chicken.  The phone RINGS. Helen controls the urge to run to it. 
HELEN Hello? 
METALLIC VOICE Doris? 
HELEN Oh.  Yes? 
224   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - NIGHT 
GIB, AT OMEGA SECTOR, uses the SPEECH SYNTHESIZER to disguise his voice. 
GIB Listen carefully.  Go to the Hotel Marquis in one hour.  Pick up an envelope marked Doris at the front desk.  And dress sexy. 
225   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT 
BACK ON HELEN as she reacts to that. 
HELEN What? 
VOICE Get going! (CLICK) 
HELEN (thinking for a second, then--) Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye. 
Harry smirks, listening to her lie.  She's good.  The smirk drops as she turns. 
HELEN Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey. 
HARRY Sure, hon. 
She walks unhurriedly out of the room.  Behind her back, Harry is grinning.  The second Helen is out of his sight line, she runs up the stairs.  Harry waits a moment then picks up the phone. 
226   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ ELECTRONIC LAB -- NIGHT 
Gib is in a corner of the electronics lab, in an area dedicated to DIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING.  The phone in his briefcase rings. Gib answers. 
GIB You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis. 
HARRY Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?                               * 
Gib looks over at a SOUND RECORDING BOOTH nearby.  In it a FAT   * FRENCH AGENT, JEAN-CLAUDE is doing voice recording from a hand-  * written page. 
GIB Not quite. 
227   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - INSIDE THE BOOTH - NIGHT 
We hear Jean-Claude record a line on a tiny DAT tape recorder.   * He speaks with a cosmopolitan French accent.  Close your eyes    * and he's Charles Boyer. 
JEAN-CLAUDE                                  * No no.  Do it slowly.  Very slowly. 
228   OMITTED                                                          * 
229   INT. HOTEL MARQUIS - NIGHT 
A big luxury hotel downtown, with an opulent lobby.  Helen enters, looking different than we have ever seen her.  She has been commanded to be sexy, and she is.  Her black slinky dress is cut at mid-thigh, showing some good legs we haven't been aware of.  She's pulled her hair back and added pearls.  Now she looks elegant and hot.  Playing the role. 
230   INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT 
She goes to the front desk and signals the ASSISTANT MANAGER with her eyes.  He comes over to her. 
HELEN Do you have an envelope for Doris? 
The man nods.  Saying nothing, he reaches under the counter and hands her the envelope.  She opens it as she walks across the lobby.  In contains a room key, a small bugging device, and a phone number. 
231   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON A PAY PHONE as Helen finishes dialing the number.  She scans the lobby as the phone rings-- 
METALLIC VOICE Listen.  You are a prostitute named Michelle.  Go to the room. A man will be there.  He is a suspected arms dealer. 
HELEN Do I have to... you know-- ? 
VOICE No.  He has particular tastes. He likes to watch.  You will say his regular girl, Carla, is sick. If he likes you, he will tell you what to do.  You must plant the bug near the telephone, by the bed, before you leave.  If you do not accomplish your mission, the deal is off. 
232   INT. HOTEL/ TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT 
The door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs. 
HELEN Listen, you don't need him, he's nothing.  He's a sales rep for a computer company, really-- 
The thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up. 
HELEN That was unnecessary. 
236   INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT                                      * 
A stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen   * through the basement labyrinth.                                  * 
HELEN What were you doing there? 
HARRY You wouldn't believe me. 
A pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helen's ear. 
TERRORIST LEADER Talk again, I kill you. 
They are hustled across a loading dock to a RENTAL VAN waiting   * with the door open.  A fourth terrorist slides the van door      * shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel.  The van    * takes off. 
CUT TO:              * 
237   OMITTED                                                          * 
238   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT 
The rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a private hanger.  The van doors open and the hostages are brought out.  Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind the van.  The driver, an enormous man names AKBAR, hurries to open the passenger door.  A slender pair of ankles emerge, followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly beautiful but now quite sinister. 
To Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed to kill, approaching them. 
JUNO (with a wry smile) Hello, Harry. 
HARRY Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again. 
HELEN You know her? 
Juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the prisoners toward the plane. 
JUNO Who's your little friend? 
HELEN I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are? 
JUNO (to Harry) So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist? 
239   INT. G-3 JET - NIGHT 
They enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane.  Helen has never seen anything like this. 
HELEN Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep. 
JUNO No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night. 
HELEN No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years-- 
HARRY Look, Juno, this is just some whacko hooker I met in the bar. 
AKBAR and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats and strap them in. 
HELEN Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter-- 
HARRY (looking at Helen contemptuously) I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business. 
HELEN Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this? 
Helen grabs the locket, dangling on a chain around her neck, and opens it to show Juno. 
THE PICTURE IN THE LOCKET -- Harry and Helen together, smiling. 
Harry roles his eyes.  Great, Helen.  A FLIGHT HOSTESS walks up carrying a tray.  Juno smiles graciously at Helen. 
JUNO Something before take-off? 
The hostess whips a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR off the tray and zaps Helen in the shoulder. 
HELEN Oooowww!!  That hurt.  You biii-- 
She slumps.  Juno looks at Harry. 
JUNO She was telling the truth, wasn't she Harry?  She really doesn't know.  Interesting. 
Juno nods and the hostess zaps Harry.  He slides into unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to SCREAM. 
240   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT 
The G-3 lifts into the night sky, turning south. 
241   EXT. PIER - NIGHT 
A small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier.  Next to the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building, two stories high.  There are floodlights on the dock but beyond is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms. It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island in the Caribbean. 
There is a lot of activity.  Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles.  About thirty men, clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various activities.  Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles. 
PILOT Miami TCA, we are on final. 
GIB Call our DEA contact, tell him I want those choppers flight-ready the second we land. 
244   INT. WAREHOUSE - NO NAME KEY - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON BLACK AND WHITE VIEWFINDER IMAGE of the terrorists' handycam.  Harry is speaking directly into the camera, finishing up his message. 
HARRY ...and I can verify that they have the arming box and all                            * equipment necessary to detonate the four warheads.  This is absolutely the real thing, gentlemen. 
The camera swings off Harry to Malik, standing before the rest of the Jihad warriors, who are assembled behind the four bombs. 
MALIK You have killed our women and                          * children, bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and dare to call us terrorists-- 
Over the image of Malik, a LOW-BATTERY warning begins to flash. 
CUT TO SCENE, as Malik speaks into the camera, which is head by one of his men.  The CAMERAMAN is sweating, wondering if he should interrupt.  He gulps nervously as Malik drones on. 
MALIK -- But now the Oppressed have                          * been given a mighty sword, to                          * strike back at their enemies.                          * Unless the US pulls all military forces out of the Persian Gulf area, immediately and forever, Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major US city each week until these demands are met... 
BACK TO VIEWFINDER IMAGE.  BATTERY warning flashing faster. 
MALIK ... First one weapon will be detonated on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of Crimson Jihad's power and our willingness to be humanitarian. However, if there demands are not-- 
In a burst of static the image GOES BLACK. 
The cameraman nervously lowers the camera, ashen faced. Malik's eyes are black with murder. 
CAMERAMAN Battery, Abu. 
MALIK Get another one, you moron! 
245   INT. BUILDING - NIGHT 
A filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse). A few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no glass in the windows.  Harry and Helen are brought in by two TERRORIST GUARDS.  Juno follows then into the bleak room. Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs. 
A MAN enters the room carrying a small suitcase.  He has skull- like features.  He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view of the contents:  medical instruments, needle-probes, drills, Dremel tools with saw blades. 
JUNO This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty. 
HARRY Oral hygiene? 
JUNO Not exactly. 
HELEN (scared) What's going on, Harry? 
JUNO Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist. 
SAMIR (holding up a syringe) This will help. 
Samir injects Harry in the arm with the syringe. 
HARRY You know, you should swab that with alcohol.  I might get an infection. 
SAMIR                                        * I'll return when this has taken                        * effect.  Then we'll talk.                              * 
HARRY                                        * I'm looking forward to it.                             * 
Samir exits.                                                     * 
HARRY                                        * Why are you helping these raving psychotics. 
JUNO Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics, and I'm getting a lot of money. 
She kneels down in front of Harry, stroking his leg. 
JUNO You think I care about their                           * cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.                         * See, America is on top now .  .                        * .  but so was Rome, once.  All                         * civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living                          * well takes money.                                      * 
HARRY You're damaged goods, lady. 
Harry's words are beginning to be slightly slurred.  The drugs are taking effect. 
JUNO (indicating Helen) Did you tell her about us, Harry? 
HARRY There is no us, you psychotic bitch. 
JUNO Sure.  Say that now. 
Juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately.  She breaks, looking at Helen to savor the effect.  Helen is trembling with rage. 
JUNO Thanks for everything, Harry.  It was good while it lasted. 
Juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his belt.  Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees. She pushes Helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the grenade then pulls the pin. 
JUNO Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine. 
HELEN Something you obviously have a hard time doing! 
JUNO Hold that thought. 
Juno leaves.  Harry looks dopily at Helen. 
HARRY There was nothing.  I swear. 
HELEN As much as you used to? 
HARRY No. (she deflates) Much more. 
She looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth. 
HELEN                                        * (grinning)                                        * It wore off. 
At that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block building. 
HARRY They found the bodies.  Come on-- 
249   EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT 
Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of the mangrove swamp.  A LIGHT HITS THEM.  TWO TERRORISTS, running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees.  The trunks explode     * with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.               * 
As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from  * the shadows and grabs one from behind.  He wrests his rifle      * away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down.  The      * first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner. Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two- hand neck-breaker-- SNAP. 
Two more run around the corner of a building.  Harry stomps his  * foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log.  It    * flips into the air and he catches it in firing position .  .     * .  and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts.  Helen comes   * out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement.  His shirt is ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle   * expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.             * 
HELEN I married Rambo.                                       * 
He grabs her and kisses her passionately. 
HARRY Let's go. thru   OMITTED                                                          * 
254   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
LOOKING DOWN FROM A CATWALK on the activity below the four horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the floorspace.  A rental truck is being loaded with conventional weapons, including machine guns and several HAND-LAUNCHED STINGER MISSILES.  One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit cut in the concrete floor.  Malik and most of the terrorists are gathered around it. 
A GUARD, F.G.  on the catwalk, watches intently from the railing.  So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on him.  SNAP.  Harry catches the guard's MAC-10 machine pistol before it can hit the floor.  He and Helen crouch behind a steel pillar, watching the proceedings below.  Helen keeps glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment before by her husband.  It is all surreal. 
BELOW, MALIK is shouting in his native language.  He pulls a chain from around his neck and holds up a METAL ARMING KEY. Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's arming computer.  Harry is listening intently, translating for Helen. 
HARRY In ninety minutes a pillar of                          * holy fire will rise at this place                      * as a sign to out enemies.                              * (Malik theatrically turns the arming key) It is done... 
Malik jumps out of the pit.  He signals and terrorists pour concrete into the pit, covering the bomb.  He begins ranting again. 
HARRY Now no man can stop us.  We are set on our course.  No force can stop us... (as libbing) ... we're cool, we're badass, blah blah. 
255   INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWN BELOW - NIGHT 
Malik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans. The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns in the air.  Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all over the inside of the metal building. 
Malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work at double time.  They are loading warheads Two and Three onto trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside. 
256   INT. WAREHOUSE - ON CATWALK - NIGHT 
HELEN If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? 
HARRY We must be in the Florida Keys .                       * .  .  the Overseas Highway                             * connects the islands to the mainland. 
HELEN                                        * So there's no border, no customs.                      * They can just drive anywhere they                      * want .  .  .  there's nothing to                       * stop them .  .  . 
HARRY Just us. 
HELEN What are you going to do? 
HARRY (shrugs, like: what do you think?) Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. 
He hands her the MAC-10.  She holds it clumsily. 
HELEN Oh shit. 
HARRY Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay? 
She nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the floor below. 
257   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT 
ON HARRY, reaching the floor.  He slips behind some packing crates.  Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard as he can, down to the other end of the building.  KABOOM!!  He uses the distraction to move forward.  But it goes wrong almost right away...  A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him, shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him, with guns raised. 
HARRY (to Helen) SHOOT!! 
258   INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT 
HELEN fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one! But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the gun 
FLIES OUT OF HER HANDS. It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off.  B-B-BLAM! The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10 cartwheels and hits further down.  ANOTHER BURST.  Another terrorist is splattered. 
It spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST MIRACULOUSLY KILLS THE LAST TWO TERRORISTS!! 
She has inadvertently saved her husband.  Harry looks up from behind cover-- to see all seven dead.  Now it's his turn to be amazed.  He signals to her to run... get off the exposed catwalk.  She makes it through the door to the outside stairs as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her. 
259   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT 
A TERRORIST with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry.  Harry snatches up a jack-hammer and BRAT-TAT-TAT-- Drives it into the guy's chest.  Then he-- Grabs an AK from one of the fallen terrorists and opens fire.  Malik shouts to the drivers of the trucks to get going.  The other terrorists return fire at Harry-- Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door-- 
260   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
--landing outside.  He takes cover behind an aircraft REFUELING TRUCK.  Not a good place.  He is pinned down by automatic weapons fire.  He looks around for Helen, who is--

275   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY 
HARRY AND GIB are both talking a mile a minute, coordinating the evacuation of the highway and the surrounding area. 
GIB ... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah-- 
HARRY Here they come. 
Gib looks out the window in time to see-- 
THREE hunch-winged P.S.T.O.L.  HARRIER jets pass them at 600 knots. 
HARRY (to the pilots) Roger, Mike Three Five, you are cleared to engage.  Be advised, your targets have Stingers and light machine guns. 
276   INT. COCKPIT OF LEAD HARRIER - DAY 
The pilot, like all jet pilots, seems icy calm. 
PILOT Copy that, Bright Boy command. (to his wingman) Tally ho. 
277   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY 
The terrorists see the Harriers approaching on a low attack run, and scramble to get out their Stingers. 
The Harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the trucks below.  The 20mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of the causeway into plumes of spray. 
278   EXT. HIGHWAY - ON TRUCK - DAY 
One of the Bomb trucks is hit.  It explodes and flies off the    * bridge into the water.  The terrorists on one of the other trucks fire a Stinger missile. 
279   EXT. ABOVE HIGHWAY - ON HARRIER - DAY 
It arrows up, blowing one wing off the lead Harrier.  The pilot ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes. 
280   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY 
Harry sees the battle far ahead... the exploding jet. 
HARRY (to the pilots) Recommend you use your Mavericks                       * to take out the bridge.                                * 
PILOT (OVER) They won't set off those nukes will they? 
HARRY Negative, Mike Three Five. That's a negative. (low, to Gib) Probably not. 
281   EXT. HIGHWAY/ OCEAN - DAY 
The two remaining Harriers make an attack run, launching four    * Maverick missiles at the bridge.                                 * 
282   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
The missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and    * .  .  .  K-BOOOOM!!  A whole section of the concrete span        * collapses into the water. 
283   EXT. HIGHWAY - TRUCKS - DAY 
The first truck is consumed in the blast.  The last truck        * slides to the edge of the gap and stops.                         * 
284   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY 
Juno is trying to see what's going on ahead.  All they can see is smoke and explosions.  Akbar is speaking heatedly (in Arabic) into a walky talky and getting no answer. 
Helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward, grabbing the gun.  Juno fires wildly as they struggle for control of the weapon.  The sound is deafening in the tiny space.  The second shot catches Akbar behind the ear, and he slumps forward.  His foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal and the car surges faster. 
285   EXT. HIGHWAY/ BATTLE SITE - DAY 
The third Harrier fires its 2.75 Rockets and blows the           * remaining truck into tinfoil.  Battle over.  Two bombs down. 
286   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY 
The columns of smoke from the battle are still a couple miles ahead of the copter. 
HARRY Good shooting, Mike Three Five. I need you to stay on station. (to the copter pilot)                             * Okay.  You see that limo? 
287   INT./ EXT. LIMO - HIGHWAY - DAY                                  * 
THE LIMO tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one guardrail to the other, throwing sheets of sparks where it hits.  In is funneling along the causeway, unslowed, like an out- of-control-train. 
288   INT. LIMO - DAY 
INSIDE, Helen knocks Juno's hands against the edge of the open sunroof and the pistol goes flying out. 
HELEN You... bitch!! 
Helen is raging, grabbing Juno's head and pounding it against anything hard she can find inside the car.  Suddenly she stops, looking out the front window.  Juno turns too, off her look, to see-- ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  The causeway is blown away about a quarter mile ahead. 
JUNO Shit! 
Juno climbs through the window into the front seat, tugging on the dead driver.  The heavyset Akbar is like a bag of cement. Helen look up through the sunroof and sees-- 
289   EXT. ABOVE LIMO - DAY 
THE BELL 206 COPTER, descending rapidly.  Harry is climbing out onto the skids.  He hooks on arm and leg over the skid and hangs down as low as he can.  HELEN stands up in the opening and waves her arms. 
290   INT. / EXT. BELL COPTER/ LIMO - DAY 
Harry doesn't have a G-suit or a helmet of anything.  He just has his walky on his belt. 
INSIDE THE CRAMPED COCKPIT, Harry looks around for the lever which vectors the thrust.  Finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees (vertical).  He bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle up to FULL. 
GIB (to pilot) It'll be fine.  He's got hundreds of hours in Harriers.  Joint-ops, cross-training and all that. 
AGENT Harry can fly anything. 
The big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble-bee. 
GIB He's a little rusty.  It's like riding a bicycle .  .  .  you never forget.  Uh .  .  .  I'd seek shelter! 
It drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way. At about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar.  It lifts unsteadily straight into the sky.  It turns around 180. 
GIB He's got it. 
HARRY Sorry. 
Harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust-nozzles turn, accelerating the plane forward. 
300   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY 
Gib is standing, watching Harry go.  He never believes this guy.  Harry's voice comes over the walky... 
HARRY Tell Helen what's going on.  Tell her I love her.  And ask the pilot where the button for the 20mm cannon is-- never mind.  I found it. 
The plane disappears toward Miami. 
301   EXT. HIGH RISE - MIAMI - DAY 
AN AERIAL SHOT, circling the building.  It is an unfinished building in the high rise district.  The Aerospatiale sits on the roof, its rotor turning slowly.  The street below is jammed with cars.  Honking horns echo up the glass canyons. 
302   EXT. STREET - DAY 
ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter two blocks away. 
303   INT. HIGH RISE - DAY 
INSIDE THE HIGH RISE the terrorists have barricaded themselves on the twentieth floor.  There are 12 TERRORISTS, all with automatic weapons.  Occasionally one of them will fire a burst down a stairwell with an AK-47.  Miami-Dade SWAT team members are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance. 
304   INT. HIGH RISE - ON THE 21ST FLOOR - DAY 
Malik is sequestered with the bomb.  It sits on the floor, still in its shipping case.  Dana stands nearby, looking scares.  She is not ties up.  Where can she go? 
She watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key. He has a TV set up on some crates, and we see that his video- tapes demands are running on CNN.  Harry's face fills the screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat.  He is identified at the bottom of the screen as HARRY TASKER, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.  Dana stares at her father's face on the national news.  It's like a bad dream.  She has been crying but she is fairly composed now. 
DANA I have to go to the bathroom. 
The terrorists ignore her.  A terrified ACTION NEWS REPORTER and his CAMERAMAN, under guard by TWO TERRORISTS, are hastily setting up to shoot Malik. CAMERAMAN Tape is rolling. 
MALIK This is a communique from Crimson Jihad.  You have heard from your own expert.  You have seen the Holy fire with your own eyes.  Do not force us to destroy this city.  And do not try to use force against us.  I can trigger this bomb instantly.  All I have to do is turn that key... (he points fiercely at the bomb) ... and five million of your people will die. 
The reporter glances down, nervously. 
REPORTER What key? 
MALIK (pointing like the guy's blind) That key right there! 
Malik looks down.  The key is gone. 
MALIK (to his men) Someone has stolen the key! 
He turns, looking around wildly.  Malik then sees Dana running for the stairwell to the roof.  He pulls a pistol and shoots at her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door.  He runs after her. 
305   EXT. BUILDING / ROOF - DAY 
ON THE ROOF, Malik bursts through the stairwell door.  His TWO MEN have followed him.  Malik stops suddenly when he sees-- Dana standing at the edge of the roof.  She is holding the ARMING KEY by its chain.  Dangling it over the edge.  He signals to his men not to fire. 
DANA (terrified, but thinking) You shoot me, this'll fall. 
Malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally.  She backs up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof. Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest. 
DANA Don't come any closer.  I'll drop it!  I swear to God. 
MALIK If you drop it, I will have no reason not to kill you. 
He advances, calling her bluff.  She backs away from him along the edge. 
MALIK Come on, child.  Give me the key. (smiling) Don't you want to live?  I give you my word. 
DANA No way you whacko. 
She reaches the corner of the building.  Her back touches something.  it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting building supplies.  Careful to keep the key dangling over open space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off Malik.  She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly. 
Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.  He knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.  It is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.  Dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.  It is windy and the boom is swinging. 
306   INT. 20TH FLOOR - DAY 
The Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar and look toward the window. 
307   EXT. HIGH RISE - DAY 
RISING INTO VIEW, LIKE A GARGOYLE FROM HELL, IS THE HARRIER. It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet outside.  The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon.

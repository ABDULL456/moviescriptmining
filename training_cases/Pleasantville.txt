PLEASANTVILLE 
A Fairytale by Gary Ross 
October 7, 1996 
"He was part of my dream of course but then I was part of his dream too." 
- Lewis Carroll "Through the looking glass" 
FADE IN: 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. DAY. 
A college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high school seniors about their future. 
COLLEGE COUNSELOR ... For those of you going on to college next year, the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop from thirty-one to twenty-six percent, and the median income for those jobs will go down as well ... 
There is some rustling in the audience. 
COLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT) Obviously, my friends, it's a competitive world and good grades are your only ticket through. By the year Two Thousand  ... 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS. 
A different teacher lectures a different class of students. 
HEALTH TEACHER ... The chance of contracting HIV from a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty. The odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty-five hundred. (beat) Now this marks a drastic increase ... 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS. 
Same angle. Different teacher. 
SCIENCE TEACHER ... From just four years ago when ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level. By the time you are twenty years old, average global temperature will have risen two and a half degrees. Even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought and famine. 
REVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS. 
They stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID WAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth. Nobody moves ... 
SCIENCE TEACHER (chipper classroom tone) Okay. Who can tell me what famine is? 
CUT TO: 
Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet stillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in beautiful BLACK AND WHITE. 
MAN'S VOICE (OS) Honey, I'm home. 
SUBURBAN HOME. 
GEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the coatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer with a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a tour guide at Disneyland. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (OS) Hello darling. 
WIDER. 
MRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her apron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and concrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a fresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek. 
BETTY How was your day? 
GEORGE Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought. 
BETTY Oh darling that's wonderful! (an adoring gaze) I always knew you could do it. 
WAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 
1996 -- (LIVING COLOR) 
DAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on a sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big smile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants, black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly ... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never taking his eyes off the show. 
GEORGE (OS) (on T.V.) Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell? (sniffing) Is that your meat loaf? 
DAVID (by rote) "It might be ..." 
BETTY (OS) (shy smile) It might be. 
He leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek. 
GEORGE (OS) Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to this man's heart. 
There is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when his real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room. 
DAVID'S MOM (OS) ... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the deal 
INT. KITCHEN. 
David's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand. Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix her age. 
DAVID'S MOM No--you have custody the first weekend of every month and this is the first weekend ... (pause) I don't care if yesterday was the thirtieth, this is still the first weekend. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. 
Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the show. 
DAVID'S MOM (OS) No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to go to La Costa ... (beat) Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's really my business, isn't it? 
He reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at an unnaturally high volume. 
GEORGE (on T.V.) Hey. Where are those kids? 
DAVID (reciting--a little louder) "Right behind you father." 
BUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER (on T.V.) Right behind you father. 
RESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE) 
The Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the foyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud has on a Letterman's sweater. 
MARYSUE Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little surprise for you. 
BETTY What's that Bud? 
HOWARD (weighing it) A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night? 
DAVID Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon. 
CUT TO: 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE. 
David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends are hanging out. 
KIMMY Omigod, it's so mortifying, being related to him. I can't believe you're like-- 
JENNIFER Only on my parent's side. 
KIMMY I know, but you're like ... twins and stuff. (beat) You must be from like, the cool side of the uterus. 
A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen year olds. The girls freeze when they see them. 
KIMMY (CONT) Omigod, omigod--here they come. 
CHRISTIN Don't do anything. Just don't like--do anything ... 
JENNIFER (cooly) Hi Mark. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
He pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young racehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole parking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his lackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan Pathfinder like a small summit conference. 
MARK (to Jennifer) Hey. 
JENNIFER (right back) Hey. 
Beat ... 
MARK'S LACKEYS (to Jennifer's lackies) Hey. 
JENNIFER'S LACKEYS (back to them) Hey. 
MARK Saw you at the mall yesterday. 
JENNIFER Yeah ... Saw you too. 
Everyone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything. 
JENNIFER (CONT) So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight? 
MARK Yeah. (beat) 
Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement. 
JENNIFER My mom'll be out of town. 
Kimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster. 
MARK So uh ... Maybe we could uh ... 
JENNIFER (smiling) Cool. 
MARK (nodding faster) Cool. 
VARIOUS LACKEYS Cool. 
Everybody bobs and shuffles for Â” beat, when Mark nods, summoning his flock. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK. 
lt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver." The uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There is a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have the same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of hell. 
JENNIFER (VO) ... I know, I know--He's just like so FINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod." 
INT. WAGNER HOME. 
lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so at night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the cordless phone attached to her ear. 
JENNIFER It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like: "Well my Mom'll be out of town." And he's like "Well then, maybe we could-- you know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure." And he's like "Well, cool." (beat) I know, he's just so smart. (pause ...) I don't know. Maybe that black thing I just got. (pause ...) It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute. (pause ... ) Well, "hello?" He's not coming  over here to study ... (beat) I know. Well I'm jealous of you too sometimes. 
INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM. 
lt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside with a cordless phone in his hand. 
DAVID ... He's not homeless Howard, they just don't say where he lives. (pause ...) Well it's a silly question. (pause ...) Because nobody's homeless in Pleasantville. 
REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. 
His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her Mercedes. 
DAVID ... because that's just not what it's like. 
She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway... 
DAVID (CONT) Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty. I gotta go. 
INT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM. 
The huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the room. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making a B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from the other direction, fiddling with her clothes. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
They hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at exactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at each other in shock. 
JENNIFER (stunned) What are you doing? 
DAVID What are you doing? 
Neither one moves. They clutch the remote together. 
JENNIFER David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes. 
DAVID Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty. 
CLOSER. 
He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash Gordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while Jennifer and David stare at him warily ... 
DAVID (beat) How much does it cost? 
DICK VAN DYKE Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free. 
JENNIFER Free? 
DICK VAN DYKE Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do. 
There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first. The house rattles for a moment then is quiet. 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) Well, I better get going. Your show's almost on, and ... (smiling at Jennifer) It's almost time for your date. 
He places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and smiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and tumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing position. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he looks back at them and smiles. 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) (grinning) Take care now. 
There is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the doorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his head. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
David glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he picks it up. 
CLOSER. 
David points the remote toward the TV set with an apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then pushes one of the buttons. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
The TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an angry housewife screams at a transvestite! 
DAVID Hunh. 
It ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time the channel changes. 
DAVID (CONT) (relaxing) Great. 
He continues to press the button, flipping through the channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches for the remote. 
JENNIFER Lemme see that. 
DAVID No way. 
He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on the Pleasantville Marathon. 
BUD'S VOICE fills the room. 
BUD (OS) (on TV) Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow your transistor radio? 
MARY SUE (OS) (on TV) I promised Betty Jane she could use it over the weekend. 
FULL SHOT. TV SET. "PLEASANTVILLE" (BLACK AND WHITE) 
Bud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor radio. They seem to be in the EXACT SAME POSITION as David and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control. 
ANGLE. DAVID AND JENNIFER. 
She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction. 
JENNIFER Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life. 
DAVID Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this. 
BUD (OS) (on TV) "But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a transistor in to electric shop." 
MARY SUE (OS) (on TV) "And I told Betty Jean she could have it for the picnic with Roy." 
JENNIFER (yanking at it) God, David. Just give it to me! 
DAVID (yanking it back) Get lost! 
JENNIFER YOU get lost! 
WIDER. LIVING ROOM. 
She tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands. David pulls in the opposite direction as they POINT IT DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TV. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT. 
A huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets sucked into the TV. 
WIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM. 
It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight. 
INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY. 
David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They still clutch the remote control in the exact same position that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE... 
DAVID (a whisper) Oh my God. 
JENNIFER What happened? 
DAVID I'm not sure. 
WIDER 
George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots. 
GEORGE (as if to his own children) Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a move on, you're gonna be late for school. 
He continues to cross through the living room whistling into the kitchen ... 
JENNIFER (desperately) What did you do? 
DAVID I don't know. 
JENNIFER (examining her black and white skin) Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty! 
INT. KITCHEN. 
David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them: 
THEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN. 
Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table. There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs. Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham. The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children. 
GEORGE (once again) Morning kids. Better get a move on or you're going to be late for school. 
They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the heap. 
DAVID (under his breath) I don't believe this. 
JENNIFER Neither do I. 
GEORGE Well, c'mon. Dig in. 
David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves. 
BETTY (to Jennifer) I put blueberries in them just the way you like. 
JENNIFER Actually--I'm not real ... hungry. 
BETTY (big smile) Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast. 
She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES. 
BETTY (CONT) (oppressively chipper) Here. Why don't you have some waffle cakes. (beat) And there's sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon ... (beat) ... And a ham steak. 
Betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge slab of butter. 
BETTY (CONT) ... And of course, a nice big bowl of oatmeal. 
Jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who looks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks stunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a forkful of the oozing mess ... 
CUT TO: 
FULL SHOT. PAT BOONE. 
He stands facing the CAMERA in an actual Kinescope from 1958. The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the background singers are all white debutantes. He wears a letterman's sweater and button down shirt ... 
PAT BOONE "... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity ... Oh rooty." 
He CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). It becomes a slow and lilting melody ... 
PAT BOONE (CONT) "... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..." 
SERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE. 
The MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image of this strange "Utopia." The effect is a weird, sanitizied version of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video. There are men tipping their hats and women walking their dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen. 
PAT BOONE (VO) (slowly ...) "... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom." 
Pruned hedges. Twin beds. BIG houses. The CAMERA CRANES DOWN in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs. 
JENNIFER I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God. 
DAVID Just take deep breaths. 
JENNIFER All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something. 
Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from side to side--totally absorbed. 
JENNIFER (CONT) I still don't see why we're doing this. 
DAVID We're supposed to be in school. 
JENNIFER We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color! (wailing) Oh God ... 
A man calls out from across the street. 
MR. SIMPSON Hello Bud. 
DAVID Hello Mr. Simpson. 
MR. SIMPSON Hear your Dad got a new car. 
DAVID Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell. 
JENNIFER You know him? 
DAVID Owns the hardware store. 
JENNIFER Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR! 
DAVID We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ... 
JENNIFER Play along? 
DAVID Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue. 
JENNIFER (ripping the barette from her hair) No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you! 
DAVID We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back. 
JENNIFER Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT? 
DAVID To who? 
Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the block. 
WIDER. 
Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN) 
They work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response" anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a tree. 
FIREMAN C'mere, kitty ... 
BIFF (OS) Bud ... 
WIDER. 
Biff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the other side of the Gym. He is a classic All American Hero-- somewhere between 4-H club member and a future astronaut. 
BIFF (a little nervous) Hi ya Bud. 
BUD Hi ya Biff. 
He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down. 
BIFF Can I ask you a question? 
BUD Sure. 
BIFF Well ... If I was to ask your sister ... What I mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue ... 
DAVID Oh God! Are we in that episode? 
BIFF What? 
DAVID I don't believe it. 
BIFF What's the matter? 
DAVID You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ... 
BIFF Yeah ... How'd you know? 
DAVID (shaking his head) Lucky guess. (beat) Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ... 
Biff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David. 
DAVID (CONT) What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ... 
BIFF (stunned) She won't go out with me? 
DAVID I didn't say that. It's just that right now ... 
BIFF I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ... 
All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out. 
WIDE ANGLE. GYM. 
Play comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE, DUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT. 
SHOT. DAVID. 
He retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff. David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other side of the gym. 
DAVID (under his breath) Look, I'm sure we'll work something out. I'll talk to her or something. 
Biff looks at him, troubled. 
DAVID (CONT) Honest. It'll be fine. 
Biff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDOR. LATER ... 
David stands off to the side with his sister, while class pours out around them. 
JENNIFER No way. 
DAVID One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack. 
JENNIFER It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank? 
DAVID What? 
JENNIFER I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them. 
DAVID What were you doing in a library? 
JENNIFER I got lost. (beat) Oh here ... look at this! 
She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches. Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire. 
DAVID JENNIFER! 
JENNIFER Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ... 
Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant. 
DAVID Jen, listen ... 
JENNIFER (trembling) I like--really need a cigarette, too. 
DAVID (putting his arm around her) I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. 
She looks over at him, slowly. 
JENNIFER You really think anybody's gonna, like, notice if I don't have a chocolate malt with this guy. 
At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of wind-up toys. 
PEGGY JANE (high-pitched--rapid fire) You won't believe what we just heard. 
LISA ANNE Biff Martin's going to ask you out. 
BETTY JEAN And that's not all ... 
PEGGY JANE No, that's not all ... 
ALL THREE TOGETHER He's going to give you his pin! 
They explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer looks over at David. 
DAVID Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along. 
Mr. Johnson stares at him. 
DAVID (CONT) Really. It's fine. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE. 
The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays through, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her "girlfriends" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a table, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing against him as she goes. 
ANGLE. DAVID. 
He stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and apprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all over his chest. 
FULL SHOT. TABLE. 
Biff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome devotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross between Troy Donahue and a mannequin. 
BIFF (haltingly) I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue. 
JENNIFER (full blown "Mary Sue") Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me. 
He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again. 
BIFF I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ... 
JENNIFER Really Biff? The keenest? 
BIFF Oh yeah. 
JENNIFER (all sarcasm) Gosh. I hardly know what to say. 
DAVID (OS) What can I get you two? 
WIDER. 
He stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper and a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost bursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty angle with large white apron tied around his neck. 
BIFF Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke. 
More goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the same dopey countenance. 
JENNIFER Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a salad and an Evian Water. 
He shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him. 
JENNIFER (CONT) Cheeseburger it is. 
ANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID. 
He glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an eye on the table the entire time ... 
RESUME. TABLE. 
Biff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look on his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him. She's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue." 
BIFF See the whole time we were in civics together, I really wanted to sit next to you--but you were always sitting between Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne. 
There is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond. 
BIFF (CONT) ... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about. 
JENNIFER Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think? 
BIFF Hunh? (goony laugh) Oh, right ... 
He still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself. 
BIFF (CONT) So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important. 
JENNIFER Oh, gosh no. 
BIFF I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you? 
JENNIFER Oh you bet. (beat) Will you excuse me for a sec? 
Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom. 
ANGLE. DAVID. 
He freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister practically stumbles through the bathroom door. 
INT. BATHROOM. 
Of course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way to the sink and leans against the counter. 
JENNIFER Jesus Chirist ... 
She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open. 
GIRL'S VOICES (overlapping) "Did he give it to you ... Did he give it to you ... I bet he gave it to her ... Did he give it to you?" 
JENNIFER (straight ahead) I don't think he knows how. 
They TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It sounds like an aviary. 
LISA ANNE I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's Lane. 
PEGGY JANE I bet he is. I bet he is. 
BETTY JEAN I bet he's even gonna hold her hand! 
They TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head. 
INT. SODA SHOP. 
David is standing beside their table as she retums from the bathroom. 
DAVID (chipper) Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes. (pointedly) If you need anything, I'll be right over there. 
JENNIFER (Mary Sue) Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other? 
EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT. 
The SOUND of the television plays OS while a warm light burns in the window. 
INT. KITCHEN. 
Jennifer and Betty stand at the sink finishing the dishes. Betty washes while Jennifer dries and it's clear who's more used to this. Jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places a dish in the drying rack. 
BETTY Mary Sue? 
JENNIFER Yeah? 
Betty hesitates. Rinses out a pot. 
BETTY Can I ask you a question? 
JENNIFER Sure. 
She pauses for a long moment. 
BETTY What goes on up at Lover's Lane? 
JENNIFER (turning toward her) What do you mean? 
BETTY Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... (she looks over) Is it holding hands? That kind of thing? 
JENNIFER Yeah ... (beat) That--and ... 
She stops herself. 
BETTY What? 
JENNIFER It doesn't matter. 
BETTY No. I want to know. 
JENNIFER (glances toward the living room/ lowers her voice) ... Sex. 
BETTY Ah. 
Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A beat goes by ... 
BETTY (CONT) What's sex? 
Jennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at her with a blank, curious expression. Jennifer hesitates. 
JENNIFER You sure you want to know this? 
BETTY Yes. 
JENNIFER Okay. 
She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to the kitchen counter and turns to her. 
JENNIFER (CONT) You see Mom ... (softer and with understanding) When two people like each other very much ... 
Betty looks at her and nods ... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT. 
The TV keeps flickering in the window. 
INT. KITCHEN. LATER ... 
The CAMERA PANS across the kitchen table where there is a full quart of milk and some uneaten co6kies. It finally comes to rest on Jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table with a concerned look on her face. 
JENNIFER You okay? 
REVERSE ANGLE. BETTY. 
She nods--shaken but "fine." Betty stares long and hard at the plate of chocolate chip cookies. She's far away. 
BETTY Yes ... (softly) It's just that ... 
JENNIFER (gently) What? 
BETTY Well ... (looking up) ... Your father would never do anything like that. 
SHOT. JENNIFER. 
She bites her lip weighing her next sentence ... 
JENNIFER (leaning forward) Oh. Hmm ... (whisper/ woman to woman) Well, Mom ... there's ways to "enjoy" yourself without Dad. 
ANGLE. BETTY. 
She looks across the table, perplexed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PARKER BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
George crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the middle of the room. He wears long sleeve pajamas that are buttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering. 
GEORGE Sweetie? You coming to bed? 
There is no answer. 
GEORGE (CONT) Betty? 
INT. BATHROOM. 
She stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub. Her dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well. 
BETTY (calling out) Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath first. 
CLOSER. BETTY. 
She swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches for the spigot and turns on the water. Betty's heart beats a little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN. 
EXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ... 
David walks away from the center of town looking down at his plaque. He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge when a young woman comes up beside him. 
GIRL'S VOICE Hi Bud ... 
WIDER. 
She is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school, and one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure. Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence. 
MARGARET That was sure swell ... 
DAVID Oh. Thanks, Margaret. 
MARGARET (smiling) I baked you my oatmeal cookies. 
DAVID (vaguely remembering an episode) Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey. 
MARGARET No. I baked them for you. 
DAVID No. You baked them for Whitey. 
MARGARET (low and gutteral) No. I baked them for you. 
All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her mouth is inches away from his. 
DAVID Um ... thanks. 
David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment, unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville smile. 
MARGARET See ya. 
She turns and heads around the comer, while David just watches her dumbstruck. 
CUT TO: 
SODA SHOP. DUSK. 
David heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat. The BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to "hip" '50s JAZZ. DAVE BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside. 
SODA SHOP. 
The place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house now. Brubeck's "TAKE FIVE" plays in the background while several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths. 
DOORWAY. 
David walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz on a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table. Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him. 
JENNIFER (in a whisper) I had nothing to do with that fire. 
DAVID (quietly) It's okay. 
JENNIFER Not directly anyhow ... 
DAVID It's fine. 
David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at him, with a weird expression of awe. 
JENNIFER (still under her breath) Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ... 
DAVID Sure. 
He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at him. It's like Elvis has entered the building. 
DAVID (CONT) How you doin? 
VARIOUS KIDS Swell ... 
They keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ... 
BOY How'd you know about the fire? 
DAVID What? 
BOY How'd you know how to put it out and all? 
David hesitates, weighing his words. 
DAVID Well--where I used to live ... That's just what firemen did. 
This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward. 
BOY And where's that? 
DAVID (carefully) Um ... Outside of Pleasantville. 
This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids. It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A hush descends. 
BOY What's outside of Pleasantville? 
DAVID Look it doesn't matter. It's not important. 
BOY What is it? 
David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on every word. 
DAVID It's really not important. 
GIRL'S VOICE (OS) What's outside of Pleasantville? 
REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY. 
Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the same excitement as the others, it just means so much more. 
MARGARET (CONT) (hungry for knowledge) C'mon. Tell us ... 
She stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might as well be touching him. 
DAVID (slowly) Well ... There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going. 
There's an excited giggle. They lean forward. 
Bob takes a belt of his drink ... 
BIG BOB George, everyone likes you. 
GEORGE Oh well ... 
BOB No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ... 
GEORGE (heartfelt) Thank you very much. 
BOB And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it. 
GEORGE No. Of course not. 
BOB (big patriarchal smile) And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce. 
GEORGE (stunned/ moved) Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say. 
BOB (smiling) Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs. 
GEORGE Oh sure ... You bet. (calling out) Betty ... 
There is no answer. 
GEORGE (CONT) (louder this time) BETTY ... 
Still no answer. 
GEORGE (CONT) BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ... 
WIDER. 
George turns around to see David, standing on the landing, listening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a moment ... 
DAVID I'll get her. 
He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him. 
INT. KITCHEN. 
David gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across the room to see: 
REVERSE ANGLE. 
Betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the window. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen counter. 
DAVID (approaching slowly) Are you okay? 
She doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on her shoulder. 
DAVID (CONT) Are you alright? 
Betty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED. SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the tear stains on either side of her face. 
BETTY (fighting tears) What am I going to do? 
David moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering. 
DAVID It's okay. It's alright. 
BETTY (trembling) I can't go out there. How can I go out there? 
She looks right up at David. 
BETTY (CONT) (quieter) Look at me ... 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
He stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear and confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile. 
DAVID Have you got any make up? 
BETTY In my handbag. 
He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex. 
DAVID Okay--first we'll dry you out a little. 
He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude, Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY powder puff. 
CLOSER. 
It is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup, she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips. 
REVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER. 
He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back. All at once, David seems to wince: 
REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE. 
The life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the fictional version of herself all over again. 
BETTY (off his reaction) What? 
David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her face, turning her head first right, then left. 
BETTY (CONT) (beat) Does it look okay? 
DAVID Looks just like it did. 
BETTY And they won't be able to tell? 
DAVID (even quieter) No ... They won't be able to tell. 
Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide "stewardess" smile ... 
DAVID (CONT) Wait. 
BETTY (turning back) What? 
He wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his head. 
DAVID (calling back) Sorry ... 
FOLLOWING DAVID. 
He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a time flinging open the door. 
INT. PARKER HOUSE. FOYER. 
DAVID "Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching in ..." 
He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs, when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room. 
MAN'S VOICE (OS) Bud ... 
He pauses a second and glances back. 
MAN'S VOICE (CONT) David ... 
He peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer ... 
HIS POV. TELEVISION. 
Dick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble. 
DICK VAN DYKE Hello there. 
DAVID (wary) ... Hi. 
DICK VAN DYKE (stage whisper) Well c'mere, young fella. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. 
David crosses slowly over to the TV set. 
DICK VAN DYKE (big smile) You know I've been thinkin' ... I might have been a little "hasty" the other day when you asked to come home--just took me by such surprise, ya know--ha ha ... 
He gives a goony laugh. David just looks at him ... 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again. 
DAVID (quickly) I can't. 
DICK VAN DYKE What? 
DAVID Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ... 
The look turns suddenly dark and ominous. 
DICK VAN DYKE Bud--I thought you wanted to come home. 
DAVID Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ... 
DICK VAN DYKE (getting testy) I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ... 
DAVID Re-runs? 
DICK VAN DYKE Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. (losing it a little) ... Those aren't your cookies Bud. 
DAVID Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ... 
DICK VAN DYKE Excuse me? 
DAVID Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow? 
DICK VAN DYKE BUD. 
DAVID Terrific. I'll talk to you then. 
He swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room, breathing hard ... 
INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. 
She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to open it when she senses something and glances toward the door. 
REVERSE ANGLE. 
Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems to be out of breath. 
JENNIFER What's wrong? 
DAVID Nothing. 
JENNIFER Nothing? 
He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the remote in his hand. 
DAVID Listen ... 
He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly stops. 
DAVID (CONT) You're reading? 
JENNIFER (glancing at the book) Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad. 
She holds up the cover. 
JENNIFER (CONT) D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him? 
DAVID (amazed) ... Yeah. 
JENNIFER Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages. 
DAVID (still stunned) That's great. 
He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to drift ... 
JENNIFER So what is it? 
DAVID Well ... I just ... (out of the blue) Can I ask you a question? 
JENNIFER Sure. 
CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY. 
She nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street when she glances up, and suddenly stops. 
HER POV. ACROSS THE STREET. 
There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist Santa hovering over the roof tops. 
SHOT. BETTY. 
She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of the block, staring straight ahead. 
INT. SODA SHOP. 
The door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters. 
MR. JOHNSON (OS) We're closed right now ... 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway. 
MR. JOHNSON Oh, hi ... 
BETTY (turning to leave) I'm sorry ... 
MR. JOHNSON No, no ... Come on in. 
REVERSE ANGLE. 
He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist Christmas" in the window. 
BETTY I just thought ... It's beautiful. 
MR. JOHNSON Thanks. 
Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr. Johnson motions toward his easel. 
MR. JOHNSON (CONT) I was just trying to do one of these "still lifes." 
He sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of GRAY FRUIT. 
MR. JOHNSON (CONT) Having kind of a tough time. 
BETTY I think it looks nice. 
MR. JOHNSON Well ... (shrugs) Here's what it's s'posed to look like. 
He leads her over to the table and points down at the art book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page. 
BETTY Oh my ... 
CLOSER. 
They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world. 
MR. JOHNSON Here. Look at this. 
He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is nearly electric. 
BETTY (breathless) Where'd you get this? 
MR. JOHNSON Bud brought it to me. 
BETTY Bud? 
MR. JOHNSON Here's my favorite. 
INSERT. BOOK. 
He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping Women." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own shoulder. 
MR. JOHNSON What do you think? 
She doesn't answer ... 
MR. JOHNSON (CONT) Isn't it great how she's resting like that? 
BETTY (faintly) She's crying. 
WIDER. 
Mr. Johnson looks down at the painting. 
MR. JOHNSON What? 
BETTY She's crying. 
MR. JOHNSON No she's not. 
BETTY Yes she is. 
He looks up at her ... 
REVERSE ANGLE. 
A single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP. A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath. 
ANGLE. MR. JOHNSON. 
He stares up at her in amazement. 
ANGLE. BETTY. 
She senses something and glances down at her hand. Her fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts for the door. 
WIDER. 
MR. JOHNSON (following her) Wait ... 
BETTY I've got to go ... 
GEORGE (faintly) Rain. 
BOB (beat) Real rain? 
George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning lights up the sky. 
BOB (CONT) Oh my God ... 
He turns back to George. 
BOB (CONT) ... We had no idea. Burt was rolling a 250 and ... (beat) Are you alright? 
George shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches and guides him into the seat ... 
BOB (CONT) What happened? 
GEORGE (still shivering) Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home." 
ANGLE. MEN. 
They all nod in recognition. 
ANGLE. GEORGE. 
GEORGE ... Only no one was there. 
A MURMUR goes through the men. 
GEORGE (CONT) So I went into the kitchen and I yelled it again. "Honey--I'm home." But there was no one there either. No wife. No lights. No dinner. 
They all GASP. 
GEORGE (CONT) So I went to the oven--you know-- because I thought maybe she had made me one of those "TV dinners ..." 
The men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head. 
GEORGE (CONT) But she hadn't. She was gone. 
A LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his head and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up and puts a hand on his shoulder. 
BOB (gently/ the patriarch) ... It's gonna be fine George. 
George looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly on the back. 
GUS What do we do Bob? 
BOB Well--we'll be safe for now--thank goodness we're in a bowling alley-- but if George here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be next. It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or even you Phil ... 
They murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam. 
BOB (CONT) (like a WWII movie) ... That's real rain out there gentlemen. This isn't some little "virus" that's going to "clear up on it's own." There's something happening to our town and I think we can all see where it comes from. 
They nod in agreement. 
BOB (CONT) We're gonna need a town meeting. Phil, how fast can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop? 
PHIL Couple of hours. 
BOB Gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks ... 
Gus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm, patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder. 
BOB (CONT) (soothingly) And the first thing you're gonna do is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt. 
INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT. 
The rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through Mr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft radiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow pink ... 
MR. JOHNSON You can't go out there. 
BETTY But I really should get home. 
MR. JOHNSON But you can't go out there. 
There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the roof. 
BETTY Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it. 
MR. JOHNSON (listening) Yeah. It does. 
There is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this time. 
BETTY Like a drum. 
MR. JOHNSON Yeah. (thinks) Or like sprinklers in the summer ... 
Betty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr. Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two. Betty starts to smile ... 
EXT. LOVER'S LANE. 
David huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she nestles against him with her head on his shoulder. 
INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. 
She lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting image of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses have slipped down her nose. There is another fork of lightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP. A BRIGHT RED ROSE. 
Drops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT RED IN THE MORNING SUN ... 
AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. 
The rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight complete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky. Literally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the black and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card. 
INT. SODA SHOP. 
Betty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each other's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming Mr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens his eyes and looks outside ... 
MR. JOHNSON (seeing the rainbow) Oh my Gosh ... 
There is a murmur from the crowd ... 
CLOSE UP. GEORGE. 
He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a shiny new pin can give you. 
SHOT. BOB. 
He holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS. 
BOB Jane Davidson found these in her son's laundry basket. 
There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats. Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair. 
BOB (CONT) This is from Mary Petersen's front porch. She found one last week. There were two more this morning ... 
The MURMUR starts to grow ... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 
David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright RED bow. 
DAVID (softly) I got you something. 
Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled. 
MARGARET It's beautiful. Where'd you get it? 
DAVID It was a prop for the school play ... 
She looks down and giggles. 
MARGARET Can I open it? 
DAVID Sure ... 
Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the corner. 
WIDER. 
David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with BLACK AND WHITE faces ... 
DRIVER Hello Bud ... 
DAVID (clipped) Hello Whitey. 
They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and arrogant. 
WHITEY (more pointed) Hello Margaret. 
MARGARET Hello Whitey ... 
WHITEY (loud) Hey Bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now? 
DAVID (curt) No reason. (pause/ firing back) How come you're not? 
WHITEY Oh. We're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. See. 
He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and leers ... 
WHITEY (CONT) No reason hunh ... See I thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend. 
Margaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around her and pulls her close. 
DAVID Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here. 
WHITEY Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that. 
He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns toward Margaret. 
WHITEY (CONT) (leering more) You know Margaret, you can come over and bake those Oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to. 
They share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David holds her tighter ... 
DAVID It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything. 
She nods, groping for reassurance ... 
CUT TO: 
INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT. 
The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing. Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the audience. 
WOMAN Ed McFadden's got a blue front door. 
ED MCFADDEN It's always been blue! 
WOMAN Not that blue! 
MAN There's a big tree turning orange in Joe Baker's front yard! 
SHOT. GEORGE. 
He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ... 
BOB People, people ... I think we all know what's going on here. 
SHOT. BOB. 
Bob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit. 
BOB Obviously certain "changes" have been happening. Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been-- well ... "Pleasant." And, recently, certain things have become ... "Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are "Un-Pleasant." 
There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ... 
BOB (CONT) George, why don't you and Burt take the lead on this. Why don't you put together kind of an "Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ... 
CUT TO: 
DAVID (gathering strength) I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that. 
DICK VAN DYKE (nuts) JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE! 
He lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the "barrier." 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) OW! 
DAVID (terrified) I'm going to leave now. 
DICK VAN DYKE You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!! 
Dick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves the shop. 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) Don't make me get rough with you! I can get awfully fucking rough! 
ELM STREET. DAY. 
David sprints down the tree lined street toward his house. The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN even this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's hedge and goes tearing up his front walk. 
INT. FOYER. 
The door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He crosses into the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. 
David rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door. 
MAIN STREET. DAY. 
David moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to stash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville Travel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't see much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a drain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the street. 
WIDER. 
David turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main Street. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to his feet as the voices get louder. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a group of young men who circle around her, taunting and harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face: BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd circles her like a pack of dogs. 
CLOSER. BETTY. 
The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one another "Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her picture ..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to the ground ... 
WIDER. 
David shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.) David steps in front of his "mother" with both fists clenched. 
DAVID (as scared as she is) Come on! 
He plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black and white thugs just stares at it. 
DAVID (CONT) COME ON! 
ANGLE. CROWD. 
They look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts backing away. 
DAVID Get out of here! 
They back away further and David takes a threatening step. The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother." 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER) 
David moves up to her gently. 
DAVID Are you alright? 
She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go wide. 
DAVID (CONT) (off her look) What? 
CLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER. 
Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR. 
REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID. 
He holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The courage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle arm around her shoulder. 
DAVID (quietly) Come on. 
He begins to lead her up toward the corner. 
CUT TO: 
FULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY. 
A larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude painting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are even louder. The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway. After a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ... 
WIDER. 
A big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the fever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an instant, Mr. Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed. The CHEERING grows louder ... 
Almost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together. The door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon all that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND BROKEN GLASS. 
INT. SODA SHOP. 
It is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables ripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick in the front of the juke box ... 
EXT. MAIN ST. DAY. 
David and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being destroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok. After a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped open. 
DAVID Oh my God. 
He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David strokes her hair. 
DAVID (CONT) Are you alright? Are you okay? 
She nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two, then glances down to her side ... 
They respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage. Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as the kids try to put their shop back together. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT. 
Big Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a lynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills. Bob points his finger. 
BOB This is not the answer people. 
The crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern. 
BOB (CONT) No matter how upset we may get, or how frustrated we may be, we're not gonna solve our problems out in the street. It's just the wrong way to do it. We have to have a "Code of Conduct" we can all agree to live by. 
His tone grows softer--more concerned ... 
BOB (CONT) Now, I asked George and Burt here to sketch out some ideas-and I think they've done a terrific job. (beat/ scans the crowd) If we all agree on these then we can take a vote and I think we'll start to move in the right direction. 
ANGLE. CROWD. 
They murmur and nod ... 
BOB (reading from the CODE OF CONDUCT") "ONE: All public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease immediately." 
EXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT. 
It is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in VOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb. 
SHOT. FIRETRUCK. 
The same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls several yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and extinguish the raging bonfire ... 
BOB "TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville are to treat one another in a courteous and "pleasant" manner ..." 
SERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS. 
The CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in rapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop windows ... 
SODA SHOP. 
Debris is still strewn around the street. A dim light emanates from inside. 
INT. SODA SHOP. 
It looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads the code of conduct out loud by flashlight. 
LISA ANNE "Courteous and Pleasant manner." That doesn't sound too bad. 
David just looks at her then continues. 
DAVID (reading from THE CODE) "THREE: The area commonly known as Lover's Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice." 
This sends a murmur amongst the kids. 
DAVID (CONT) "FOUR: The only permissible recorded music shall be the following: Pat Boone, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones, The marches of John Phillips Souza or the Star Spangled Banner. In no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate or "pleasant" nature." 
VARIOUS KIDS (overlapping) "Oh my gosh ... No ..." 
David holds up his hand. 
DAVID "FIVE: There shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind." 
Various glances dart back and forth between them. David continues. 
DAVID (CONT) "SIX: No bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than 38 inches wide." (pause) "SEVEN: The only permissible exterior paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or GRAY, despite the recent availability of certain alternatives." 
David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly. Betty clutches his hand. 
DAVID (CONT) "EIGHT: All elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the "non-changist" view of history-- emphasizing "continuity" over "alteration." (David pauses) Wow. 
David lowers the paper. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
It is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of sadness. 
Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner. 
BOY Hey. This thing works. 
He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop. RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive time. 
BUDDY HOLLY Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo ... 
LISA ANNE (suddenly/ in a panic) Turn that off! 
The boy looks back at her. 
LISA ANNE (CONT) (shrieking) You're not allowed to do that now! 
He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it. David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear tone. 
DAVID Sure you are. 
He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance. 
WIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP. 
Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious reputation. 
BUDDY HOLLY The little things that you say and do Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ... RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ... RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ... 
Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little safer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel ashamed. 
Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the helm of his ship ... 
EXT. STREET. LATER ... 
He steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge. The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is silent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids. 
DAVID (whisper) Stick together till you get off Main Street. 
INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT. 
David sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling. 
INT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ... 
Mr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in true "inmate" fashion. 
REVERSE ANGLE. WALL. 
Rather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr. Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall complete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at his work and smiles. 
SHOT. POLICE CHIEF. 
He approaches David's cell from the other direction and knocks gently on the bars. David turns around. 
DAN There's someone to see you Bud. 
DAVID. 
David sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could be. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding crosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE LOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles. 
DAVID I thought it might be you. 
REVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE. 
He stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's outfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND WHITE. 
DICK VAN DYKE Hope you're proud of yourself. 
DAVID I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors. 
Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the cell behind him. 
DICK VAN DYKE Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control? 
DAVID Why? 
DICK VAN DYKE Because you're coming home. 
DAVID (smiles) Why don't you just take me back without it? 
DICK VAN DYKE Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? (tightly) It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came. 
David just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back on the bunk ... 
DAVID So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ... 
DICK VAN DYKE Just gimme the damn remote! 
DAVID I'm sorry. I can't do that. 
Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the barred window. 
DICK VAN DYKE I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ... 
DAVID They weren't my memories. (beat) I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them. 
Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to tremble. 
DICK VAN DYKE (containing his rage) How long do you think you've been here? 
DAVID (warily) I don't know ... Three, four weeks. 
DICK VAN DYKE Much less than that. (checks his watch) An hour and a half. 
David looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad nasty smile. 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) See--and this is really great-- the show was on for what--half an hour a week? So that means for every week that goes by in Pleasantville, only half an hour goes by in the real world. 
The smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him. 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ... (calculates) Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down. 
DAVID I'm going on trial tomorrow? 
DICK VAN DYKE This is TV pal. They don't fool around. 
David is rocked but tries not to show it. 
DAVID (stoicly) There's worse places. 
DICK VAN DYKE Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous. (beat) Sleep well. 
He taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him out. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down the hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David looks around his cell, truly afraid. 
CLOSER. 
He stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the ceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it ... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David crosses to the small window and looks out. 
HIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW. 
Across the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall complete with the newly painted mural. The "Utopian" view of Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to BLACK AND WHITE. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY. 
It is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history. There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air. 
INT. TOWN HALL. DAY. 
The place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews and ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous configuration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped across the back wall. 
ANGLE. BENCH. 
At the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the front. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings finally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange combination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind." Big Bob bangs the gavel ... 
CLOSER. 
The undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the pews are Black and White. There is a "colored" section in the back for standing room only. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen while David confronts his "father." George straightens up. 
GEORGE (solemn) Yes Bud. 
DAVID (beat) Don't you miss her? 
CLOSE UP. GEORGE. 
He looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody listens. George just stares at him like he got shot. 
DAVID I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ... 
George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room. 
DAVID (CONT) (softer whisper) Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. (shrugs) You might even call it "love." 
BIG BOB (BANGING the gavel loudly) Okay, that's IT!!! 
DAVID (motioning toward the back) Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her? 
Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of COLOR behind it. 
DAVID (CONT) Don't you wish you could tell her that? 
He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well. 
BOB (POUNDING the gavel) YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER! 
DAVID Why am I out of order? 
BOB BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS! 
DAVID Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. 
David motions behind him to the black and white section. There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces. 
BOB THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE. 
DAVID But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you. 
BOB (tightly) It's not in ME. 
DAVID Oh sure it is. 
BOB No it isn't. 
He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans over the bench and gets right up in his face. 
DAVID (smug whisper) What do you want to do to me right now? 
Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves closer. 
DAVID (CONT) C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ... 
BIG BOB That's not going to happen! 
DAVID But it could happen. 
BIG BOB No it couldn't! 
Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely RED IN THE FACE. 
WIDER. 
A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window. 
CLOSE UP. BIG BOB. 
He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom. 
ANGLE. DOORWAY. 
As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside. 
EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!) 
All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars, Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his creation. The whole town is washed in joy. 
WIDER. 
Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and looks at her brother making out. 
JENNIFER Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ... 
David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David throws his arms around his sister as more and more people stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY. 
David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control. 
DAVID Are you sure? 
JENNIFER I told you. I'm like positive. 
DAVID This thing works. We could go home right now. 
JENNIFER I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while. 
WIDER. 
They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge). 
A large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning. Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the distance. 
JENNIFER Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there? 
DAVID (thinks ...) Honestly ... no.

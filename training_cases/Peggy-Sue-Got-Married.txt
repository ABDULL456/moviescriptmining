PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED 
An Original Screenplay 
by 
Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner 
REHEARSAL DRAFT - These changes are August 14, 1985 
Over BLACK, we HEAR the sounds of an old TAPE RECORDING. Young VOICES are filtered amid a noticeable hum, hiss and crackle. We HEAR giggling and then someone named Charlie making vows of love to someone named Peggy Sue. 
CHARLIE (0.S). Hi this is Charlie and... Come on, say your name. 
PEGGY (O.S.) Peggy Sue. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) And we're here on the couch... 
PEGGY (0.S.) Don't say that... 
EXT. PEGGY'S NEIGHBORHOOD  DAY 
A splitlevel house on a slight grade of lawn. A red Honda the driveway. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) We're here on the sofa bed... 
PEGGY (0.S.) Charlie... 
CHARLIE (O.S.) ...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something. 
A real estate agent, a WOMAN, carries a "For Sale" sign to the center of the lawn and begins driving it in with a hammer. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed. 
PEGGY (O.S.) I can't. I'm too embarrassed. 
INT. BODELL HOUSE 
MOVING VIEW, revealing the empty house. We HEAR the RECORDING LOUDER. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) But you love me don't you? 
PEGGY (0.S.) Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) And nothing will ever change that. 
Charlie starts giggling. We HEAR fumbling and tickling. 
CLOSE VIEW INTO THE KITCHEN - First we see a woman's hand, on the floor. It is partially covered with flour. 
MOVING VIEW reveals PEGGY BODELL, in her early 40's, fainted from heartbreak while baking a cake. Flour is scattered on the floor. She recovers from her faint. Confused, she steadies herself and brushes the flour from her dress. 
INT. GARAGE -- DAY 
Peggy's son, SCOTT, 16, is playing an old reel to reel tape recorder. There are stacks of boxes filled with personal things and records. His sister, BETH, 23, is packing. 
SCOTT Boy, have they changed. Who gets it? 
BETH I don't know, just put it back. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) Oh, gotta go. Here's a little makeout music. 
A record starts: "You Belong to Me" by the Duprees. 
INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT 
CHARLIE BODELL, early 40's, singing the same song. He can't hit a high note, turns off the water and steps out of the shower. JANET, his young, buxom girlfriend is in the bedroom. 
CHARLIE Goddamnit, I just can't hit those high notes anymore. 
JANET You know Charlie, if you're serious about this, I know a great vocal coach. 
Charlie's perplexed reaction. 
EXT. BODELL HOUSE - DAY 
"Crazy Charlie's Discount Appliances" truck has parked in front of the house. WORKMEN are loading boxes of records, tapes, etc. Charlie pulls up, waves to workmen. 
INT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY 
Peggy is loading the oddshaped cakes into boxes. We note the grandfather clock tolling nine. 
VIEW IN HALLWAY 
EXT. LOVIN' OVEN BAKE SHOP 
Peggy pulls up to the front door of The Lovin' Oven, her bake shop. Bags of bread and rolls lean against the door. Beth jumps out and opens the door of the shop. Peggy stacks the boxes in Beth's arms and opens the door for her. 
PEGGY If the pastries aren't here by nine thirty, call Monica and threaten her life. 
Peggy gets into the car, and blows a kiss to Beth. 
PEGGY I'll be back by noon. 
Peggy drives off as MONICA drives up. She exits her car and begins to unpack cake boxes. 
BETH Hi Monica. You just missed Mom. 
MONICA Sorry I'm late. My Bobo's back in town. 
EXT. KRISTIN'S COIFFURES HAIR SALON 
INSERT:	Sign: KRISTIN'S COIFFURES 
Peggy exits with a fifties flip. From a distance she looks like a fifties teenager. She nervously looks at her reflection. Maybe this was a mistake. Too late now. 
INT. PEGGY'S CAR  DRIVING 
Peggy is driving. On her car radio, we HEAR a local PHONEIN TALK SHOW. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) Hi. I'm Dolores Dodge. We're taking calls today on surrogate mothers. Wombs for rent. I want to know how you feel.. 
PEGGY Oh, Dolores. 
Peggy switches stations until she finds the news. 
EXT. STREET CORNER 
Peggy stops for a red light. Her eye is caught by a Mercedes stopped next to her. Behind the wheel is a striking woman of her age, CAROL HEATH. They stare curiously for a beat, then: 
PEGGY Carol! 
CAROL Peggy Sue! 
They pull over to the side of the road. 
EXT. SIDE OF ROAD 
Exiting the cars, they hug. 
CAROL I haven't seen you in years. In all that time, haven't you at least tried another hair style? 
Peggy tries to laugh off her embarrassment. 
PEGGY 1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun. 
CAROL You're probably the only one who could carry it off. 
INT. LOVIN' OVEN  DAY 
Peggy and Carol enter as Beth finishes up with a customer. Peggy walks behind the counter as the customer exits. 
BETH Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve. 
PEGGY This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her. 
Beth and Carol exchange hellos. 
BETH r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call.. 
PEGGY How do you like my hair? 
BETH It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible. 
Peggy takes over the work of decorating the large pennant shaped cake in silver icing: 25th Reunion  Buchanan High.' 
CAROL Who's the mother around here? 
BETH Sometimes I wonder. 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO 
A television studio set made up of platforms covered with black cloth. Placed around the platforms on different levels are projection TVs, regular TVs, microwave ovens and other expensive, futuristic appliances. Charlie sits at one of them (or a table) as a CHINESE WAITER rushes in and puts a tray of fortune cookies down. 
WAITER Here Charlie, extra fortune cookies. Good luck. 
CHARLIE Thanks. 
Charlie grabs a cookie and puts it on the table in front of him, smashing it with his fist. He picks up and reads the fortune: 
The gym is packed with people dancing, chatting, greeting lost friends. A bar is set up at one end. On the walls are black and white blowups of the 1960 yearbook. On a table is a buffet and Peggy' s cake. The BAND is PLAYING and SINGING old rock and roll songs. Couples slow dance, jive and stroll. 
Peggy, Beth, Maddy and Arthur enter. Beth leaves the group. 
ARTHUR Hey, there's Terry and Leon. 
MADDY Peggy, would you find a table? We'll see you in a little while. 
PEGGY Okay. 
They walk away into the crowd, leaving Peggy alone. 
INT. GYM NEAR WALL 
CL0SE VIEW  A photo of the majorettes. Peggy is in the middle, twirling her baton. 
Her reverie is interrupted by: 
RICHARD (0.S.) Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher? 
PEGGY I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you. 
RICHARD You look exactly the same. 
PEGGY I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this. 
SHARON It's adorable. 
RICHARD Oh, I'm sorry.. Peggy Sue Kelcher, my wife Sharon. 
PEGGY Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now. 
RICHARD Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh. 
PEGGY He's not here. We're getting divorced. 
RICHARD Gee. I'm sorry to hear that. 
NEW VIEW  A large, beefy HAND is THRUST INTO FRAME. 
MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) Mr. Norvik. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE DOUG SNELL, a paunchy, overbearing man, shaking Richard's hand. 
DOUG Or, uhh, Richard?  David Snell, Merrill Lynch.  I read about the Cordex deal in Business Week. Congratulations. 
RICHARD Thank you, Doug. 
DOUG Hi Peggy. How are you? How's Char1ie? 
INT. GYM 
VIEWS ON Carol and Walter. They play a standoffish game, each noticing the other, but pretending not to. 
We HEAR and SEE bits of conversations: 
SANDY (gleeful) I can't believe how she let herself go. She was so beautiful in high school. 
CAROL Everyone's got a gold Rolex. I had this one specially made in platinum. 
Richard is standing with three men. They hang on his every word. Beside them, a very DRUNK MAN overhears: 
RICHARD ...fifth generation core capacities are going to cause another shakeout in the smaller companies. 
DRUNK MAN (to Richard) Your damn computers put me out of business. You're a billionaire, and I'm a goddamn failure. 
Another man gently restrains the drunk and leads him away. Richard is shaken. 
NEW VIEW 
Carol and Peggy. 
CAROL (chuckling) Welcome to the singles scene. 
PEGGY I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie. 
CAROL You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage. 
PEGGY We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things. 
CAROL So he started having affairs, and you got depressed. 
Peggy nods. 
CAROL (CONT'D.) You should have left here years ago, like I did. 
LEON Let's play "Rate the Moment". I give tonight an eightyseven. Better than sex, not as good as racquetball. 
INT. GYM OFFICE 
Dolores has left. Walter lays out lines of cocaine on the back of the clipboard, as Carol watches. 
WALTER The best thing about being a dentist. Pure pharmaceutical grade. A couple of lines of this, I can drill my own teeth... (looks at her for a moment) Hi. 
CAROL Hi. 
INT. GYM  INTERCUT - SERIES OF SHOTS 
SERIOUS MAN (to his wife) Joe would have enjoyed this. God, I still miss him. 
MADDY (to Carol) Peggy was a mess right after they separated, but I think she's coming out of it... It seems to be pretty friendly now.. 
CAROL Sometimes it's easier when you hate them. 
GREASY DRUNK CREEP I can't remember. Did I make it with you in high school? 
LISA Doesn't it feel like it was yesterday? 
TERRY Youth is like an amputated leg. Long after it's gone, you still feel it. 
SAME BEARDED MAN My wife's a cow, my son has shit for brains, and my daughter's in India with Mother Teresa. 
WOMAN My husband's a pig. But my son's in social work and my daughter, God bless her, is in India with Mother Teresa. 
LEON For the fitness generation, we've sure got a lot of porkers. 
SANDY I don't remember anything about the seventies. 
LISA Breaking up was horrible. I said we had a very special attachment, he said, so does a Hoover. 
LEON I don't know why I came back. I hated high school. 
The group around him all answer "So did I" or "Me too." 
ROSALIE I enjoyed it. 
INT. GYM NEAR WALL 
Peggy (loose, holding a drink) and Sharon stand in front of a PHOTO of the 1960 Cross Country Team. 
VIEW ON PHOTO - off to one side stands MICHAEL FITZSIMMONS. His hair is longer, his gaze intense and nonsmiling. 
SHARON Who's the one with the hair? 
PEGGY Michael Fitzsimmons. I had such a crush on him. 
Carol and Maddy join them, still panting from dancing. 
CAROL Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance. 
PEGGY Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left? 
CAROL Who knows. Remember... (a beat) Whatever Walter wants... 
CAROL, PEGGY AND MADDY (laughing) Walter Getz. 
PEGGY Sharon Norvik this is Carol Heath, and Maddy Nagle. My oldest and dearest friends. Sharon's married to Richard. 
CAROL Lucky lady. Hi. 
MADDY (looking at the photo) Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here? 
PEGGY No. I asked Rosalie. She couldn't track him down. 
CAROL. Too bad. 
SHARON He must have been quite a guy. 
PEGGY He was the only one in high school I wished I'd gone to bed with. 
CAROL The only one? 
PEGGY Well, besides Charlie, of course. 
We HOLD on the photo of Michael and... 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. GYM  LATER 
The BAND is PLAYING AND SINGING the SONG, "JUST BECAUSE." 
Arthur places the gold cardboard crown on Richard's head as they shake hands. 
RICHARD Sharon and I thank you all for making us feel so welcome. It's good to be back. 
MORE APPLAUSE as Richard steps back. 
ARTHUR Every king deserves a queen. Now, we had a Lot at worthwhile candidates. And I don't want any of you ladies to feel left out, 'cause you're all beautiful. But when we sent out the invitations, we didn't mention anything about this being a costume party. 
Peggy's embarrassed reaction, realizing everyone's looking at her. 
ARTHUR Maybe we should have, 'cause just looking at her brings it all back for us. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our queen, Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell. Come on up here, Peggy Sue. 
The band begins the song PEGGY SUE. Peggy looks pained. She doesn't move. 
CAROL They're waiting. Come on. 
PEGGY (close to tears) I can't. It's all too much. 
CAROL Go on. You can do it. 
Charlie and Beth stand together: Beth is worried about Peggy. CAMERA TRACKS Peggy as she haltingly makes her way to the stage. As she does, she notices another blow-up on the wall: 
Peggy and Charlie, as King and Queen of the 1960 prom. Arthur gives the crown to Richard who places it on Peggy's head. He kisses her cheek and stands back, beaming. 
PEGGY (into mike, overwhelmed) Thank you.. Thank you very much. 
The lights dim, leaving Peggy in the spotlight. Continued APPLAUSE as the singer steps up to his mike and begins to SING the song PEGGY SUE. 
PEGGY ON STAGE  INTERCUT WITH HER POV 
People starting to clap and sing along. Carol and Carol's POV: a blowup on the wall of Carol in the senior play. Walter and. Walter's POV: a photo of Walter on the basketball team. People leaving their tables, surging towards the stage, drawn by the music. Maddy and Maddy's POV: a photo of Maddy and friends mugging for the camera in the cafeteria. Charlie talking to Carol. 
Peggy begins to cry softly. The images begin to melt together, pulsing to the music. Peggy is the focus of everyone's nostalgia. A wave of time washes over them. 
She remains onstage, looking past the crowd to the photo of her and Charlie. 
Peggy onstage, eyes closed, swaying to the music. Walter and Carol join hands, walking towards the stage. Rosalie in her wheelchair, doing the hand jive, crying. 
The entire crowd swaying to the music, looking to Peggy, repeating the chorus over and over. 
Beth notices her mother's state of emotion. Peggy collapses onstage. We hear SHOUTS and SCREAMS. Richard, Arthur and several others crowd over Peggy. Beth rushes to the stage, reaching out to her mother. Charlie too. 
MUSIC STOPS. 
INT. GYM - ECU A THIN TUBE FILLED WITH BLOOD INSERTED 
INTO PEGGY'S ARM - DAY 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE Peggy lying on a cot. She wears the same dress she had on at the reunion. She's terrified. We NEAR a smattering of background noises: NAMES are CALLED, NURSES helping, etc. Looking up she sees: The IV. 
The NURSE taking the IV out of her arm, and placing a vial of blood on a tray with several others. Peggy sits up slowly, dazed and frightened. She looks at the nurse. 
NURSE Would you like your Twinkie now? 
Peggy takes the Twinkie, staring at it blankly. Looking around she SEES students giving blood to the Red Cross. Several have tubes in their arms. Nurses attend to them. 
Carol sits up drinking a cup of juice, waving weakly at Peggy. Maddy, now a brunette, slowly rolls down her sleeve. Arthur, Dolores, Walter and several others from the reunion. Everyone is younger but instantly recognizable.. 
Charlie walks over to Peggy. He grins at her, revealing wax vampire fangs in his mouth, hair Brylcreemed to death. 
CHARLIE I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie. 
PEGGY Charlie! Am I dead? 
CHARLIE No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. (normal voice) Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway. 
Mechanically, Peggy hands over the Twinkie. Charlie bends over to nuzzle her neck. The nurse's hand COMES INTO FRAME and grabs Charlie by the scruff of the neck, pulling him up. 
NURSE Young man, stop that. 
The SCHOOL BELL RINGS. 
CHARLIE Hey! I just made a deposit in your blood bank. Now I want to make a withdrawal. 
NURSE I think it's time for your next class - 
CHARLIE I'm changing banks! 
Charlie walks away towards Walter and Arthur. Peggy gazes after him, his body blocking her view of a portion of a banner hung on the wall. It reads: "Support the Buchanan High Blood Drive..." As Charlie exits, the final words come into view: 
"Spring 1960." Peggy gasps. She begins to tremble. 
NURSE Lie back down and take a deep breath. 
PEGGY What's going on? Where am I? 
Peggy embraces her mother, holding on for dear life, inhaling her scent. 
PEGGY Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home. 
MRS. KELCHER Of course, dear. You're home now. 
PEGGY I'm home now. 
INT. PEGGY'S ROOM 
Peggy enters warily, looking around, a fifties museum of teenage artifacts. She walks around the room gently touching her old belongings including the record player from opening scene. She looks in the mirror to make sure she's still there. Suddenly, she turns around. 
PEGGY Okay, I'm alone now. Is anyone here? 
She opens the closet door expectantly, then closes it shaking her head. 
PEGGY No. This is crazy. Is somebody going to tell me what's going on? Why me? What happened? You don't have to show up. I don't have to see you. Just send me a sign. (beat) Thanks a lot. 1 guess I'm on my own. 
NANCY, Peggy's twelveyearold sister, peeks in the room. 
PEGGY Nancy! Come here. 
Nancy tentatively approaches. Peggy hugs her. 
NANCY What are you doing? 
PEGGY I'm just happy to see you. 
NANCY Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me. 
PEGGY I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life. 
NANCY Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest. 
PEGGY Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders? 
NANCY (suspicious) Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do? 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
On a small black and white TV, Dick Clark introduces a spotlight dance. Peggy and Nancy are sitting on the sofa, watching. Nancy is eating small candies, like M&M's. 
PEGGY It's unbelievable. The man never ages. 
NANCY Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great. 
PEGGY Don't eat the red ones. 
NANCY Why not? They're my favorite. 
PEGGY They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. (red dye *2) 
Nancy react, as Peggy stands. CAMERA TRACKS HER to the den. 
DEN 
Peggy opens the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle of Scotch and a glass, noticing the family photos on the wall.. 
PEGGY Can't hurt. I'm already dead. 
She belts down several drinks. 
NANCY (Q.S.) Peggy Sue! Hurry up. Fabian! 
Peggy steadies herself as CAMERA TRACKS her back into the living room. 
LIVING ROOM 
Peggy collapses on the naugahyde recliner. Unexpectedly, it leans back, shooting Peggy's legs up. 
MRS. KELCHER (from the kitchen) I put your laundry on your beds. Don't forget to put it away. 
NANCY What's for dinner? 
MRS. KELCHER Meatloaf. 
NANCY Yeech, not again. 
Peggy leans forward in the recliner eating the candies. Bemused, she looks at Nancy watching TV and into the kitchen where her mother is slapping together meatloaf. 
ANGLE - HALLWAY - THE FRONT DOOR OPENS 
JACK KELCHER Peggy's father, enters the hallway. 
MR. KELCHER Girls? Evelyn? Who left this thing outside? 
Mrs. Kelcher takes an elastic band from around the faucet and hands it to Peggy as she sits at the table. Peggy makes a ponytail. 
MRS. KELCHER You're looking pretty chipper this morning. 
PEGGY I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today. (beat) Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health. 
MR. KELCHER Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again. 
PEGGY That would be impossible. 
MR. KELCHER You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits. 
PEGGY Mom, is there any coffee left? 
Mrs. Kelcher begins to pour the coffee, then pulls back, spilling some on Mr. Kelcher. 
MRS. KELCHER When did you start drinking coffee? 
PEGGY Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it. 
MR. KELCHER If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too? 
PEGGY I think I'm way ahead of them. 
NANCY Pass the toast, please. 
Peggy passes Nancy the toast. 
NANCY And the butter. 
PEGGY You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself. 
MR. KELCHER Well, at least you stopped calling me DaddyO. 
NANCY (correcting him) DADDYo. 
PEGGY Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this. 
NANCY Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret? (silence) Well? 
MRS. KELCHER How does Diane like her braces? 
R31.NCY She hates them. Nobody likes braces. Thy just call you junkyard face and Miss Metal Mouth. I gotta go. 
Nancy jumps up, grabbing her lunch on the counter, as she exits. "GOODBYES' all around. We HEAR a HORN HONKING outside  a fivenote musical phrase  BEBOPALUBOP. 
PEGGY Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him? 
MRS. KELCHER What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?. 
PEGGY Sort of. 
MRS. KELCHER What about? 
PEGGY The house payments. 
EXT. KELCHER HOUSE 
Peggy exits the house wincing at the sight of Charlie's car, the blue Impala she'd seen the day before. Charlie sits, one arm on the wheel, the other over the back of the seat. 
CHARLIE How do you feel? 
PEGGY Pretty strange. 
Peggy hesitates, unsure how to handle her accumulated ambivalence towards Charlie. 
CHARLIE Come on. Get in. I can take care of that. 
Peggy warily gets in. Charlie leans over to kiss her, but she pushes him away. No dice. 
PEGGY Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years. 
CHARLIE Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today. 
Charlie starts the car, burns rubber and peels out. 
PEGGY You drive like a maniac! 
CHARLIE I call this the staccato. (does tricks) 
INT. CHARLIE'S CAR  DAY - DRIVING 
CHARLIE (earnest) Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night. 
PEGGY Oh yeah? 
Peggy hasn't understood a word. 
RICHARD And then, there's Richard's Burrito. 
PEGGY What's that? 
RICHARD That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland. 
PEGGY I	know what a burrito is. 
RICHARD Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other. 
PEGGY What's inside? 
RICHARD You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes 
PEGGY So you think time travel is possible? For people? 
RICHARD Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants. 
PEGGY Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise? 
RICHARD Okay. I promise. 
PEGGY This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years. 
RICHARD You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me. 
PEGGY. No. Really. You're the smartest person I know. It sounds unbelievable. But I can prove it. 
RICHARD Oh yeah? 
PEGGY You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things. 
RICHARD How, did you know about my grandfather? 
PEGGY Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 
RICHARD Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule! 
EXT. STREET 
Peggy and Richard are walking, carrying their books. 
RICHARD But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it? 
PEGGY I don't know. 
Oblivious, Peggy and Richard walk by Shower's Cafe. Inside, Dolores and Carol see them. 
EXT. ANOTHER STREET  APPROACHING RICHARD'S HOUSE 
RICHARD I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain. 
PEGGY That's why I was getting a divorce.. (beat) What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died. 
EXT. RICHARD'S DRIVEWAY 
RICHARD You look pretty good for a corpse. 
PEGGY Come on, Richard, I'm serious. 
RICHARD You're giving me the creeps. 
PEGGY Am I dead or not? 
RICHARD There's one way to find out. 
Richard stops and throws down his books. He steps in front of Peggy, throwing down her books, dragging her to the curb. 
PEGGY What're you doing? 
RICHARD Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door. 
A large truck speeds towards them. 
RICHARD Step in front of the truck! If you're dead, it won't matter. The truck'll go right through you. Go ahead! You're dead! 
Peggy takes one step off the curb. The truck is getting closer. The truck BLOWS A LOUD SUSTAINED WAIL. 
PEGGY No! I don't want to die! 
INT. RICHARD'S GARAGE 
A completely outfitted laboratory, kites decorate the walls. 
MRS. KELCHER Peggy, do you know what a penis is? (Peggy's jaw drops) Stay away from it. 
EXT. KELCHER HOUSE  NIGHT 
Charlie pulls up to the curb, opens the glove compartment, extracts a can of Old Spice aerosol, sprays the seat; and exits his car, throwing a kiss to it as he walks up to the door. 
CLOSER VIEW 
He's wearing a hideous orange and turquoise sweater. 
INT. KELCHER HOUSE  HALLWAY 
Mr. Kelcher opens the door, Charlie enters. 
MR. KELCHER Hello, Charlie. 
CHARLIE Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store? 
MR. KELCHER Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you. 
CAMERA TRACKS Charlie and Mr. Kelcher into the living room. Mr. Kelcher sits on his recliner, Charlie, nervous, on the couch. Nancy is on the rug, studying. 
MR. KELCHER You may have noticed that Peggy Sue's been acting a little strange lately. 
NANCY She's distorted. 
CHARLIE Yes, sir. 
MR. KELCHER She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes. 
NANCY She's almost a juvenile delinquent. 
Mr. Kelcher gives Nancy a look and points to the door. Without her father noticing, Nancy creeps up behind him and makes rabbit ears behind his head. Charlie tries hard not to laugh. Nancy continues to clown. 
CHARLIE Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school. 
MR. KELCHER Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter. 
CHARLIE Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands. 
Mr. Kelcher looks as if he's witnessing the latest attack of teenage weirdness. 
INT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM 
Peggy is changing a record. She sees the dress she was wearing the day before (and at the reunion) slung across a chair. As Peggy picks it up, a book of matches falls out. Peggy picks it up, excited. 
INSERT: MATCHBOOK which reads: FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR SPARE TIME. Peggy frantically searches the dress pockets and slowly draws out two joints. She stares at them for a beat. 
PEGGY (worrying) Oh, Beth. 
There's a knock at the door. Peggy quickly hides the joints. Mrs. Kelcher opens the door. 
MRS. KELCHER Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready? 
PEGGY For what? 
MRS. KELCHER Maddy's party. 
PEGGY I don't feel very festive. 
MRS. KELCHER You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares. 
Peggy laughs. 
MRS. KELCHER Enjoy yourself! This is the best time of your life. And the sooner you learn to handle Charlie the better. Get dressed. 
Mrs. Kelcher closes the door. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
MR. KELCHER We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you. 
CHARLIE What would that be, sir? 
MR. KELCHER Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself. 
CHARLIE (surprised) Of course. 
ANGLE ON PEGGY 
walking downstairs, surprised by Charlie and Dad talking. 
EXT. KELCHER HOUSE - NIGHT 
Peggy and Charlie exit and walk towards his car. Peggy's holding a pan of Rice Krispie squares. Charlie slips Peggy's sweater back on her shoulder. He's trying hard to make up. 
PEGGY You know, I never could figure that one out. 
INT. BASEMENT - ANOTHER ANGLE 
Maddy, Arthur, Walter, Carol, Charlie and Peggy sit on a couch. Maddy and Carol sit in their boyfriends' laps. Peggy sits distractedly on the couch arm. They cross talk  boys to boys  girls to girls. 
MADDY I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids. 
WALTER The Yanks got the hitting but the Sox got the defense. 
CAROL What are your colors, going to be? 
ARTHUR I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson over Fox and Aparicio. 
MADDY I'm thinking of pink and green. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Dolores and Terry standing in a corner kissing passionately. 
MADDY (CONT'D.) Look at Dolores. What a tramp. 
CHARLIE Pitching wins pennants. The Tigers got four potential twenty game winners. 
CAROL You'd be surprised at how many girls in school aren't virgins. 
WALTER AND ARTHUR (to Carol) Like who? 
CHARLIE Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning and Paul Foytack. 
INT. BASEMENT  LATER 
ARTHUR And now, direct from three weeks of rehearsal in Walter's garage, four guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing group in the world... (beat) Charlie, Walter, Leon and Terry. The Definitions. 
Applause as the group enters from the furnace room. They all wear black pants and iridescent sharkskin jackets. Charlie is in the center of the group as they position themselves. 
CHARLIE One, two, three-... 
The group begins to SING an A CAPELLA version of RAMA LAMA DING DONG (or I WONDER WHY). Charlie sings lead, backed up by the other three. Walter dances insane, Temptationlike steps. The crowd huddles around them, clapping and grooving. Peggy is on the planet of lost innocence, removed and melancholy. 
CAROL Charlie really has a great voice. 
MADDY Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts. 
PEGGY Don't get your hopes up. 
MADDY Come on, where's your enthusiasm? 
Charlie SINGS directly to Peggy, grinning at her. In spite of herself, she smiles back at him. She's starting to realize why she fell in love with him. He's irresistible. 
PEGGY He is kind of cute, isn't he? 
CAROL Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are. 
PEGGY He does? 
The group finishes the song. Charlie blows Peggy a kiss. The crowd APPLAUDS, including Peggy. Dolores joins Peggy, Carol and Maddy. 
DOLORES Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today. 
PEGGY First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out. 
DOLORES God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends. 
PEGGY Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion. 
DOLORES Are you for real? 
PEGGY Touchy, touchy! 
Dolores storms away. 
MADDY (to Peggy) I don't know what you said to her, but I wish I'd said it. 
Charlie and Walter walk over and accept "BRAVOS" from the girls. Walter does his James Dean imitation. 
PEGGY Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik? 
CHARLIE Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff? 
PEGGY He's trying. 
CHARLIE Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry? 
PEGGY (charmed) Come on, let's dance. 
PEGGY At my age? Don't be silly. 
MR. KELCHER Thank God for that. 
PEGGY Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young? 
MR. KELCHER Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay. 
PEGGY Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please. 
MR. KELCHER All right. But this better be good. 
PEGGY I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell. 
MR. KELCHER Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government. 
PEGGY I think they're going to deregulate it. 
MR. KELCHER That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into. 
PEGGY Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school. 
MR. KELCHER I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room! 
PEGGY Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox! 
MR. KELCHER Evelyn, take her to her room! 
Peggy stalks out of the kitchen to the front door. 
MRS. KELCHER I'm not the maid! 
PEGGY Way to go, Mom! 
The Kelchers glare at each other~. We HEAR the DOOR SLAM. 
INT. SHOWER'S CAFE  DAY 
Peggy and Richard sit in a booth. Richard's kite is hung on a coat rack. 
RICHARD The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world. 
PEGGY I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here. 
RICHARD But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents? 
PEGGY I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me. 
RICHARD I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help! 
PEGGY Richard, take it easy. 
RICHARD No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you... 
PEGGY How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people? 
RICHARD I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them. 
PEGGY Give me some credit, will you? 
RICHARD Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner. 
PEGGY Wbat're you talking about? 
RICHARD Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty. 
PEGGY Sixtyforty. 
RI CHARD That's not fair. 
PEGGY Okay, find yourself another vision. 
RICHARD You're taking advantage of a minor. 
PEGGY When do we start? 
A WAITRESS approaches their table. 
WAITRESS Do you know what you want? 
RICHARD A Ton on a Bun, with fries. 
WAITRESS And you? 
PEGGY Quiche Lorraine, spinach salad and a Perrier. 
INT. LISTENING BOOTH 
Peggy sits on the chair. A turntable sits on a small desk. Record covers decorate the walls. Charlie enters and sits on the desk, his feet resting on Peggy's chair. 
PEGGY What do you know about classical music? 
CHARLIE Nothing.. Selling is selling. 
PEGGY Charlie. About last nights.. 
CHARLIE Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts. 
PEGGY But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand. 
CHARLIE Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why? 
PEGGY Why? 
Charlie cups her face in his hands, pouring out his heart. 
CHARLIE Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you. 
PEGGY What am I going to do with you? 
CHARLIE Don't be cruel to a heart that's true. 
INT. KELCHER HAT STORE KELCHER'S HATS - LATE AFTERNOON 
Alone in the store, Mr. Kelcher is going through some receipts. Peggy enters carrying a shopping bag. 
PEGGY Hi, Dad. 
MR. KELCHER Doing some shopping? 
Peggy reaches into the shopping bag and pulls out a small wrapped box. 
MR. KELCHER For me? 
PEGGY Open it. 
He opens the present.  Inside are a pair of miniature golf ball cufflinks. 
MR. KELCHER Sweetheart, they're beautiful. But they must've been expensive. 
Across the street an ice cream truck pulls up. Mothers, fathers and children crowd around the back as the driver exit the cab. 
PEGGY I closed my Christmas club. 
MR. KELCHER Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank. 
PEGGY I wanted to apologize for this morning. 
MR. KELCHER It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. (looks out the window) Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up. 
PEGGY Quiet today? 
MR. KELCHER This morning was good. 
PEGGY The hat business is in trouble. 
MR. KELCHER I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business? 
PEGGY Yes. 
MR. KELCHER That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up. 
PEGGY But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats. 
MR. KELCHER Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win. 
PEGGY (gravely; closing her eyes) He'll win. 
MR. KELCHER Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats. 
INT. NANCY'S ROOM 
Peggy is helping her sister Nancy with an art project. 
NANCY You think this'll cheer Dad up? 
PEGGY Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist. 
We HEAR Mr. Kelcher arguing loudly from downstairs. The two girls freeze. 
MR. KELCHER (O.S.) I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that? 
Richard kneels on top of Peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the buttons at her breasts. Peggy comes to, as Richard jumps off. She buttons her blouse, furious. 
PEGGY Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself. 
RICHARD Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you. 
PEGGY That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back? 
RICHARD I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest. 
PEGGY God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here? 
Peggy grabs a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall. 
RICHARD Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis. 
PEGGY Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out. 
Peggy storms out. 
INT. KELCHER HOUSE 
Mrs. Kelcher stands at the counter preparing a pot roast. Peggy's making a chocolate mousse. 
MRS. KELCHER You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you. 
PEGGY Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta? 
MRS KELCHER What's pasta? 
INT. KELCHER DINING ROOM 
Peggy and Mrs. Kelcher are setting the table, taking the good china out of the cabinet. A dozen red roses grace the table. 
MRS. KELCHER These roses are beautiful. And so romantic'. Who is this Michael? Is he a friend of Charlie's? 
She moves the Jell-O mold. 
PEGGY No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO. 
MRS. KELCHER What does Charlie think about that? 
PEGGY You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie. 
MRS. KELCHER (shocked) What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married. 
PEGGY Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school? 
MRS  KELCHER Of course I loved your Lather. I remember once being offered a scholarship to art school. But I turned it down. 
PEGGY Why? 
MRS. KELCHER All the college girls I knew were so well, dressed. I was worried that I wouldn't fit in. I didn't have the right clothes. I was so silly. But, I don't have many regrets, and besides, r don't have time to worry about the past. But Charlie. I hope you know what you're doing. 
INT. DINING ROOM  TWO HOURS LATER 
Michael, DORIS and ED FITZSIMMONS sit at the table with the Kelchers. They have just finished dessert. 
MR. FITZSIMMONS Moose?  I never thought I'd have moose for desert. 
The adults laugh. Michael looks bored. 
MR. KELCHER Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner. 
NANCY But Mom helped. 
MR. FITZSIMMONS You know, you should open a restaurant. 
PEGGY It's incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business. You have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market, you have problems with spoilage, employee pilferage, and just try and collect from the credit card companies. They take months to pay. 
The whole table is astonished. 
MR. FITZSIMMONS How does a young gal like you know so much about business? 
PEGGY Oh, I just picked it up from my dad. He's a wonderful businessman. 
MR. FITZSIMMONS Really? 
Peggy gives her father a go get him look. Michael's writing in a pocket notebook. 
MR. KELCHER Ah, Ed, why don't you and I adjourn to the den for a while? 
EXT. KELCHER HOUSE 
Peggy~ and Michael stand by Michael's motorcycle, passing a cigarette. 
MICHAEL I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something. 
PEGGY What? 
MICHAEL My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook. 
INT. KELCHER KITCHEN 
Mrs. Kelcher finishes the dishes, with rubber gloves on. Mr. Kelcher sits, cleaning his pipe. Peggy enters. 
PEGGY How did it go with the pantyhose? 
MR. KELCHER It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now. 
PEGGY Oh no! 
MR. KELCHER Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn? 
MRS. KELCHER Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards. 
PEGGY He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit. 
MR. KELCHER Peggy Sue, watch your mouth. 
MRS. KELCHER Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man. 
PEGGY Oh, you're both so naive. 
MR. KELCHER Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool! 
MRS. KELCHER You have a point, dear. 
INT. PEGGY'S ROOM 
(POSS. OMIT THIS SCENE) 
Peggy lies in bed in the darkness, her eyes wide open. The bedside clock reads: 2:47. Peggy gets out of bed. 
CAMERA TRACKS Peggy into Nancy's room. Peggy looks down at Nancy sleeping. Gently pulling back the blankets, Peggy gets into bed with her. 
EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET  MORNING 
Peggy walks down a residential street, much like her parents'. She stops when she sees Charlie's car parked in a driveway, and leans against a tree next to his car. Moments later, Charlie exits his house, a dog trailing behind him. The dog runs up to Peggy. Charlie is wary and distant. 
CHARLIE What're you doing here? 
PEGGY I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... (pats dog) Good dog, Rusty. Good dog. 
CHARLIE Rusty's dead. That's Ajax 
Charlie throws a stick. Ajax chases it, never comes back. 
PEGGY Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. (beat) Could you give me a ride to school? 
CHARLIE Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while. 
PEGGY Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell.. 
CHARLIE How'd you know about that? 
PEGGY I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific. 
CHARLIE Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with? 
PEGGY What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group. 
CHARLIE Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other. 
Charlie and Peggy walking. 
PEGGY I'd forgotten how much music meant to you. 
CHARLIE That's real big of you. 
PEGGY Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you. 
CHARLIE You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why? 
Peggy takes a piece of paper from her purse. 
PEGGY Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest. 
CHARLIE Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it. 
PEGGY Just take a look at it. (hands him the lyric) 
PEGGY But accidents can happen. 
ROSALIE Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics. 
PEGGY Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop. 
ROSALIE You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis. 
Rosalie exits into the pool area. Peggy feels helpless. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Peggy walks down the hall, a set of double doors, leading to the pool, just ahead of her through them she sees Rosalie diving through the air with the careless innocence of youth. 
Burdened with the inevitability of it all, she rushes through the hall, and is stopped by Richard. 
RICHARD What's the matter? 
PEGGY It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out. 
RICHARD Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip. 
PEGGY You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here. 
She starts to walk away. 
RICHARD Peggy, I believe you. I believe everything you told me. It's wonderful. You're the exception that proves the rule. 
She kisses him on the forehead. 
PEGGY I love you too, Richard. Thanks for trying. 
She continues down the hallway. 
EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Peggy heads out the door, sees Charlie. 
CHARLIE Hey, Peggy. Wait a minute. 
Peggy stops on the landing. Charlie joins her, so eager. He doesn't notice how distraught she is. 
CHARLIE I cut shop and did some work on your song. You know, it's not half bad for your first try. Of course, I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs". Listen to this. 
Charlie begins to sing an R&B version of SHE LOVES YOU. 
PEGGY Forget it, it'll never work. 
CHARLIE Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres. 
Walter, Arthur, Maddy and Carol watch as Peggy runs away. 
INT./EXT. BUS OR TRAIN - HIGHWAY 
INTERCUT the bus, Peggy looking out the window, the rural scenery: pastures, barns, etc., the other passengers. 
EXT. STATION 
Peggy's grandparents, ELIZABETH and BARNEY ALVORG , wait in the front of the station. 
INT. BUS 
Peggy sees her grandparents waiting for her.  She grips the window rail tightly, trying to hold herself together. 
BUS DRIVER Everybody gettin' off at Dumont. Here we are. 
Peggy stands and reaches above to take down her suitcase. Nervous, she drops it. A MAN, getting off the bus, helps her, picking it up. 
PEGGY Thank you. 
MAN No trouble at all. 
The man gets off the bus. 
EXT. GENERAL STORE 
Peggy stands at the door of the bus, hesitant. Elizabeth and Barney approach the bus, waving and smiling up at her. 
BARNEY Hello, Lilla! 
ELIZABETH Peggy Sue! 
Peggy slowly walks down the steps, moved to tears. She approaches her grandparents and drops her suitcases. She hugs them tightly. The bus door closes and the bus pulls away behind them. 
INT. CAR  DRIVING 
ELIZABETH He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late. 
BARNEY Let's go. 
PEGGY (hugging Elizabeth) Goodbye, Grandma. 
ELIZABETH Have a good time. 
Barney and Peggy open the door and exit. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE DRIVEWAY 
Peggy and Barney approach the car. 
PEGGY What does Grandma think you do at your meetings? 
BARNEY Stag movies. Smokers. 
Peggy chuckles as they get into the car. The car proceeds along the driveway and turns onto the highway. 
INT. CAR  DRIVING 
Barney is at the wheel. 
BARNEY I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you. 
PEGGY I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. (beat) Has it ever worked before? 
BARNEY The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one. 
INT. LODGE - NIGHT 
A onestory, pitchroof building. The sign over the entrance reads.: THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN. Underneath the sign is a logo of a spreading sunrise. Peggy and Barney pull up to the front, exit the car and enter the building. 
INT. LODGE  ANTEROOM 
Thirty old men are congregating around the cloak room. Most are already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise logo over their hearts. They either wear or carry tricorner hats. Peggy and Barney enter. Several men approach them. Peggy nervously clings to Barney' s arm. 
GEORGE Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to have you with us. 
PEGGY Thank you. 
HENRY You know, you're a lucky girl. You could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather. 
PEGGY Ah... thank you. 
BARNEY Let me take your jacket, Lilla. I've got, to get my robe. 
Peggy hands him her jacket as he heads over to the cloak, room. 
AL You know, this is very exciting for all of us. 
GEORGE We've been waiting a long time for someone like you. 
Barney rejoins them, wearing his hat and robe. The group begins to enter the main room. 
PEGGY (nervous) Do you have to wear that hat? 
BARNEY It wouldn't be a lodge without hats. 
Barney takes her hand and squeezes it. They walk slowly through the doorway. 
BARNEY Don't you worry. I'll be watching after you. 
INT. LODGE  MAIN ROOM 
A large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit with fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, gold painted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders, with lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front of the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth". 
Peggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from Barney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her shoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne. 
HENRY Hey, George. Get the lights. 
The LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles. 
The men form a semicircle around Peggy. Old men at the end of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose. The men rejoin the line. 
LEO COOPER, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps forward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant. 
LEO (to Peggy) Are you ready, dear? 
PEGGY Yes, sir. 
Leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms. 
PEGGY Fasten your seat belts. Here we go. 
CHARLIE It opens, too. Look inside. 
Peggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition. 
INSERT - LOCKET 
Two photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children. 
PEGGY Scott and Beth. Where did you get these? 
CHARM E Who's Scott and Beth? Your mother gave me our picture. That's you and me. 
PEGGY So are Scott and Beth. 
Peggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him, holding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their foreheads touching. 
CHARLIE (tenderly) I love you. 
PEGGY I know. 
Charlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the ground. HOLD on the locket, and... 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. ON THE HILL - LATER 
Charlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash of lightning streaks across the sky. 
CHARLIE I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain. 
PEGGY (musing) Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed? 
CHARLIE What the hell is that? 
Flying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon kite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing like a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE. 
The kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her feet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to sail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her. 
CHARLIE Peggy! Where're you going? Come back! 
PEGGY I've got to go now. 
CHARLIE But I love you. I'll love you forever. 
PEGGY I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years. 
CHARLIE Come back to me. 
PEGGY I'm trying. 
As Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning strikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run outside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy floating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and blows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite cord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain the runaway kite. 
CHARLIE Richard, do something! 
RICHARD I can't! It's out of control! 
Suddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away. 
CHARLIE Peggy! 
Charlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and dipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's VOICE singing "Peggy Sue" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the blackness. In an instant she becomes a star. 
FINAL SCENE 
DISSOLVE/OPTICAL 
HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
Moving from two to C.U. Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the cake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect: 'Your heart stopped for a while..." Father's voice: 'You're a very lucky young lady...' Doctor: 'A (explain) of the head...' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right now, the paramedics got there...' Mom, 'We were so worried..." 
Echoing of, until once voice is left. Charlie. Sitting opposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness. He looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy Sue' for her. 
CHARLIE (singing softly). Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue... 
PEGGY Charlie? Was I dead? 
CHARLIE I thought you were...for a while. 
PEGGY (affectionately) You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old. 
CHARLIE But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue. 
PEGGY Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you. 
CHARLIE I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.

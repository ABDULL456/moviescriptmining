2	EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY 
TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the jukebox we hear one of her songs. 
The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN. 
There are several people at the counter with him, including GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them. 
A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full or dishes. This is WADE. 
WADE (to SUELEEN) You want a ride into town? 
They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

TOM You ladies got room for a spare? 
STEW Sure. 
14B	NEW ANGLE 
L.A. JOAN is left in the dust. 
L.A. JOAN 'Bye... nice talking to you. 
GREEN sees his niece and walks over. 
GREEN Joan? 
She turns. 
L.A. JOAN Did you see who that was? 
GREEN Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too. 
L.A. JOAN He is just wonderful. 
GREEN I'1l get your bag. 
CUT TO: 
15	EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY 
GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps close to NORMAN. 
GLENN Am I late? 
NORMAN Late!  Oh, Jesus! 
He runs off. 
16	ANOTHER ANGLE 
As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all shake hands. 
HAVEN Delbert, how are you? 
REESE I'm fine. This here is John Triplette. Triplette, like you to meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven Hamilton. 
HAVEN Good to meet you. (turns to BUD) Bud, have them move the horses. 
TRIPLETTE Pleasure 
REESE Where is she? 
HAVEN Still inside the plane posing for pictures and signing autographs. She's got a new album cut again. She'll be down in a minute. But she'll be late for the Opera if she doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on the walkie-talkie. 
BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get anything. 
BUD They don't seem to be answering. The ambulance boys are here, though. Barnett always expects them to get there like a shot. That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going. 
HAVEN Thank you, Bud. 
BUD nods like he has been complimented. 
17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE 
A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in awe of the situation. 
TRIPLETTE Oh -- 
REESE We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him? 
TRIPLETTE Well, I really think he's got a chance. 
REESE You do? 
TRIPLETTE Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new. 
REESE He ain't really new. 
TRIPLETTE He is to a lot of people. 
REESE He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago. 
TRIPLETTE You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority. 
REESE Where are you from? 
TRIPLETTE Southern California. 
REESE You always live there? 
TRIPLETTE Spent time in Arizona. Why? 
REESE Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars? 
TRIPLETTE I know a couple. 
REESE No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who? 
TRIPLETTE Ah... Peter Finch. 
REESE Who? 
TRIPLETTE Peter Finch -- he's English. 
REESE I never heard of him. Name somebody else. 
TRIPLETTE Ryan O'Neal. 
REESE You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them? 
TRIPLETTE Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff. 
REESE I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something? 
TRIPLETTE Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here. 
REESE I'll be dammed. 
CUT TO: 
33	AIRPORT BUS 
GLENN is at the window. "Connie White" ads are present. 
34	MOBILE HOME 
Part of normal traffic. It belongs to TOMMY BROWN, who lounges with four very black associates, playing serious poker. 
35	INT. LINNEA'S CAR 
Joining the procession from an auxiliary route. With her is OPAL, who interviews LINNEA. 
OPAL Have your children been deaf since birth? 
LINNEA Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here. 
OPAL When did you start singing? 
LINNEA When I was little, in church. 
OPAL Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir? 
LINNEA Yes, it is -- 
OPAL Well, can you tell me why? 
LINNEA It just is. 
The TRICYCLE MAN works his way through traffic. STAR has climbed from his truck and goes to help. ALBUQUESQUE takes advantage and runs off. 
41	ANGLE NEAR KENNY'S CAR 
It overheats and explodes. KENNY gets out, carrying his violin case and starts to walk. ALBUQUERQUE spots him and steps near. 
ALBUQUERQUE Hey, mind if I walk with ya? 
She looks at his violin case. 
ALBUQUERQUE You a musician? 
KENNY No. 
ALBUQUERQUE Do you have people in Nashville? 
KENNY No -- Just coming to Nashville, that's all. 
42	INT. AMBULANCE 
BARNETT is in a rage. The ATTENDANTS administer oxygen to BARBARA JEAN 
BARNETT I don't care. I pay you people twenty-five bucks an hour and keep you working steady. Now either go on or turn around. But move. 
43	EXT. HIGHWAY 
The ambulance passes all the vehicles, including the horse rigs. As he passes NORMAN'S limo: 
MARY Don't worry, Norman. There's no blood. Nobody's hurt. 
She climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells for some workmen below to call the police. 
44	ANGLE AT DIESEL 
The driver is hurt badly. TRICYCLE MAN and STAR are there. STAR looks up, relieved an ambulance is coming. His face drops as the ambulance speeds past and toward the city. 
45	ANGLE FURTHER BACK IN TRAFFIC 
ALBUQUERQUE is walking with KENNY. She sees STAR returning to his truck. She ducks into the ivy. 
ALBUQUERQUE Hurt my foot... 
STAR approaches his truck, sees ALBUQUERQUE is gone and spots KSNNY. 
STAR Have you seen a woman about so high? 
KENNY No. 
STAR She had on high heels? 
KENNY No. 
STAR Need a ride? 
KENNY nods "yes" and climbs in the pickup. 
46	ANGLE AT BRIDGE 
People are helping the injured driver. TRICYCLE MAN climbs on his machine and leaves, heading toward Nashville. 
CUT TO: 
47	INT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON 
BARBARA JEAN is in bed. A DOCTOR is there, along with a crowd of publicity people and well-wishers, including: TRIPLETTE, REESE, BUD. BARNETT hovers over BARBARA JEAN. The atmosphere is stifling. 
DOCTOR Barbara, I'd like to talk to you and Barnett alone. 
BARNETT Anything you say. 
He turns to the visitors. 
BARNETT Doctor says you'll have to go on out now 
There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as the people start to leave. 
TRIPLETTE Excuse me, Barnett, how's she doing? 
BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers who he is. He doesn't. 
TRIPLETTE I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South. 
DELBERT Monday night. 
MANAGER You want her to sing, too? 
Sueleen has finished her song and eavesdrops blatantly. 
SUELEEN I can do benefits 
MANAGER (into phone) How much? 
DELBERT Twenty dollars for her and ten for you. 
The MANAGER keeps looking at SUELEEN 
MANAGZR Well, do you want a blonde? 
DELBERT How does she look? 
MANAGER You know... blonde. 
DELBERT Okay, I'll get you your money. 
Both hang up the telephones. 
52	INT. DEMON'S DEN 
The MANAGER carefully looks at SUELEEM. 
MANAGER I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit. 
SUELEEN Money's no object. 
She kisses his cheek. He hates it. He writes on a piece of paper. 
MANAGER You go here Monday night and be there at eight sharp and look flashy you know what I mean? 
She nods "yes" and takes the paper. 
MANAGER Are you sure you know what you're doing? 
SUELEEN Hundreds of times. 
MANAGER Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around. 
SUELEEN Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay. 
She isn't convincing. 
MANAGER That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break. 
SUELEEN Thanks. You are just a wonderful person. 
53	ANOTHER ANGLE 
ALBUQUERQUE enters. STAR sees her and chases her outside. 
54	EXT. DEMON'S DEN 
STAR hits the pavement, but there is no sign or ALBUQUERQUE. He stands there as BUD and L.A. JOAN enter. 
55	INT. DEMON'S DEN - NIGHT 
BUD and L.A. JOAN go to the bar as SUELEEN sings another song. TOM has moved away from OPAL to the telephone.

TOM I'm here. 
LINNEA Who is this? 
TOM Tom. You remember? 
REESE I'll just be in here. 
He catches OPAL'S eye and doesn't leave. 
OPAL Do you know Barbara Jean?

ALBUQUERQUE looks to see who is present. 
92	ANGLE BACKSTAGE 
CONNIE WHITE and her entourage are gathered. HAVEN, BUD and PEARL talk. OPAL and REESE arrive. As TOMMY BROWN performs, TRIPLETTE makes the rounds. OPAL comes near. They are handed pieces of anniversary cake. 
OPAL Hi. 
TRIPLETTE Hello. 
OPAL I'm Opal. 
TRIPLETTE Oh yes, I'm John Triplette. 
OPAL I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi. 
He looks puzzled. 
OPAL The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks. 
TRIPLETTE Why? 
OPAL Why? 
TRIPLETTE What? 
OPAL What? Oh. A film. 
At this point, HAVEN walks up. 
BARNETT Where'd you get the cake? 
They are taken quite off guard. 
TRIPLETTE Someone gave it... Here, you want this... I'll... 
HAVEN No. 
Somebody walks by and asks HAVEN how the PRESIDENT is. 
HAVEN A little worried. Fine, though. 
TRIPLETTE clears his throat and turns his back to HAVEN and continues to talk to OPAL. HAVEN walks off. 
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE Ladies and gentlemen, Haven Hamilton. 
BARBARA JEAN I don't want to listen to her sing 
BARNETT Don't feel that way, honey. 
BARBARA JEAN Then why are you listening to her - 
BARNETT Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang. 
BARBARA JEAN You have to what? 
BARNETT Go to the King Of the Road and thank her. 
BARBARA JEAN gets up out of bed. 
BARBARA JEAN Well here, why don't you take her some of these flowers while you're at it. 
She begins pulling flowers from various vases. 
BARBARA JEAN Maybe you'd like to work out something with her, too... Split us up... Her on the road and me in town or in the hospital -- (she wails) Barnett! 
She sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to cry. BARNETT backs off. If she was hoping for understanding, she is not about to receive it. 
BARNETT What the hell is wrong with you? Huh? 
He bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse owner whose investment Just collapsed in the stretch. 
BARNETT Wait a minute. You're not going nutsey on me, are you?  Huh...? You're not going to have one of those nervous breakdowns or anything, are you? 
Afraid she has gone too far, BARBARA JEAN stops crying and tries to make everything all right. But she is still choking in her own panic of being left. 
BARBARA JEAN A... No... No, I'm just... I'm really fine... I just. (she gets up) don't want you to think I'm giving up or anything like that... 
BARNETT looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of secretly being crazy. He begins to pick up the flowers from the floor. 
BARNETT I'll just take these on over to her. Show her your appreciation. 
BARBARA JEAN crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding affirmatively. 
BARBARA JEAN Sure... you go on and do that. 
She begins to shiver. BARNETT looks at her, but he makes no attempt to come any closer. 
BARBARA JEAN (very small) Barnett? 
He leans in and pats her arm gingerly. 
BARNETT I'll tell her thank you, for you. 
BARBARA JEAN nods affirmatively, still shivering. 
BARBARA JEAN (please hold me voice) Barnett? 
BARNETT What? 
She senses he can't go any further. 
BARBARA JEAN Bye, bye. 
He looks at her again and leaves. 
BARNETT Bye. bye. 
He is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns into her pillow so he won't hear her. 
102	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
GREEN has come from his wife's room. He sees BARNETT walk down the hall. After a moment's deliberation, GREEN enters BARBARA JEAN'S room. 
103	INT. BARBARA JEAN'S ROOM 
We SEE GREEN come in the door. BARBARA JEAN is sti1l trying to control herself, but is not having much luck with it. 
BARBARA JEAN (to the pillow) I just get so afraid sometimes. Then I get more afraid. : Just want you to hold me. 
MR. GREEN can't bear what she's saying. He hesitates for a minute and then figures what the hell. 
GREEN Hello. 
She freezes, thinking BARNETT has come back and she will be discounted as totally insane. 
GREEN Am I disturbing you? 
NORMAN and BILL are there. An ENTERTAINER is singing the CONNIE WHITE song that CONNIE is doing at the Opera. BILL is eager to know where MARY is. 
NORMAN Maybe she's at the Opera. 
BILL Why the hell would she be there? 
NORMAN shrugs. 
106	NEW ANGLE 
BILL You know goddamn well where she is. 
BARNETT, with the flowers, enters and sits in the lounge. 
107	ANOTHER ANGLE 
It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera. 
OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying much in one language and she might just be talking to the OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive. 
108	NEW ANGLE 
CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill. After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and TRIPLETTE. OPAL is still on the phone, now speaking in Ita1ian. 
109	NEW ANGLE 
As CONNIE and group step out of the lounge, MARY enters. BILL and NORMAN see her. BILL reacts.

BILL Tom! 
TRIPLETTE'S VOICE No, ah, Bill? 
MARY We can't support him  We're registered Democrats. 
BILL begins the fight again. 
BILL It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him. 
MARY Bill, he's a crazy man. 
TRIPLETTE moves in fast. 
TRIPLETTE Well, he- expressed a particular wish to have you on. 
They stop and look at him suspiciously. 
MARY What for? 
TRIPLETTE You're real favorites of his. 
They seem to change viewpoints in a moment. 
MARY You're kidding. 
BILL How come? 
TRIPLETTE settles in like they were old friends. 
TRIPLETTE First you have to understand how much he admires you. 
MARY and BILL get caught up in the sincerity. 
TRIPLETTE You sing for people and that's what he's about. He wants to help people. Especially now, you know. 
BILL bypasses all the talk about WALKER. 
BILL Where'd he ever see us? 
TRIPLETTE (bluffing) D.C. 
BILL D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there? 
TRIPLETTE Sure thing. 
MARY What National TV...?

TOM Come on in. 
NORMAN enters and they shake. 
TOM How's your stomach?

KENNY (still looking at the dog) Does their hair fall out? 
MOTHER (V.0.) Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.

KENNY Listen. Maybe I should go... 
MOTHER (V.0.) I've been a Little dyspeptic. 
KENNY I want to get the dog off my bed. 
MOTHER (V.0.) But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...

JOAN What's this? 
KENNY Replacement party. 
JOAN Who's that?

BARNETT Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks. 
He hangs up. The NURSE is reading the forms. BARBARA JEAN is going through the flowers... She finds GLENN'S and reads the note. 
NURSE Well, I don't know. 
BARNETT I have a nurse waiting for her in the bus. 
BARBARA JEAN Who brought these? 
NURSE I don't remember seeing those. 
BARNETT Somebody brought them. Come on, honey, let's go. 
She puts them on the gurney with the others. 
BARBARA JEAN Well, thank you all so much. You tell the other ladies thank you. 
NURSE Well all right. 
As they start out, DELBERT enters. 
REESE How is she? 
BARNETT A little slow, but she'll be fine.

REESE He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker. 
BARNETT Who the hell is he? 
REESE He's going to run for president. 
BARNETT Third party? 
NURSE If you'll wait Just a minute I'll get everything from the business office. 
146B	ANOTHER ANGLE 
He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the window at BARBARA JEAN getting into the bus. He comes back and begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register GREEN'S grief. 
GLENN (loudly) My mamma used to know her... They lived next door to each other... she said she was always nursing the sick animals. 
GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his hand. 
GLENN I really learned all about her from my Momma -- She's been saving this scrap book about her since she got to be famous. 
GREEN nods. 
GLENN The one thing she said to me when I joined was "When you're doing your travels you be sure you see Barbara Jean. You don't have to say anything about me but you be sure you see her."  So that's what I've been doing. Now I'm going to hitch a ride so I can see her in Memphis. 
GREEN nods. 
GLENN You give my test to your wife1 
GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls from the desk. 
NURSE Mr. Green, the doctor is on his way and the business office has your bill ready.

REESE Sueleen... Sueleen Gay. 
His look says what he wants. She is terrified.

A platform has been erected in the center of the parking lot. BARBARA JEAN'S bus is parked nearby. There is a large crowd, and several people gathered around the platform. GLENN is among them so is TRIPLETTE, REESE and OPAL. Radio station personnel and musicians prepare for the show. Finally, the bus door opens and BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start and she sings. The sound comes from many huge speakers and people come from stores and shops to hear. 
BARBARA JEAN segues from one song to another. 
179	NEW ANGLE 
BARNETT stands to the side, talking to various people TRIPLETTE pulls his sleeve. 
BARNETT Well, for heaven's sake. You're just about everywhere, aren't you? 
THIPLETTE I came out to see how you all were doing. 
BARNETT I think I should tell you I know why you're here. The answer is no ... we don't get involved in politics. 
TRIPLETTE (laughs good- naturedly) Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven. 
BARNETT Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen. 
TRIPLETTE I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out. 
BARNETT He knows better. 
TRIPLETTE Well, it's probably because it would help him. 
BARNETT How is that? 
TRIPLETTE Everybody likes to be as good as their word. 
BARNETT Whose word? 
TRIPLETTE His Word. 
BARNETT His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something? 
TRIPLETTE That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him? 
TRIPLETTE Nothing; Barnett. It's my job. 
BARNETT Your job, huh. 
He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he speaks. 
BARNETT She will not appear on the stage or support that Walker guy and you can't have any of his signs up while she sings. She'll be on first and out of the park before he shows up. There will be no pictures, no questions, no answers or tying her name up with his now or in the future to come. Any money she makes will go to the President of the United States. 
He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the statement. Then the secretary signs. 
BARNETT We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send her three songs over this afternoon. She'll be done about ten minutes after she starts and Walker better not show up till she's through. Now, get out of here. 
TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary. 
MAN Barnett? 
BARNETT (sharply) What? 
MAN Well, Barnett, I have this terrific song I've been working on. It would be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like you to take a look at it. 
BARNETT looks at him suspiciously. 
BARNETT I'm very busy right now. (to secretary) Get me Haven. 
MAN It'll just take a minute. Here, I'll even hold it for you. 
BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged. 
BARNETT I don't know where you got this, but something tells me you stole it and I hate thieves. 
The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- BARNETT yells after him. 
BARNETT Aren't you an engineer...?  I know you -- Don't you work at one of those cut a record places...? Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? Usually their last twenty-five... 
The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until he's out of sight.

The Deer Hunter 
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY 
The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted by the falling snow. 
In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional aid from a leaning pole. 
MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as we watch a car come charging up through the slush on Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears, huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY STREET. 
MAIN TITLE COMES UP: 
THE DEER HUNTER 
INT. STEEL MILL - DAY 
A white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and comes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and another and another and another. The ingots are huge, trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying rumble. 
CREDITS ROLL 
UNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are NICK, SAL and MERLE. 
CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL. SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips, gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track again and they all grab their tongs. 
INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY 
A very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding ceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which will be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing slowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of nerves. 
SAL'S MOTHER It's all ready? Everything's ready? 
PRIEST Yes. 
SAL'S MOTHER Are you sure everything's ready? Are you positive? 
PRIEST Everything. Yes. 
SAL'S MOTHER It would snow... Everything's going to slip. Everything's going to slide... All the cars are going to crash! 
SAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into tears. 
SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D) I can't believe this... My own little boy... with a stranger! 
The PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and comforts her. 
EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY 
Another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides back. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses bursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin scampering across the street. They have all been working on their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As they make their way to the other side of the street they all wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One of the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the garment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS disappear inside. 
CAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little houses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides back. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group of OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a miniature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats. They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow, with the great white cake held firmly between them. 
INT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY 
The time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin checking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather together along the wall. 
NICK Where's Vince? 
SAL There's Albert! (calls) Hey, Albert!!! 
ALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox -- changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound STEELWORKERS. 
ALBERT How you feelin', Sal? 
SAL I feel okay. 
ALBERT Feeling hot? 
NICK (arm around SAL) Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell! 
MERLE There's Vince! 
OTHERS (calling) Vince!... Over here! Vince! 
MERLE Get him, Albert. Get Vince! 
ALBERT I'll get him. 
ALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs VINCE and they all push out together. 
EXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY 
The snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers the acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all stop dead in their tracks. 
VINCE Snow... Holy shit, snow! 
GUYS IN THE CAR (chanting) Do it, Nick! Do it! Go Nick, Go! Do it! Do it, Nick! Go! 
The car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep. 
NICK Back! All hands to the rear! 
ALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw themselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE. 
GUYS IN BACK SEAT Easy... 'At's it, easy! Easy, Nick... Easy! 
EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY 
The Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground and skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER. 
INT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 
ANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes. ANGELA leans forward into a mirror. 
ANGELA (sincerely) I do. 
A pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) (heartfelt) I do. 
ANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) I do, I do, I do!!! 
ANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and unrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself on the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the pillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it out she sees that something is written on the back: 
ANGELA (CONT'D) (reading, slow) "This is it -- more or less... Love, Mom." 
ANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of Michaelangelo's "David". ANGELA stares at the figure for a long, long moment... 
ANGELA (CONT'D) Oh, wow. 
INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY 
The place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking boilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret from the hunters, some power beyond their own. 
JOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At the same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and VINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his tray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around the floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert their places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting congratulations. 
INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
LINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly lovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are coming from the room above. The thumping gets louder. There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were being thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there is more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud... and then silence. 
LINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it all on a tray. 
INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY 
The room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the wall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is LINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he holds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through the open window, snow is blowing in. 
LINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment expressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the tray on the bureau and kneels beside him. 
LINDA Daddy? 
FATHER (mumbles) Go... fucking hell! 
LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins cursing again. 
FATHER (CONT'D) Fucking shit... all around, like a sea! Like an ocean! 
LINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in the face and pushes her violently across the room. 
LINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her. 
FATHER (CONT'D) Fucking bitch... All bitches! 
He swings, catches her in the face again, hard. 
LINDA Daddy...! Daddy, it's me! 
FATHER Hate 'em. Fucking bitches! 
LINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. 
EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY 
Seven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently through the falling snow. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY 
The WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging from grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield rolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive -- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter comes from inside. 
NICK I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too. 
MERLE (with a glance to the window) I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo. 
NICK (laughs) Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo? 
MERLE Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do. 
NICK (laughs) You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac! 
MERLE Yeah. (he grins) When it comes to hunting, that's true. 
Cursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN and ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open. NICK and MERLE go out. 
EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY 
NICK Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys! 
ALBERT It won't open. 
NICK You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there. 
ALBERT Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it. 
NICK Here. Hit it here. 
ALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps open. 
ALBERT Hey, that's neat. 
NICK nods. 
ALBERT (CONT'D) That's new, isn't it? 
NICK Couple of weeks... Listen -- 
ALBERT I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been. 
VINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him. 
VINCE Hey, guys... 
JOHN Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville. 
ALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end of the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest, thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent, mile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of excited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up. 
BRIDESMAID 1 Albert, what are you doing! 
BRIDESMAID 2 Hurry up, you guys! 
BRIDESMAID 3 Who's got their carnations? 
BRIDESMAID 4 Here. They're right here. 
BRIDESMAID 1 Look at you! You're all a mess! 
BRIDESMAID 3 Put on their carnations! 
BRIDESMAID 1 Who's got a pin? 
As the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on carnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to find LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be seen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a small suitcase in her hand. 
NICK (crosses) Linda... 
LINDA Hi. (forces a smile) Nick, your shoes are soaking. 
NICK Linda, what's the matter? 
LINDA (tries to toss it off) Oh... You know... 
She fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks around, pulls her inside the trailer. 
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY 
NICK clears a place on the couch. LINDA sits, holding her suitcase in her lap. 
LINDA (with great effort) I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because... 
NICK Sure. Are you kidding? Sure. 
LINDA I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking -- 
NICK (kneels in front of her) Linda... Hey, Linda... 
NICK What kind of beer would you like? 
LINDA (laughing) I don't know. 
NICK (to Merle) Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life. 
NICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub, finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks transformed. She begins chattering and laughing. 
MERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk. 
MERLE Sorry. 
LINDA (laughs) It's okay, Merle. 
NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves. 
MERLE (catching Linda's expression) I guess you like Nick. 
LINDA (nods) Yes. 
MERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be trying to contain a floodtide of emotion. 
MERLE Fuckin' Nick... (clears his throat) Fuckin' Nick... gives. (he nods, bangs his fist on the table) Gives. Fuckin' Nick gives. 
INT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT 
The rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing and low moans. What light there is comes from the colored glass ball revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now playing sweet and low. 
The front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform. On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are brightly polished. 
SERGEANT Pow! 
The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance floor. 
INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT 
The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS, plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at the end of one of the white trestle tables. 
INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 
ALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her feet and marches around holding her above his head. 
GIRL Albert, what are you doing... Albert! 
INT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT 
VINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED. 
VINCE Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass! 
JOHN Oh, well... 
VINCE Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now. 
VINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass. FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts his hand right back where FRED had it. 
INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT 
NICK, SAL and MERLE are standing together, looking at the SERGEANT. 
MERLE Nick, he just came back. 
NICK From Nam? 
MERLE Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son! 
MERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to the SERGEANT. 
MERLE (CONT'D) We, ah... We're going too. 
The SERGEANT looks at them and delivers a big, blank smile. 
SERGEANT Pow! 
MERLE What? 
The SERGEANT keeps smiling. 
MERLE (CONT'D) (to Nick) What'd he say? 
NICK Pow. 
MERLE Pow? 
SAL All set, hon? 
ANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down. Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark naked, running in front of the car with colored paper streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
MERLE weaves down the street in front of the growling red Pontiac. MERLE is not just running. He is leaping and bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a realm of pure ethereal space. 
NICK, ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN pound down the street behind the Pontiac, ALBERT carrying MERLE's clothes. 
GUYS Look at that! Fuckin' guy! Fuckin' Merle!... Unbelievable! 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
The road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the other descending to the valley below. MERLE swerves up the incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes straight and disappears down the hill. 
ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN stagger to a stop, panting helplessly. NICK grabs MERLE's clothes from ALBERT and takes off up the hill. 
EXT. HILLSIDE PARKING AREA - NIGHT 
MERLE stands motionless, looking out across the valley as NICK approaches. The night is brilliantly clear and the fires from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow. 
NICK comes to a stop a few feet away. 
NICK Merle? 
MERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he gives NICK an almost feral grin. 
MERLE You think we'll ever come back? 
NICK (startled) From Nam? 
MERLE Yeah. 
NICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say. 
MERLE (CONT'D) I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that. 
NICK (half laughing) Merle -- 
MERLE Promise! You gotta promise! 
NICK You got it. 
MERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had been pressing on him. 
MERLE (with a laugh) Let's go huntin'. I mean let's do it! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THRUWAY - NIGHT 
NICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming past. 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles. 
GUYS (singing) Let me be free! Let me be free! If... you... will let me be free... You'll... always be happy... with me-e-e-e!!! 
ALBERT (making a trumpet sound) Wa-wa-wa!... Waaaaa!!! 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 
Tale Cadillac comes blasting by... 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
NICK is hunched over the wheel, his eyes gone completely glassy. MERLE and VINCE are on the nod, while ALBERT and JOHN, both half asleep, are having a lead-voiced conversation. 
ALBERT She fucked you? 
JOHN She fucked me. 
ALBERT She fucked me too. 
JOHN She fucked you? 
ALBERT She fucked me too. 
There is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes open. 
JOHN She fucked us both. 
JOHN You just put mustard on your Hershey bar. 
ALBERT (nods) Good... Pass the beer. 
VINCE (pointing to a location beside the road) Here, here! This is it! 
MERLE (milk slopping over him) Watch it, shithead! 
VINCE (pounds Nick on the shoulder) Here! This is it! 
ALBERT It is not! 
VINCE It is too! Now you passed it! 
MERLE It's ahead, by the tree. 
NICK It's ahead, Vince. 
VINCE That isn't it! There's no way that's it... Unless they changed it. They might have changed it. 
NICK pulls to a stop on the shoulder. 
VINCE (CONT'D) They changed it. That's what they did. This is it but they changed it. 
EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN 
The sky is just turning grey. A cold wind is blowing, moaning in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open roadway. The guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos. 
VINCE This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it. 
ALBERT You're full of shit. 
VINCE Who's full of shit? 
ALBERT You're full of shit! 
VINCE I'm telling you, they changed it! 
ALBERT They did not! 
VINCE They did too! 
ALBERT Jesus, it's freezing! 
NICK, MERLE and JOHN have the trunk open and are taking stuff out. MERLE strips down where he stands and begins putting on his hunting clothes. ALBERT and VINCE grab their things and follow the example of NICK and JOHN, who are changing on the corner of the seats. 
NICK Whee-uu! 
ALBERT Jesus! 
JOHN Holy shit! 
VINCE Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks? 
MERLE, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks over. 
VINCE (CONT'D) (rummaging around in the mess of things he has brought) Never mind, Merle. Never mind, I got 'em... Where the hell are my pants? Anyone see my pants?... Who the hell took my pants! 
VINCE begins plunging around. 
OTHERS Fuckhead! Watch it! 
VINCE Somebody took my pants... I know I brought pants. 
VINCE tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with nothing and steps out of the car. 
VINCE (CONT'D) All right. All right, you guys. Whoever took my pants, I want 'em back! 
EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN - LATER 
Shots are ringing out in the hills. NICK, ALBERT and JOHN stand by the roadside while VINCE and MERLE glare at each other. VINCE is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down vest that could only have come from ALBERT. MERLE's knapsack lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it contains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots. 
MERLE Sure I got boots. I got boots right here. 
VINCE Then lemme have 'em. 
MERLE No. 
VINCE (both hands in the air) No!!!? 
MERLE No. 
VINCE What do you mean, no??? 
WE HEAR THE BUZZ AND CREAK OF OTHER INSECTS, THEN A DULL, FLUTTERING DRONE. THE DRONE GROWS LOUDER... 
EXT. HELICOPTER SQUADRON - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY 
There are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the tops of the trees. Sunlight gleams on their paint and murderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat clusters, like eggs. 
Suddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets. 
EXT. RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY 
As the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot upward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two miles wide. 
EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY 
A platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts spilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute silence except for the low buzz of flies. 
A V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque command and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The LIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS -- idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he rubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS laugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke. 
There is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives a low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts. He signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts toward them. 
INT. GRASS HUT - DAY 
South Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old men -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their hands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a look of stark terror in their faces. 
EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY 
One of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE SOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a gash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly gaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE. 
A WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot rings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and stands there, on all fours, like a dog. 
EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY 
The V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them in the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges from a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their feet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a kick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The BABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY comes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the end of his bayonet. 
EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY 
MERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams a fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts for the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike, and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the dead. 
EXT. GRASS HUTS DAY 
The VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in a line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up and down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies in the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to play with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air squats nearby and yawns. 
EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 
MERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look around the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat package and draws back. 
CAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming things, glittering blankly. 
EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY 
MERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C. SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a thin mist of spraying blood. 
ABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR. 
EXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY 
There are five of them, coming in low under the tops of nearby trees. 
EXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY 
The VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters and frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm. 
EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY 
MERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of billowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of heated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes are burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet. 
In front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two charred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are motionless now, like two roasted stones. 
An AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the burning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and then the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine. 
LIEUTENANT What the hell are you doing here? 
MERLE (numb) Saving lives. 
MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL. 
LIEUTENANT Move it out, girls! Move it out! 
The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE. 
NICK Merle?... Jesus, Merle! 
MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He seems to be looking right through him. 
The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags him of f to the table. 
INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY 
SAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed opposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger than SAL, and he is trembling with terror. 
SAL Hey, listen, you can do it. (Sal nods, smiles) Believe me, you can do it. We can both do it. Then we go home, see? Then we go home! 
SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around, cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD. 
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR. 
SAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed in an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to discover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry. 
INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY 
A half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the muck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back, DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the floor. 
On the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back and forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at the table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits slumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn at the knee. 
MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND LOOKING OUT AT THE "PITS". 
EXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY 
The pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the downhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far fewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip. 
SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR A MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR. 
INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY 
MERLE turns away from the "pits". He looks down at SAL, then he looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as if he had been having a long argument. 
MERLE I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come. 
NICK What are you, God? 
MERLE Listen, asshole, it's up to us! 
NICK They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now! 
MERLE What are you, hoping? 
NICK What else? 
MERLE I thought you might be praying. 
NICK I'm doing that too. 
MERLE I suppose you wish you were somewhere else? 
NICK What do you think? 
MERLE Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out! 
NICK You're right... Okay, you're right. 
MERLE (grabs him) Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!! 
NICK (stands) Okay, okay! (he straightens his shoulders) Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal? 
MERLE Forget Sal. 
NICK What do you mean? 
MERLE I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick. 
NICK Forget Sal? 
MERLE Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you! 
NICK Merle... 
MERLE LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO! 
A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn. 
Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the pearl-handled revolver. 
NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him. 
MERLE (CONT'D) (calm) We gotta play with more bullets. 
NICK We what? 
The GUARD IN CHARGE looks at his COMPANIONS. They all begin shouting for him to go ahead. The GUARD IN CHARGE purses his lips, as if imitating a general coming to a decision, and then nods his assent. The GUARDS all howl. MERLE joins right in. 
MERLE (CONT'D) He's terrific! Great fucking guy! 
The GUARD IN CHARGE takes the revolver, opens the cylinder and begins sticking in two more cartridges. 
MERLE (CONT'D) KA-POW!!! BA-ROOMIE!!! 
MERLE hops up and down again, then screams at NICK, jabbing his finger at him, as if in fury. 
MERLE (CONT'D) Both of us may have to pull on this, so get your shit in fuckin' shape!!! (to the GUARDS) Him or me!!! Now we got it, him or me!!! (he rubs his hands and sits back down) Place your bets, motherfuckers! Now we're going! Now we got a game! 
The GUARD IN CHARGE places the revolver on the table, spins it. 
MERLE (CONT'D) Watch! Now watch! He's going to get it. And then KA-POW! BA-ROOMIE!!! 
The muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over at the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the barrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The OTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are yelling and shouting. 
MERLE You guys think I'm in trouble, right? 
MERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it... 
MERLE (CONT'D) No way! Never!!! (he begins to chant) MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA! MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA! MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA! MERLE LIVES LONG! Lemme hear it. Come on, motherfuckers, lemme hear it! 
MERLE starts it again. The GUARDS who are bett ing on him JOIN IN: 
MERLE (CONT'D) (with GUARDS) MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA! MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA! MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA! MERLE LIVES LONG! 
MERLE takes a glance at the GUARD IN CHARGE again. The GUARD IN CHARGE is still eyeing him with caution. 
MERLE places the revolver to his temple... and CLICKS into an empty chamber. 
MERLE (CONT'D) See! Nothing to it. 
He pushes the gun across to NICK. Then he stabs his finger at him, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage. 
MERLE (CONT'D) You got an empty chamber and it's in your mind! Just put that empty chamber in the gun! 
NICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at MERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty chamber. 
The GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on NICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE. 
MERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated, his brow furrowed in a mighty frown. 
NICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if throwing back a challenge. 
MERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an expression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no longer possessed the strength to pick it up. 
MERLE (CONT'D) (gloom) Who's for Merle? (he thumps his fist on the table) Is anyone for Merle??? 
MERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if suddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he pushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table, still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body sag over it. 
MERLE (CONT'D) Who here is for Merle...? 
There is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the rain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The GUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by MERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little children. 
MERLE (CONT'D) Who... here... is for Merle...? 
MERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very dramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in. 
MERLE (CONT'D) (with GUARDS) MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA! MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA! MERLE IS MAGIC -- HA! 
MERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the GUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same time NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing behind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin. TWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO GUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with AK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47, they GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor. 
It is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled mess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on -- uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal... 
EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY 
Barely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow is a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step forward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE. 
INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY 
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK spins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and lets go with the AK 47. 
EXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY 
MERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious and the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far can be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals. As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the side of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along behind and attached to MERLE by a short rope. 
MERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the ground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath, SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo with an expression of pure terror. 
SAL Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home? 
There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible. MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK. 
NICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion. Then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again. 
NICK (CONT'D) Hey, hey, the wind does blow. Hey, hey, the snow does snow... 
NICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the PHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious determination, as if this link were the last, as if by staring at it hard he could make it hold. 
NICK (CONT'D) (his voice thin, cracking) Hey, hey, the wind does blow. Hey, hey, the snow does snow -- 
There is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the unmistakable sound of APPLAUSE. 
NICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he crosses toward it. 
EXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT 
A tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the around are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown off. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the back of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another corpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the right temple. 
MAN (V.O.) If you are brave and lucky I can make you rich. 
NICK turns. A MAN is standing in the shadows of a small grape arbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. The MAN'S accent is French. Beside him, on a small white table, is a bottle of champagne and several glasses. 
MAN (CONT'D) You have played? 
NICK stares at the MAN, nods. 
MAN (CONT'D) Once you have played it is not so hard. Cigarette? 
NICK shakes his head. 
MAN (CONT'D) You seem... disturbed. 
NICK I... No. You do this for money? 
MAN Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve. (smiles) But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do. (gives NICK a glass) Where did you play? 
NICK Up north. 
MAN Ah yes. Of course... So few survive. (smiles) La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release? 
NICK Playing. 
MAN (raises his eyebrows) Playing? 
NICK We... Three bullets. 
MAN And then you... 
The MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a pistol. NICK nods. 
MAN (CONT'D) How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are? 
NICK Nick. 
ARMAND Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you know that I have a cousin who is called Nicholas and a nephew Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit, en famille. In the family. 
There is another SHOT from inside and another round of APPLAUSE. 
NICK I have to go. 
ARMAND But you must come in. 
NICK No, I -- 
ARMAND But I insist. 
NICK I have to go. 
ARMAND You are frightened, no? 
NICK nods. 
ARMAND (CONT'D) Of what is there to be afraid? The war? The war is no problem. It is a joke, a silly thing. I make one call and get you out. 
ARMAND refills NICK's glass. NICK looks at it. The glass is as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss. NICK lifts the glass and empties in one swallow. 
NICK See, I'm going home. 
ARMAND Ah yes. Of course. (smiles) To the girl who waits. 
NICK (gives him a look and sits) Yeah... Do you mind if I sit? 
ARMAND But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --? 
NICK (weary, shaking his head) No. None of that. 
A huge neon sign stands against the grey sky, buzzing angrily, as if it were full of bees. 
The TAXI DRIVER comes out of one of the units, gets back in his cab and pulls away. 
INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK 
NICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled along the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw swallows. . 
NICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it again. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like that of an animal run to the ground. 
NICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands and looks out. 
EXT. THE STEEL MILL FROM THE MOTEL (NICK'S POV) - DUSK 
The five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the pale winter sky, Steam billows upward in huge, silver-edged clouds and there is the flash and gleam of fire. 
INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK 
NICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly -- stares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair, then he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins gulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and fast as he can. 
EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN 
The banner stretching to the house across the street has been whipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside NICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same vintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are entirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a moment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the trailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats, and then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS she has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start off, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car. The STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up car, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing out is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses are rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the SECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back inside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard. The GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her missing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties. She returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe and they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave there is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half undressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with coffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes off. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at JOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in the car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes to the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave them in the back seat and take off again. 
JOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way. 
LINDA stands in the yard, alone, with the three cups of coffee. 
EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN 
NICK stands half-way down a rickety wooden stairway, watching. 
EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAWN 
LINDA turns and goes back inside the trailer. 
EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN 
NICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the trailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket, drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs. Straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it with his fingers. Then he starts down again. 
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAWN 
Cakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover almost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the little settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with painful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is trying her God-damnedest. 
There is a knock at the door. LINDA freezes. Then, trying to be totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses to the door and opens it. 
NICK Guess who. 
LINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in. 
LINDA (throws herself in his arms) Nick! Oh, Nick, you're back! 
She hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull apart. 
LINDA (CONT'D) I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car... (back in his arms) I thought someone stole you away! 
NICK No. 
LINDA Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! 
They pull apart. 
LINDA (CONT'D) How are you? 
NICK Fine. I'm fine. How are you? 
LINDA Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound? 
NICK (anger) That was nothing. That wasn't anything. 
LINDA But -- 
NICK It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it. 
LINDA I made you a sweater. (she gets it) Here... You have to take that off. 
NICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him 
LINDA (CONT'D) I couldn't remember your exact size. 
The sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to NICK's knees. 
LINDA (CONT'D) (smoothly) Oh, that's fine. Perfect... It is a little too big... (she pulls the sweater back off) ... but I can easily fix that. Easily. One thing about wool sweaters, they are such a cinch to fix. 
ALBERT It's Nick! 
VINCE Nick...? (sees him) Jesus, Nick! 
VINCE grabs NICK's hand, shakes it. Then ALBERT does the same. 
VINCE (CONT'D) Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right? 
ALBERT Yeah. 
NICK I got delayed. I -- 
ALBERT (hugs him) Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean... 
VINCE Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think? 
ALBERT I know, but... 
VINCE What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe! 
ALBERT Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired. 
NICK I'm fine. Hey, I'm fine. 
THEY start for the cars. 
NICK (CONT'D) How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been? 
VINCE Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat. 
ALBERT Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married! 
NICK Married? 
ALBERT Tell him, Vince. 
VINCE Yeah. I did. Yeah...What the hell. 
VINCE makes a gesture, shrugs. 
NICK (after a beat) Well, who'd you get married to? 
VINCE Aw, it's a long story! 
ALBERT Tell him, Vince! 
VINCE Well... you remember Cynthia? 
NICK Cynthia! Sure. 
VINCE (nods) That's who. 
NICK (fast recovery) Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great! 
ALBERT Show him the gun. Hey, show him the gun, Vince. 
VINCE looks around. Cars are streaming out of the lot, horns blaring. VINCE pulls back his coat and shows a .38 Smith and Weston in a holster on his hip. 
NICK What the hell's that for? 
VINCE What's it for?? 
ALBERT He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious! 
NICK You mean...? 
VINCE Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught! 
ALBERT Vince thinks... you know... 
NICK (nods) Hey... hey, let's drink! 
INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT 
NICK comes through the CROWD OF STEELWORKERS shaking hands. The STEELWORKERS treat him with immense respect. There are no cracks; there are no jokes. They squeeze his shoulder, pat his back, reaching out for him, touching him. 
STEELWORKERS Nice going! Good going, Nick! You did good, boy; you did fine! Let him through! Damn good, boy! Let him through! He's all right! Did his part and he did it good! Let him through! Let's make a little room! 
JOHN pushes out of the crowd. 
JOHN Nick! Hey, Nick! (gives him a big hug) Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh? 
NICK Fine. Hey, I'm fine. 
NICK Angela, I just heard Sal was alive. 
ANGELA Sure. Why not. 
NICK Where? Where is he? 
ANGELA Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up. 
NICK You talk to him? 
ANGELA Oh, sure... Twice a day. 
NICK What hospital is he in? Where? 
ANGELA Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing. 
NICK Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way. 
ANGELA He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick! 
ANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands up. 
She stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket. 
NICK Angela...? 
ANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding NICK's eyes. 
ANGELA Did you ever think life would turn out like this? 
NICK No. 
ANGELA You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it. 
The door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in with an electric toaster and a screwdriver. 
SAL'S MOTHER Here. This is it. What you do, you stick this in here. 
Pushes the toaster in NICK's arms. 
SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Then you jab it, see. Jab it good. Something's in it. Hear? Listen. Something's in it. What? What's there? 
EXT. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT 
NICK sits on the steps with the toaster that Sal's mother gave him in his lap. It is snowing and from inside the church we hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and dark, like a great river rolling through the night. 
CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears glistening in his eyes. 
EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT 
We see a lone telephone booth at the curb. The door is half open and snow is blowing in. 
EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - ORIGINAL ANGLE - NIGHT 
NICK closes his eyes, leans his head forward and takes it in his hands. 
INT. MOTEL NICK'S UNIT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
LINDA steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself. 
LINDA It just seems sort of strange coming to a motel... Like a honeymoon. Or some kind of parlez vous ... Not parlez-vous! (she giggles) What am I saying? That's those cocktails! Parlez-vous!... What I mean is rendezvous. Some kind of rendezvous. 
LINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at herself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and poking a finger in her mouth. 
LINDA (CONT'D) Do you know what I mean?... Nick? 
NICK doesn't answer. LINDA pulls the door full open, takes one last look at herself and goes out. 
INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
As LINDA comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she stops dead in her tracks. 
NICK is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe off and sound asleep. 
LINDA Nick? 
NICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a wistful shake. 
LINDA (CONT'D) Nick...? Nick, it's me! 
But NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately, she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest. 
NICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH SCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND STUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF SOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND. 
NICK In the timeless words of Squire Albert... 
VINCE cracks up, howling. 
VINCE Squire Albert... 
VINCE collapses on the floor. 
NICK In the timeless words of Squire Albert... 
ALL (in a ragged chorus) Hey! Fuckin' A!!! 
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
NICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the window by a street light on the corner. There is a sound outside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with groceries. 
LINDA Nick? 
NICK Right here. 
LINDA crosses to the doorway. 
LINDA What are you doing? 
NICK Oh. Nothing... Sitting. 
LINDA You're going hunting? 
NICK (blankly) What? 
LINDA I see you're going hunting. 
NICK looks at the equipment on the floor. 
NICK Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to. 
LINDA That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. 
NICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with pain and his voice is cracked with emotion. 
NICK You know how sometimes you're going along... You're going along... And that's all...! One thing is right after another, like steps... And you step along. 
NICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking. 
NICK (CONT'D) I don't know where that is... It's gone! That's gone! 
A car pulls up outside. The HORN begins blowing, then VINCE and ALBERT begin pounding on the wall of the trailer. 
VINCE (V.O.) Let's go!!! 
ALBERT (V.O.) Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!! 
NICK I gotta go. 
NICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and heads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak. 
NICK (CONT'D) I'll be... I don't know... Couple of days. 
NICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER GROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE. SNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT HISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY 
Snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice covered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the whispering, fitful, spinning flakes. 
NICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting snow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill, following the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see that he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY 
A magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks, looking down the slope. 
NICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow. 
The BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly and vanishes into the trees. 
EXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY 
VINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on all fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area above VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that it sounds like a full scale war. 
VINCE What are you, kiddin'? Are you kiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I coulda had her! She...! One time she begged me, practically begged me. Listen, I had her tit, which was out, in one hand, and my other hand... You know that mole on the inside of her right leg? Well, I was past that mole, way past that mole, and I was -- 
JOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope, single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush over to the TWO DEAD DEER. 
VINCE (CONT'D) (coming after them) Nice shootin', you guys. Not bad. Not half bad. 
EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
The lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping carts which a CLERK is banging together. 
NICK gets out of his car and goes in. 
INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 
Two or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front. 
CHECKER She's in back. 
NICK Thanks. 
CHECKER How was huntin'? 
NICK Oh. Fine. 
CHECKER Get anything? 
NICK No. 
CHECKER Too bad. 
NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair, crying. 
NICK Linda... Honey, what's wrong? 
LINDA (helpless shrug) I don't know. 
NICK Hey. Look. There must be something. 
LINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face. 
LINDA I'm just so lonely. 
NICK C'mon. I've got the car. 
LINDA (shakes her head) I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. 
NICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages. 
INT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
The CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together. 
NICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car. 
EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT 
NICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out of the door and crosses towards him. 
NICK You okay? 
LINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door. 
LINDA Let's make love, Nick. 
LINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight. 
LINDA (CONT'D) Let's make love forever! 
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
LINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across the pillows, like a dancer leaping. 
NICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her, fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then goes to the window. 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT 
The wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest, polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer. 
THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY. 
THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT, THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET. 
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
NICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to the window again. 
EXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT 
The street is empty. The MAN is gone. 
MP Right this way, Lieutenant. 
NICK is hurried to the limousine where a SECOND MP holds the door. 
SECOND MP Quick as you can, sir. We're in a rush. 
NICK gets in the limousine. The SECOND MP slams the door, jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing. 
INT. LIMOUSINE - SAIGON - NIGHT 
There are jeeps with MP's ahead; there are jeeps with MP's behind. Seated beside NICK is a gigantic MARINE CORPORAL who stares rigidly ahead. 
EXT. CAVALCADE - SAIGON - NIGHT 
Pedestrians and bicyclists flee as the cavalcade comes screaming down a wide boulevard. 
EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - SAIGON - NIGHT 
The jeeps peel off to the side. The gate swings open and the limousine enters the compound. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT 
A STRING QUARTET is playing. GUESTS in evening clothes are drinking champagne. 
NICK enters with the MARINE CORPORAL and is whisked rapidly down a hallway. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
NICK stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table. On the table there is a basket of eggs, an omelette pan and a pile of mushrooms. Across from the table six SERVANTS with napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates. 
MARINE (V.O.) Sir? 
NICK turns. The MARINE CORPORAL is holding a chef's hat. NICK takes off his cap, puts on the chef's hat. Suddenly a door comes open and the AMERICAN AMBASSADOR and his WIFE come in. 
AMBASSADOR Henri! So good to see you. How are you? How are you? Darling, this is Henri. Henri, my wife Elizabeth. 
WIFE My pleasure. 
AMBASSADOR Henri, we are starved. Six omelettes, s'il vous plait. 
WIFE (hissing) Avec champignons. 
AMBASSADOR Avec champignons. (back to his WIFE) Fines herbes? 
The WIFE shakes her head. The AMBASSADOR winks. 
AMBASSADOR (CONT'D) Avec champignons. 
The AMBASSADOR and his WIFE hurry out. There is dead silence. NICK pulls the MARINE CORPORAL to one side, points to his crotch. 
NICK Pee-pee. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT 
NICK comes down the corridor behind the MARINE CORPORAL. As he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he picks it up and swings it down on the MARINE CORPORAL'S head. The blow is ferocious. The chair splinters into pieces and the MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud. 
NICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels, removes his pistol and jams it in his belt. 
EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - WALKWAY TO PEDESTRIAN EXIT - NIGHT 
Three MARINE GUARDS are standing at parade rest by an open iron gate. As NICK appears in his white chef's hat the GUARDS snap to attention and he walks into the CROWD OF ASIANS streaming by outside. 
EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - BUSY INTERSECTION - NIGHT 
NICK takes out his wallet, extracts the tattered calling card that he found with SAL'S money and dials the number. He lets it ring a long time but there is no answer. 
EXT. DESERTED STREET WITH SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT 
NICK is not sure where he is. Suddenly he stops, recognizing the yard with the little grape arbor where he met ARMAND. 
EXT. YARD BEHIND SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT 
The yard is grown over. As NICK goes in there comes a low buzz of flies. He trips over something, draws back. Seeing a candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses and lights it. 
The yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet cushions and rotting CORPSES. NICK leans over one of the CORPSES. The skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe with maggots. 
NICK straightens, looks around. 
NICK Merle!!! 
The back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol and goes in. 
INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT 
REFEREE (amplified) Game number seven. Gentlemen will please wrap. 
The CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth. 
REFEREE (CONT'D) (as he loads revolver) One cartridge. Game to be played to completion. Forfeit automatic after delay of one minute. 
The REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table and spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L and R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L. 
REFEREE Gentleman on the left will now commence play. 
The REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the cylinder, cocks it and 
places it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger... and clicks out. 
NICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A. SYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... 
NICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his temple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A DEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor. 
The FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS TO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS HEAD AND DANCES AROUND. 
NICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory. He looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in five languages. 
NICK starts off again, hurrying. 
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT 
NICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads blown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing, squatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS. Some of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE, several of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF THE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS. 
Suddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins. TWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND CONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and screaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the SECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily removed, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS in it. 
ARMAND (V.O.) If you are brave and lucky I can make you rich. 
NICK turns and finds ARMAND behind him. ARMAND studies him for a fraction of a second and then smiles. 
ARMAND (CONT'D) C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play? 
NICK I came to see Merle. 
ARMAND Ah. Merle. And you know Merle? 
NICK Yeah. 
ARMAND (studies him) You are his friend. 
NICK Where is he??? 
ARMAND (faint smile) Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him. 
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT 
GUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering like birds. 
Laughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny lanterns bob and sway. 
NICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops. 
MERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone, dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops, or snow flakes, or falling stones. 
NICK (shouts) Merle! 
MERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When NICK reaches the table, he stands. 
NICK (CONT'D) Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you? 
MERLE Nick!... I thought you went home. 
NICK I did. I... This is stolen. I came back. 
MERLE Sit down. 
NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't know where to start. 
MERLE (CONT'D) (breaking the silence) How's Linda? 
NICK Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing? 
MERLE (eyes him) I like it, Nick. 
NICK Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... (stares at him) Why? 
For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if to some landscape far beyond. 
MERLE I like it because it's simple.

SCREEN is BLACK.      In white letters we read: BALTIMORE 1963. FADE IN: 1   EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY                                   1 BILL BABOWSKY ("BB"), a wiry, dapper-looking man in his mid-thirties, is circling a baby blue Cadillac. A SALESMAN follows on his heels. SALESMAN She's a beauty. BB (looking at Salesman) Who? 
SALESMAN What? BB Who's the beauty? SALESMAN The car. BB I thought maybe you saw some chick walking by. I lost my concentration. Why do they call cars 'she'? They never say 'he'... always 'she.' The Salesman shrugs his shoulders.      BB walks around the Cadillac. BB Very nice... very nice.

2   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LINE OF ROW HOUSES - DAY                     2 We hear YELLING. 
3   INT. ROW HOUSE - DAY                                             3 NORA, a rather plain, but attractive woman in her early 30's, is yelling up the stairs. NORA You're a sick man! Sick! Do ya hear me?! Do ya hear me?! (CONTINUED) 
3   CONTINUED:                                              3 Peeking around the bannister from the second floor is ERNEST TILLEY, also in his 30's, handsome in a boyish way. TILLEY Who's sick? NORA Who do ya think I'm screaming at? How many of you are there up there? There's only you, and you're a sick human being. TILLEY (quietly, coming down a few steps) Where's my white on white shirt? The nice one, you know. NORA It's like yelling through a wall to you. I'm carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are, and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is. TILLEY Yes, the one with the permanent stays. CUT TO: 
4   EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY                               4 BB is now sitting in a cubicle in the office with the Salesman, going over the contract on the car. BB Now don't try to hustle me here ... you know what I mean. I hate being hustled. Give me an honest price, not one of your 'special' deals... give me an honest price. Do I make myself clear? SALESMAN Now, how much are you willing to pay? BB There ya go... there ya go... you're doing it... you're doing one of those hustle numbers. (CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED                                                      14 BB There's a red light, I'm making a space for myself... that's what I'm doing, in order to get into the street... that's something ya do! TILLEY You came out of nowhere... you bolted out of no place... bolted out of nowhere. BB Bolted! At six miles an hour I'm bolting into the street! You schmuck! You schmuck! He moves toward Tilley. TILLEY Back away from me, do ya hear me? Back away from me. BB Back away? You want me to back away? I'll back away. He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car. TILLEY You're a fucking lunatic! He goes for BB, jumps him and they both fall on to the trunk of BB's car. People have started to gather and immediately jump in and pull BB and Tilley apart. 
BB You're a madman! Smashes into me, attacks me... the man is crazy! People continue to pull them apart. MAN #1 Come on now, calm down, calm down. He holds BB's arms. Another MAN grabs for Tilley and tries to pull him off BB. MAN #2 Take it easy... take it easy... (CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              14 TILLEY (to people watching) Get  this guy! Will ya get this guy?   Backs in front of me, and then  kicks my headlight in... and  I'm crazy. You lunatic! Tilley makes another jump for BB.    Again, people try pulling them apart. BB You're going to prison. Death! Death! They're going to give you death! 
BB looks at his brand new Cadillac with the smashed-in side. BB Car only has one sixteenth of a mile, and I've been hit. He turns back and looks at Tilley. BB I'm gonna get even with you, you son of a bitch... I'm gonna get even with you. This is no ordinary traffic accident. TILLEY You want to drive a Cadillac, learn how to drive. You want to get even with somebody? You picked the wrong person to get even with. Nobody backs into traffic, smashes my car and says they want to get even. I'm gonna get even! CUT TO: 
15   INT. DINER - DAY                                              15 Seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast. SAM PICKLES, a heavyset man in his 50's, delicately butters his toast, and is shaking his head sadly. SAM Did ya see 'Bonanza' last night? Can you tell me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over? (CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED:                                              15 GIL, who is pouring half a pound of sugar into his coffee, looks up. GIL Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the Ponderosa? MOUSE, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints at Sam with an investigative look. MOUSE Did he know this guy personally? SAM No... he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.' It doesn't make any sense... he invites a strange colored guy in... invited him in to stay. Is that crazy or what? If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can I stay the night,' I'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'! It's nothing personal, mind you. MOUSE You're not a bigot, is that what you're telling us? SAM Me?   No, I'm not a bigot. GIL If you're not, how come you're making such a big thing out of it? 
SAM It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's on the Ponderosa... he's in the middle of nowhere. It's not like he's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around... we're talking about the West here. It's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West. It doesn't make sense, that's all I'm saying. MOUSE Come on... you're a bigot, that's what you are. (CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             15 SAM Listen, I'll sell tin to anybody ... I don't care who he is. A mark's a mark, whether he's Chinese, Indian or from Mars... I'm thoroughly integrated. Makes no difference to me... I just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house. CUT TO: 
16   EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY                                 16 
Tilley gets out of his car and enters the diner. 
17   INT. DINER - DAY                                             17 He starts walking to the booth where the other tin men are. On his way he yells over to the waitress. TILLEY Florence, eggs and the toast, the way I like it. FLORENCE, who doesn't have too much energy, calls back to Tilley. FLORENCE Not too gooey.     Coffee right away. She trails the last word. Sam is still talking about his problem with "Bonanza." 
CHEESE Up it fifty cents. LOONEY I call... I call. I'm in on this one... I call. MOE We get it, you're calling. CARLY I'm not sure. BB Stay with him. CARLY I don't know. (CONTINUED) 
19   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                19 CHEESE Carly, get out of the hand... I'm holding serious cards. Very serious cards. BB He's bluffing. CHEESE If I'm lying, I'm dying. CARLY I'm out. BB Ballsy move. Moe throws his hand in, too. MOE (to BB) Did you get the new Cadillac? BB Yeah.    It's already been hit. MOE What? BB Didn't have it     five minutes, backing out of     the place, and a guy comes out     of nowhere and bangs into my     car. LOONEY So, what ya got? Cheese throws his hand down. CHEESE Pair of sixes. LOONEY Jacks.     Win. CARLY Shit!    Pair of sixes. MOE (about car) How much damage? BB I bet it's six hundred bucks. (CONTINUED) 
19   CONTINUED:   (4)                                             19 LOONEY Six hundred bucks? I'd get rid of the car. That much damage it won't be any good. You may have dented the frame. BB I didn't dent the frame. LOONEY When you hit the frame, the car doesn't ride right. BB He didn't hit the frame! I'll tell you this, I'm gonna get the son of a bitch. If he would have apologized or something, but this guy gets out, tries to push me around. CHEESE You're kidding me? BB Yeah... the guy's totally off the wall. He takes a sip of his coffee. BB I'm gonna get him... just for the fun of it. CUT TO: 
20   EXT. LOWER/MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY                   20 BB's Cadillac moves through the neighborhood, and we see homes that all look to be about 30 to 40 years old. CUT TO: 
21   INT. BB'S CADILLAC - DAY                               21 Moe is with BB in the Cadillac.   BB is driving.   Moe is looking through some papers. (CONTINUED) 
21   CONTINUED:                                              21 MOE Now, let me see... we gotta be at the Hickey house at four. (he looks at his watch) It's about three-twenty now... we've got some time on our hands. You want to get some coffee? BB No, I'm up to here with the coffee. He indicates his throat. 
MOE They got any good pool halls around here? BB I don't know. (beat) You know what would be fun to do..? Let's try the Life Magazine routine. MOE (smiles) Yeah. CUT TO: 
22   EXT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY                                22 Slightly run-down.   We're looking THROUGH the LENS of a 35mm camera. BB (O.S.) You know, I think we've got to come over about two feet. The SCREEN SHAKES as BB moves the camera. CUT TO: 
23   INT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY                                23 A HOUSEWIFE is looking through the curtains, suspiciously. CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the window and we see Moe and BB moving the 35mm camera around on a tripod. We can faintly hear their talk. (CONTINUED) 
23   CONTINUED:                                              23 BB I think this  is a better position... the light is  hitting it, which is accentuating  the effect we're going for.   It's very good... very good. MOE (in a creative pose) This shows the flaws in the structure... CUT TO: 
24   EXT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY                                24 BB and Moe at the camera and tripod. BB (under his breath, to Moe) She's at the window. MOE Yeah. BB (in a loud voice) This is going to be terrific in Life Magazine. (even louder) Terrific in Life Magazine! (under his breath) Come on outside, honey. 
38   INT. TILLEY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                         38 Tilley is in the tub, lathering himself.   Nora enters and sits on the side of the tub. NORA You know, Tilley, we hardly ever do things together. TILLEY Like what? NORA Do things together that are enjoyable. TILLEY What would we do together for it to be enjoyable? NORA If we went on a picnic... it would be fun. (CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:                                             38 TILLEY I don't understand a picnic... we just go some place... we put a thing on the ground, and we eat. NORA Yes... it's nice to do that. TILLEY Why? I don't get it. It's better sitting at home and watching TV. NORA I think there's something nice about a picnic... it's fun. TILLEY What's fun about it? Ants get into the food... there's bees. I don't get it. We have to drive, it takes maybe an hour to get there, then you sit in grass and eat. Why is that fun? NORA I just thought it might be nice to do something together, that's all... thought it might be fun. TILLEY It doesn't sound like fun to me... you take the stuff you've got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it. It's just as much fun eating in front of the TV, and we do that together, don't we? No ants and no bees... much more comfortable. NORA It's not the same thing. TILLEY Scrub my back, will ya, Nora. Nora picks up the back brush, puts soap on it and starts scrubbing Tilley's back. (CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              38 TILLEY Not too hard! (beat) Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to do anything with you. I'm just a little stymied by a picnic. If you want to go, send me a postcard. Nora drops the brush in the tub and walks out of the bathroom. TILLEY What did I say? 
CUT TO: 
39   EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY                                    39 We see Tilley's Cadillac cruising the streets, obviously looking for someone. CUT TO: 
40   INT. TILLEY'S CADILLAC - DAY                                  40 Tilley is driving with Gil in the passenger seat. GIL I think you make a left here. Tilley turns the car. GIL Yeah... there it is... that's the place... Superior Aluminum... that's it over there. As Tilley pulls up we see BB's car parked outside of the building. TILLEY Okay, Mr. Marengay... here I come. He reaches into the backseat of the car and takes out a crowbar. GIL Hey, Tilley, don't go too wild... (CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:                                             40 TILLEY I'll show the son of a bitch. He gets out of the car, crosses to BB's Cadillac, and smashes in the windshield and all of the windows of the car. TILLEY (as he smashes, wildly) He'll get a lot of air... won't be too stuffy in this car when I'm finished. GIL (calling from Tilley's Cadillac) Quick, Tilley... let's get out of here. Tilley runs back to his car and drives away. CUT TO: 
41   INT. SUPERIOR ALUMINUM SIDING OFFICE - TIGHT SHOT - DAY      41 Of a map of a 15 block area of Baltimore. Colored pins are in place indicating various homes that have been provided with aluminum siding. Another pin goes into place. BAGEL (O.S.) That was a good sale, Double B. Just got a call on a loan... we're in business. 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER ANGLE We see BAGEL. He's a little guy with a black Fedora and baggy pants held up with suspenders. BB stands with him. BAGEL This whole section has been very fertile for us. CUT TO: (CONTINUED) 
41   CONTINUED:                                              41 ANOTHER ANGLE Moe, Looney and Carly are talking to STANLEY FRANKS, a young guy in his early 20's. He is dressed in the "Ivy League" look of the times. MOE (to Stanley) Sure you wanna get into the tin game? STANLEY Money's good, I understand. LOONEY Lot of crazy people you're gonna run into when you're knocking on those doors. Hermits that don't see the outside world, Jehovah's Witnesses that try and sell you the Bible at the same time you're trying to sell them tin. People that are just lonely and want to have conversations. CARLY Every time you step in that door, you've got to be fast on your feet. STANLEY Interesting. MOE (quizzing Stanley) What's the best way to qualify a mark? 
46   EXT. NORA AND TILLEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                46 We see Nora leaving her house,  walking down the    steps and getting into her car. She   STARTS the ENGINE    and pulls away.  CAMERA HOLDS for  a moment, and then    INTO FRAME comes Moe's car with BB  sitting shotgun.     They follow Nora. CUT TO: 
47   INT. SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD SUPERMARKET - DAY                         47 Nora enters. Ten seconds later, BB enters. He pulls a shopping cart from the stall, and follows Nora. 
ANGLE ON MOE as he walks up to the front of the supermarket and looks through the window. 
ANGLE ON FROZEN FOOD SECTION Nora is stopped with her cart and is deciding on vege- tables. BB has a pile of frozen dinners in his arms. BB (to Nora) Are these any good do ya know? These TV dinners? NORA I don't think they're too good for you, not a lot of 'em anyway. She continues to choose her frozen foods.     BB continues talking to her. BB My wife died. NORA (looking up) Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. BB I'm over it now, but it was a very trying time... very trying... I've only just started eating again. (CONTINUED) 
47   CONTINUED:                                              47 NORA You know what would be a lot more healthy and satisfying is to get yourself a chicken... just pop it in the oven for a couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it. Makes a good meal, and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers. BB But then you have to sit and watch it cook. Something seems sad about a man sitting alone in a house and watching a chicken cook. 
CUT TO: 
48   EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY                                        48 Moe is looking through the window of the supermarket. From his POV we see BB and Nora. BB says something and Nora laughs. Then Nora says something and BB laughs, holding her arm. MOE He's an amazing sort... he's got the gift. CUT TO: 
49   EXT. STREET - ACROSS FROM SUPERMARKET - DAY             49 A man sits behind the wheel of a plain-looking Ford. Stanley, the new tin man, pulls up in his car behind him, gets out and walks to the other man's car. He kneels down and talks to the driver of the car. There seems to be a serious exchange but with the sound of TRAFFIC and the cars passing THROUGH FRAME, we're un- able to hear what is taking place. Stanley nods, taps the side of the car, car drives off. Stanley goes back to his car and drives off. CUT TO: 
50   INT. MODEST HOUSE - DAY                                       50 Tilley is selling to a MAN and his WIFE. The Man wears a seersucker suit and a bow tie -- he is a mousie little man, and his Wife is the female equivalent. (CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED:                                              50 MAN Thank you, Mr. Tilley. I can't believe it... this is the most generous thing anyone's ever done ... Swell! Like a gift from heaven. WIFE The Lord has certainly blessed us this evening. TILLEY Well, what can I say... I'm a modest person... I just do what I can to help. 
MAN Thanks again. He opens the door for Tilley and Tilley walks out. CUT TO: 
73   INT. POOL HALL - LONG SHOT - DAY                              73 of a nearly empty pool hall. One guy plays alone in the far corner of the room. Tilley comes down the stairs of the pool hall and starts to walk toward the back rooms -- CAMERA FOLLOWS him. He opens the door and goes through. 
74   INT. GIBRALTAR ALUMINUM SIDING COMPANY                        74 CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW him INTO the offices of Gibraltar Aluminum Siding Company. (CONTINUED) 
74   CONTINUED:                                              74 We PASS BY THREE GIRLS on telephones -- they are solicit- ing jobs for the salesmen. CAMERA GOES FROM one Girl TO the other. GIRL #1 Hello, this is Gibraltar Aluminum Siding Company, we're taking a survey... GIRL #2 ... Would you be interested in our field representative giving you a home demonstration? GIRL #3 ... Home demonstration. We will have some factory representatives in your area today as it happens. A voice calls out. VOICE (O.S.) Tilley!    Let me see you. Tilley walks over to the coffee machine. TILLEY Wing, give me a minute to get a cup of coffee here. Tilley passes Sam on the way to the coffee machine. Sam is looking through the sports page of the newspaper, along with Mouse and Gil. SAM What about 'Super Highway' in the seventh... it's paying 7 to 1. Ran well in its last race. Gil looking at the newspaper. GIL 'Super Highway'... TILLEY Four in the fourth... twenty bucks. SAM Who's that? TILLEY I don't know... it just came to me -- number four in the fourth. (CONTINUED) 
74   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             74 SAM (looking at Tilley) Number four in the fourth -- 'Rider's Revenge' -- 60 to 1, never been in the money. Nice pick, Tilley. Why don't you just throw the twenty dollars in the trash can right now. TILLEY 'Rider's Revenge'... I like that name. I've gotta go and see Wing. (a little pissed off) Look, we can be scientific from now to doomsday, but we gotta be gutsy and go for the big one. Tilley goes through the door into Wing's office. 
75   INT. WING'S OFFICE                                            75 His office    is equally messy and thrown together as everything    else in the Gibraltar offices. As Tilley closes the    door, his coffee, which is filled to the top of his cup,    spills over the top and starts to burn his hand. TILLEY Ah!    Ah! He jumps back, and puts his coffee down on a desk, and wipes his hand on the back of his jacket. TILLEY What's up, Wing? 
Wing is sitting at his desk which is cluttered with papers. WING You lost a sale, Tilley. The Hudsons' loan didn't go through. TILLEY What do ya mean? They wouldn't clear the loan? (CONTINUED) 
75   CONTINUED:                                              75 WING This Mr. Hudson's some guy. He's got three outstanding shoplifting charges, failure to pay child support from a previous marriage ... guy's overdue on his mortgage, overdue on his car loan, and he was fired from his last job for misappropriation of funds. TILLEY What's wrong with this world? There are sick people out there! Thievin' son of a bitch like that takes up my time... cuts into the amount of hours I have available to deal with other people interested in my wares! There's no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country. WING They don't make our job easy, Tilley. TILLEY (lamenting) Wing, it was such a beautiful thing... you shoulda seen how I worked. Like a magician... 'this job is free'! It was my best... my best! There's no fucking justice in this world... there ain't no justice. Tilley goes to pick up his coffee off the desk. 
WING Did you see the paper? TILLEY What section? WING Take a look at this. He hands the newspaper to Tilley. TILLEY (reading) 'Home Improvement Commission... Hearings begin today..." Is this McCarthyism? What are they gonna see? If there are any communists? (CONTINUED) 
75   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              75 WING Just cool down the scams, okay, Tilley? Tilley shrugs his shoulders. CUT TO: 
76   INT. CONVERTED TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY                        76 An area has been set up for hearings to take place. This seems to be a temporary headquarters until something sub- stantial can be worked out. There are boxes and crates all over. There's a long table with a number of commis- sioners behind it, and a defense table a little way across the room. MICROPHONES are being used, and the sound BOOMS -- ECHOING off the walls. A small gallery of people are watching the proceedings. 
ANGLE ON JOHN MASTERS who is presiding over the hearings. Even though he wears a tie and a vest, he is nonetheless very sloppily dressed. To his left and right are two other home improvement commissioners. MASTERS Now,  when you made your initial sales  pitch, did you indicate that  you would be giving free storm  windows with the job? 
SAM (to Tilley) What do you think, 'Sally's pride' in the second? (to Waiter) Get me a Bloody Mary. WAITER (to Sam) Anything other than the Bloody Mary? TILLEY (to Sam) What number is Sally's Pride? (CONTINUED) 
79   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             79 SAM Six. (to Waiter) No, I don't like to eat until the third race. Waiter walks off. TILLEY (putting his hand to his forehead) Six... six... six... six. (beat) I'm thinking one. Whose one? 
SAM Mr. Motor. TILLEY Then that's it, I'm going with one. SAM Tilley, this is insane. You're picking horses because you think you're clairvoyant or something. TILLEY Sam, I'm  not doing too well by checking  the stats, so why not. I put my  hand to my forehead, I see a one  -- Mr. Motor in the second...  twenty bucks. They both look toward the track, the horses race to the finish line. Number nine streaks across the finish line. 
SAM Hallihan's Daughter. TILLEY (laughing) I got it... I got it... He picks up the racing form. TILLEY Three to one... hundred and sixty smackers. (laughs) Hand to the forehead! Hand to the forehead! (CONTINUED) 
79   CONTINUED:   (3)                                             79 SAM You're not exactly talking about a long shot. Mr. Motor, for instance, is coming off at 50 to 1. Tilley taps his forehead, with his eyes closed. TILLEY Third race, I see a six... I see a three. I don't think the verdict's in on that one yet. Tilley stands up and is going through his money and race tickets. 
TILLEY Wing paid a hundred on number five, he loses, I got hundred and forty... next race I'll lay down the bet. (beat) What you taking in this   race? SAM Thrifty's Delight -- number four -- 20 bucks. TILLEY You take Thrifty's Delight -- 20 bucks, I got 20 on Mr. Motor, Wing's got a hundred on Night Fire. What's the odds on Night Fire? SAM Twenty to one. TILLEY I don't see Night Fire winning. Fuck it, I'm not gonna even place the bet... I just made a hundred bucks. SAM What are you, crazy?   What happens if he wins? TILLEY He's not gonna win... I feel it. (CONTINUED)

TILLEY Hey, Wing, we're sitting just off the left of the entrance. I'm gonna lay down your bet right now. See you in a minute. You lost the first race, in case you don't know. CUT TO:

BB I tell you something, she's getting on my nerves. MOE Who, Nora? BB Yeah, yeah... who else is it gonna be... 'who, Nora"!... who else is there? (beat) The whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me. It's one thing when they're with you for a night, but when they live with ya, it's stretching the point. They got a lot of things they bring with them... you go to the bathroom you see 'things' you never saw before. MOE So, what's the todo? (CONTINUED) 
81   CONTINUED:                                              81 BB Well, they move your stuff around and it's not where it used to be... I'm not used to that. MOE You mean all this time you've never lived with a girl? BB What?! Did we just meet? How long we been partners? No, I've never lived with a girl! MOE Boy, oh boy! Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? BB Yes, I did. I came in  last night, she was sleeping on my side of the bed. In my life I  never got out of bed on the left side... in my life, never from the left. (beat; he looks out of the car window) I got close once up in the Catskills. I met this  girl, Dorian. For a week we  were together, but it wasn't the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff. She didn't  have things in my room. 
BB gives a big sigh. BB All this 'cos I'm trying to get even with some guy. (beat) You know what? I think I got to see her and put an end to this. CUT TO:

TILLEY Eight hundred? WING Yeah... I wanna bet eight hundred on Fordnee Lane. TILLEY (feeling uncom- fortable) Fordnee lane -- eight hundred. Sam is looking at Tilley knowing that he's really in a jam. TILLEY Eight hundred. WING (calling to Waiter) Waiter, can you get me a cup of coffee? Tilley looks over to Sam, with panic on his face.    Wing turns back to Tilley and Sam. WING You guys want anything else? TILLEY (nods "no") Er... hum... er... hey, Wing... I tell you, I got a problem. WING What is it?

TILLEY Wing, it was the craziest thing... I didn't want to mention it earlier because it was so nuts... it was the craziest thing. WING What? TILLEY I don't know how to even tell you this without being embarrassed for myself. It was an accident... it's like one of those things out of the blue... it's crazy... you can't explain it... it happens. WING (to Sam) Sam, what is he talking about? SAM (quietly) He had an accident of some sort. TILLEY It happens... I don't know how... I don't know how to explain. It's too crazy, I swear to God, Wing. WING Wait a minute... you're telling me that I didn't win the last race? TILLEY You won, Wing... you won, it's just that you're not getting any money... it was a fluke. I swear, I don't know how it could have happened. A ten-year-old couldn't have made the mistake I made... I don't know, I swear. (CONTINUED)

TILLEY If there was some way I could make it up, believe me, I would, because you know where I stand. There's a beat while Wing just looks at Tilley. TILLEY You know where I stand, Wing. If there was any way, believe me, I'd make it up. I'd give you thirty percent of what you didn't get because it was a fluke... I'm willing to make some kind of retribution. WING You just pocketed the God damned money... you just took my money and slipped it into your God damned pocket, didn't you? TILLEY No. I'd split fifty-fifty with you, that's how badly I feel under the circumstances. WING You get this straight, you son of a bitch, you owe me sixteen plus... I want sixteen plus. 
MASTERS Fossey says it should go down very well with the city council. Could help us appropriate more funds. This goes a long way to establish our credibility in what we're trying to do. We hear a LOUD, SAWING noise and HAMMERING echoing through the warehouse throughout this scene. STANLEY There's a lot more where this came from. MASTERS You know what I think you should do now. Why don't you pull some files... some files that were completed, others that went unsold, and I'll have somebody run it down, talk to the customers and get some statements. STANLEY Pulling files is another thing. That might not be easy. MASTERS To sneak a few here and there when you can. STANLEY I'll see. MASTERS I think that might be good. CUT TO:

SHUBNER (MAN) What does that mean, Mr. Gable? MOE You know what I do, Alan? I pick certain houses that are strategically located, we put up the aluminum siding, and for every referral, for every person who sees this quality job that we do... sees how beautiful it is... I give you two hundred dollars. SHUBNER Two hundred dollars? MOE That's right. God knows how many homes we could sell by people passing this house. It's perfectly placed for that. (taking out his wallet) Alan, this is how confident I feel that this house will drum up business for me. He peels off four hundred dollars and hands the money to Shubner. (CONTINUED)

MOE (interrupting Shubner) I'm certain of it. I'm not giving away four hundred dollars for my health... I'm a businessman, and I'm a good businessman. This is good business for me. I'm giving it away 'cos I believe in this house, believe that it will refer me to other jobs which means money in my pocket, which means money in your pocket. SHUBNER You got a deal, Mr. Gable.

BB I don't know. To be honest with you, I think I'd rather work alone ... he's too green. Is he a pain in the ass? LOONEY No. He don't talk much; he's a good listener, so he can't really get on your nerves. He's a lousy pool player and he can't play cards for shit, but... BB (interrupting) So what good is he?

As he comes out of the Superior Aluminum building and walks towards his car. We see Nora driving her Chevy in front of BB's car. She drives her car forward, and then reverses it hard into BB's Cadillac. He runs over to the driver's side of Nora's Chevy. BB What are you, crazy?! Nora drives the car forward and then backwards again almost running BB down. She rolls down the window (auto- matically) so that she can yell. NORA You're a goddamn tin man! Then she backs the car up.      BB tries to go around the front of the car. BB Wait a minute!     Wait a minute! Nora starts to move the car towards him. He moves away, and her car smashes into the side of his car. She presses the button to the window and rolls it down just a shade. NORA You wanted to win me just to get even with my husband... screw you! She rolls up the window, floors the car, and drives away. (CONTINUED)

PULL BACK to reveal Tilley at the refrigerator in the kitchen of his home. He is putting eggs and rotten tomatoes from the refrigerator into a bowl. He looks at a piece of celery, but it's so wilted and has no strength for his purpose that he throws it down. He picks up other vegetables, but settles for the eggs and tomatoes. He closes the re- frigerator door and makes his way to the living room. We see BB lying on the floor, unconscious. Tilley sits down across from him with the bowl in his lap... he watches BB. BB starts to come to. TILLEY (to BB) You're a sick man! You smash my car, you steal my wife, and now you come to rob me! You're one demented human being. BB tries to focus on Tilley. TILLEY I'm going to call the police and send you to jail... but I'm going to humiliate you first. Tilley throws an egg at BB and hits him in the head.     BB is groggy and confused and still drunk.

There ain't tons of jewelry hanging out of drawers... it ain't like I don't know which watch to put on, I got so many. I'm a working man, trying to make an honest living. What fucking morality you got, asshole?!! Tilley throws another egg at BB and hits him in the head again. Egg yolk drips down BB's face. He tries to get off the floor, but can't. 
BB You're the craziest human being on the face of this earth! Tilley, getting ready with another egg. TILLEY What else do you want from me? Huh? What else?! I've got enough problems with the I.R.S. busting my balls and the Home Improvement Commission bullshit to contend with. I don't need aggravation from you. BB (still trying to get up; wiping his face) Nobody does this to me and lives! Nobody! 
BB (to Waitress, cutting Tilley off) Can I have some French toast and a cup of coffee? (to Bagel) Bagel, what do you want? TILLEY Hey! I'm ordering here. At least you can have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast. BB (to Waitress; ignoring Tilley) French toast and a cup of coffee. TILLEY (to Sam) Sam, this guy gets on my nerves... from day one! I knew it then and I know it now. Tilley stands up from the table and starts to leave. BB I'm back to pressing charges against you!

I have to be brought here to be intimidated... 
BB I can't stand it any longer. You're driving me out of my mind. BB lunges for Tilley across the table, Sam and Bagel try to intervene -- the Waitress doesn't know what to do. BAGEL Come on, guys... take it easy... take it easy. TILLEY Get the people with the straitjackets... this man is out of control. Tilley and BB pull at one another. BB We're gonna finish it... we're gonna finish it. 
Bagel and Sam pull them apart. SAM (to Tilley) Come on, let's get out of here. Sam ushers Tilley to the door. TILLEY I'm not finished with him, Sam. (to BB) You heard me... I'm not finished with you, mister. (CONTINUED)

Moe shrugs his shoulders as if he doesn't know. BB (suddenly angry) This Nora is a pain in the ass, Moe... a pain in the ass. It's worse now than when she used to be around. Moe smiles. BB You wanna hear something? The other night at the Corral Club, I turned down a dance. (CONTINUED)

MOE Hundred to one BB don't dance... a hundred to one against. There's a beat. MOE I'm getting out of the business, BB... I've got nothing for all this. BB Lot of good times, Moe. MOE A lot of good times, but I can't live off the good times. (beat) You know, my brother-in-law has offered me a job at Hess Shoes. I think maybe I should do it. You get there in the morning, you come home at night... you get health benefits... I get to be assistant manager. BB That's it, Moe? You're gonna spend the day measuring people's feet? 'You're an "E" fit... you're a "D" wide... you got a high arch... I'll show you something in an alligator... something with a wing tip...' How can you talk about that all day long?

DELANEY The couple purchased twenty-eight hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record. They say, and I quote here, 'that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided to buy aluminum siding.' (looking up from paper) Is that true? TILLEY It sounds right. DELANEY Are you aware that, according to the Home Improvement code, you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in incentives? TILLEY (shrugs his shoulders) We wanted to be a little more generous, that's all. DELANEY The couple said that they never did receive any money from any other jobs, as you had promised. SAM (leaning into microphone) We didn't get any leads from them. Their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be. It didn't generate the activity that we had hoped. (CONTINUED)

MASTERS (leaning into microphone) Excuse us for one moment. He then leans over to Delaney, and they start to confer. Tilley and Sam watch, wondering what's going on. Masters leans in the other direction, holding his hand over the microphone, and he talks to the other commissioners. They nod in approval, then Masters leans back into the microphone. MASTERS Thank you very much, gentlemen. Should there be a reason in the future to call you back, we would like to reserve that right. TILLEY (leans into microphone) Glad we could be of some service. Tilley and Sam get up from the table and walk out of the building. CUT TO:

127   EXT. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT                           127 Heavy RAIN is falling. Nora, with an umbrella, walks quickly across the parking lot. Suddenly BB slips under the umbrella with her. NORA (reacting sharply) I don't want to see you anymore. She pulls away from BB and continues walking.      BB walks behind her, getting soaked in the rain. BB I gotta talk to you. NORA I don't want to listen. BB Give me a chance to explain.    You owe me that much. Nora still walking toward her car in the downpour. NORA I don't owe you anything. BB lets her walk away.   After a beat, he yells out. BB It was a lousy thing to do, okay? It was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband... but the fact is that I never would have met you otherwise. Nora stops and turns to look at BB. 
BB (more quietly) It was lousy... it was a disgusting, terrible thing... but a lot of good came out of it. NORA What kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing? BB I'm not always a nice guy, I admit that. I got a lot of training in deceit... it's an occupational hazard. They stand looking at one another in the rain. (CONTINUED)

BB I didn't want to have to come here. I wish that I didn't have to ever see you again. I've gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me. I was going through life, sailing along, pretty good... doing okay, and I tried to get even with some crazy guy... and I'm here. NORA The wet becomes you. Gets rid of some of the slickness. BB I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of this, but if this stuff's got to happen, I guess I've got no choice. I wanna... ya know... (he gets angry) ... I wanna be with ya! Okay, I said that... I said it, okay?! I wanna be with ya! It pisses the hell out of me, and I'm gonna tell you that to your face, but I want to be with you because... I miss you and I'd like to live with you... I'd like to marry you... and that's that! Nora eyes him carefully. The rain falls on her umbrella and the rain beats on BB's head. After a long moment. NORA I was hoping for something a little more romantic... but, okay. A slight smile comes to BB's face. CUT TO:

SAM Ya know, Tilley, we been working together for over a year. TILLEY Yeah, must be about that. SAM I've been thinking that sometimes a different combination makes for better luck. Ya know what I mean? I mean, maybe the two of us ain't the right combination. TILLEY I'm just getting used to ya, Sam. SAM Let's face it, we're not exactly setting the world on fire. TILLEY It's a slump... it's a slump, Sam. SAM Maybe it's a slump, but like baseball, some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again. TILLEY You're not serious about this, are you, Sam? SAM Yeah. TILLEY You're serious? You wanna get another partner? You don't think I'm gonna pull out of this? SAM I know you're gonna...

We   split right now and maybe we can   add to that... you know what I'm   saying? TILLEY I know... I know. Change in the lineup. Okay, maybe it'll help... maybe it'll help. (he drinks his whiskey) You got any ideas for a new partner? 
SAM Well, I had a    conversation with Solly Shavitz,    so... maybe I'll go with him. (beat) Mouse is gonna   need a new partner because Dennis   is going into used cars. TILLEY Mouse! Mouse!

I never put my feet up to watch TV. NORA That's the way you are, Tilley, it doesn't mean anything to you. You don't care if they take it all away. It's all you, Tilley!

Then, satisfied that he's got everything he needs, he picks up the files and turns to leave. BB is standing at the door watching him. BB You know something, Stanley, I can always smell a guy who's not made of tin. He walks over to Stanley. BB It's against the law to steal files. I could call and have you arrested and sent to jail, right now. (CONTINUED) 
132   CONTINUED:                                            132 STANLEY I'll put everything back, nobody's the wiser. BB You work for the Commission, is that it? Stan nods "yes." BB Doesn't the Commission have enough information? They got to send out guys like you to spy? 
STANLEY Well, we just started out, and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions, it would give us a lot of credibility in the community. BB walks closer to Stanley, looks at him for a second, grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards. Stanley crashes into the filing cabinet. BB You know what your big problem is, Stanley? You're lazy. If you want to find out stuff, then you dig... you get on the phone... you canvas... 'We're from the Home Improvement Commission...' Go find your leads... that's what we do all the time. You're just lazy, Stanley. If we're doing something wrong, you should collect all your evidence. Instead, you snoop around... steal files. What is this? Undercover time? You think you're breaking up some big drug ring? Is this the Mafia you've infiltrated? All you've got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for Christ sake! (beat) You want some files? He walks over to the filing cabinet, flips through some files and pulls out three files. Stanley has gotten up from the floor. BB throws the files down on the desk. (CONTINUED)

BB Go on, get out of here. Stanley starts for the door, and turns back. STANLEY Why are you doing this? 
BB If it's    not gonna be you, it's gonna be    somebody else... and if it's not    tonight, it's gonna be another    time. Stanley exits the office.

TIGHT SHOT OF CUE BALL hitting the balls on the break. A seven ball drops into the pocket. CAMERA PANS TO BB who has a smile on his face at the successful break he just made. He quickly moves around the table, lines up a shot and sinks the ball. Tilley looks a little concerned. BB moves around the table quickly, confidently. He lines up another shot. He carefully strokes the pool cue between his fingers, hits the ball, and sinks the shot. He moves around the table -- he has a particularly complicated shot. BB Combination... side pocket. The tin men react.   BB hits the ball and sinks it. BB That's four. (CONTINUED)

He hits the ball, it goes     toward the pocket, but bounces back slightly, missing     the pocket. Tilley quickly goes to work. He sinks his      first shot... his second. He makes a difficult shot. TILLEY Yes, sir!    Yes, sir! Tilley    keeps moving around the table, sinking one ball after    the other. He's enthusiastic, excited and confi- dent.     He sinks another ball, and another. He sinks every    ball, then he eyes the eight ball for the coup de grace. 
BB (trying to shake Tilley) You make this one here, and you win. TILLEY Don't I know it... don't I know it! He shoots. The eight ball heads for the pocket and doesn't make it. It hangs up on the felt about two feet from the pocket. BB Bad break. BB quickly goes to work... sinks every one of his balls. He eyes the eight ball carefully. Tilley's nervous. A couple of the tin men make private side bets whether the ball goes or doesn't. BB lines up the shot; he shoots, and it misses, hanging up on the lip of the pocket. TILLEY Tough break. Tilley quickly moves and sinks the eight ball. TILLEY You lose. BB Yeah... that puts an end to one of our differences. Now, concerning you... TILLEY Yeah? (CONTINUED)

BB turns his back on Tilley to move toward the door. Tilley swings with all his might and hits BB in the     back of the head. BB almost falls to the ground. Tilley       goes to hit him again. BB hits him in the face, knocking      him back. Tilley falls back... BB starts to move toward      him. The tin men move in. 
TILLEY Stay out of this... this is between the two of us. BB gets to his feet... the two guys eye one another, moving. BB quickly moves with incredible cat-like speed with four hits into the stomach, really fast, and one hit to Tilley's head. Tilley falls into the rack of pool cues, they all fall to the ground. BB goes to jump on Tilley. He slips on one of the pool cues and falls to the ground. 
ANGLE ON DOOR TO OFFICE Wing is standing watching the fight.    He looks disgusted ... shakes his head. 
BACK TO TILLEY AND BB 
Tilley moves toward BB. BB hits him hard in the stomach again. Tilley keeps coming at BB. He rams him and knocks him to the ground. Tilley pushes BB's head onto the ground, trying to hit it against the floor. BB gets a hand free and hits Tilley hard in the side of the head. The tin men have seen enough and jump in and pull Tilley and BB apart. AD LIBS: "That's enough, you guys" ... "Come on, break it up." BB and Tilley stand up. BB brushes his suit down with his hand. BB I think our business is finished. Tilley just stands watching BB.    BB walks up the steps of the pool hall and exits. CUT TO:

Danny goes into a bar, chicks lined up and down the bar. Walks up to one and says, 'Honey, would you like to fuck?' She'd slap him in the face. He'd move down to the next girl, say the same thing... she'd slap him. Then he'd just keep moving down, going from one girl to the other. Fifteen, maybe sixteen girls would tell him to get lost... to get the hell out of there... BB enters, says "hi" to the Girls, moves to get a coffee. LOONEY ... Call him names... but he doesn't take it personal, you see ... he keeps going, and then the next girl smiles. He says, 'Why don't you buy me a drink'... he scores. Every time.

WING Tilley, it's got nothing to do with the money. TILLEY You're selling me out? You're gonna let them bury me? Jesus Christ, Wing... Jesus Christ! I'm not gonna be able to work in this business? Wing, this was my chosen field! WING Masters was gonna take this company apart. You're the low man on the totem pole, Tilley.

He takes out his wallet from his pocket, and peels off a few notes. WING Here's a thou until you get yourself set up. I can do no better than that. TILLEY (looking at the money) You'd sell me out for a lousy three thousand dollars? Three thousand dollars and I got to go down the toilet? Jesus Christ, Wing, how long the two of us been busting our asses together ... Jesus Christ! We got some history to this relationship for Christ sake. Masters puts a little squeeze on you, you just sell out. Three thousand dollars?! WING The bottom line is, I'm running a business, Tilley.

BB is watching the proceedings.      CAMERA HOLDS ON him. MASTERS (O.S.) Was it the heat of the sales pitch on February 23rd of this year that made you write across a contract 'This Job Is Free'? 
ON TILLEY who is falling apart. TILLEY As I remember, no sale was made concerning those customers. MASTERS It fell out because a loan couldn't be arranged, but the people did agree in principle. (beat) The point that we'd like to stress, is that you misled these people. Told them the job was free. Then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown, and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars. That is misleading and deceptive sales practice. TILLEY It was    temporary insanity. I don't    know... it just came over me ... it    might have been something I ate.     I don't know... it was crazy,    I'm the first to admit it was a    crazy thing to do. Believe me... (CONTINUED)

You violated sections 241 and 247. And concerning a job sold to Mr. and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9, 1962, violations of sections 251 and 257 took place. TILLEY What are all these numbers here? I'm not familiar with all these section violations. 
ON BB who is watching the proceedings intently. MASTERS (O.S.) It is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the Home Improvement Laws, and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state. 
CAMERA ON MASTERS MASTERS It is the decision of this commission to revoke your license to sell aluminum siding...

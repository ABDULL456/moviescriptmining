TWO FOR THE MONEY 
Written by

Final Draft: 10-29-04 
EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1982 - DAY 
A DAD tosses a baseball to his SON.  The boy swings, connects, sends the ball flying.  DAD smiles. 
BRANDON LANG'S VOICE That's me.  Five years old.  I remember that day.  Believe it or not, I remember that hit.  I remember it because of the smile that spread over my dad's face... 
EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1983 - DAY 
BRANDON shooting hoops.  DAD drinks a Bud, frowns as he misses. 
BRANDON VOICEOVER I would've stood there all day to sink one.  Just to see that smile... 
EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1984 - DAY 
BRANDON runs, wears a too-big helmet and pads.  A DOG chases him as DAD throws a football -- long pass -- TIME SLOWS and -- 
BRANDON VOICEOVER To pop, sports were a religion.  To me, it was about purity, a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily forgotten.  I was going to fill the whole house with trophies for him.  There was no doubt in my mind, I was going to make him happy... 
BRANDON catches the ball.  Blinding light, loud CHEERING and 
EXT. STADIUM - 1999 - NIGHT 
Our eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM.  It's a night game. Stands packed.  A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN.  It's the fourth quarter.  Seven seconds left.  Score:  CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27.  A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back to the huddle.  The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG. 10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S every word -- 
BRANDON Last play.  Slant red, right back on two.  On two, Scottie. It's a lock.  A guaranteed TD.  I've already seen it.  So relax. There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear any "Hi moms."  Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me.  See you in the end zone. 
The teams breaks, approaches the line.  Loud CROWD roar. 
BRANDON VOICEOVER I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football.  Set high school records.  Won state championships.  I wasn't driven by joy, it wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of losing. 
TV ANNOUNCERS South West Nevada needs a score.  Seven seconds on the clock. 22 yard line.  Win or lose, this has been a spectacular season for Lang.  The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until -- Lang's got the snap-- 
BRANDON drops back.  A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey. BRANDON pulls free, runs.  OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES.  BRANDON rolls on his back as an OPPOSING PLAYER hurtles in -- mid-air -- unable to stop as -- 300-plus pounds come crashing onto BRANDON'S leg. Sickening sound.  BRANDON clutches his strangely angled limb. 
BRANDON VOICEOVER ... My first thought was I can tape it and play next week.  Then I puked. 
TEAMMATES surround BRANDON, many turning from the sight and -- 
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
BRANDON'S wheeled in. 
INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT 
SURGEONS regard the leg.  IVs are hooked up. 
BRANDON What's the rehab time? 
The SURGEONS talk between themselves, impressed by the break. 
BRANDON When do I play again? 
One DOCTOR examines his x-rays.  BRANDON grabs his smock. 
BRANDON The patient's got a question! 
Anesthetic haze.  A wavy world is melting far, far away. 
SURGEON VOICEOVER Football's done, son... 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
BRANDON'S in a hospital bed.  Big leg cast.  IV's in each arm. 
MAN'S VOICE Brandon... Brandon, it's me. 
BRANDON opens his eyes, focuses on his FATHER (older, cheap suit, beard stubble, clutching a $2 bouquet of flowers). 
BRANDON'S DAD You okay?  I saw what happened on the tv.  Helluva thing that happening like that. 
BRANDON (edge) 
What are you doing here? 
BRANDON'S DAD I brought some flowers.  From downstairs in the shop. 
BRANDON (pressing the nurse's call button) 
No, you gotta go -- where's the nurse? 
BRANDON'S DAD I'm thinking of getting into a new program, Brandon. 
A NURSE comes fast through the door, watches unsure -- 
BRANDON Could you get him out, please? 
BRANDON'S DAD It's okay, we're fine, I'm his father. 
BRANDON --You've reached the Jessica Simpson hot line!  Jessica's going to tell you all about Nick's surprise birthday party and her rockin' new panty line at Wal-Mart, but first, here's a little fan trivia to win a VIP Gold Package back stage pass to Jessica's Omnicon Hotels Summer Tour-- 
A bull-like BOSS appears at BRANDON'S cubicle entry -- 
BOSS Got a job for you, Lang. 
BRANDON I'm in the middle of taping. 
BOSS Bauer's sick, can't update his betting line.  You know anything 'bout sports? 
BRANDON ... Yeah, a little. 
INT. NEIGHBORING CUBICLE - OFFICE - MINUTE LATER 
BRANDON enters a co-worker's cluttered cubicle. 
BRANDON VOICEOVER 900 numbers, audio text, the racket had a lot of names. 
Brandon sits at his co-worker's desk.  He picks up the text copy sitting beside the recording device, looks it over -- 
BRANDON VOICEOVER This guy's gig was sports handicapping.  Predicting winners for people who bet.  I was supposed to just record his picks. 
The thing was, I didn't agree with them. 
Brandon starts changing game selections, re-writing the copy. 
BRANDON VOICEOVER My picks went 9-and-1 that weekend.  By football season, the job was mine... 
INT. BRANDON'S NEW CUBICLE - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER - DAY 
A football is seen, rising and falling from BRANDON'S cubicle. He tosses the football as he records a new update -- 
BRANDON --Kansas City is 7-1 against the point spread versus division opponents coming off a Monday night game.  Take K.C. minus the six points.  Call tomorrow for my pro football game of the year -- Tampa Bay versus Oakland.  That's 900-656-3100.  This is Brandon Lang saying good night and good luck everybody. 
BRANDON pops the tape.  Dons an old UNLV windbreaker.  He shoulders a beat-up bike, walks up front, hands the tape to his BOSS. BOSS hands back a paycheck.  Regarding the amount -- 
BRANDON I went 9-2 in pro football Sunday and hit my third straight Monday night parlay. 
BOSS That's what you get paid for. 
BRANDON I want a raise to 12 bucks an hour. 
BOSS I don't make 12 an hour. 
BRANDON You're not picking 75 percent. 
BOSS If you're so good then bet your own games, get rich and send me a postcard 
from the Riviera. 
BOSS pops BRANDON'S tape in a multi-line answering system and-- 
EXT. LAS VEGAS - DAY 
BRANDON rides a beat-up bike through downtown. 
INT. CASINO - DAY 
BRANDON maneuvers through a bustling casino, enters the SPORTS BETTING ROOM.  He goes to a rack of printed bettling lines for the weekend games, pockets a printed sheet, sees a SUPERVISOR. 
BRANDON Hey Stu, where's the action this weekend? 
SUPERVISOR/STU We're getting big money on Tampa/Oakland.  Everyone's jumping on Tampa Bay. 
BRANDON Crazy. 
Supervisor/stu 
You think? 
BRANDON That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu.  Gruden put that Tampa Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right?  He knows every weakness of that team and every strength.  He knows Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double-teamed to the right.  He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field.  Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday. 
(STU staring at him, pained look) 
...You got sucked into Tampa, didn't you? 
(STU manages a nod) 
Stu, how many times do I have to bail you out?  All right, listen, forget the point spread.  Oakland's going to win outright.  Bet the money line and bet big. 
STU Thanks, B. 
OMIT 
EXT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
BRANDON rides up.  His younger brother, DENNY (18, Metallica t-shirt) and some FRIENDS work on an old, bondo-pocked muscle car in the garage. 
DENNY I scrounged some old headers, B!  Check it out! 
DENNY turns the key.  The car rumbles to life.  He revs the bored-out engine, flashes a shit eating grin. 
BRANDON ... Awesome dude.  That's a righteous ride, Denny. 
INT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
WALTER VO Run the numbers, do the math.  Hold on a sec-- 
Muzak.  BRANDON juggles the phone, searching, finds a pay stub. Amount: $275.00 a week.  BRANDON crosses it out, writes $1000. He crosses that out, writes $1500.  BRANDON pulls a quarter, flips it.  The coin bounces, spins, falls and-- 
EXT. JFK MOVING WALKWAY - DAY 
BRANDON hefts a duffel bag -- sees an ASIAN DRIVER, chauffeur uniform, mirrored shades, holding a sign reading B. LANG and 
INT. MOVING LIMO - DAY 
BRANDON eyes a basket of croissants and juice, grabs a danish, takes a bite, sees the DRIVER watching in the mirror. 
BRANDON I'm gonna pay.  I'll pay you-- 
DRIVER --Pay me?  Pay Walter.  His car.  I'm Milton, I drive for him. 
BRANDON I thought it was a service. 
(moving to the jump seat, seeing MILTON is driving very fast) 
So what's the deal with this guy?  You work for him a long time? 
MILTON Oh yeah, going on two weeks. 
(off BRANDON'S look) 
I was bike messenger.  Walter's driver hit me with his car. I lie on ground, make it look worse than is, big car, you 
know maybe get some money.  Driver call me name, I call him name, he take swing -- big son of a bitch -- so I kick his ass. 
(slicing the air with his hands) 
Walter get out.  I say his driver can't drive, he say you're right.  I say damn right.  He ask if I can, I say hell yeah. He take hat off driver, give it to me. 
Every day with Walter is... 
EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS BROWNSTONE - DAY 
Five stories.  Next to the Brooklyn Bridge.  Manhattan rises across the East River.  The limo pulls up.  BRANDON steps out, regards the structure.  Exhaust fans dot the second floor.  Satellite dishes on the roof.  Security cameras everywhere. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - TOP FLOOR - DAY 
BRANDON follows MILTON through a large, wildly furnished apartment. They pass an large library dominated by rows of bleacher seats from the old Polo Grounds.  A hot dog stand sits outside a wine cellar.  Toys tell us there's a child in the house.  A cha-cha plays from a stereo.  MILTON stops at a set of doors.  About to knock when -- 
WALTER VO 
Bring him in! 
INT. WALTER ABRAMS' OFFICE - DAY 
WALTER smokes a cigarette, talking on the phone as an ASSISTANT in a separate, adjoining space handles four ringing phones. Across the room, a large wall is filled with TVS, each turned to a different channel, no sound. 
WALTER I'll hire the trainers too... Well run it by them, you won't know until you try... So, they can stay the night.  I'll put 'em up at the Plaza, nice suite, park view... Okay double it... Triple it... Everything's about money.  Look, on Sunday, my daughter, an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again.  She 
loves elephants.  Your circus has 10, 
I only want one, my little girl's happiness is in your hands. 
(beat, icy edge) 
I don't need parenting advice from a guy 
who doubles as a clown.  I want an 
elephant and I'll pay.  What'll it take to grease your wheels and get one this weekend?  Hello?... Hello?"  Fuck wad! 
(intercom his ASSISTANT, furious) 
Find Ringling Brothers!  Get me on the horn with someone who understands profit! 
WALTER sees BRANDON.  Something new.  Full focus.  He removes the headset.  Dons his glasses.  Circles around. 
WALTER Whoa, look at you.  The Marlboro man. 
(feeling his bicep) 
Jesus you're in great shape. 
BRANDON I've been in better. 
WALTER (assessing BRANDON as he speaks--) 
Modesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity.  There are rules to 
success, Brandon, and this is rule number one, know what you know and know what you don't know and know I gotta know  everything you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner!  Smile.  C'mon! What the hell is that?  I said smile.  Bigger.  Hungrier.  More teeth.  Ever sell before? 
BRANDON No. 
WALTER If you can sell you'll never starve.  Ever speak in public? Perform?  Anything like that? 
BRANDON I played quarterback in college.  Division one. 
WALTER I know, I'm talking about not in uniform. 
BRANDON I used to sing at church. 
WOMAN Easy for you to say.  You used to model. 
The other WOMEN CUSTOMERS listening nearby nod in agreement. 
TONI Oh yeah, that's true.  Those were the good days.  Sometimes I like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab. 
WOMAN Tightly wound today, aren't we? 
TONI I guess.  Must be the coffee talking. 
(handing her a fashion magazine) 
Here, read a fashion magazine.  Feel more insecure about yourself. 
TONI walks through the shop, checks her watch, passes a row of WOMEN getting lunch-hour nail jobs.  BRANDON'S squeezed in among them.  Only guy there.  Cotton between his toes post-pedicure. Hunched and uncomfortable as the WOMEN around him discuss boyfriends and relationships. 
TONI ... Brandon? 
BRANDON Hi. 
TONI I'm Toni.  Walter said you'd stop by. 
BRANDON Nice to meet you. 
(immediately, re: the pedicure) 
This was his idea. 
TONI I know. 
BRANDON He makes all his employees do this? 
TONI Every one. 
BRANDON How often? 
TONI Once.  Before they start work. 
BRANDON Weird. 
TONI You think? 
BRANDON I've never had my nails done before. 
TONI I can see that. 
(putting his hands in water) 
Strong hands.  Nice.  Do you drink? 
BRANDON No thanks.  I'm fine. 
TONI No, do you drink? 
BRANDON Excuse me? 
TONI Alcohol.  Are you a drinker? 
BRANDON I've been pretty focused on staying in shape.  I mean a beer once in a while. 
TONI Smoke? 
BRANDON No. 
Toni 
What about gambling? 
BRANDON What about it? 
TONI Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time. 
(stopping work, regarding him) 
I asked do you bet.  Are you a bettor? 
BRANDON No. 
TONI Really?  Why not? 
BRANDON meets her gaze.  Gears turning.  She's hitting on him. 
BRANDON Toni, huh?  Are you here full-time? 
TONI It's my shop, I better be.  Why don't you gamble? 
BRANDON Well I'll tell you, Toni.  I bet on something once.  Risked everything I had and lost. 
TONI So? 
BRANDON I swore I'd never do it again. 
Toni 
You're sticking to that story? 
BRANDON back at the mike.  Groping for a delivery. 
BRANDON John Anthony here, ready to make all your betting dreams come true!  Call now and let me win for you!  The point spread in the Indiana/Michigan game's up to four, making that game a gimme-- 
INT. BROWNSTONE - WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Another CD sails out.  WALTER staring at BRANDON -- 
WALTER What is that shit?  You spent 6 years bouncing from one dead-end job to another.  Riding to work on a frigging bicycle.  Were you making some kind of statement?  What the hell were you afraid of? 
BRANDON I wasn't afraid of anything.  I was working my ass off, trying to get back in the game. 
WALTER You are back in the game!  Convince me you belong here! 
INT. BROWNSTONE - DOWNSTAIRS GYM - NIGHT 
BRANDON pumping it out.  Music pounds on a stereo.  BRANDON watches himself in the mirror, muscles straining.  He suddenly slams the bar down, goes down the hall, grabs the mike, reads from the copy and -- 
BRANDON This is John Anthony here, and from Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money stays and plays with me!  Winning consistently's the name of this game and I always remain the same, winners on a consistent basis, 77 percent winners!  So sit back and relax because 
because it's a scud attack this weekend and I'm shelling your bookmaker! 
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 
BRANDON bounding up to WALTER'S office. 
BRANDON VOICEOVER Game one of my three-team parlay is  Michigan hosting Indiana; the big boys at Michigan are just 2-7 against the spread as a double-digit home favorite and with arch rival Wisconsin on deck next week, Indiana will catch them looking ahead!  Take Indiana plus the 16 points!  It's a lock! 
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY 
WALTER listening to the CD.  BRANDON watching him. 
BRANDON VOICEOVER You want more?  John Anthony's the man with a plan to make you money!  Game two goes to Florida and North Carolina!  I don't care how many points you gotta lay with Florida, lay it!  They'll win by 50! 
WALTER pops the CD, heads for the window. 
BRANDON C'mon!  First too little, then too much -- 
WALTER It's a start. 
BRANDON Tell me what you want. 
WALTER No.  What do you want, Brandon?  That's what this is about! 
WALTER stops.  Steadies himself.  He pulls a prescription vial. Sits.  Passing, pained look. 
BRANDON Walter?  Are you okay? 
WALTER ... Huh?... It's nothing. 
(popping a pill from the vial, beat, taking another) 
... Small one. 
BRANDON Should I call someone? 
WALTER Not unless they got a spare heart.  I'm okay. 
WALTER finds a cigarette.  Lights it.  Savors the first drag. 
BRANDON What are you doing? 
WALTER Courage wants to laugh. 
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING 
BRANDON riding his bike hard across the Brooklyn Bridge.   Wearing earphones while he listens to a radio sports show. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER/keith jackson vO 
--Talking about college defenses you have to include Oklahoma. The Okie boys are 2nd-ranked going into this weekend and facing an offensive powerhouse in Oregon. 
That game and more coming up after the break. 
A commerical's heard as BRANDON pedals away, glances up and --surreal sight -- Brandon hurtling at an ELEPHANT'S ASS -- he swerves -- looks back at the TRAINER walking the pachyderm across the city span and -- 
INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY 
A TV SCREEN FILLS FRAME.  A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME starts. ANNOUNCERS riff a MEDLEY of analysis and scores. 
PULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON comes out of the shower, towel around his waist, putting on a clean shirt.  Through a ground floor window the boardwalk can be seen.  A child's party is in progress. The elephant ambles by wearing a birthday hat, the bemused TRAINER walking beside him.  TONI and WALTER are seen arm-in-arm with their 6-year-old daughter, JULIA.  WALTER crosses the lawn, looks through the window. 
BRANDON'S switching between football games blaring from the tv. A radio blasts scores and updates.  WALTER knocks on the window, mouths "How we doing?"  BRANDON grabs a betting sheet, writes something, holds it up -- 0 and 9.  WALTER scowls.  BRANDON realizes it's upside down, flips it to read -- 6 and 0.  WALTER kisses the glass and -- 
EXT. BROWNSTONE - SAME TIME - DAY 
WALTER catches up to TONI, walks through the party with her. 
WALTER He's a machine, all he does is work out and pick winners.  Talk about fit.  Go  take a peek, see him with his shirt off.  I did. He's a serious side of beef. 
TONI Enjoy your daughter's party. 
WALTER Check him out, you know you want to. 
TONI Get out of your head, Walter.  It's a bad neighborhood. 
INT. OFFICE OVERLOOKING SALES ROOM - SAME TIME - DAY 
JERRY SYKES types stats into a computer as he fields a call. Three other computer screens flash football info and data. Large, complex wall graphs chart esoteric team trends.  A framed promotional picture shows JERRY standing in a bank vault, the banner type below reading "Jerry 'The Source' Sykes, Creator of The Sykes Sports Wagering System." 
JERRY (typing on a computer as he speaks) 
--I know it's a new stadium, I'm asking if they used Astroturf or Astroplay?... Astroplay, it has a rubber silica base, like ground up tires... Look, I don't have time to explain abrasion indexes and resistance scales to you, trust me, it makes a big fucking difference... 
(looking through the glass, seeing WALTER showing BRANDON around) 
So bribe a security guard, sneak in with the grounds crew, do what you have to -- this is what I pay you for. 
INT. ENCLOSED OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY 
WALTER and BRANDON enter.  It's spacious.  Nicely appointed. A glass partition overlooks the sales room. 
WALTER I had three guys who picked games.  I fired one last weekend. I'm giving you his job.  This is your office.  From here  out your picks are going straight to our biggest customers.  How do you like it? 
BRANDON What's not to like? 
JERRY SYKES appears at the door.  Fast glance at BRANDON, attention to WALTER -- 
JERRY The Miami/New York point spread shifted a half tick up to 10. 
WALTER What do you think? 
JERRY Miami's still a lock.  The win/loss ratios and RPI ratings are off the charts.  I'm keeping it on my sheet. 
WALTER Jerry's our top handicapper, came to me straight out of grad school.  Jerry, meet the new kid in town. 
JERRY Whoa, phone guy makes good.  Big jump from the 900 numbers. Watch out you don't get a nose bleed.  Just kidding, best of luck, I gotta get back to work. 
BRANDON Pleasure meeting you.  By the way, Jerry, New York's gonna win straight up.  They always play the fish tight.  Tonight it's foregone, they win outright. 
JERRY Really?  Listen up, stick to college, sonny.  You have to work up to pro ball around here.  Nice try though. 
WALTER (watching JERRY walk away) 
I got three guys who can handicap and 20 who can sell but I never had one who could do both, not really, not until now. 
BRANDON You mean me? 
WALTER Not you.  John Anthony. 
BRANDON John Anthony doesn't exist. 
WALTER That's a shock 'cause I'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair! 
BRANDON Look, making predictions is one thing -- but pushing people to bet, it's not me. 
WALTER Pushing people?  Get real, this country was built on gambling. Look at Wall Street -- one big casino.  The state spends millions hawking the lottery.  If people want to pay for advice on who to bet, who are we to say no?  Stop being selfish, spread the word!  Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive. 
BRANDON You got a whole room full of salesmen. 
WALTER Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent winners. 
WALTER CON'D What's the matter?  Gonna lose your purity?  C'mon, what do you think selling is?  We're just talking a few well-timed phrases. Let's start with an easy one.  A throw-away.  "I don't want your money, I want your bookie's fucking money?" 
BRANDON I don't want your money -- 
WALTER --Jesus, don't start that shit again.  Sell me. 
BRANDON I don't want your money, I want your bookie's money! 
WALTER What happened to the fuck? 
BRANDON Nothing, I just don't talk like that. 
WALTER I can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck. 
BRANDON It's not that I can't.  Why do I have to? 
WALTER Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can.  Fuck is your friend.  Fuck can be your best friend. 
BRANDON I'm happy for you and your friend, Walter, but I'm not using it. 
WALTER Chaucer used it 600 years ago.  It was good enough for him. C'mon-- 
(calling out to the SALESMEN) 
--this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck! 
A chorus of "Fuck yous" fill the air. 
WALTER C'mon, repeat after me -- fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.  Fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me -- try it. 
BRANDON It's not me.  Let it go. 
WALTER Backbone.  Almost as good.  We'll keep working on the other thing... So, you really like New York in tonight's game? 
EXT. MANHATTAN - MID-DAY 
Looking down Fifth.  Thousands of heads in a hurry to get somewhere. Here comes BRANDON and WALTER. 
BRANDON Where are we going? 
Congratulations. 
BRANDON I'm picking now with you and Jerry. 
CHUCK (ducking back into his office) 
Whatever. 
The MAN shuts the door, leaves BRANDON looking at the KEEP OUT sign.  SOUTHIE stops for a coffee, has seen the exchange. 
SOUTHIE Don't take it personal.  Chuck's got a condition, get's anxious around people. 
CHUCK closes his blinds, blocks out his glassed-in walls and-- 
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY 
BRANDON'S poring over sports pages and injury reports when TAMMY enters his office, sits on his desk, extends a lead sheet. 
TAMMY His name's Amir, he's a dime bettor.  Owns a dry cleaners.  We got him for the subscription.  He's on line three. 
(leans in, gives BRANDON a kiss) 
TAMMY Walter wanted your first call to be special.  Go get 'em tiger. 
BRANDON (picking up) 
Amir, my man, John Anthony here! 
INT. NEW JERSEY DRY CLEANER - DAY 
A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (ratty t-shirt, beard stubble, sleepless look) stands in the back of a low-end dry cleaners. 
AMIR Yes, hello. 
BRANDON Today's your day, Amir!  It's a Pamplona thing, I'm running wild in the streets this weekend!  Starting with the hottest Saturday of my life!  How much can you lay with your bookie?  20 large? 
Amir 
You crazy?  No way.  I was betting a thousand a game but... Look, I saw an ad.  I was just calling to see-- 
BRANDON --Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime!  Texas plus the six points! They win by two touchdowns! 
Amir 
Really?  I like Oklahoma in that game. 
BRANDON (looks up, sees WALTER watching) 
Oklahoma huh?  Okay... well considering that, I like Texas even more now. 
Amir 
I shouldn't have called.  Thank you for-- 
BRANDON --Amir, buddy, I'm talking about banging out the biggest win of your life. 
WALTER crosses, whispers to BRANDON.  Into the phone: 
BRANDON Hold on, I got Vegas on the line. 
(pressing HOLD) 
WALTER There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients -- they're all in the hole.  The second they pick up the phone, wham!  Right to the point!  You're above them!  Let 'em feel it!  More confidence!  More John Anthony! 
(punches speaker phone) 
BRANDON/into phone 
Amir, what's your favorite drink? 
AMIR Favorite drink?  I dunno, Pina Colada. 
BRANDON Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink.  But for now, this is what you're gonna do.  First, you're going to bet 20 large on Texas, then you're going to put on a 
Hawaiian shirt, whip up your sweet little rum concoction with the orange slice and 
the cherry, turn on the game and play 
with the little umbrella while you sit 
back and watch Texas tear those Okies a 
new asshole -- and when you call me back 
after winning 20 G's the first thing out out of your mouth will be words every fratboy knows -- "Thank you, sir, may I have another!" 
AMIR ... What about payment? 
BRANDON Good question.  What about it? 
Amir 
Well how much is this going to cost me? 
BRANDON We take a percentage if WE win, Amir -- not exactly your problem of late, is it? 
WALTER (continues to his dresser, manic) 
What a show!  You should have seen him!  I'm sitting there watching him roll and I swear he made me want to grab a phone and call! I took the sales boys out to Smith and Wo's.  Get 'em primed for the 
weekend.  Chuck got drunk, took a swing 
at one of the deer heads on the wall. 
Just blowing off steam.  I'm gonna hire more guys Monday.  Put in more phones.      Everything's amping up.  It's okay.  There's room.  I'll tear down a 
few walls, fit another 10 desks down 
there easy.  I'm gonna do a whole dot-com thing around him! Oh shit, if I had me when I was his age... I never had a 
protege.  Someone you hand it all down to.  Anything happens to me, he steps in!  Just knowing that, with the thing... I 
mean that's just beautiful! 
(changing into workout clothes) 
Just beautiful. 
TONI What are you doing? 
WALTER Going for a run.  See the sunrise.  We're doubling volume this week.  And doubling it again after that.  He can pick, he can sell, he's gonna change things around here.  He's the real deal. Knows sports from the inside.  That's how he picks.  Guy like him comes along once in a -- a -- 
TONI -- 100 years. 
WALTER Yeah, a lifetime. 
TONI Walter, come to bed. 
WALTER Not tired. 
TONI You're exhausted. 
WALTER I'm just gonna run the bridge, up Fifth, circle Central Park, be back in no time. 
TONI Get in bed.  Lie down next to me.  Come on.  Come here, Walter. 
WALTER Just a quick once-around. 
TONI Roll on your stomach for a minute. 
WALTER Just for a sec.  I've gotta meet the trainer tomorrow.  Told me to run.  Run in place, or from one place to another... 
WALTER lays down.  TONI gently massages his back.  She leans in, whispers to him.  We sense she's done this before. 
TONI --I know.  Of course you do.  This is no time to sleep, Walter... Can't sleep now... Just because you're so tired... Completely, totally, utterly exhausted... I'll be here when you get back from your 
TONI CON'D run... Right beside you... You go on now, baby, I'll stay right here... It's okay... Close your eyes... Just for a second before you leave... I'm not going anywhere... I'll just hold you-- 
(quietly crying) 
I'll wait right here for you... 
TONI'S whisperings become a constant, soothing, mantra.  WALTER'S eyes close.  Dressed in sweats and sneakers.  Gone.  TONI loosens his laces, covers him with a blanket, slides under the covers. TONI kills the light.  Seen in darkness.  Holding WALTER close, draping a protective arm around and -- 
INT. SALES ROOM - DAY 
A SLEDGE HAMMER smashes through a wall.  DELIVERYMEN dolly in new desks and chairs to accomodate more salesmen.  SOUTHIE and REGGIE at the water fountain, watch the room expand. 
SOUTHIE You see him this morning?  Wearing those suits to work now. 
REGGIE He keeps picking 90 percent I'll press the fuckers for him. 
WALTER walks in, stops at the front desk, speaks to TAMMY. 
WALTER What a weekened!  Helluva Christmas bonus if this keeps up. Where'd you hide the phone sheet? 
TAMMY locates the sheet, hands it to him.  WALTER studies it, starts away.  He sees something, stops.  Walking back -- 
WALTER (to TAMMY, pointing on the sheet) 
Who's this?  This guy here -- Lang? 
TAMMY I dunno, he said it was personal. 
WALTER Did Brandon take the call? 
Tammy 
He wasn't in. 
WALTER Don't mention it to him.  And don't patch the guy through.  Say Brandon doesn't work here, you can't reach him. 
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY 
BRANDON at his desk, reading The New York Post.  JERRY enters. 
JERRY You know anything about Stokley being out this weekend against the New York? 
BRANDON A knock would be nice, Jerry. 
JERRY I'm underwater here, man.  Yes or no? 
WALTER This kid's different, he's different -- wait a minute.  This has nothing to do with you, you know I do business up here. Why are you so angry? 
TONI Are we actually going to have this conversation?  Are you completely clueless? 
WALTER You're jealous.  Look at you! 
TONI Of what?! 
WALTER Gee, I don't know -- Brandon screwing someone? 
TONI You really are fucking crazy, Walter!  That never entered my mind! 
WALTER That's not where those thoughts enter. 
TONI Fuck you! 
TONI goes into the kitchen, slams the door.  Calling to her -- 
WALTER You'll be happy to know he didn't sleep with her.  I paid her off just for coming.  No pun intended. 
WALTER grimaces, clutches his side.  WALTER pops one, two -- three pills from a vial, let's them settle as JULIA, princess clothes, runs down the hall, leaps in his arms.  WALTER stifles the pain of her embrace.  Carries her down the hall. 
WALTER ... Julia my jewel, you're getting big angel. 
JULIA Can we play princess, Daddy? 
WALTER Course we can.  Who am I gonna be? 
JULIA You're the king, daddy, like always. 
INT. SPORTS ADVISORS TV SET - NIGHT 
BRANDON practicing John Anthony expressions.  A pretty MAKE-UP ARTIST finishes touching him up. 
MAKE-UP ARTIST I made 500 bucks off your picks last week.  I was thinking maybe we could go out later and get a little wild... you can help me blow some. 
BRANDON Let's get really wild and you can blow mine. 
The GIRL laughs.  BRANDON crosses the stage, takes his place on the set between WALTER and JERRY.  CHUCK sits off to the side, eating a muffin.  WALTER looks voer at BRANDON -- 
WALTER Look at you.  I like the tan. 
BRANDON Toni put one of those lamps down in my room.  The ladies do love it. 
TECHNICIAN 60 seconds! 
WALTER John's up first tonight, Jerry. 
JERRY What? 
WALTER John Anthony's leading off tonight. 
JERRY John Anthony's leading? 
WALTER Somebody tell the engineer there's an echo in here. 
JERRY Two years I lead and you bury me in the deck over a few lousy fucking weekends?  The Sykes System's based on percentages -- the long haul. 
WALTER No, that's called a mutual fund, Jerry. 
JERRY (to CHUCK) 
You gonna sit for this shit? 
CHUCK shrugs, finishes his muffin.  JERRY turns to WALTER -- 
JERRY ... He leads, I'm walking. 
WALTER He's leading. 
JERRY unclips his microphone, stands. 
WALTER That's baby talk!  You need a fucking rattle!  Sit down! 
(staring him down) 
You probably think you know what I'm gonna say... how everything you got I pay for.  Your apartment, your car, your kid's school -- and it's true.  You'd be right.  I do.  Now I don't know, Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course maybe you don't.  I don't see you taking that chance.  My gut says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not on a gamble, a hunch yet.  And if you do, fuck it.  I give a shit?  The only reason I keep you around is it makes me look loyal and him-- 
(pointing at BRANDON) 
--look good!  Now you got three fucking seconds to stop standing there like dog 
shit on my porch and sit down and shut 
the fuck up or you can kiss everything you have goodbye!  The clock's started. 
Beat.  JERRY sinks into his seat.  WALTER turns to BRANDON. 
WALTER See that?  He made the safe play.  Me, I would've walked, but I'm a fucked-up human being.  That's the difference between us. Right there.  Jerry's a statistician, I'm a gambler.  And you're not a gambler, not really -- until you bet more than you can afford to lose. 
TECHNICIAN Five, four, three, two, one -- 
WALTER Welcome to week 7 of pro football! 
INT. SPORTS ADVISORS TV SET - BACK HALL - NIGHT 
WALTER You weren't listening!  You're not paying attention to me!  There's no such thing as too far!  Push everything as far as you can! Push it until it starts pushing back and then push some goddamn more!  Remember that when you're with this guy today! 
OMIT 
INT. PUERTO RICAN MANSION - DAY 
Palatial.  Drapes dance before the open doors.  Music plays. BRANDON and WALTER sit in the living room.  Peaceful beat. 
WALTER I start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit me down, I wanna kack here. 
A beefy BODYGUARD enters followed by a tan, broad shouldered MAN of 50.  WALTER extends his hand. 
WALTER Mr. Novian!  What can I say?  An honor.  This is my associate, John Anthony. 
MR. NOVIAN nods, settles in a chair.  WALTER and BRANDON sit. 
NOVIAN You should know I think that most sports services are a complete scam... However, I hear your boy here's having quite a season. What's your system? 
WALTER (looking around) 
Our system?  Fuck that, what's your system? 
Walter laughs.  Novian stone-faced, glances at his watch when-- 
BRANDON It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Novian.   You have a beautiful home.  Let's start with how much you bet. 
NOVIAN A million a game, across the board. 
BRANDON Nice round number, is that our ceiling here?  Is that the most we're working with? 
NOVIAN "We're" not doing anything until I hear how you feel about this weekend. 
BRANDON Do you rent that yacht out there? 
NOVIAN I own it. 
BRANDON Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend.  That may sound cocky, I don't care.  I didn't come down here to lie. 
NOVIAN Do you have inside information? 
BRANDON If I did I wouldn't share that with you.  My record speaks for itself.  The truth is I know these teams better than they know themselves.  I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes the Monday Night parlay. 
NOVIAN Why should I believe you? 
BRANDON With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to. 
NOVIAN I can afford to do any damn thing I please. 
BRANDON Can you?  What I'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win?  Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy.  Or was, until you called me. 
Charged beat.  A tight grin's glued to WALTER'S face. 
BRANDON The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian -- up-front -- in addition to a percentage of every game you win. 
NOVIAN Fuck you.  I never pay anything up front. 
BRANDON And we've never charged it before.  But with what you're betting, 250 up front's a bargain.  You want this weekend's winners, that's my offer.  Take it or leave it. 
NOVIAN (standing) 
... Step outside. 
BRANDON and WALTER exchange looks, unsure where this is going. 
EXT. NOVIAN'S BALCONY - DAY 
NOVIAN and BRANDON regard a group of GIRLS lounging topless by a pool. 
NOVIAN ... Ever pick oranges, Mr. Anthony? 
BRANDON Nope. 
NOVIAN I have, in fact it's how I started. 
Builds character.  See those girls down there?  Pretend they're oranges and pick some ripe ones.  Take 'em upstairs and build some character.  Mr. Abrams and I need to refine the terms. 
BRANDON goes to an ice-filled cooler by the door, pulls a bottle of champagne, carries it dripping down to the pool and-- 
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY 
A FOOTBALL BETTING FORM fills FRAME.  Two columns of teams seen. Point spreads penciled in between them.  11 of 12 games checked off.  Monday Night the last to be decided. 
PULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON in his office, the unfinished form before him.  A young SALESMAN appears at the door. 
YOUNG SALESMAN They need it, Mr. Anthony. 
BRANDON picks up his pen, regards the box for Monday Night -- Seattle or New Orleans?  The point spread is Seattle minus 3. A box beside it is for the over/under.  That number is 34. BRANDON about to pick when he stops, looks up, smiles -- 
BRANDON Three questions.  What's your mother's name? 
YOUNG SALESMAN Shelia. 
BRANDON What street did you grow up on? 
YOUNG SALESMAN Atlantic Avenue. 
WALTER Nice job, now don't blow it by getting ahead of yourself.  I'm looking beyond the money. 
BRANDON You can afford to, you're holding it all.  C'mon, I only want what's fair, Walter. 
WALTER smiles.  Wraps an arm around.  Puts him in a headlock. 
WALTER "Fair?"  Honey, you don't know what fair is.  What's fair is not giving you the money.  Now I'm only gonna say this once. If you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a sneeze you have to do more than think about it.  Or ask for it. You gotta earn it.  You gotta fight for it.  You gotta rip it out of my fucking talons.  John Anthony would know that.  That's what he'd do.  As a matter of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as John Anthony.  'Cause from now on I'm not talking to you about money. 
BRANDON pulls free.  Stunned.  Seething.  MTV pounds from the TVs, people dancing all around.  TONI walks up. 
TONI The big winner.  How are you doing? 
BRANDON I'm winning... I'm winning... 
BRANDON leaves.  WALTER pulls her close, moves with the music. 
WALTER Dance with me.  Close, that's it.  I gotta dance with you more. Listen, I'm thinking of buying a plane.  Big one.  G-something. We can just get on it and go, you and me, anywhere in the world, any time we want.  There's a house for sale in the Bahamas with a runway right beside it.  Comes with its own 50-foot boat. Two for one.  What an investment.  Anything happens, you and Jules always have it.  Let's go down and check it out.  Next week, just us, barefoot in the sand. 
(TONI watching him) 
Well say something. 
TONI ... Are you gambling again, Walter? 
WALTER What?  Oh, c'mon -- hell no. 
TONI Look me in the eye and say it. 
WALTER I am not gambling.  Not now, not ever.  18 years clean.  That shit's over. 
TONI It's never over, Walter.  You know that. 
WALTER Get a lie detector if you don't believe me.  Shoot me with truth serum.  Baby -- we just made two-million dollars.  I'm working miracles here.  Now can I enjoy a dance with my wife?  Huh? I swear, it's a shame you can't drink, we need something to kill that bug up your ass. 
TONI smiles.  WALTER holds her close, kisses her and -- 
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 
BRANDON'S Mercedes speeds into the city. 
INT. MANHATTAN STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 
Big breasts, G-strings, testosterone.  BRANDON in a booth with a topless BLACK GIRL.  We can see from his moves it's the Million Dollar Man talking.  Drinking Dom.  Flashing cash.  He whispers something to her.  She reaches for her top as he grabs the hand of her topless FRIEND and -- 
INT. STRIP CLUB - PRIVATE BACK ROOM - NIGHT 
DARKNESS.  A light goes on, illuminates a cave-like bedroom. MUSIC from the club rumbles through the space, reduced to a driving bass beat.  The ASIAN GIRL pulls an outrageous wad of cash from BRANDON'S pocket, tosses it confetti-like in the air as -- BRANDON, the ASIAN GIRL and the BLACK GIRL fall on the gold lame sheets.  Clothes are peeled off, money sticking to their bodies, GIRLS clawing the cash from BRANDON'S skin -- 
Black girL 
(kissing his neck, hands roving) 
What's it feel like to do what you do?  To win like that? 
BRANDON flips her over, leans in from behind. 
BRANDON It's just like sex.  You start by massaging the numbers, very relaxed, 
getting a feel, see how they move.  Then there's a shift, a plan forms and you connect to your teams. 
(the GIRL moans, reacting to something unseen) 
Sunday's like penetration and the games have started and teams are scoring and 
you're inside and you're doing it and 
it's doing you, feeling every shift, 
every score, every trickle of sweat -- 
the giving, taking, the long, the short, 
excitement growing bigger and bigger-- 
(BRANDON cupping her breasts) 
And it's not an idea or part of you anymore -- it is you, all of you -- and the crowd's roaring and the clock's 
ticking and you know everything except 
how it'll end and and then you've won -- over and over and over and it's like one, big, huge, insane, weekend-long orgasm. 
FRIEND (totally turned on, kissing him) 
Nice job description. 
BRANDON presses her below FRAME, naked ASIAN GIRL climbing on top as the sound of APPLAUSE is heard, building in volume and-- 
INT. BROWNSTONE SALESROOM - DAY 
25 SALESMEN stand on their desks, clapping, as BRANDON passes through on the way to his office.  Only it's John Anthony who's strutting through the room, high-fiving SALESMEN, kissing the GIRLS, a tanned, tailored, magnetic presence and -- 
INT. BROWNSTONE - BRANDON'S OFFICE - MORNING 
WALTER waits within, standing at the window overlooking the sales room as BRANDON enters. 
TONI "What do I do for myself?"  If you drove past my salon and went two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years ago with a needle in my arm.  I was a 5-bag a day junkie.  I would have sold Julia to get high.  Keeping it all on track, that's what I do for myself. 
BRANDON That's not living, Toni.  That's just maintaining.  You cashed in. 
TONI What the hell does that mean?  Are we talking perfection here? 
BRANDON Well, nobody's perfect... except me last weekend going 14 and 
BRANDON pulls up outside her shop.  TONI regards him. 
TONI Yeah, that's living. 
BRANDON Hell yeah.  You oughta try it some time. 
TONI (stepping from the car) 
Thanks for the ride, John... 
TONI enters her shop and -- 
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Eight football games are winding down, another four starting. Favor one of the TV SCREENS.  A network sports update.  CHRIS BERMAN motor-mouthing a one-minute list of results. 
CHRIS BERMAN -- Big loss for Washington, going down 24-12 in Miami.  Saint Louis upsets K.C., 34-14.  And another Sunday surprise, Philly trounces Pittsburgh, 23-10. 
CHRIS BERMAN continues with the scores as -- a PENCIL runs down BRANDON'S betting sheet -- checking off results -- loss --  loss -- loss -- loss -- loss -- the pencil pauses -- suddenly snaps from the pressure of the person's hand and -- WALTER stares at BRANDON, seated on the sofa, watching the tvs.  It's obvious they're getting killed. 
BRANDON I'm gonna go work out. 
WALTER Sit down!  You're watching every game!  Every second of every minute of every game!  Don't even think of leaving! 
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
All but one tv is dark.  The last game ends and a remote control suddenly shatters the screen.  WALTER paces the office.  BRANDON still on the sofa.  No one else in the room.  A wall clock reads 12:19 AM.  WALTER picks up BRANDON'S betting sheet, holds it like a dead fish. 
WALTER ... How do you go 3 and 11?  Wanna know how -- you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday!  It rained in Cincinatti!  Two starting QBs didn't play!  You're a handicapper, not a psychic! 
BRANDON There's still Monday night and the parlay. 
WALTER Fuck Monday night!  Fuck the parlay! 
You were pissed at me, right?  The commission thing? 
BRANDON I don't know. 
WALTER You fucked with me, right?  Joke's on me, right?  The money thing. Okay, I think we're on dangerous ground here but I'm giving you a bump, 10 percent.  Now what about Monday night's game? You want to look over that pick?  Because everyone's gonna double down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in. 
BRANDON Monday night's fine. 
WALTER You'd bet your mother's house on it? 
BRANDON I don't bet. 
WALTER If you did? 
BRANDON I like the pick, Walter. 
WALTER On your mother's house or not? 
BRANDON With my mother in it. 
INT. UPPER EAST SIDE BAR - NIGHT 
Up-scale.  BRANDON sits at the end of the rail, empty glasses lined before him, watching a wall TV with the sound off.  Monday Night Football's on.  His glazed expression suggests it's been a long three hours.  PATRONS around him socialize, laugh, enjoy the bar's oasis-like vibe.  But for BRANDON, it's just him and the game as -- a GIRL approaches, big smile. 
GIRL Oh my God -- Brandon! 
BRANDON glances up, quickly goes back to watching the game. 
Girl 
Oh come on, I know you remember -- two weeks ago, Aqua -- I'm Heather. 
BRANDON (eyes glued to the game) 
Uh-huh. 
Heather 
This is like such a concidence.  I live right around the corner. This is my neighborhood bar. 
She sits beside him, signals the bartender. 
Heather 
Apple martini. 
(back to BRANDON) 
So listen, my office is renting out a loft this weekend, really fun group, it's gonna be a big blow-out, a PR thing -- music, open bar.  Wednesday night, I want you to come, I mean I'd really love to hook up. 
POV BRANDON -- flurry of action on the TV.  Final seconds.  BRANDON lasered on the screen. 
HEATHER (leaning in, laughing) 
BRANDON Son of a bitch... What the fuck-- 
BODYGUARD Mr. Novian wants to see you.  Now. 
BRANDON (seeing a gun in his waistband) 
... Tell him to call. 
BODYGUARD You tell him. 
BRANDON looks, sees NOVIAN nearby. 
NOVIAN I didn't recognize you without the suit, John. 
BRANDON This is my time off.  It's how I clear my head.  You want to talk, pick a time. 
NOVIAN Or should I call you Brandon?  Someone costs you 18 mill, you do some research. 
I know more than your name, Brandon.  I know where you're from. Where your family lives.  Hell, I just came from Vegas.  Your Mom, sweet lady... dealt me three blackjacks in a row. 
(stepping close) 
Where's the cocky motherfucker who came to my house? 
BRANDON I'm leaving. 
The BODYGUARD grabs his arm.  Iron grip. 
NOVIAN Feel that?  I hate the cold.  Winter's coming.  Water's getting rough. 
BRANDON What the fuck is this about?  If you don't like my picks, use someone else. 
NOVIAN Oh, I'm not using you again.  That's already decided.  And I can't get my money back.  It's gone.  No, I came for an apology. 
The BODYGUARD holds him tight.  Light fading.  No one around. 
NOVIAN Look me in the eye and say you're sorry. Say it so as to make me believe you mean it. 
Cold gust.  NOVIAN closes the distance between them. 
BRANDON You flew to New York for-- 
NOVIAN --That's right. 
BRANDON ... I'm sorry. 
NOVIAN I don't accept it.  Not good enough.  Try again. 
BRANDON I don't know what you want me to say.  I'm sorry.  I am.  I'm very sorry. 
NOVIAN Pathetic. 
BRANDON I am very, very sorry.  That's a lot of money. 
NOVIAN Not even close. 
BRANDON I'm sorry! 
NOVIAN This isn't going to work.  I'll have to get satisfaction somehow else. 
BRANDON Look, I'm not it -- I... 
NOVIAN inches from BRANDON.  Unbuttons his coat.  Sound of a zipper.  BRANDON glances down, sees Novian reach into his fly. BRANDON jumps.  The BODYGUARD holds him.  NOVIAN comes close. BRANDON struggles, very unsure where this might be going and-- 
He squirms -- enduring something -- trickling water heard -- NOVIAN staring right at BRANDON -- finishes pissing on BRANDON'S leg.  NOVIAN motions his BODYGUARD to let go and the men walk off.  BRANDON stands there.  Alone in the gloom and -- 
INT. STUDIO PRODUCTION SET - NIGHT 
WALTER, BRANDON, JERRY and CHUCK at the desk, waiting for the weekly taping to start.  WALTER jots notes.  JERRY leans over. 
JERRY I scored you the new mikes, Walter.  No wires to mess with. What do you think? 
WALTER I'm busy. 
JERRY Listen, I think I should lead off.  I have some really strong stuff. 
WALTER You got a good hole, Jerry.  Stay in it. 
JERRY C'mon, I went 8 for 12 last weekend.  I'm hot.  I'm feeling it. 
WALTER doesn't respond, continues working.  JERRY fumes. 
TECHNICIAN 60 seconds. 
JERRY What am I, wood? 
WALTER You got one good weekend under your belt, don't push it. 
JERRY One weekend?  The Sykes System revolutionized this industry. 
(pulling a newspaper, showing a full-page ad for JOHN ANTHONY) 
Explain something to me, where's my fucking ad? 
WALTER Take a hike. 
BRANDON sits at his desk.  Staring out at the city.  His phone rings.  Again.  Again.  Finally pressing speaker phone -- 
BRANDON Hello. 
Intercut - amir in payphone beside N.J. Turnpike - dawn 
Amir 
(dishevelled, distraught) 
I'm wiped out, John... 
BRANDON Amir? 
Amir 
My business... My house... My credit... 
BRANDON No, now listen to me -- we got a big weekend coming up, buddy 
AMIR Still you talk like this.  Who the fuck are you, like this is some kind of game.  I was betting a few thousand a Sunday when I called you.  You pushed me.  Every call.  All the time with your talk... I lost $380,000 this weekend... I was going to get married... I had a life... 
BRANDON staring at the phone, barely holding it together, sees TAMMY standing there -- holding the day's newspapers, hearing the conversation on speaker. 
AMIR No words now, huh?  No more money to squeeze so you shut up. How do you fucking live with yourself? 
Click.  Amir hangs up.  Crushing beat.  TAMMY staring at him. 
BRANDON What? 
(face hardening) 
Fuck him if he can't take a joke. 
TAMMY puts the day's newspapers on his desk, leaves.  BRANDON glances down, something catches his eye.  BRANDON pulls a newspaper from the pile -- finds himself staring at a full-page ad for JOHN ANTHONY.  Big smile.  Copy advertising "The Million Dollar Man!" and -- 
INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 
BRANDON paces the dim space.  Sits on the bench press.  Leans back on the board.  He stares up at the weights.  Moves the weight pin to 250... and slowly starts to lift.  One rep.  Two.  Three. Four.  A bad of sweat forms.  BRANDON throws off the jacket. Pulls off the tie.  Removes his shirt and shoes.  He resumes lifting, grim determination -- the weights rising over and over and over -- faster and faster and -- 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
BRANDON, t-shirt and sweats, approaches WALTER'S office, bursts through the door -- 
BRANDON I know what the problem is! 
BRANDON freezes.  WALTER watches two MEN unload stacks of money from a briefcase, pile them on his desk. 
BRANDON I'll come back later. 
WALTER No!  C'mon in.  We're done here.  Right fellas?  All through? You want a bite before you go?  Something to drink? 
The two MEN leave.  WALTER lights a cigarette. 
BRANDON Who were they? 
WALTER We need a bat light or something, you know a signal I can shoot up at the 
Walter con'd 
clouds and no matter where you are you 
can look up and you'll know I need you.  Maybe that would work. 'Cause last night I must've beeped you a hundred times. 
BRANDON Who were they? 
WALTER They're from the Salvation Army.  How the hell does someone go 1-for-8?  A fucking monkey tossing darts could do better! 
BRANDON What's with the money, Walter? 
WALTER 1-for-fucking-8! 
(coming around the desk) 
I have a plan.  From now on we take your picks and reverse everything! Like a Twilight Zone episode where everything's the opposite! You say black we go white!  A is B!  Lose becomes win! 
BRANDON (staring at the pile of cash) 
How much is that? 
WALTER (sweeping the pile to the floor) 
How much is what?  Oh, that -- 275,000 dollars! 
BRANDON What happened to the two mill, all the other money? 
WALTER I was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up.  The last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off.  He'll come around. Climb out on his own.  Now I figure fuck it!  Time to turn on the lights!  Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! Maybe that'll shake him up!  So what do you want to know?  I got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway!  All this -- everything you see around you -- 
is smoke and mirrors!  I shoulda been a magician! 
WALTER CON'D ... What'd you say when you came in?  You    were in a good mood when you walked through the door and you said something. 
BRANDON You're betting my picks? 
WALTER You went 82 and 11!  You were picking 80 percent -- how could I fucking not!?  Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet!  One decent weekend and I would have been set for life!  One decent weekend! 
BRANDON Walter, it's over.  What use could John Anthony be to you now? Only an idiot would follow him after the streak I've been on. 
WALTER Wrong!  Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot.  Bettors will climb back aboard. 
WALTER CON'D They know you!  And when your luck turns they'll remember you went 80 percent for half the season!  We'll make it all back on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything. 
BRANDON Who said anything about next year? 
WALTER Sports betting's year-round. 
BRANDON I'm not doing this next year. 
WALTER You made a career choice!  I bankrolled it! 
TONI VO Let him go, Walter. 
WALTER and BRANDON turn, see TONI at the door. 
WALTER Of course you stick up for him! 
TONI Meaning what? 
WALTER Who's side are you on? 
TONI I didn't realize I had to choose. 
WALTER (to BRANDON) 
Look, you got a magnificent gift.  Own that.  So you strike out sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences.  You're a champion, Brandon.  A champion goes down 186 times but gets up 187.  I'm not letting you stay down.  This isn't about you or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical, this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God... Besides, we have a contract. 
BRANDON Bullshit! 
TONI You can't own someone, Walter. 
WALTER I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen! I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! Why the hell am I even explaining this to you!  This is between me and him!  Get out! 
BRANDON Don't talk to her like that. 
WALTER I need you to tell me how to talk to my wife?  When I'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet! 
TONI (to BRANDON) 
Leave. 
INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
BRANDON comes down the hall.  TONI and WALTER heard yelling through the office door.  BRANDON hesitates, walks out and -- 
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Dim darkness.  A distant siren bleeds in as -- 
WALTER'S VOICE Brandon... Brandon. 
BRANDON'S POV.  His eyes open.  WALTER'S face fills FRAME. 
WALTER Wake up. 
BRANDON What time is it? 
WALTER Five in the morning.  Listen, I gotta fly to Vegas to meet with some clients.  Hand holding thing.  Keep 'em on board for the final game.  Because you can do this thing, Brandon.  End of the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around.  I'll be back to you out to dinner.  Get you back in the groove.  9:30. Nobu. Gotta catch my flight.  See you tonight.  Look sharp. We're turning it around. 
WALTER backs out, kills the lights.  Darkness returns and -- 
INT. NOBU - NIGHT 
BRANDON alone at a table, sipping a sake when TONI, evening dress, sits next to him. 
BRANDON Hey, I didn't know you were coming. 
TONI Walter was delayed, he's coming back in the morning.  Asked if I'd fill in. 
BRANDON (processing this) 
That's funny, he didn't call me.  You look great. 
TONI silent. 
BRAndon 
You okay? 
TONI Julia did her ballet recital today.  God she was beautiful. 
BRANDON She is. 
TONi 
... He's betting again. 
BRANDON regards her. 
TONI I can't believe I'm here again.  I saw it coming.  I just... I just couldn't stop it. 
BRANDON Nobody could. 
BRANDON I can't take this. 
WALTER vo 
Why not? 
BRANDON It's too much. 
WALTER vo 
For what?  You're family, Brandon.  We all love each other, right? I'm like a father, you're like my son -- gee, sorry Toni, but I guess that makes you his mother. 
WALTER PANS to TONI, staring at the fire.  Strained silence. 
WALTER vo 
What?  Somebody fart or something? 
TONI starts taking off the earrings. 
WALTER vo 
Leave 'em on. 
TONI They're for evening. 
WALTER vo 
Good, wear 'em to bed tonight. 
(VIDEO CAMERA back on BRANDON) 
Who do you think'll win the big game? 
BRANDON Turn it off. 
WALTEr/still taping 
Better yet, don't say anything.  Surprise me.  We'll break it when we do the live show.  Take your time, Brandon.  Enjoy yourself. Give Walter a smile. 
WALTER ZOOMS IN -- BRANDON staring back at us and -- 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE NEWS STAND - DAY 
BRANDON loads up on newspapers and sports magazines and -- 
INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY 
BRANDON surrounded by a sea of sports pages, comentary, ratings. He looks up at a blaring TV and -- 
THE TV FILLS FRAME -- TIME CUT as various sports shows come on back-to-back -- each providing a wealth of competing Superbowl predictions and analysis. 
CAMERA TIGHTENS ON THE SCREEN AND WE SEE, for every hopped-up SPORTSCASTER who picks Denver, an equally assured COUNTERPART chooses New York.  One after another.  No consensus at all. Airwaves awash in past-season stats -- regular season stats -- post-season stats -- all of it blending into an overwhelming, mind-numbing, jarring blather of pure disagreement and -- 
INT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO BATHROOM - NIGHT 
BRANDON, suit and tie, splashes water on his face, stares at himself in the mirror.  He pulls reams of stats and newspaper reports from his pocket, regards the Superbowl pick sheet.  Blank space for the winner.  Blank space for the over/under.  BRANDON fumbling with his sheets of data, desperately searching for an answer when he suddenly hurls it all in the trash.  Kicks the can.  Kicks it again. 
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE 60 seconds till we go live, Mr. Anthony! 
BRANDON looks over.  The unfinished pick sheet lies crumpled by the toilet.  He smooths it.  Pulls a coin. 
BRANDON Heads, New York.  Tails Denver. 
He flips the coin.  Palms it.  Heads.  BRANDON checks the box. 
BRANDON Heads, over.  Tails, under. 
BRANDON flips again, lets the coin hit the floor, watches it spin, slowly come to a stop, drop to its side and -- 
INT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO - NIGHT 
BRANDON sits at the set.  Looks over at CHUCK, in his own world, working something from his teeth.  BRANDON Slides the pick sheet to WALTER. 
TECHNICIAN Ten seconds! 
BRANDON Wanna know about the picks? 
WALTER New York minus the two-and-a-half points and the over, what should I know? 
BRANDON I flipped a coin to decide. 
TECHNICIAN Five, four, three, two, one -- 
WALTER Hello everybody and welcome to the big weekend!  John Anthony's just given me tremendous news about his assessment!  Let me say to all of you who've used our service and those of you thinking of using it for the first time -- never before in the history of this industry has an offer been made like the one I'm about to present to you now!  I am so confident of John Anthony's picks for this Sunday, so sure of the skills he's brought to bear and so anxious to get you on the phone and dialing the toll free number on your screen that for the first time in sports service history I will guarantee our picks this weekend!  What's that mean?  Tell us how much you're betting with your bookie.  You lose, we cover!  That's right!  Risk free!  Lock Of The Millenium! Now let's go to the oracle, God's gift -- John Anthony! 
BRANDON'S face fills the monitor.  Completely off-guard. 
BRANDON ... Wow.  What an offer.  The phones'll be flooded. 
WALTER We're that sure!  John, rundown the pitfalls facing the average bettor.  I mean a game this huge, all the added dynamics, without your expertise most bettors might as well just... flip a coin, am I right? 
BRANDON (tapping into it) 
That's right, Walter!  Last game of the year ladies and gentlemen! Come Sunday you're either ending the season a winner or a loser! It's crunch time!  The last action on the way out the door! And I am absolutely, 1000-percent sure that I, John Anthony, will end the season ahead of the game! 
Walter walks back to the bedroom.  The tv's on.  WALTER pauses to watch another play, about to leave when he spies the Rolex on the nightstand, envelope beside it.  WALTER picks up the letter. Sees his name on the outside.  He opens it, reads. TONI appears in the BG.  WALTER turns. 
WALTER ... He left. 
TONI I know. 
WALTER And you didn't you tell me? 
TONI He asked me not to. 
WALTER Just like that?  No goodbye? 
TONI I'm sure it's in the letter. 
WALTER I'm sure it is... I wonder what's not in here? 
TONI What do you mean? 
WALTER What do you mean, what do I mean?  When it comes to Brandon you seem to have all the answers. 
TONI He had enough.  He wanted his life back. 
WALTER He said that to you? 
TONI Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving. 
WALTER I think it's something else. 
TONI Yeah, tell me. 
WALTER You know. 
TONI No. 
ON -- the TV.  New York's driving.  Game reaching a head.  A clock in the corner counts down the final two minutes. 
WALTER You have no idea, huh? 
TONI You're missing the game. 
WALTER No I'm not.  This is the game. 
INT. JFK AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT 
BRANDON travels down an escalator and -- 
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
TONI at the door.  WALTER approaches. 
WALTER Something was bothering him.  I mean sure, maybe he was homesick. Or I was thinking maybe he had such, you know, deep feelings for me he couldn't face saying goodbye.  What a minute.  I just 
thought of something.  Just came to me.  Out of the blue.  What about this?  Maybe Brandon left without telling me because -- 
(full volume, in her face) 
You let him fuck you! 
ON -- TV.  A New York RECEIVER catches a long bomb.  Nailed at the 20.  Clock down to a minute 30.  No time to huddle and -- 
WALTER Do you deny it? 
TONI Do I have to? 
WALTER I know you did! 
TONI Really?  Another "lock of the year?" 
WALTER I saw you, Toni!  I saw you go into his room that night!  This room!  With him!  I never went to Vegas! 
INT. JFK AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT 
BRANDON walks through FRAME.  PASSENGERS rush for flights and-- 
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
TONI and WALTER in the middle of it -- 
TONI You mean you lied to me about the trip! 
WALTER Don't talk to me about lying! 
TONI I guess you had the whole thing planned? 
WALTER Don't make this about me! 
TONI Put me out there on a tray! 
WALTER Yeah, I put the tray out there -- but you didn't have to shove an apple in your mouth and jump on it!  On him! 
ON -- New York throws a pass.  Blocked.  45 seconds left -- 
WALTER Admit it! 
TONI You played me!

EARLY DRAFT 
February 28, 2003 
FADE IN: 
INT. BUS STATION - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE:     17 YEARS AGO 
Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16, enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe. 
MARTIN 
Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to Montreal please? 
CASHIER 
Pardon? 
MARTIN 
I need a ticket to Montreal. 
CASHIER 
Montreal? 
MARTIN 
Yes, sir.     Please. 
CASHIER 
Forty-three dollars. Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The DRIVER loading bags. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him, offers a hand. Martin shakes. 
DAN 
Dan Soulsby. 
MARTIN 
Martin.     Nice to meet you. 
DAN 
Where you heading to? 
MARTIN 
Away from here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     Offers Martin one. 
MARTIN 
Pisswater. 
DAN 
At least it's cold pisswater. Here's to getting away. They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas. BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING. Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks. 
DAN 
That was bad. (bummed) It's gonna take all day to get another bus here. Martin sighs, looks out the window. 
WHAT MARTIN SEES 
A car rental place. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket. 
MARTIN 
You have a license? 
DAN 
Had one.    They took it away. 
MARTIN 
I got one.   Let's go. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth. 
DAN 
WOMAN 
You need to open that grave.   It can't be my son in there. A beat. 
INSPECTOR 
I lost my mother two years ago. Every day I think I see her. Driving to work in the car next to me. At mass. Shopping, I see her, but this is someone else's mother. You see? The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye. There is something formidable about her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WOMAN 
Inspector, I'm saddened by your loss and touched by loyalty. But let's focus on the matter at hand. He walked right past me. We made eye contact. I know he recognized me. It was my son. A mother knows these things. I will sign anything, I will swear before a judge. And thank you, I do have all my faculties and friends who can vouch for my character. 
INSPECTOR 
Did you talk to this man, he is a man now? 
WOMAN 
Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd be thirty-two. And no, I did not speak with him. I ran. (low, serious) Inspector, my son was very, very disturbed. He had serious emotional problems. I assure you he was. (a beat) Is. Is a dangerous person. He hands her some forms. 
INSPECTOR 
Madame. The police department cannot resolve your problem. You need to get permits from the coroner and health and safety department. You pay for an exhumation. You have someone qualified examine the remains. If it is the wrong body, the Forensic Examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us. Then we open an investigation. (a beat) No, Quebec City police will investigate. He is buried there, no? The Woman bristles.     Stands, takes the forms. 
WOMAN 
No.   Inspector. He is not. 
EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river.        A log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION 
WORKERS. 
A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly, hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the headless body he has just dragged from its grave. Workers gather and gawk. 
WORKER 
Someone call the cops. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT 
INSPECTOR LAVAL and INSPECTOR REYNAUD, rock solid French Canadians, pin photographs of the body we just saw on the wall. Laval steps back. Takes in the display. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
(subtitled French) Think she will like this? Reynaud shrugs.    Laval tosses him a Newsweek. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
(subtitled French) We are lucky the FBI is sending her. She is the Michael Jordan of criminal profiling. (off Reynaud's look) The Guy Le Fleuer of profiling. She will save our ass. The PHONE RINGS.   Laval answers. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
(subtitled French) Inspector Laval. (a beat) Have the airline check again. Look around baggage claim. (to Reynaud) She was on the flight but they can't find her. Reynaud's CELL RINGS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
(into phone) Oui? 
Reynaud grabs his coat.     Turns to Laval. 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
(subtitled French) I know where she is. 
CUT TO: 
DARKNESS 
We hear BREATHING and the SOFT RUSH of a RIVER.        Soft, rhythmic. Then FOOTSTEPS. Two eyes open, reflect moonlight.      The FOOTSTEPS drawing closer. CLICK!     A FLASHLIGHT turns on.   REVEALING: 
EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT 
GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up. Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from the bright light. 
GRACE 
It's okay, I'm supposed to be here. CLICK.     The LIGHT goes off.   REVEALING Laval and Reynaud. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Agent Vanderholt, we requested your help. I'm Inspector Laval, this is Inspector Reynaud. 
GRACE 
Hi. Look, I'm not ready to talk to you guys yet. I need a little more time here. Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two UNIFORMS guarding the site. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER 
(O.S.). 
GRACE 
Would you mind trading one liners somewhere else? I need to hear the natural sounds. I appreciate it. The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.    Laval gestures for them to walk down the road. 
GRACE 
Bingo.   That's your murder weapon. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
It might be trash a camper left. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE 
No. Look at it, braided parachute cord, two pieces of broom stick. You approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might. The more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out. And now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
That is a theory. 
GRACE 
That's exactly what it is. A theory. That evidence supports. When the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won't need me. Inspector. Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages. Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her quietly. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
Laval and Reynaud are my stars. Very smart, very persistent investigators. On the street; they're magnificent. 
GRACE 
I can see that Director.   You're lucky to have them. A beat. 
GRACE 
Go ahead, Director, say what you have to say. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
You're the expert. If you have any suggestions on how to proceed... 
GRACE 
Sure. A forensic anthropologist can draw the victim's face based on the skull. I know someone at Quantico who can do it by tomorrow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
We have people. 
GRACE 
Call 'em. Then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago. You have his initials; MRC, inside the wetsuit. The long hair is distinctive, someone may recognize him. It's a semi-long shot. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
No, that's bread and butter detective work. Thank you. (checks his watch) We should get upstairs. They cross to the exit. Director Gillet barks orders in FRENCH at his two-star Inspectors. 
INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY 
Photos, maps, newspaper articles cover the walls. Twenty-four Hour News ON a TV. Six DETECTIVES man the phones. ROOKIES fetch reports, pour coffee. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The long table is crowded. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud. Three more POLICE OFFICIALS. A pair of CITY COUNCILMEN. Grace sits next to Gillet. 
COUNCILMAN #1 
You found the skull. Incredible. 
GRACE 
I had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains. 
COUNCILMAN #2 
So I can tell my people there isn't a headhunter running around the wilds of Quebec? 
GRACE 
No headhunters, sir.   However, a killer is out there. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COUNCILMAN #1 
Director Gillet. Do you have the victim identified? 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
No name yet, sir. We have someone from the University recreating his face from the skull. 
COUNCILMAN #1 
Why, after two years, has nobody reported him missing? 
GRACE 
He wasn't missed. He had no family, or moved often. He had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman. He spent a lot of time in his kayak. 
COUNCILMAN #1 
The big question is who killed him. 
GRACE 
Computer error? 
GRACE 
Too many independent systems. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
(beat) We work organized crime sometimes, maybe a hit man wanted to lay low. He assumed the life of a civilian until things cooled off. 
GRACE 
You really think a gangster is going to break his stride and become a long hair groovy river guide? Inspector, this guy's whole life has been stolen. Someone killed him and became him. Down to profession and taste in clothing. Laval and Reynaud trade looks. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER) 
The lights are still on, Grace has fallen asleep on her bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. Case photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even on the ceiling. KNOCKING at the door. Grace stirs. 
Crosses to the door, groggy. She checks the peephole. Cracks the door. It's Inspector Laval. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
You are a heavy sleeper. 
GRACE 
You're everywhere. What's up, Laval? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
A man was killed tonight. Attacked from behind. Asphyxiated with a nylon cord with handles. And there's a witness. Or a suspect. We're not sure yet. We should go. 
EXT. PARKING LOT CRIME SCENE (DOWNTOWN MONTREAL) - 
NIGHT (4:00 AM) 
Cop cars everywhere. Crime scene tape. The Coroner's van. A couple NEWS CAMERAMEN. Grace crossing with Laval. Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the back of a cop car. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
That's him.   He says he saw the killer. Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag nearby. A pair of UNIFORMS stand guard as a CRIMINALIST processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Meet Mr. Todd Ford. Grace squats by the body. CLICKS on her Mag-Lite and inspects the victim. Bruises on his neck. 
GRACE 
He's still warm. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grace shines her flashlight along the corpse.      A couple hairs glow in the strong light beam. 
GRACE 
Want to get those? The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs. 
GRACE 
Where is it? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
There.   Under his car. Grace shines her light under a car. A garrote is there, made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord. 
GRACE 
Holy shit.   Has Le Directeur been notified? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
I'm letting the poor man sleep a couple more minutes. (pointing things out) Twenty-four hour gym is there, next door. He has a membership card in his wallet. That's his car. Car keys. Grace looks around the garage.      Taking it all in. Getting a feel for the scene. She carefully examines the victim's car with her flashlight. The door has been brushed with black print dust. 
INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT (4:43 AM) 
Director Gillet sips bad coffee in a rumpled suit and T- shirt. Looking through a two-way mirror. Grace, Reynaud are with him. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
Is that our killer? 
GRACE 
Maybe. So far he checks out as an art dealer from Winnipeg. 
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT 
JOHN COSTA, 33, sits at the small table. Glasses, moppish hair. Laval sits across from him. Costa is sincere, and frightened. 
COSTA 
I walk out of the gym. Walk to my car. I'm unlocking it and I hear a scuffle, a fight. Over by this car I see this guy getting choked from behind and I shouted. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
What did you shout? 
COSTA 
'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then the person doing the choking lets go and pointed a gun at me and ran. I'm so stupid. I could of been shot. I called the police gave him CPR until the paramedics came. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
You touched him? 
COSTA 
COSTA 
Thank you. He had these real intense eyes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Costa about to start drawing. 
GRACE 
Hold on. Before you do that, I need some personal information from you. Can you write down the name of the elementary school you attended? And your elementary school teachers, as many as you can remember. Costa looking at Grace a beat. 
COSTA 
Are you kidding me? Lady, I saw someone get killed tonight and you're asking me about grade school? 
GRACE 
I apologize, I know it's random, but it's the best way you can help me. 
COSTA 
I don't remember any of that. 
GRACE 
Please, Mr. Costa. You'd be surprised. 
COSTA 
(writing) I attended two. Holy Trinity and Mother of Good Counsel. I remember Sister Bernard. And. I don't know, Father Jeffrey. Mr. Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien, she had a glass eye. 
GRACE 
May I? She takes the list of names. She tips over her briefcase with her foot, the evidence bag spills out. Costa glances at the garrote, REACTS. 
COSTA 
Omigod.   That's it, isn't it? 
GRACE 
That's what? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COSTA 
The thing around his neck. Costa looking at Grace, realizes it's a mind game. 
COSTA 
I told the other guy, I'll tell you. I did not do this. Grace. I saw who did this and I can show you what he looks like and you can go catch him. Costa is unambiguously sincere. Grace's attitude softens a bit. She tucks the garrote back in her bag. 
GRACE 
Go ahead and draw the face of the man you saw. Costa draws a simple smiley face.     He shows her. 
GRACE 
We'll get an artist to help you. 
COSTA 
I can draw him, thank you. Grace crosses to the door.     Costa begins drawing in earnest. 
INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT 
Grace emerges from the interrogation room. Reynaud hands her a printout of Costa's school records. Grace checking Costa's list against his transcripts. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
You left a file in there. 
GRACE 
I know. See if he tries to peek in it. The real killer couldn't resist. He'll want to know what we know. Laval watches Costa. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Costa draws with skilled hands, delicate but strong.      The file is ignored. 
INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT 
Grace hands Laval back Costa's file. 
GRACE 
Can you remember any of your grade school teachers? He remembered three. A Rookie crosses with a photo, hands it to Laval. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Here's his provincial driver's license photo. He's checking out. Laval shows Grace the photo.   It is definitely Costa.    A beat. 
GRACE 
Have a nurse take a DNA sample. Just to make sure his DNA isn't in the victim's car or anything weird. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
We'll run the tests. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Costa has finished the sketch. He holds it up to the mirror, for those he assumes are watching. REFLECTED in the two-way mirror is COSTA'S SKETCH.   Cold piercing eyes, chiseled features. The door opens, expecting Grace, Costa is disappointed to see a tough-looking PARAMEDIC unwrapping a cotton swab. 
Good question.  Do we trust Costa? An unmarked car pulls up.     Reynaud drives. 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
Get in. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY 
Grace and Laval get in, Reynaud guns it.       Grace belts in. 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
I found a current address here in Montreal. Reynaud leans on the HORN, aggressively maneuvering through traffic. 
GRACE 
You guys have an extra weapon? I didn't want to cross the border armed. 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
The glove box. Grace opens it and finds a compact Glock.       She checks it, shoves it into her pocket. Reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. Stops cold in front of an apartment building. And gets out. Great driving. A mere two blocks away from the crime scene.       Laval gets out. Then Grace. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
An upper floor. Grace, Reynaud and the MANAGER cross to a door. The Manager studies Costa's sketch of the attacker. 
SUPER 
I never met him. We conducted our business by phone. They arrive at a door. Reynaud about to knock.   Grace stops him, listening at the door. 
GRACE 
I smell smoke. Back where I'm from anyone can kick a door if there's a fire. It's the 'citizen's arrest' of search warrants. Then: The SMOKE ALARM inside the apartment BUZZES O.S. Reynaud and Laval trade looks. Reynaud cocks a leg... The Manager unlocks the door a beat before Reynaud kicks it. Laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to enter. Grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows what she's doing. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
It's dark, drawn shades. A small studio. Reynaud and Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace enters the kitchen. Light smoke. Reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket. Just pillows. Grace checks under the sink. Reynaud checks the bathroom and shower. A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom. Grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one lurks in there. 
GRACE 
Clear. Grace turns off the burner. She crosses to a window, whips aside the curtains, and opens it. Coughing. 
GRACE 
Ugh.   Got a lung full. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grace looks at a glass of orange juice, a half-eaten plate of food on the table. 
GRACE 
Looks like this guy ran out in the middle of breakfast. Laval has entered, he stares out the window.      Grace looks out the window, REACTS. 
WHAT GRACE SEES 
The apartment window has a perfect view of the gym parking lot where the killing occurred. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Reynaud sees that and also REACTS. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
We should get out of here. Don't touch anything. They back out of there. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY (AN HOUR LATER) 
Grace watches a CRIMINALIST bag a comb from the medicine cabinet. A couple hairs entwined in its teeth. In the kitchen another CRIMINALIST dusts for prints. Reynaud taking pictures with a large still camera. Laval KNOCKS on the walls. Laval moves a picture frame. A photograph falls out. Laval picks it up with surgical gloves. INSERT PHOTO: A dead ringer for Costa's sketch, carousing in a Thai bar. Laval shows Grace. 
GRACE 
Resembles the man Costa sketched. (beat) Have you released him? You don't want your star witness steaming in a holding cell. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
He went home twenty minutes ago. Agent Grace, where do you think Monsieur Edwards is? 
GRACE 
I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a deep grave with square corners like Messieurs Kohler and Ford. Which looks like all the victims. Maybe he's subconsciously killing himself. Grace finds a guitar case. Opens it. It's a mobile office; it has postage stamps. Postcards. Assorted stationery, different address labels. Neat, organized. Holiday cards. A CD titled: "Learn Flamenco Guitar." Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents. Victim's personal effects. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
We'll take that with us. (in French) Put a number and seal on that case. Reynaud SNAPS pictures of the guitar case. Grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can tell her. Bonding with the space. She smells a pillow. Thinking. 
GRACE 
Ever see a Hermit crab? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
No. 
GRACE 
It's a crab that lives in the shells of dead sea snails. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Yes, yes. They have one big claw and curl up tight. Laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his jacket. Begins prying off a door molding. Grace sits at the kitchen table. 
GRACE 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
Very nice.   You like to play games. Grace smiles. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Mr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship musician. He would walk around and play his guitar on the decks at night. 
GRACE 
Life is pretty cold sometimes. Man's just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
He targeted Mr. Ford the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in Aruba. 
GRACE 
Only the new improved Mr. Ford was going to meet he ship. 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
Think he has a plan B? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE 
I doubt it. He's been so meticulous and effective in the past, I bet he's never needed one. We can assume he has all sorts of fake IDs and passports. Disguises. But that's not enough for him, he has to be someone else. He gets off impersonating people. And he knows his current persona is compromised. Laval and Reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at her. 
GRACE 
What? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
You're always thinking. Save something for tomorrow. We have three boxes of evidence to go through. 
GRACE 
Pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
My papa dropped dead of a heart attack in front of a drill press at work. Not me. Grace understands.     Laval CLINKS her beer, Reynaud too. 
GRACE 
I'm dropping by Costa's, I still have a couple questions. (off Laval's look) I can't turn it off. 
EXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT 
A warm night, people are out. TEENS, COUPLES. Some OLD MEN argue politics. Grace approaches the gallery, keeping a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside. 
INT. ART GALLERY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT (MOS) 
John Costa shares some Merlot with a statuesque ELEGANT WOMAN. She's laughing, flirting. Costa is making her laugh. 
EXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT 
Grace quickly crosses to the entrance. 
INT. ART GALLERY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT 
An OLDER MAN joins them, the woman is his arm candy. Costa shakes his hand. The Older Man and the Elegant Woman exit. 
INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT 
Grace enters. Costa sees her, REACTS, genuinely glad to see her. And that throws Grace a beat. She really likes his smile. 
GRACE 
Mr. Costa. 
COSTA 
You caught me. 
GRACE 
Not yet. Grace looks over the art. 
COSTA 
Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him in Haiti last year. Very troubled life. Outlived all his children. And he had ten. He lost his wife to cancer and went blind. Passed away last year. 
GRACE 
Overpriced folk art. Is it the work of a soul that has suffered? Sure. Are his explorations as an artist groundbreaking? No. 
COSTA 
Ouch. And I was going to send you two and charge them to your Amex. 
GRACE 
I couldn't afford it. Costa is looking at her, looking through her. 
COSTA 
What about Daddy's Amex? I've sold quite a bit of art to poor little rich girls like you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grace grows tense. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grace trying not to laugh, hands him a form. 
GRACE 
She signed.   Start digging. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY 
A back hoe rips a bucket of earth from amidst the graves. A couple UNIFORMS watch. 
INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
A cheap wood coffin sits on a gurney. The lid has been removed. Grace, Laval and Reynaud peer inside and REACT. Reynaud looks ill. 
MEDICAL EXAMINER 
Hmm. Could be worse after getting run over by a pickup and twenty years in the ground. 
INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY (10 MINUTES LATER) 
The body has been moved to the exam table. Covered with mold the corpse seems to be upholstered with baby blue velvet. The Medical Examiner checks the scale. 
MEDICAL EXAMINER 
Bodies get mixed up all the time. Police found the wallet, called the mother and nothing was cross- checked. This was his head. Medical Examiner pulls a plastic bag from the coffin. Slices it open, revealing skull fragments and teeth. Passes them off to an ASSISTANT. 
MEDICAL EXAMINER 
(to the assistant) Get that to Doctor Shivani and make sure someone signs for it. (to Grace) She'll rebuild his jaw line and check it against Martin Asher's dental X-rays. 
GRACE 
How soon, sir? 
MEDICAL EXAMINER 
(shrugs) This is a priority case, this afternoon maybe. 
INT. POLICE GYM - DAY 
Five XL-sized COPS pump iron before their shift. 
CAMERA FINDS GRACE. 
She's doing sit-ups on a decline bench, holding a 25- pound plate to her chest. She's a machine. Sweating. Intense. The cops can't help but to be impressed. Grace's CELL RINGS. She doesn't stop, does sit-ups faster. At the last second she answers. 
GRACE 
(into phone, panting) Vanderholt. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.) 
(filtered) Am I interrupting something? 
GRACE 
Yes.   What? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.) 
The X-rays don't match. 
GRACE 
Find the real Martin Asher. He's your killer. (a beat) You better get his mother someplace safe. 
EXT. POSH HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 
An UNMARKED parked with Laval and Grace inside.     They watch: 
INT. POSH HOTEL LOBBY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT 
MRS. ASHER checking in. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT 
GRACE 
How'd she finagle a room there? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
She's a very slick woman. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE 
She didn't have one picture of Martin. Not one. Even cut him out of the old yearbooks. And she had a basement door like a vault. She's hiding something. In the basement of her house. What is it, ten minutes away from here? Her house. A beat.   Laval looks at Grace, decides he can trust her. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
If she's under our protection and something happens to her house, her belongings, the department could be liable. There could be a lawsuit. 
GRACE 
You're right. We should make sure her front door is locked. Laval makes a U-turn. 
INT. ASHER HOUSE - NIGHT 
The front door opens. Revealing Grace, and Laval as he pockets a lockpick gun. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Reynaud takes a picture of the screen. Laval checking the door's lock. Finds no marks. Gives Costa a look. 
COSTA 
Is this about the strangling?   Is that guy after me? 
GRACE 
Please relax, Mr. Costa. We don't know if there's a connection yet. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Is anything missing. 
COSTA 
No.  Everything's here. (a beat) Shit. He took my organizer and my business checkbook. Grace nods for Laval to step outside with her. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GALLERY - DAY 
Grace and Laval. 
GRACE 
How do we know Costa didn't stage this? For attention or something. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
He's happy to see you. But the alarm was jumpered. Do you think Costa knows how to jumper an alarm? 
GRACE 
We should take the computer. Costa who has followed them out, overheard. 
COSTA 
Don't take the computer.    That's my brain. Costa turns to Grace. 
COSTA 
I'm not making this up.     Believe me. Grace shrugs, sees an ATM facing the alley. 
GRACE 
Should I believe you? Grace crosses to the ATM.   Peers into its security camera. 
GRACE 
Or should I believe this. 
COSTA 
Believe what you want. He's cocky, Grace likes that. 
EXT. ALLEY - ATM VIDEO - NIGHT 
Being fast forwarded. COSTA exits his office.        Locks the door. He walks TOWARD CAMERA and EXITS FRAME. A MAN'S SILHOUETTE in the alley. Crossing towards the office door. An ATM CUSTOMER blocks the shot. The ATM customer moves on. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Nobody is there.     Then: MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door. APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME. Fast forward some more until Costa ENTERS FRAME and crosses to his office with a cup of coffee. The VIDEO STOPS. It REWINDS. FREEZES ON ASHER. 
CUT WIDE TO: 
INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Costa, Grace, Laval and Reynaud. Costa stands there looking at Asher's image on the video monitor. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Is that the man you saw choking Mr. Ford? Fear flashes across Costa's face. 
COSTA 
I must of walked right past him. 
GRACE 
Mr. Costa, is that the man you saw kill Mr. Ford in the parking lot? 
COSTA 
Yes. That's him. That is the man I saw murder Todd Ford in the parking lot outside my gym. No doubt. Now will you go catch him, please? 
GRACE 
Thank you.   I just needed you to say it. 
COSTA 
Who is this guy? He's like a Ninja. Sneaking into my office. How dangerous is he? Does he want to kill me? 
GRACE 
John, no harm will come to you. Listen to me. No harm will come to you. I promise. Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to get through these two for starters. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She gestures at Laval and Reynaud.     Costa turns to them. 
COSTA 
How many people have you killed? 
Reynaud shrugs. 
COSTA 
What? 
BLACK MAN 
We're calling it off. 
EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT 
Costa bursts from the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the wire, he struggles out of the body armor. Grace and Laval watching. 
COSTA 
I have a life. I can't play superhero for you. I don't handle stress very well. I have an art show to open tomorrow and I don't know what I'm putting on the walls yet. 
GRACE 
I know you have a life. So did the people who have lost theirs. Someone else might die if you do not help us. Every time someone dies it affects forty, fifty lives. Costa looks at her, arms on his hips. 
COSTA 
Grace, I've been cooperating. I even drew you a picture. You can't put your responsibility on me. You have a badge, not me. 
GRACE 
If somebody else dies, and you know you could have done more to stop it, you're going to feel like shit for a very long time, Mr. Costa. A beat.   That resonates with Costa. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COSTA 
I want to help you guys but I don't have time to hang out and listen to bad techno. 
A beat. 
GRACE 
It's okay to be scared. 
COSTA 
Scared? I'm off-the-charts terrified. There's a pissed-off serial killer after me. I mean, what did I do to him? 
GRACE 
You saw him and that's enough. Don't stop living your life. You'll be protected by armed officers twenty-four seven. 
COSTA 
Until he's caught? 
GRACE 
(softly) I can't promise you that. Costa is torn, Grace empathizes with him. 
COSTA 
I have a lot of work to do. 
GRACE 
A car is watching the gallery. You'll be okay. Costa looking at Grace.     He decides to trust her. 
INT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY 
Director Gillet leans against a wall, smoking a pipe. Grace, Laval, Reynaud sit on the tired couches. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
So who was in Asher's grave? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Dan Soulsby. He went missing from the Alberta Military Institute two days before the accident. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE 
I'm sure Soulsby's death was a homicide, Asher saw the opportunity and took it. He became Soulsby and bummed around Seattle for a couple years. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
Why is Asher after Costa? Why isn't he in Mexico getting a new face? 
GRACE 
Costa saw him. Costa caught him in the act, caught him being Martin Asher. Seen first by his mother, then by Costa. For the first time he's failed at taking a life, and since we found the apartment, he can't be Edwards. To be seen, to be recognized, is a horrifying thing to Asher. He has no identity and wants it that way. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
Where is the real Mr. Edwards? 
GRACE 
Likely dead and buried south of the border somewhere. (beat) South of the American border somewhere. Visa records put Asher, using Kohler's ID and Edwards at a Mexican surf resort. Edwards' last charge was sixteen hundred dollars at a 'no questions asked' facelift clinic in Guadalajara. Director Gillet taps out his pipe.     Looks at a new, more detailed portrait of Asher. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
Have you contacted the clinic? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Yes. They are also 'no questions answered.' Mr. Kohler suddenly paid off his credit card bills, thanks to money from Edwards. 
GRACE 
Thanks. 
COSTA 
You look a little anxious. 
GRACE 
(re: her dress) This isn't me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COSTA 
It's all you. Grace gives Costa a look.       She sips her drink, nods at the painting. 
GRACE 
I'm trying to get into the show, but I mean. What is this? It looks like somebody napalmed the Garden of Eden. 
COSTA 
Mangos.   Ripe mangos hanging on a branch. Now she sees it. 
GRACE 
Oh. Okay. Why the borders? Almost every painting has one. Was he in prison or something? Costa REACTS, impressed by Grace. 
COSTA 
Most people don't notice. This is from his prison series. He could see a mango grove through his cell window. He made some of the pigments himself. From flowers. From his own blood. 
GRACE 
What was his crime? 
COSTA 
He attacked his neighbor with a machete. There was a woman involved. 
GRACE 
Always is. Grace sips her drink, letting herself relax.       She enjoys Costa's company. 
GRACE 
He had a lot of lovers, didn't he? 
COSTA 
Dozens. He was a consumer of life's pleasures. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE 
Now he's dead and you get rich? 
COSTA 
His children formed a corporation, I take ten percent. I'm not a buccaneer, Grace. Grace looks at Costa and smiles. 
COSTA 
What? 
GRACE 
I don't think I've ever met anyone quite like you. 
COSTA 
You're very sensitive for... 
GRACE 
An FBI agent? The ELEGANT WOMAN spots Costa and crosses. She lays a hand on Costa's shoulder. He turns and they kiss cheeks. 
ELEGANT WOMAN 
John, it's amazing tonight. I want to cry, I'm so touched. Grace watches her hand linger on Costa's arm. And is amazed that she feels jealous. She catches Costa's eye. 
GRACE 
Mr. Costa, I would like to discuss an arrangement for the series. The Elegant Woman REACTS. 
ELEGANT WOMAN 
Just a sec, John. She crosses to the Older Man in b.g.       Costa is miffed. 
COSTA 
What are you doing? 
GRACE 
She's not writing the checks. The Elegant Woman returns with the Older Man.       He grabs Costa's hand. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OLDER MAN 
ON GRACE 
Running.   Equally tireless.      Locked onto Asher like a missile. Grace is slowly gaining on Asher. 
Laval behind her.      Running.   Screaming in his radio. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
(subtitled French) We're heading East. Form a line at Seychelles. A dozen UNIFORMS charge through the crowd. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY 
Police RADIOS busy with CHATTER. UNIFORMS clear a path for two PATROL CARS. SIRENS WHOOP as they coast in, TAP bumpers, blocking the intersection. POLICE OFFICERS form a formidable skirmish line. SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside. 
EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT 
Asher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees the gauntlet of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection ahead. Asher shoves his hand in his pocket... 
BOOM!   BOOM-BOOM!     POP-POP-POP! 
Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES. It's not gunfire... 
TILT UP. 
FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of fire. Rivers of sparks. Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for Asher. Laval reaches her. 
GRACE 
Shit.     You see him? POP-POP-BOOM! More fireworks.         Laval gestures for some Uniforms to spread out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A SHRILL SCREAM O.S. 
From an apartment building. Grace runs into the building. Laval follows her. 
INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Grace and Laval running.   More SCREAMING O.S.    They run upstairs. 
INT. APARTMENT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
An UPSET WOMAN is in the hall, standing by the just-been kicked-in door of her apartment. Grace and Laval charge inside. 
INT. UPSET WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered. Below and beyond is a long rooftop. Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the St. Lawrence River. 
GRACE SEES -- 
ASHER jump from the far end of the roof. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Laval will go no further. Grace gets a running start, jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls. On her feet again, Grace sprints along the roof. FIREWORKS BOOM and POP overhead.   THUMPING TECHNO. Grace reaches the edge of the roof.     REACTS.   Reynaud has caught up with her. 
EXT. RIVER PARK - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT 
Asher has vanished into a vast sea of DANCERS, adorned with strobing and glowing jewelry. The BEAT dominates all sound. 
EXT. RIVER PARK - NIGHT 
Grace and Reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd. 
FIND ASHER -- 
A dozen yards away. He stalks a dancing RAVER who wears a huge bundle of glowing necklaces. Asher snatches necklaces.   Disappears into a wall of 
DANCERS. 
FIND GRACE -- 
She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a bonding moment. Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher turns... 
IT'S NOT ASHER. 
Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through the crowd. Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.    They cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal... 
A FIGHT 
Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around; no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in and arrest the two Jocks. Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.    He looks at Grace, they know they've been beaten. 
EXT. RIVER PARK - CRANE SHOT - NIGHT 
PULL BACK to reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an ocean of bodies in motion. 
CAMERA FINDS A DANCER. 
Some dude with his shirt off grinds on three HOTTIES. 
PUSH IN ON THE DANCER. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
It's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand, Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity. 
ASHER'S EYES 
Dangerous and cold.     They track Grace as she moves through the crowd. Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with her. Grace searching the crowd.    Scanning faces. Grace passes within feet of Asher. Asher smirks.     Now another hottie wants a kiss.   Asher complies. 
INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT 
It's late. Costa has a beer, his nose bandaged. INSPECTORS finish up questioning PATRONS. Grace enters, crosses to Costa. She's tense, wound tight. 
GRACE (O.S.) 
That would be out of bounds. Grace looking at him. Costa looking at her. A staring match. Costa and Grace try not to laugh. They end up giggling. 
COSTA 
What was that? 
GRACE 
I don't know. John, games are fun. But head games are dangerous. 
COSTA 
Then keep your head out of it. A beat.   Grace shrugs, back to business. 
GRACE 
The Justice minister is going to relocate you to another city until Mr. Asher is in custody. 
COSTA 
I don't know what your deal is. One second you're so there, then all I get is the badge. 
GRACE 
I apologize if you've been getting the wrong signal. 
COSTA 
Yeah.   Relocate where? 
GRACE 
Another province. They want you on a flight tomorrow morning. 
COSTA 
This monster comes into my life and I have to leave? A UNIFORM SERGEANT enters. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SERGEANT 
My people are in place. 
GRACE 
Thank you, Sergeant. The Sergeant exits. 
COSTA 
This is surreal. What do I pack? 
GRACE 
What you need.   Movers can get the rest. 
COSTA 
I need tomorrow morning to finish up my business here. 
GRACE 
I'll let them know. This is goodbye.     Neither of them feels very good about it. 
COSTA 
I thought you were going to check under my bed. Grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed, stretching for Costa. Driving him nuts. 
GRACE 
No monsters. 
COSTA 
Thank you. Grace holds out her hand.      They shake. 
GRACE 
I probably won't see you again until the trial. If there is a trial. 
COSTA 
Goodbye, then. Costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall. A bold move. Now they are eye to eye. Grace kisses Costa for a long beat. Grace breaks the kiss. Holds a finger to her lips; shhh. She turns and exits. The door shuts behind her. Costa is going to miss Grace. 
EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The next morning. Laval pulls up in UNMARKED #1, next to the patrol car that has been guarding Costa's apartment. With a wave the UNIFORM behind the wheel drives off. Laval exits his car. Crosses to Costa's door. 
NEW ANGLE 
Reynaud and Grace have just pulled to the curb a half block away. 
INT. UNMARKED #2 - DAY 
Reynaud behind the wheel, turns to Grace. 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
You spent a lot of time with Costa. Grace isn't sure if that's an accusation. 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
I like him.   He's a good guy. Grace smiles. 
EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Laval RINGING the bell. A white PLUMBER'S VAN pulls up behind Laval's unmarked. A PLUMBER gets out.    Coveralls, clipboard.    Crosses to another apartment. Costa opens the door. With two packed bags.       Laval takes one. Costa takes one last look at his home.       Locks the door. Laval watches the plumber KNOCKING a couple doors down. Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1. The plumber approaches them.     Costa looking at him, 
A head-on imminent.    The Buick swerves onto the shoulder. Just missing them. 
INT. UNMARKED #2 - MOVING - DAY 
Grace watches Costa's unmarked SCRAPE past the truck.        A side mirror is knocked off. The oncoming Buick swerves back onto the asphalt. Overcompensates, now heading right for Grace... Grace REACTS, swerves. BAM!   The cars hit.   Grace gets a face full of airbag. 
EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY 
Grace's car spins off the road. Stops in a ditch.       A beat. The Buick's hulk blocking the road. Grace exits the unmarked. Dazed but unhurt. She crosses to the Buick. Three HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS are in the car. 
GRACE 
Is everyone okay? They seem alright. 
GIRL #1 
Yeah. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GIRL #2 
I think so. 
GIRL #3 
Omigod, I have to call my mom. A POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a stop. Then another POLICE CAR. Grace runs to one of the police cars. 
GRACE 
They're okay. Let's go. (points up the road) He just shot a cop. Grace jumps in the passenger seat.        The COP looking at her. 
GRACE 
Let's go.   Bad guy's that way. The Cop nods, PUNCHES IT. 
INT. UNMARKED #1 - MOVING - DAY 
Costa is driving towards the mountains.        Driving through the pine forest. 
ASHER 
There.   Turn there. A hard-to-see side road. Costa JAMS the BRAKES to make the turn. Asher SLAPS him. 
ASHER 
Careful. 
COSTA 
Okay. Sorry. Sorry.      You don't want to do this. 
ASHER 
Yes I do. John, do you have any idea how many people I have killed? It's always been business. This time is personal. 
COSTA 
Please be cool. C'mon, we don't even know each other. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ASHER 
Shut up. Art Man. You are stupid or crazy or both. Will you drive faster? I'll shoot you in the thigh. Will that get your attention. Costa speeds up. 
COSTA 
Don't, man. I got money. You want money, I'll give you money. I got paintings. What do you want? Talk to me, Martin. 
ASHER 
I am not Martin. There is no Martin. 
COSTA 
Of course. No Martin. What do you want? What's my life worth to you? 
ASHER 
Nothing. And everything. This is deeper than money. Shut up. Talk is done. Talk is over. Understand that. You are over. Just shut the fuck up. Asher lights a cigarette.     A sharp turn ahead.    Costa speeding up. 
COSTA 
Okay, please, Martin.   Martin.   Be cool. Asher aims his pistol at Costa's head. 
ASHER 
(really pissed) Who the fuck is Martin? Costa sets his brow in determination; he is driving straight at a large tree... Asher REACTS. Costa jams his thumb into the release button of Asher's seatbelt... Asher angrily pulls the trigger of his pistol. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The unmarked car hits the tree... POW!   Airbags deploy. 
Costa's body is slammed by crash forces but stays put... Asher goes over his airbag.     Asher's head goes through the windshield. 
INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY 
The Cop GUNS it into the mountains.       A fork in the road. 
COP 
Which way do I turn? 
Who? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ASHER 
I should have cut her throat when I saw her on the ferry. That's the least she deserves. Please don't do anything, Grace. It would hurt me so much if I had to hurt you. 
GRACE 
Good idea.   Don't hurt me. Costa shakes his head, his brow set with a grim determination. He turns, enters a stairwell and exits the building. Grace's heart is breaking. 
GRACE 
Shit! She kicks the wall and gives chase, runs into the stairwell. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
Asher gets into Grace's unmarked.      And drives away. Grace exits the building, watches him go. Grace has no way to follow.     Then... She sees a COP talking to a cute NURSE by his patrol car. 
GRACE 
Police emergency. We need to pursue him. He's a murder suspect. The Cop cocks his head, looks at Grace like she's a nutcase. Grace dials her cell phone. 
GRACE 
Director Gillet, there's an emergency, can you please tell this officer to cooperate with me? Grace hands the cell phone to the Cop. 
EXT. NICE HOTEL - DAY 
A patrol car stops in front. Grace leaps out and runs into the building. An Unmarked pulls up. Reynaud jumps out and enters the building. 
INT. NICE HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY 
Grace running.   Reading room numbers.     Reynaud appears in the hall. Grace finds the right room.    Reynaud joins her, gun drawn. The door is ajar.     Grace pushes it open. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRACE'S POV - DAY 
A MAID changes the sheets.    Mrs. Asher is gone. 
INT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY 
Mrs. Asher answers a KNOCK at her door.       Mrs. Asher 
REACTS. 
ASHER 
Hello, Mother. Asher forces his way inside.      Mrs. Asher SCREAMS. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
SIRENS SCREAMING, flashing lights as six police cars zip by at 90. 
INT. UNMARKED - DAY 
Grace over the shock and harder than steel.       Reynaud drives fast. Grace on her cell. 
GRACE 
No answer.     She turns her phone off. 
INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Mrs. Asher sits on her couch. Asher stands.        The teeny Doberman walks into the room, sniffs Asher. 
ASHER 
What happened to Rex?     He was a real dog, right, Mom? Rolls up his sleeve, revealing the dog bite scars. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MRS. ASHER 
Don't show me that, Martin. I had Rex put down after you ran away. Martin, sit. 
Asher looks at her defiantly.     Mrs. Asher stands, gets in his face. 
MRS. ASHER 
How dare you defy me. You will sit down on that couch and you will do it now. Martin. Asher sits. Mrs. Asher lays a hand on his, leans forward, her eyes intense and earnest. 
MRS. ASHER 
Martin, you have severe emotional problems. I know you're in a lot of pain. There's hope and help, Martin. Look at me, Martin. I love you very much. 
MARTIN 
I know now that what you did to me was not love. 
INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Asher sitting on the couch.     Then stands. 
ASHER 
I'll stand if I want to stand. I can do anything I want to do. And I've done some great things, Mother. I'm not a scared little boy you can push around anymore. 
NEW ANGLE 
Mrs. Asher's head neatly adorns a silver platter. 
INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY 
Grace holds on as Reynaud slaloms around a corner in Asher's neighborhood. 
Not here. This city no longer has the psychic gravity to hold him here. Try Mexico, getting a facelift. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
We ID'd the remains in the morgue. The real ID. He hands her a picture of the man whom we thought was Asher. 
GRACE 
(reads) Richard Hart. 
FLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Hart rolls painting canvases into a tight cylinder. Inserts it into a fancy lamp. A hypodermic stands by to reward his work. 
DIRECTOR GILLET (V.O.) 
He was an addict. And a thief. An art thief. He hits galleries in Europe and North America. Traveled back and forth smuggling and selling stolen canvasses. 
INT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT) 
Grace puts it together. 
GRACE 
Let me guess, Costa was selling stolen art for Hart and never gave him the money. Now Hart is just another one of Asher's victims. Director Gillet. 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
Costa owed him eight thousand. Those are E-mails off Hart's computer. 
GRACE 
(reading) Go to hell. I won't pay you a dime. I'm not scared of you. 
FLASHBACK - INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT 
Richard Hart checks his E-mail and nearly has a heart attack. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Come and get me. I will never pay you, dumbass. (thinks a beat) Asher taunted Hart into a confrontation. Jesus. It was right there in my face. I was interpreting behavior from two different suspects. 
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) 
DIRECTOR GILLET 
He had us all fooled, Grace. All of us. If Asher can do that, what else can he do? 
GRACE 
Anything he wants. KNOCKING. Gillet stands, crosses, opens his door. Two FBI SUPERVISORS enter. Grim, silver-haired. Grace stands. 
GRACE 
Ah, the undertakers have arrived for my career. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grace hugs Gillet.     And the FBI Men escort her out of Gillet's office. 
INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Grace is on the spot.     Her LAWYER by her side. Facing a panel of seven SENIOR AGENTS.     Microphones, water pitchers. 
SENIOR AGENT 
Have your rights been explained to you and has an indication to that effect been made in your employee record? 
GRACE 
Yessir. 
INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Grace is exhausted, but holding up well.     The questions don't stop. 
SENIOR AGENT 
Agent Vanderholt. Why would Asher kill Ford, if nobody knew he was Costa. If he wasn't going to use Ford's identity? 
GRACE 
He needed a murder he could link not only Richard Hart to but also to his past victims. 
FLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Upscale Euro-hip. Hart SLAMS down the phone.        Shoves a gun in his belt and exits. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Hart's behavior was consistent with a disorganized drug addict following the rules of the criminal road by attempting to kill a debtor who won't pay. He had no idea he was being manipulated by a serial killer. 
INT. HART'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Asher enters through the front door.   Hart isn't home. 
INT. HART'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Asher steals floss from the garbage can.   Takes Hart's toothbrush. Some dirty laundry. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Asher wasn't becoming disorganized and decomposing into madness, he was evolving. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Asher, his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood, pulls Todd Ford from the trunk. 
ASHER (V.O.) 
Hello? 
GRACE 
I'm here. 
ASHER (V.O.) 
I miss you. 
GRACE 
Why don't you come and see me. I miss you, too. I'm at the Gainesville Virginia. The Motel 6 off Highway 29. Stop by. There is a strange tension in her voice. She hangs up. Turns off the TV. She gets off the bed, crosses to a corner. She sits, settles in for a long vigil. 
INT. ECONOMY MOTEL - DAY 
The rising sun reveals Grace has not moved. She is now realizing Asher isn't going to show. Grace drops the .45 and begins to cry. 
EXT. MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY 
Grace exits the clinic reading a test result.      She freezes in her tracks, returns inside. 
INT. WAREHOUSE STORE - DAY 
Grace shopping. She has a quarter ton bag of dog food. Gallons of spaghetti sauce. Stocking up. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Wintertime. It's an ice storm. Freezing rain accumulates on existing snow and ice. Grace loading her supplies into her truck. It's miserable out and getting worse. 
HONKING. Grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding helpless across the ice. It stops just short of hitting a parked car. 
INT. POST OFFICE - NIGHT 
Ten minutes later Grace checks her P.O. Box. Finds some baby catalogs. A local PREGNANT WOMAN enters. 
PREGNANT WOMAN 
Wow, you know the question? 
GRACE 
Six months. 
WIDER TO REVEAL: 
Grace is very pregnant. 
PREGNANT WOMAN 
That's it? 
GRACE 
Twins. 
PREGNANT WOMAN 
Good luck, sweetheart. Get yourself home, it's miserable out. Grace smiles, exits. 
EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT 
Old and falling apart. Overgrown with branches. The wind picking up. Grace's truck slowly navigating the ice. The only vehicle around. 
INT. GRACE'S TRUCK - MOVING - NIGHT 
The accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. Grace drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in low gear. She drives around a fallen tree branch. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
The State Police have said to stay off the road unless it's an absolute emergency. Several of their cruisers have already been damaged. There is ice everywhere. On the way in tonight I saw the snowplow slipping and sliding. Everybody, stay where you are. This is only the beginning. Grace turns OFF the RADIO.     Turns on the defroster. 
SOMETHING MOVING. 
WHAM! 
Her WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.     Grace REACTS. A tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her truck. The truck slides across the ice. Grace fights to regain control, to keep it out of the ditch. Grace stops.     Gets out.   Pulls the branch off the hood. 
EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
The last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings. Grace pulls open a large garage door. Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice. Regains her feet, finishes opening the door. She gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage. 
INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY 
Restored. Filled with family heirlooms.      Another family that has decayed from glory. Grace enters. Dripping wet. She turns OFF the ALARM. Then hangs up her heavy jacket. Bone tired. Grace crosses to the kitchen. 
INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Grace takes a Glock from her pocket and sets it on the counter. She pours water into a kettle. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Puts the kettle on the stove. Turns on the stove.         Grace notices water on the kitchen floor. Wait. Wet footprints. 
Grace REACTS.     Reaches for the Glock. A hand lands on top of her hand.      It's MARTIN ASHER. 
ASHER 
Hi, Grace. CLICK!   He snaps a handcuff around Grace's wrist. Asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down into a chair. She throws a punch. Asher blocks it. Asher yanks on her cuffed arm.       SMACK!   Grace slaps him. Asher pulls her into a chair. CLICK! Grace is now cuffed to the chair. She struggles futilely against the cuffs. Asher catches his breath. 
ASHER

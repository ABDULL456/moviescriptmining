Revised : April 30, 1975 
PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS. 
FADE IN: BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES 
1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT 
The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes 
2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT 
A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see 
3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY 
Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains... multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear tubes of the MAZE- CARS. 
4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS 
As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop. 
5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER 
The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator which instantly  starts to descend. 
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR 
From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out, pushes into  the crowd. 
7 		OUT 
8		WITH THE RUNNER 
As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he fears pursuit. 
9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR 
Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand -- and watching.  It is FRANCIS. 
10		WITH THE RUNNER 
Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the hall. 
11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS) 
Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised. 
12		P.O.V. 
The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful. 
13		THE SANDMAN 
Emotionless. Aims. Fires. 
14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE 
Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him. 
15		THE SANDMAN 
Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him. 
16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT) 
Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN. 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
(TITLES END) 
17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT) 
21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them. They   move off. 
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR 
Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see: 
23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE 
Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car disappears  into a tunnel. 
24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE 
As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a gathering  CROWD. 
25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE 
Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every delight -- too  much to take in at a glance. 
26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured argument continuing... 
LOGAN but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says.  One for one. One for one." 
FRANCIS Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea? 
LOGAN (laughs) No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher With a stuck tape. 
FRANCIS Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. (beat) You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman 
They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!! 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly, falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an apology and starts  back to RELIVE. 
As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully to  Logan and Francis and moves on. 
27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU 
They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in front of  her with his hands framing his face. 
MAN Well? How do you like it? 
WOMAN (critically) I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little - 
MAN Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think? 
WOMAN Too little. 
MAN Too little? (gestures) Too little. Okay, wait for me. 
And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by. 
28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP 
Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing "yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them. 
LOGAN Did you ever see Francis-8? 
FRANCIS (shaking his head) I never even visited Nursery before tonight. (beat) When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know? 
They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds... 
FRANCIS I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was? 
LOGAN (quickly) Of course not! I m curious, not sick. (laughs) 
The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway. Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group. 
29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL 
An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see Francis. They embrace,  and as they break: 
FRANCIS and that's my friend, Logan. (as she acknowledges the introduction) We're celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to come along? 
WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head) Only if I make it to the top of Carousel. (she holds up her hand) Thirty -- and the big spin. 
In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her a  half-squeeze. 
FRANCIS You're thirty -- already? I always thought I was older than you - (beat) Well, give it a good try. 
WOMAN (pleasantly) You know I always have. 
Another beautiful WOMAN joins them. 
Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there. 
42		CAROUSEL 
As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it... 
43		CROWD 
Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see 
44		CAROUSEL 
Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained aurora as the Carousel picks up speed. 
45		LOGAN 
Caught up in it Like the rest. 
46		CAROUSEL 
Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting, spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of weightlessness, always struggling to move higher. 
Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and then -- a searing flash. And it is gone. SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING. 
47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN 
Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as: 
48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL 
High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome, fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward against the curtain and the flash of extinction. 
49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN 
At the highest level...straining for the rainbow... 
50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD 
Hysterical...starting to chant... 
CROWD Renew! 
The man continues to strain: 
CROWD Renew! 
51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN 
Almost a blur...but still straining: CROWD'S CHANT Renew! 
52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
LOGAN AND FRANCIS (chanting with the rest) Renew! 
53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN 
The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the rainbow... 
CROWD'S CHANT Re... 
Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness below...where he is instantly incinerated. 
54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL 
Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining. 
55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS 
Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing -- SCREAMING, fulfilled. 
56 		OUT 
57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow bands. 
58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small, dark plastic box. 
Logan looks at the box. On it we see: 
MAN: RELIVE STORE 14 LOGAN (to Francis) Looks like I'm working. Francis stands. LOGAN Who invited you? 
FRANCIS I'm in my party mood. Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the bleachers. 
They make their way into the hall. 
As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd beginning to pour out of Carousel. 
63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE 
Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is gesturing toward the Hallucimill. 
FRANCIS ...Well I think you're getting stale. You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out... 
He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down. 
FRANCIS (calling after him) I'll look for you here when I'm off-- 
And he is gone. 63X15		LOGAN 
waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill. 
63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT. 
Crazy, man. 
63X17		BACK TO LOGAN 
Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He looks and we see: 63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS 
The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for more fun. 
63X19		LOGAN Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit. 
63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT 
As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials. 
63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS 
As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing. 
63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE 
Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes shape. It is Jessica. 63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN 
Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile. Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room. 
64		LOGAN AND JESSICA 
As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her- but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely, is amused and surprised. 
LOGAN What's wrong, Available? 
JESSICA (breaking away gently) Please . . .No. 
She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling. 
LOGAN Please . . . no ? (noting that she looks trapped, he understands) You mean "not here"--that's it? You're a private Available but particular, (he is moving in on her as he speaks, she retreating, which amuses him) Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you. 
JESSICA No. (that stops him) Just no. 
LOGAN You prefer women? 
JESSICA No. 
LOGAN Well then...? 
JESSICA Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake. 
LOGAN Sad? What made you sad? JESSICA A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone. LOGAN (after a beat) Yes...probably he was renewed? 
JESSICA (flatly) He was killed 
LOGAN Killed? Why do you use that word? 
JESSICA Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill. 
LOGAN I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate  Runners (a beat) Who brought you? 
JESSICA Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the circuit. 
LOGAN You felt sad. What's your name? 
JESSICA Jessica. 
LOGAN (matter-of-fact) You're beautiful. Let's have sex. JESSICA No. LOGAN Later. 
JESSICA No. 
LOGAN But you put yourself on the circuit! 
65-68	OUT 
69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA 
Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE, YELLOW GREEN AND RED. Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes. 
There are no humans. 
Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room.... above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of a palm crystal on one part of the circular table. 
Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table. (These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at the beginning of the film.) 
The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner on the overhang above. Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times. He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments later...the scanner stops...the word: IDENTIFY 
appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . . and the words: CLEAR FRANCIS-7 
appear on the SCREEN. 
FRANCIS See you in the hydrotoner! Logan nods. 
Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry. 
Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was earlier. 
The scanner continues scanning. 
Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on and on. 
Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything remotely resembling this length of time. 
Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word: 
PROBABILITY 
blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word: APPROACH 
We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . . that he has never seen this before. Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair. 
The word on the SCREEN is now: 
IDENTIFY 
Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove. We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words appear on the SCREEN: 
OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT? 
LOGAN Negative. Question: What is it? Words on SCREEN now read: 
PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL. NAME: ANKH. QUESTION: IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY? 
LOGAN Negative. 
Words on SCREEN now read: 
SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL- ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING PLACE OF IMMUNITY. 
LOGAN I don't understand? 
Words on SCREEN now read: 
SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056. LOGAN Question: 
Word on SCREEN now reads: 
HOLD It disappears and words on SCREEN now read: 
OBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... RUNNER GOAL. 
LOGAN 1056 unaccounted for?! 
Word on SCREEN reads: 
CORRECT 
LOGAN Impossible! (Rising tone) Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal on Carousel. 
Words on SCREEN read: 
NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056... 
LOGAN Question: None of them reached renewal? 
Word on SCREEN reads: 
ZERO 
Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to: 
70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING 
Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out the black box, dials. 
LOGAN (into box) Location...female Green Six... name Jessica...living in Quad K. 
71-73 	OUT 
73X1		INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT 
Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who has obviously escorted her there. 
YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling) She says she's been here before... 
LOGAN She has. 
Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off. 
JESSICA You could have called me yourself. 
LOGAN But I wasn't sure you'd come. 
JESSICA (the game has started) Here I am. (beat) Shall I come in? 
Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area. 
LOGAN I couldn't get you out of my mind. 
JESSICA I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose? 
LOGAN Maybe...sure.... 
JESSICA Thanks...but I have the choice. LOGAN Of course. JESSICA Then it's still no. 
Logan laughs. 
JESSICA You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want? 
LOGAN You know 
JESSICA I don't believe you. There has to be more. 
LOGAN All right. 
Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that. Jessica can see it blinking red. 
Jessica gasps for a moment...then: 
JESSICA Why show me? 
LOGAN I'm going to run. 
JESSICA (after reacting) Why tell me? 
LOGAN You know something. JESSICA About running, dying what? 
LOGAN Both...running's what I'm interested in. 
JESSICA I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has. 
LOGAN It's different now. Help me. 
JESSICA How can I? 
Logan takes out the ankh. 
JESSICA Where did you get that? 
LOGAN A Runner gave it to me. 
JESSICA And then you killed him, right? 
LOGAN I let him go...believe me. 
JESSICA I don't.. 
LOGAN (a beat) Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please... 
JESSICA Please? What friends? 
LOGAN (clutching the ankh, looking at Jessica's; then:) I don't have much time. 
JESSICA I never heard of a Sandman running . . . ever. . . 
Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful. 
94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE 
The man from the restaurant, following. 
94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA 
Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS. 
Logan opens the door, reacts. 
LOGAN Are you here to help me? JESSICA What do you need? 
A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to him as the door closes. 
94X4 	OUT 
DISSOLVE TO: 94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together, stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi). 
JESSICA What're you going to do? 
LOGAN That's tomorrow. 
JESSICA (turning away slightly) I wish I could help you. 
LOGAN (turning her gently back) Maybe you'll chink of something... 
JESSICA (hating herself) I wish I knew what you think I know. 
Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each other anyhow. They commence walking again. 94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE 
The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue, Logan and Jessica approach. 
94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA 
LOGAN If you did know, you'd tell me. JESSICA Of course-- 
LOGAN (overriding) If you trusted me, you'd know. JESSICA (evading it) We're coming to Arcade. (beat)	- Shall we Relive together? 94X8		CLOSE ANGLE 
As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit round a corner. 
94X9 	OUT 
94AX9	READY ROOM 
As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing there, watching. He loves the work--they all do. 
94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL 
Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary. 
94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE 
Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level. 
94X12	FEATURING JESSICA 
As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound, hesitates, pretends to have stumbled. 
94X13	THE AMBUSHERS 
Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the man's hands. 94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them. Logan looks at her searchingly. 
LOGAN Tell me, Jessica. 
Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver. Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side, Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica cranes her head to see too. 94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN 
As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 
RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2 ...LOGAN-5 
The Sandman at the console turns and says: 
1ST SANDMAN Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you-- 
But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you see them" etc. 
95-105 	OUT 
105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH 
JESSICA (gently) Don't be afraid. 
We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair is tangled. 
JESSICA What's your name? 
MARY I'm Mary 2. 
JESSICA Where do you live, Mary? 
MARY Here. 
JESSICA Why aren't you in Nursery? 
MARY I'm very smart. 
JESSICA When do you go up? 
MARY I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady. 
As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away swiftly. 
As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back. 
LOGAN (shaking his head) Not here. Might be a decoy. 
Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into- 
125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF 
An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings. 
Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area, listening... 
SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady. 
Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off, puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand still then he straightens, steps out, calls: 
LOGAN Runner! 
Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on and off. The Runner is a woman! 
There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly Jessica gasps, grasping at him. As Logan whirls: 125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE 
Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs. 
A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still. 
BILLY (speaking of the Runner) Don't worry about her. We'll have that one later. Right now I think we've got a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner! 
The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy. 
A VOICE We're going to have ourselves a time, we are. Right, Billy?! 
There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest. 
LOGAN I'm a Sandman! 
BILLY I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They said I'd never get him...but I cut him up good, I did. 
LOGAN (firm tone) I feel sorry for you, boy! 
Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader. 
BILLY For me? Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman! 
LOGAN No, for you! How old are you, Billy? 
Billy is silent. 
LOGAN Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? (he points to the yellow flower in Billy's palm) What happens when you're sixteen and you go green? 
BILLY (lashing out) Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go! 
LOGAN No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. (slightest beat) If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart! 
BILLY Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth! 
Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned building. 
ANOTHER VOICE Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut his mouth! Let's watch him shake himself to death!! We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They take menacing positions - some leaping overhead. A VOICE Give him some Muscle!! Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and Jessica 126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA 
Watching..terrified. 
127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN Being held against the wall by Cubs as: ANOTHER VOICE Shake him to death!! 
Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 
134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS 
shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window. FRANCIS (in a firm, cold tone) Runner! The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as: Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples to the floor; 
134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN 
hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange a look. 
135		LOGAN AND JESSICA 
At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn. Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and pulls her away. 
136		FRANCIS 
After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and starts to speak into it: 
FRANCIS (quietly) Runner terminated at G.16 Ready for cleanup at Cathedral Quadrant 39. 137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 
The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform... peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have heard. 
They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica. 
SECOND MAN I almost believed her. 
They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived. 
138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 
Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car platform. 
139		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT 
JESSICA I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed. 
LOGAN Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there? 
JESSICA Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you. 
LOGAN (a beat) All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner. 
JESSICA (interrupting) Yes, but they won't know that...or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now... 
LOGAN (wry laugh) That's nothing...there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them. 
JESSICA (torn) I - I can't. 
LOGAN Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain 
JESSICA No. Not that either. 
Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then: 
LOGAN All right. New You 483. I'll find out myself. 
139X1		INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS 
Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring the city. 
139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS 
Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area. 
The scanners begin moving. 
Moments later the scanner stops...the word: 
IDENTIFY 
appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into the groove. 
Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them on the scanning table. 
An ALARM SOUNDS and the word: 
REJECT 
flashes on and off on the SCREEN. 
Sandmen come running into the Area. 
SANDMAN What happened?! 
Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind, taking the items off the table: FRANCIS Can you beat it....I've got the damn wrong bag. 
DOC Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table... (smiles) and other things. I'll be back in a minute. 
HOLLY He's going to sterilize himself. 
LOGAN Do I have to undress? 
HOLLY Not for your face. 
Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc who speaks to her with soft urgency). 
DOC You shouldn't have brought him here. 
JESSICA; I didn't bring him -- what's the difference. He's blinking. He wants to run. DOC Run!? He's a Sandman. 
JESSICA I tell you he's running. I know. DOC Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd gone somewhere else. (a beat, a shrug) All right. He gets a face. 144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY 
Logan lies down. 
The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning him. 
HOLLY (leaning - close to Logan) I like dark hair. Have him give you dark hair. 
DOC'S VOICE All set? HOLLY Um huh. Would you take a picture of him, Doc? I'd like you to give his face to somebody else. 
DOC Why not? 
Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH. 
DOC Do you have anything special in mind? 
LOGAN I don't care...Just get it over with. 
DOC (smiling) Hurry...hurry...hurry. 
HOLLY (whispering) Dark hair. 
LOGAN Holly'd like dark hair. DOC Holly'd like a lot of things. (studying Logan's face) We can start by narrowing the cheekbones. Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach. 
CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points. 
A vibrobeam begins to KEEN. 
SOUND: An insistent chiming. 
Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The table and the laser heads stop moving. DOC (as if speaking on a phone) Hello (listening) Yes (listening) Yes, they are. (listening; his expression changing) Done. 
Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan, then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine again... 
DOC Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine. 
As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near Logan's face. It pauses as 
DOC With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. It's all in one...watch now... 
The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a bright trail of blood as 
DOC But here's the improvement. Instant healing---before you feel a thing. Watch now... 
Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track, spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is moist and whole. 
144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN 
His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's happening. 
144X3		BACK TO DOC 
who is playing the console as he speaks. 
DOC Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman. The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath-- absolute precision. Watch now And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a seam of blood following the rip. 
DOC Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning. And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears. Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed. 
HOLLY No! You're scrambling the table. He'll be cut to pieces, Doc. DOC Damn right! It was a trap. They know! LOGAN No - I'm Running! 
Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY. 
Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with her as: 
145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 
Moving. 
HOLLY 
Watching two stun beams lower. 
Logan and Jessica running through Arcade. 167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Suddenly she pulls him in another direction. 
JESSICA Follow me, Logan. Stay close. 
As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind... spots them and follows. 
173 		OUT 
174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop. 
175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and laughing: 
WANTON I have an empty one, Sandman 
Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and Jessica with it. 
176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON 
As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica. 
179		SERIES OF SHOTS 
Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off. 
INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold and multiform -- everybody doing it. 
180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS 
Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing Wantons. 
181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA 
Brief glimpses of them looking for each other. 
183		FRANCIS 
Hunting both. 
184		WITH LOGAN 
As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple mirrors enclose them. 
Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides shut again. 185		FRANCIS 
Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down again as the orgy continues. 
186X1 	OUT 
186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY 
After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the wall. 
LOGAN Are you taking me to them? 
JESSICA Yes. (beat) I don't know what else to do -- with him following us. (she hesitates) Why do you keep running from your-- 
LOGAN Because he's my friend - (a beat) and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone. 
JESSICA He's good, isn't he? 
LOGAN Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others. (a beat) You know there's only one place to go now... 
JESSICA (hopelessly) They won't believe us. 
LOGAN (beat) I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis. 
JESSICA They won¹t listen. LOGAN (interrupting) You think Sandmen will? (before she can answer) There's no other way for me, 
JESSICA We'll convince them. 
They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off. 
JESSICA Yes, Logan. (turning to him blindly) I'm glad they didn't change your face. Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They continue down into the darkness. Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their footsteps are heard. 
187 		OUT 187X1	FRANCIS At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away as he searches. 
188-200 	OUT 
200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA 
They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness. 
As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall, suddenly: 
227		FRANCIS 
looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away. 
228		LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion, somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient machinery GROANS. They turn and run as they HEAR: FRANCIS (distorted; echo; etcetera) LOGAN N N N. 229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT 
is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see: 
THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back and they are revealed. 
230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS 
aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in his sights. 
231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 
Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half-drowning Jessica through. 
232		INT. - THE SHAFT 
A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning when the waterlock door closes. Logan slumps to the floor. 
233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside - flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow. It is now very cold. 
In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly, tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to move. 
JESSICA (whispering) I'm afraid. 
LOGAN It's brighter there...besides, we can't go back. 
He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back. 
JESSICA Wait. 
He halts. 
JESSICA (cont'd) I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- (a beat) Are you glad you didn't kill him? 
LOGAN It doesn't make any difference anymore. 
JESSICA You're really one of us now, aren't you? 
LOGAN You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? (Jessica nods) Why did you stay with me? 
JESSICA (feelingly) I wanted to... (Logan puts his arms around her) ...And you...what made you kill Sandmen? 
LOGAN I had to. I did kill...for the first time in my life I killed. 
JESSICA Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you. 
LOGAN I guess so...I know I felt something I never felt before...and I didn't like it...not a bit. (after another long beat) I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now. 
JESSICA For us. 
Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last minutes he has done strange things. 
234-236 	OUT 236x1	INT. - ICE CAVERN 
Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side and revealing for the first time where they are. 
236x2	ANGLE 
Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the side, a bright light. 236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Walk toward the light. 
236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA 
We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds. 
236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE 
As they look in wonder: 
VOICE Overwhelming, isn't it? 
Logan and Jessica turn and see: 
237-238	OUT 
Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and flicker out. 
270X7	ANGLE 
The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again and again like great spears and wedges 
270X8	BOX Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness. 270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by Being in an angle of the cave. 
270X10	FULL SHOT The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence. Then: 
SOUND: Ice melting, water running. 
270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive. 
SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into the water. 
As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening. 
Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out. 
271-272	OUT 
273		EXT. - HIGH LEDGE 
Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt. 
They are blinded by: 
274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN 
As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the dazzling light will not go away: 
Standing together...in fear of the sunrise. 
JESSICA Is there something on fire!! 
Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know. 
As Logan looks up at the sun. LOGAN It seems to be moving away. Come on... 
274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge. 
274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS 
Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing. 
JESSICA (frightened) What's that? 
LOGAN It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving. 
JESSICA (smiling) And yours. 
They reach the level below and pause, look around. 
LOGAN Jessica -- we must be outside! 
She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they set out again. 
275-276	OUT 
276X1	INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS 
Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled. 
277-287X1 OUT 
288		EXT . - FOREST AREA 
As Logan and Jessica reach it. 
They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched, etcetera. 
A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off: 
JESSICA (starting to panic) I hate outside! I hate it! 
LOGAN (holding her; comforting tone) We'll be all right... (a beat) We will... 
The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in the grass...startling them for a moment. 288XA1	FRANCIS Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica did. 288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA 
LOGAN What makes you think so? 
OLD MAN My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know? 
LOGAN (astonished) Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father? 
The man nods. 
JESSICA And...and how were you grown? Inside your mother? 
OLD MAN Yes... 
JESSICA Are you sure? 
OLD MAN Mother and Father said so... you know? 
LOGAN Where are they? 
OLD MAN Dead...they're dead...and buried. 
JESSICA (not knowing what it is) Buried??? 
Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider: 
302		CLOSE ON A CAT 
Coming through the opening - did he push it? 
303		CLOSE ON THE MAN 
OLD MAN (pleased; reciting) "Gus is the cat at the theatre door. His name, as I ought to have told you before, Is really Asparagus. That's such a fuss To pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus." 
306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA 
OLD MAN May I see your hand again? 
Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them, looks from one to another with delight. OLD MAN They're beautiful. May I have one too please? LOGAN No--I'm sorry. It's not possible. OLD MAN (offended) It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats...a Jellicle cat. (reciting) "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise." 
LOGAN I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you. As the man continues to look petulant: 
JESSICA (simply; sincerely) That's the truth. 
Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man. 
JESSICA Here you can have this. 
The man seems pleased. OLD MAN What kind of jewel is this? 
JESSICA I don't know. OLD MAN You're both full of secrets like Macavity. (looking at the ring) Did you steal this? JESSICA No. OLD MAN (reciting) "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity." LOGAN What's beyond this place - do you know? OLD MAN No, no, no LOGAN Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place? OLD MAN Never, never, ever. Nothing. 
After a pause: 
LOGAN May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest. 
OLD MAN Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people. 
JESSICA What belongs to the people? 
OLD MAN All this. All of it. JESSICA What people? OLD MAN I don't know...but it does. 
The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining room. 
OLD MAN I'll be right back. (stopping) Oh, yes...about the cats... one rule is true: (reciting) "Don't speak till you are spoken to." The man smiles and leaves. 305		LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down. 
Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it. 
Logan is deep in thought. 
Jessica looks up from the book. 
JESSICA (quietly) How curious people used to be -- All these books... 
Silence...until: 
LOGAN That sweet madman -- how could he Come to exist? JESSICA He had a mother and father -- and he knew them. 
LOGAN One in a million, I suppose 
LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; smiling) ...Who knows? 
JESSICA (after a beat) We're going on, aren't we? 
LOGAN (shaking his head) There's nothing to go on to, Jessica. 
Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the CHAMBER FLOOR. 
FRANCIS Why did you do that??!! 
LOGAN I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that.... 
FRANCIS (interrupting; wild) Why did you do that???!!! 
Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan. 
314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS 
Scattering in all directions as: 
315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN 
In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling 
320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING 
Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and Francis were putting on a show for him. 
321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS 
A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling backward. 
D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who ducks. 
E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it. 
F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in front of him. 
G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole. 
H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows. 
I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest. 
J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward. Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on Francis' head. 
K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward Logan... 
Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding death off with the strong grip. 
FRANCIS (delirious) That was the right shot--Look out there, he's trying to break free Watch it, Logan, steady, now!...... 
His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant. 
FRANCIS Logan! You renewed! 
And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO: 332		JESSICA AND THE MAN 
The man walks over to Francis and bends down. 
OLD MAN Oh, my...he died...

OLD MAN They¹re put into the ground so they can be visited by the living... 
Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out. 
OLD MAN I¹ll make the arrangements. 
JESSICA (softly) At least it¹s over... 
Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then: 
OLD MAN Are you ready to put him in? LOGAN Not yet. 
OLD MAN All right. 
The man sits down. 
Logan nods. 
OLD MAN Yes, I would like to see that. Is it a long journey? 
Again, Logan nods.

361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE 
On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of firelight. 
OLD MAN (weary but enthusiastic) Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon? 
LOGAN I promise. We '11 go on as soon as it's light. 
JESSICA (gently, turning O.M. away) But now I'm tired. Let's go back to the fire... 
They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT 
As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground. 
OLD MAN That's better than gold when it's cold. 
LOGAN Thank you. (turning to Old Man) Tell me - what do those words mean? "Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"'... 
OLD MAN My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used - to stay together. 
LOGAN Stay? They lived together all their years? 
OLD MAN Oh, yes...I think... 
JESSICA (reading; moved) ³Beloved son²... (a beat) So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered. (another beat) I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way? 
LOGAN (facing Jessica) Yes. You and I, Jessica. (a beat) 
JESSICA And Sanctuary? 
LOGAN Sanctuary is the right to live.... nothing more. But nothing less, either....

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to find and destroy Sanctuary. 
In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading: PROBABILITY blinks on and off. 
Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN. 
We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the b.g. of the SHOT.

372X1- 372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN 
As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear -- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds. 
As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

J. 						A FOURTH HEAD (Logan's voice) There is no Sanctuary 
K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light... starting to frighten the Sandmen present. 
L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody. 
M.						A FIFTH HEAD (Logan's voice) An old man without a crystal...But there is no Sanctuary. 
N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the intermittent glow of overheated electronic components. 
O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but broken now. 
P. 						A SIXTH HEAD (Logan's voice) There is no Sanctuary. 
Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen. 
R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the SCREEN begins to shake. 
379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS 
LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating from all of them) There is no Sanctuary. There is no Sanctuary. 
The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out. 
The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame. 
380-410 	OUT 
410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN 
Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time to meet: 
410X2	SANDMEN 
Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in on Logan One holding Jessica. 
410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc. Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and discharges. 
410X4	THE BATTLE 
The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion. Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving. Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet. Crouched, they make for the exit.

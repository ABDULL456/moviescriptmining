"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued to believe in a turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro 'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black masses quiet until now."

INT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY 
EXTREME CLOSE UP 
WE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips. 
MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY Waaaake up! Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up! Up ya wake!  Up ya wake!  Up ya wake! 
CAMERA MOVES BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY, a DJ, a radio personality, behind a microphone. 
MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY This is Mister Señor Love Daddy. Your voice of choice.  The world's only twelve-hour strongman, here on WE LOVE radio, 108 FM.  The last on your dial, but the first in ya hearts, and that's the truth, Ruth! 
The CAMERA, which is STILL PULLING BACK, shows that Mister Señor Love Daddy is actually sitting in a storefront window. The control booth looks directly out onto the street.  This is WE LOVE RADIO, a modest station with a loyal following, right in the heart of the neighborhood.  The OPENING SHOT will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the storefront window. 
MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY Here I am.  Am I here?  Y'know it. It ya know.  This is Mister Señor Love Daddy, doing the nasty to ya ears, ya ears to the nasty.  I'se play only da platters dat matter, da matters dat platter and that's the truth, Ruth.

INT: DA MAYOR'S BEDROOM--DAY 
An old, grizzled man stirs in the bed, his sheets are soaked with sweat.  He flings them off his wet body. 
DA MAYOR Damn, it's hot. 
INT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY 
CAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa bed. 
CLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS 
WE SEE him counting his money.  This isn't any ordinary counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the "dead presidents"--are facing the same way.  This is MOOKIE.  Once he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks into his sister's bedroom. 
INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY 
CLOSE UP--JADE 
JADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep.  Mookie's fingers ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips.  Jade pushes his hands away.  Mookie waits several beats and he continues.  Jade wakes up--mad. 
JADE Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping? 
MOOKIE Wake up! 
Mookie enters the pizzeria and Pino is on him before the door closes. 
PINO Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you? 
MOOKIE Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito. 
SAL How ya doin', Mookie? 
VITO Whaddup? 
MOOKIE Just coolin'. 
PINO You're still late. 
SAL Pino, relax, will ya. 
PINO Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping. 
MOOKIE Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow. 
VITO That's right. 
PINO Shaddup, Vito. 
MOOKIE Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for. 
PINO You get paid to do what we say. 
MOOKIE What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say nuthin'. 
Pino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this; all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito. 
PINO Who's working for who? 
There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters. 
SAL Come on in, Mayor. 
DA MAYOR Good morning, gentlemens.  It's gonna be a scorcher today, that's for sure.  Need any work done around here? 
Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom. 
DA MAYOR It will be the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of Health. 
Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle. 
PINO Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum-- 
MOOKIE Da Mayor ain't no bum. 
PINO Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son. 
MOOKIE Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit. 
SAL Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business. 
VITO Tell 'em, Pop. 
PINO Me and you are gonna have a talk. 
VITO Sez who? 
PINO Sez me. 
SAL Hey!  What did I say? 
MOOKIE Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit. 
SAL Mookie, no cursing in the store. 
MOOKIE Talk to your son. 
EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY 
Da Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be.  As soon as he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle. 
KOREAN CLERK You buy 'nother beer. 
DA MAYOR Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're asking a lot to make a man change his beer, that's asking a lot, Doctor. 
EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY 
Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops and takes a long swig. 
MOTHER SISTER You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya about drinking in front of my stoop? Move on, you're blocking my view. 
Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her. 
MOTHER SISTER You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me. 
Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look. 
MOTHER SISTER The evil eye doesn't work on me. 
DA MAYOR Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you? 
MOTHER SISTER You're a drunk fool. 
DA MAYOR Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you. 
MOTHER SISTER Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love. 
DA MAYOR One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil. 
Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a final swig of beer just for her. 
INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY 
An elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes the door on her mother's ranting and raving. 
ANGLE--TINA 
Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks to her son while walking around the room. 
TINA Hector, I shouldn't be telling you this but you would find out sooner or later.  Ya father ain't no real father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world.  Your father is to the curb.  You're smart.  I see that look on ya face. You're saying if he's such a bum why am I with him?  Good question. Like I said before, you're no dummy. He talked his way into my panties, I thought being a mother would make me happy, make me whole.  He's a mistake, but you are not. 
Tina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another teenage parent. 
EXT: STREET CORNER--DAY 
Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall, a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment, nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML.  All three are sitting in folding chairs up against a wall in the shade. 
ML The way I see it, if this hot weather continues, it will surely melt the polar caps and the whole wide world--the parts that ain't water already--will be flooded. 
COCONUT SID You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that? 
ML Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat? 
ML Don't worry about it. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts. 
ML I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE So when is all this ice suppose to melt? 
INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY 
Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy. Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN' OUT, a b-boy. 
SAL You paying now or on layaway? 
Buggin' Out looks at the slice. 
BUGGIN' OUT How much? 
SAL You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty. 
BUGGIN' OUT Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker. 
EXT: STREET--DAY 
Mookie walks down the block with pizza box in hand when he sees Da Mayor sitting on his stoop. 
DA MAYOR Mookie. 
MOOKIE Gotta go. 
DA MAYOR C'mere, Doctor. 
Mookie turns around and goes back. 
DA MAYOR Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'. 
MOOKIE OK.  OK.

MOOKIE That's it? 
DA MAYOR That's it.

He bends down to pick up the pizza box and tackles the last few flights. 
CLOSE UP--DOORBELL 
Mookie pushes the buzzer. 
ANGLE--DOOR 
A young Puerto Rican woman opens the door. 
NILDA I hope it's not cold. 
Mookie hands her the pizza. 
MOOKIE No, it's not cold.  Twelve dollars for the pie. 
Nilda hands him a handful of singles.  Mookie looks at the crumpled mess.  Nilda attempts to close the door, but Mookie's foot says, "Hell no." 
MOOKIE Hold it.  Let me count this first. 
First he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills. 
MOOKIE You're short. 
NILDA I counted the twelve dollars myself. 
MOOKIE Twelve is right, but no tip. 
NILDA No tip. 
MOOKIE Look, lady.  I carried your pizza up five flights of stairs and shit. The cheese didn't slide over to one side like it sometimes does with delivery people who don't care.  I do care.  May I get paid? 
Nilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going anywhere. 
NILDA Wait here. 
MOOKIE I'll wait. 
Charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out, and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy.  Of course, he's slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl Lewis. 
ANGLE--STREET 
Charlie, a wet mess, tries to buy some sympathy from the folks; none is to be bought. 
CHARLIE I'm fucking soaked.  If I ever catch those fucks they'll be sorry. Cocksucking sonabitches! 
The ranting continues, and people laugh at him. 
CHARLIE You people make me sick. 
A cop car screeches to a halt in front of the man.  Two officers, LONG and PONTE, get out. 
CHARLIE Officers, I want an arrest made. Now. 
OFFICER PONTE What happened? 
CHARLIE Two Black kids soaked me and my car. It's fucking ruined. 
OFFICER LONG Where are they? 
CHARLIE Where are they?  What kind of fucking asshole question is that? They ran the fuck away. 
OFFICER PONTE Do you wish to file a complaint? 
CHARLIE A complaint.  I want those fucks locked under the jail. 
Officer Long goes into his car and gets a wrench. 
ANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP 
Officer Long turns off the hydrant, then puts the cap back on. 
OFFICER PONTE This hydrant better not come back on or there's gonna be hell to pay. 
CHARLIE What about my car?  I want justice. 
Officer Long sides up to Da Mayor who's been looking on. 
OFFICER LONG You know anything about this? 
Da Mayor is quiet. 
CHARLIE He knows.  He's a witness.  They all know.  He saw the whole thing. 
Officer Ponte goes to Da Mayor's other side. 
OFFICER LONG Who were the punks? 
DA MAYOR Those who'll tell don't know. Those who know won't tell. 
OFFICER PONTE A wise guy. 
Mookie emerges from the crowd and leads Da Mayor away from the interrogation. 
MOOKIE Let's go, Mayor. 
OFFICER LONG Keep this hydrant off.  You want to swim, go to Coney Island. 
CHARLIE He's leaving?  What about me? 
OFFICER PONTE I suggest you get in your car quick, before these people start to strip it clean. 
The man looks at the crowd of Blacks and Puerto Ricans around him and he considers what he just heard. 
OFFICER LONG Let's go, break it up.  Go back to your jobs. 
OFFICER PONTE What jobs? 
Both cops laugh. 
ANGLE--STREET 
Charlie drives away, fuming. 
VITO I'll do that. 
MOOKIE We're outta here. 
MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY Thanks for stopping by.  WE LOVE Radio, 108 FM. 
EXT: STREET--DAY 
On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking cerveza frío, and playing dominoes.  One of their cars is parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music. 
ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM 
As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but underneath the salsa music.  Radio Raheem does not like to be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him competition, this is no good.  Radio Raheem stands in front of the stoop and raises his decibel level. 
ANGLE--STOOP 
The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him in Spanish.  There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing in a deafening roar.  One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the stoop and goes to the car. 
ANGLE--CAR 
Stevie turns the car radio off. 
CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM 
Radio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable listening level, and bops down the block.  Radio Raheem still the loudest.  Radio Raheem still the king. 
STEVIE You got it, bro. 
ANGLE--STOOP 
The men curse in Spanish and shake their heads in bewilderment and Stevie turns the salsa back on. 
EXT: STREET--DAY 
Vito and Mookie see Buggin' Out on their way back to Sal's. 
MOOKIE You the man. 
BUGGIN' OUT You the man. 
MOOKIE No, you the man. 
BUGGIN' OUT No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world. 
Buggin' Out gives Mookie five and a menacing look at Vito. 
MOOKIE Vito is down. 
EXT: STREET--DAY 
Buggin' Out is walking down the block when CLIFTON, a yuppie, accidentally bumps into him, stepping on his new sneakers.

He runs down the block after Clifton. 
BUGGIN' OUT Yo! 
Clifton turns around. 
BUGGIN' OUT Yo! 
CLIFTON Yes? 
BUGGIN' OUT You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me." 
CLIFTON Excuse me.  I'm very sorry. 
Vito stands frozen in front of his brother. 
PINO Are you gonna listen to this Mook? Listen to him tell you to smack me? Your only brother? 
Vito walks away and Mookie is disgusted. 
PINO I didn't think so. 
EXT: STREET--DAY 
Officers Ponte and Long drive down the block and at the corner they stop, glare at the Corner Men.

COCONUT SID Look at what? 
ML points across the street to the Korean fruit and vegetable stand. 
ML It's a fucking shame. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE What is? 
ML Sweet Dick Willie. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE That's my name. 
ML Do I have to spell it out? 
COCONUT SID Make it plain. 
ML OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down. 
SWEET DICK WILLIE Let it be broke. 
ML Can ya dig it? 
SWEET DICK WILLIE It's dug.

INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY 
Jade sits in a chair directly in front of an air conditioner going full blast. 
JADE How come you're not at Sal's? 
MOOKIE I'm working. 
JADE Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches? 
MOOKIE I just come home to take a quick shower. 
JADE Sal's gonna be mad. 
MOOKIE Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me. 
JADE I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work. 
MOOKIE Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me. 
JADE I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is. 
MOOKIE Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid. 
JADE Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.

Sal takes a seat at one of the tables. 
SAL I'm beat. 
Pino sits down next to his father. 
PINO Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive. 
SAL Since when do you know what's best for us? 
PINO Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood? 
SAL Too many pizzerias already there. 
PINO Then we could try something else. 
INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY 
Buggin' Out sticks his head in and yells:

Before Sal and his two sons can answer, Buggin' Out is gone. 
EXT: STREET--DAY 
Buggin' Out has one foot up on a fire hydrant and tries to clean his soiled Air Jordan. 
ANGLE--JADE AND MOOKIE 
Jade and Mookie walk up to Buggin' Out. 
BUGGIN' OUT It's so nice to see a family hanging out together. 
MOOKIE We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work. 
JADE That's not even true.  I just want a slice. 
BUGGIN' OUT Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. 
JADE What did he do this time? 
BUGGIN' OUT Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?

BUGGIN' OUT Have you noticed something about them? 
JADE No. 
MOOKIE (interjects) Yo, I'm gone. 
JADE I'll see ya there. 
BUGGIN' OUT Peace. 
Mookie leaves. 
BUGGIN' OUT Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian. 
JADE And? 
BUGGIN' OUT And I--we--want some Black people up. 
JADE Did you ask Sal? 
BUGGIN' OUT Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall. 
Jade looks at Buggin' Out like "Are you serious?" 
JADE Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way. 
BUGGIN' OUT So, in other words, you are not down.

ANGLE--DA MAYOR 
Da Mayor holds them out for Mother Sister, who does not acknowledge him at all. 
DA MAYOR I'd thought you might like these... I guess not. 
Da Mayor takes a seat on the stoop and puts the flowers to his face. 
DA MAYOR Ain't nuthin' like the smell of fresh flowers.  Don't you agree, Miss Mother Sister? 
Mother Sister does not answer.  He puts the flowers down. 
DA MAYOR Summertime, all ya can smell is the garbage.  Stink overpowers everything, especially soft sweet smells like flowers. 
He looks up at Mother Sister who immediately turns away. 
DA MAYOR If you don't mind, I'm gonna set right here, catch a breeze or two, then be on my way. 
Da Mayor looks up at the setting sun.

SWEET DICK WILLIE ML? 
ML What? 
DA MAYOR Doctor, there's nothing to cry about.  You're OK. 
A woman in her twenties, LOUISE, Eddie's mother, breaks through the crowd and hugs her baby. 
LOUISE What's wrong? 
EDDIE Mayor knocked me down. 
LOUISE You should be ashamed of yourself. 
DA MAYOR Ma'am, the boy is just scared to death.  What actually happened is that I was minding my business when I saw your son about to be run over. I ran into the street to save him and I had to knock him down to keep the both of us from getting hit. 
The crowd agrees "That's the way it happened," and Louise stands up. 
LOUISE Eddie, is that the truth? 
Eddie is quiet. 
LOUISE Eddie, you hear me talkin' to you? 
Eddie is still mum. 
LOUISE I'm talkin' to you, boy. 
DA MAYOR Miss, the boy is fine. 
WHAP!  Louise hits Eddie on da butt.  Eddie starts to dance, as his mother hits hard; she's heavy-handed. 
LOUISE What I tell you 'bout lying? 
WHOP! 
LOUISE What did I tell you 'bout playing in the street? 
WHAP! 
EDDIE Mommy!  Mommy!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
WHOP! 
LOUISE Get upstairs now. 
Eddie runs away. 
LOUISE And when your father comes home, he's gonna wear ya little narrow behind out too. 
DA MAYOR You didn't have to hit your son; he's scared to death as it was. 
LOUISE I appreciate ya helping my Eddie. I truly do, but I'll have nobody question how I raise him, not even his Daddy. 
DA MAYOR You're right. 
Louise goes away, probably to give her son another "whooping."  Da Mayor tips his hat to her.

DA MAYOR I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. (MORE) 
DA MAYOR (CONT'D) I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama. (he is warming up now) Maybe I should be heroic more often.

MOOKIE Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.

MOOKIE Hot.  Hot. 
TINA Come in then. 
INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--NIGHT 
Tina watches Mookie watch her.  When she's through watching, she takes the pizza from his hands and puts it on the floor. Mookie grabs her and starts to kiss.  Tina is Mookie's woman, the one he's been on the phone with earlier.  We've heard the voice and now SEE the person. 
MOOKIE Tina, you are too slick. 
TINA How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week. 
MOOKIE I've been working hard, getting paid. 
TINA Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan? 
MOOKIE Shit!  I forgot. 
TINA Your memory is really getting bad. 
MOOKIE I just forgot. 
TINA And I really wanted some ice cream too. 
MOOKIE I can run out and get it. 
TINA Later for you.

BUGGIN' OUT Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.

RADIO RAHEEM I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit. 
BUGGIN' OUT He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?

Vito, Pino and Mookie are cleaning up. 
MOOKIE Sal, it's almost quitting time so please start counting my pay.  I gotta get paid. 
Sal is looking into the cash register. 
SAL We did good business today.  We got a good thing going.  Nothing like a family in business working together. One day the both of you will take over...and Mookie, there will always be a place for you at Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  Y'know, it should be Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria. 
ANGLE--VITO, PINO, AND MOOKIE 
All three look at each other.  The horror is on their faces, with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives.  Is this their future?  It's a frightening thought. 
ANGLE--DOOR 
Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella enter. 
SAL We're about to close. 
AHMAD Just four slices, regular slices. Please.  To go! 
SAL OK, but that's it.  It's been a long day. 
Mookie goes over to the table where Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella sit. 
MOOKIE Look, I want you to get your slices, then outta here.  No playing around. 
AHMAD You got it. 
MOOKIE Good.  No joke.  We all wanna go home. 
OH NO!  We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box.  As everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem are inside already.  We have never heard the rap music as loud as it is now.  You have to scream to be heard and that's what they do. 
SAL What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise? 
BUGGIN' OUT What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures? 
SAL What da fuck!  Are you deaf? 
BUGGIN' OUT No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame. 
SAL Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa. 
Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is. 
BUGGIN' OUT Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa? 
SAL It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria. 
PINO Radio Raheem. 
Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him. 
ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM 
Radio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty- pound bag of Idaho potatoes. 
ANGLE--STREET 
Officers Long and Ponte kick him. 
OFFICER LONG Get up!  Get up! 
Radio Raheem just lies there like a bump on a log. 
ANGLE--CROWD 
The crowd stares at Radio Raheem's still body.  He's unconscious or dead. 
CLOSE--OFFICER LONG 
OFFICER LONG Quit faking. 
ANGLE--STREET 
The officers all look at each other.  They know, they know exactly what they've done.  The infamous Michael Stewart choke hold. 
OFFICER PONTE Let's get him outta here. 
The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him into the back seat.  Buggin' Out is pushed into another car. The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have left the crowd.  It's at this point the crowd becomes an angry mob. 
ANGLE--MOB 
The mob looks at... 
ANGLE--MOB POV 
Sal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito and Pino, who are in bad shape themselves. 
ANGLE--MOB 
The mood/tone of the mob is getting ugly.  Once again they have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the hands of the cops.  We hear the murmurs of the folks go through the crowd. 
VOICES OF MOB THEY KILLED HIM THEY KILLED RADIO RAHEEM IT'S MURDER DID IT AGAIN JUST LIKE THEY DID MICHAEL STEWART MURDER ELEANOR BUMPERS MURDER IT'S NOT SAFE NOT EVEN IN OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S NOT SAFE NEVER WAS NEVER WILL BE 
The cops, in their haste to get Radio Raheem out of there, have left an angry mob of Black folks with a defenseless Sal, Vito, and Pino. 
The mob looks at them. 
VOICES OF MOB WON'T STAND FOR IT THE LAST TIME FUCKIN' COPS THE LAST TIME IT'S PLAIN AS DAY DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL THE BOY 
HIGH ANGLE 
Mookie looks at the crowd and notices he's on the wrong side. He leaves Sal and his two sons. 
ANGLE--STREET 
Da Mayor walks in front of the crowd. 
DA MAYOR Good people, let's all go home. Somebody's gonna get hurt. 
CROWD (OS) Yeah, you! 
DA MAYOR If we don't stop this now, we'll all regret it.  Sal and his two boys had nothing to do with what the police did. 
CROWD (OS) Get out of the way, old man.  You a Tom anyway. 
DA MAYOR Let 'em be. 
ANGLE--STREET 
Mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the street.  He walks through the crowd, up to Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino.

JADE Mookie!  Mookie! 
ANGLE--MOOKIE 
Mookie is running around with the rest of the mob. 
ANGLE--STREET 
The wail of fire trucks and police sirens is now added to the night. 
EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT 
The mob moves back to in front of Sal's as the fire trucks and police, in full riot gear, pull up in the street behind them. 
POLICE LOUDSPEAKER (VO) Good people.  Please disperse. Please disperse. 
The firemen rush to hook up their hoses, the police force themselves between the crowd and the burning Sal's Famous Pizzeria. 
POLICE LOUDSPEAKER (VO) Please disperse!  Please disperse! 
The mob doesn't listen, they will not be moved.  The mob will not be moved until they see Sal's Famous Pizzeria burn to the ground. 
ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA 
The firemen douse the pizzeria, trying desperately to stop the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings. 
POLICE LOUDSPEAKER (VO) Good people, we're giving you one more warning.  Please go back home.

MOOKIE This is our home.

POW! 
The hoses are turned on the mob. 
WE SEE Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, ML, Coconut Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc., go down before the powerful blast of the firehouse. 
Now we've come full circle.  We're back to Montgomery or Birmingham, Alabama.  The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull Connor and the German shepherds. 
It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the mob got.  People are trying to hold on to each other, cars, railings, anything to keep from being swept away. 
EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT 
Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino watch in disbelief.  It's unbelievable what is happening before their eyes. 
CUT TO: 
THE STREET--NIGHT THEIR POV 
TINA Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week. 
MOOKIE Tina, it's not like that. 
Mookie is putting on his clothes. 
TINA You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son. 
MOOKIE Tina, I'll be right back. 
TINA Be a man. 
MOOKIE I am a man. 
TINA Act like one then.  Be a man. 
MOOKIE Later. 
TINA You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life. 
Mookie leaves. 
MOTHER SISTER'S BEDROOM--DAY 
Da Mayor wakes up in Mother Sister's big brass bed (she was born in it).  At first he has no idea where he's at, then sees Mother Sister sitting down across the room smiling at him. 
MOTHER SISTER Good morning. 
DA MAYOR Is it a good morning? 
MOTHER SISTER Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night. 
DA MAYOR I've done that before. 
Da Mayor gets up out of her big brass bed. 
DA MAYOR Where did you sleep? 
MOTHER SISTER I didn't. 
DA MAYOR I hope the block is still standing. 
MOTHER SISTER We're still standing. 
Da Mayor and Mother Sister both look out the parlor window to see THE BLOCK and Mookie. 
EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY 
Mookie walks up to Sal's Famous Pizzeria as it still smoulders in the morning light.  Sal emerges from the wreckage; he looks like he might have slept there. 
SAL Whatdafuck do you want? 
MOOKIE I wants my money.  I wants to get paid. 
Sal looks at Mookie in disbelief. 
SAL Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you. 
MOOKIE Sal, I want my money. 
SAL Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed. 
MOOKIE Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead. 
SAL You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time. 
MOOKIE Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid. 
SAL We both do. 
MOOKIE We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal. 
SAL Do we now? 
MOOKIE Quit bullshitting.

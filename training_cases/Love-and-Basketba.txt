SLOW MOTION.  STYLIZED.  TIGHT. 
The silhouette of a man and woman.  They are on a blacktop basketball court, playing a sexually-charged game of one-one- one. 
Sweat glistens.  Hands pull at clothes.  Hips bump and collide.  Eyes lock...

BALDWIN HILLS 
EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - LATE MORNING 
An upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black Beverly Hills.  Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every other driveway.  The street is quiet, until -- 
YOUNG VOICE (O.S.) You wanna be Kareem? 
CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.  He sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger. 
QUINCY (CONT'D) All his big butt do is stand by the basket. 
JAMAL Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff. 
KELVIN I'm gonna be like Dr. J. 
QUINCY I'ma be like my Dad. 
JAMAL He ain't a star or nothing. 
QUINCY I don't see none of your sorry daddies in the NBA. 
KELVIN Hey, look, Q. 
Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse All-Stars approaching from next door.  Walking in the kicks is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap pulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway. 
KELVIN (cont'd) Thought only girls were moving in. 
QUINCY That's what my Moms said. 
KELVIN I hope he can ball. 
JAMAL Bet he's a scrub. 
The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway. 
KID Hey. 
QUINCY Hey. 
KID Can I play? 
QUINCY You nice? 
KID Yeah, I'm nice. 
Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then -- 
QUINCY You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal. 
Quincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the baseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown face and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years old. 
JAMAL Ah man, he is a girl. 
QUINCY Girls can't play no ball. 
MONICA Ball better than you. 
Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the driveway. 
QUINCY (whispering) What a dog. 
Monica shoots him a glare. 
JAMAL She heard you. 
QUINCY Nuh uh, they could only hear dog whistles. 
Monica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks backwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN AIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes. 
QUINCY Alley-oop, Dad. 
Nona intercepts his pass. 
NONA Boy... 
She points him back to his card.  Quincy scowls, starts writing again.  Nona scoops some frosting on her finger, holds it up. 
NONA (cont'd) New neighbors. 
Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting off. 
ZEKE See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me thinking I was getting a sister who could burn. 
Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly throws down his pencil in frustration. 
QUINCY I can't do this shit. 
Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock. 
ZEKE Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word? 
QUINCY (sighs, then) "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary. 
ZEKE Why not? 
QUINCY Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man. 
ZEKE That's right. 
NONA Zeke. 
ZEKE What? (then) Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit." 
Nona just shakes her head. 
NONA We should head over. 
ZEKE Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting. 
NONA With who? 
ZEKE Business folks. 
NONA You just got back from a four game road trip. 
ZEKE Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us. 
Zeke grabs his keys. 
ZEKE (cont'd) Later, Quincy. 
QUINCY Later, Dad. 
Zeke exits.  Nona leans against the counter, concerned. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Mom? 
NONA What? 
QUINCY We still have to go? 
NONA (beat) Yeah. 
INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at each other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.  Monica holds her card, Camille holds the cake. 
NONA ...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then... 
CAMILLE Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door. 
NONA (nods) Okay? 
Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair.  Monica moves her head. 
CAMILLE Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you. 
NONA It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook. 
Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised.  She quickly hugs his face into her stomach.  Camille lights up. 
CAMILLE Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta. 
NONA You're a caterer? 
CAMILLE Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. (then) Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about. 
Quincy snickers.  Nona quickly changes the subject. 
NONA You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house. 
CAMILLE Really?  Well, come on, then. 
Monica punches her in the leg. 
LENA Ow! 
Lena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a yellow dress on a hanger.  Monica sees it and her face falls. 
MONICA Ah, Mom. 
CAMILLE I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage. 
Monica sulks.  Lena cackles in her ear.  Camille has to laugh. 
CAMILLE (cont'd) Child, pick up your lip. 
MONICA I hate it. 
CAMILLE Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear? 
MONICA Pants. 
Camille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door. 
CAMILLE (to Lena) When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth? 
LENA Are you okay? 
CAMILLE I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day. 
Just then, Nathan enters.  He holds up two dress shirts as if it were a matter of life and death. 
NATHAN Which one for tomorrow? 
CAMILLE The blue. 
NATHAN You sure? 
Camille nods.  Nathan looks at both of them, then: 
NATHAN (cont'd) Can you iron both tonight just in case? 
CAMILLE (beat) Okay. 
NATHAN Thanks, sweetheart. 
He kisses her on the cheek, hands her the two shirts and crosses out.  Monica just watches.  Beat, then Camile turns back to her daughters. 
CAMILLE The boy next door is riding with you to school so you'll know somebody your first day. (to Lena) Hurry so she can go to sleep. 
Monica reacts, surprised.  Camille leaves.  Lena puts the comb back to Monica's hair.  Beat, then: 
MONICA Make it look nice, kay. 
INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Basketball posters, "Clippers" and USC memorabilia, a basketball globe light. 
Quincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his parents MAKING LOVE.  The sounds bring a smile to his face. 
Quincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear.  He moves to his window, sees Monica through her window directly across from his.  Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair.  Quincy kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches. EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - MORNING 
Quincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house.  A basketball is tucked under his arm. 
Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater.  She is looking cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.  A basketball sits in her back basket. 
Quincy is taken aback, stares at her. 
QUINCY You wanna be my girl? 
Monica blinks in surprise.  She thinks for a moment. 
MONICA What do I have to do? 
QUINCY I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers. 
MONICA I don't like flowers. 
QUINCY Oh. 
MONICA How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them. 
QUINCY Kay. 
MONICA Okay. 
An awkward beat between the new couple.  Finally -- 
QUINCY I think we gotta kiss now. 
MONICA For how long? 
QUINCY Five seconds. 
The two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to the secluded area between their two houses. 
REFEREE Taunting. 
MONICA Taunting?! 
COACH HISERMAN Sub! 
MONICA Man, you suck! 
The referee whips back around, whistle in mouth.  Coach Hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court. 
COACH HISERMAN Sit down and shut up. 
Monica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched. Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed.  The brother in the doorway turns, leaves. 
Monica looks up at the clock.  SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD QUARTER. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATE DAY 
Monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats on, her face dry.  She glances up at the clock.  TWENTY SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  Her team's up by SIX. 
Her teammates dribble out the clock.  The BUZZER SOUNDS and they dance across the floor.  Monica looks up in the stands. COACH SUMMIT IS GONE. 
INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK 
Camille, now forty-three, stands at the stove stirring a pot of gumbo.  Lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding a handful of plates and silverware. 
CAMILLE ...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour. 
LENA But you use potato? 
Camille nods as they cross into: 
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
At the table, Monica is in mid-conversation with her dad. Camille and Lena start setting the table. 
MONICA Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me. 
NATHAN And what am I supposed to say to the man? 
MONICA The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench. 
NATHAN You lost your head. 
MONICA I was just showing emotion. 
CAMILLE So that means it's alright for you to act like that? 
LENA (to Monica) What'd you do? 
MONICA (dismissive) nothing. 
CAMILLE I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. 
MONICA I won't.  I'm a lesbian. 
Lena chokes on her drink, cracks up. 
CAMILLE That's not funny 
MONICA Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron... 
CAMILLE Watch your mouth. 
Nathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up. 
NATHAN Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball. 
MONICA (taken aback) What? 
NATHAN You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality. 
MONICA The coach from USC is going to be at the championship. 
NATHAN I know.  But chances are... 
MONICA Chances are there's still a chance. 
Nathan nods.  She can always soften her dad, but not her mom. 
CAMILLE If you'd just listen for once, you'd realize you have a lot more going for yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty if you put a comb to your head.  I mean, why walk around with your hair looking like "whodunit"...? 
As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window. 
OUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the curb, slobbing each other down. 
Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is a brother who drank his chocolate milk.  HE IS ALSO THE BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY. 
Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears... 
EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - SAME TIME 
ZEKE I don't wanna hurt your feelings. 
QUINCY You don't wanna hurt your back. 
ZEKE (smiles) Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late. 
QUINCY You work too hard, Pop. 
ZEKE Let's hope I can say the same about you one day. 
Quincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once to give an autograph.  Zeke passes Monica, entering. 
MONICA Hey, Mr. M. 
ZEKE Hey, Miss Baller. 
He exits.  Monica approaches Quincy. 
MONICA Way to hoop. 
QUINCY I know this.  What do you want? 
MONICA A ride home. 
QUINCY Your legs don't look broke. 
MONICA Look, big head, I'll be at your car. 
QUINCY Guess "please" would be a stretch. 
MONICA (dryly) Please. 
INT. QUINCY'S JEEP - NIGHT 
Silence as Quincy wheels his Jeep Wrangler toward home. Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap.  She pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket.  Quincy glances it over. 
QUINCY What's that? 
MONICA Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you. 
QUINCY (thinks) Big-ass titties? 
Monica shoots him a disgusted look.  Quincy reaches out. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Give it here. 
Monica leans away, reads aloud. 
MONICA "Q.  I think you are so fine and I've been wanting to get with you.  Let me take you to the Spring Dance and I promise I'll leave you satisfied." 
Monica laughs in disbelief. 
MONICA (cont'd) What a ho. 
QUINCY Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me. 
MONICA She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail. 
QUINCY And? 
MONICA And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone." 
QUINCY So she's honest. 
MONICA Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything. 
QUINCY Didn't know you cared so much. 
MONICA I don't. 
QUINCY So who you going to the dance with, Spalding? 
MONICA Who's Spalding? 
Quincy looks down at the SPALDING BASKETBALL in her lap and cracks up.  Monica glares. 
MONICA (cont'd) Fuck you, Quincy. 
QUINCY See, that's why you ain't getting recruited. 
MONICA Who said I'm not getting recruited? 
QUINCY Your hot-ass temper. 
Monica points to the scar on her cheek. 
MONICA I'm not the one who put this scar here. 
QUINCY God, here we go. 
MONICA When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose. 
Quincy turns, faces her. 
NONA I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him... 
ZEKE I have. 
A beat. 
NONA You said you'd think about going back to get your degree. 
ZEKE No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold. 
Livid, Nona pulls off her gold bracelet, throws it at him. 
NONA Fine, then how many nights home is that? 
ZEKE Keep your voice down. 
She grabs a pair of gold earrings from her jewelry box, nails him. 
NONA How about now?  I got a week yet? 
INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Quincy lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, as his parents continue to have it out. 
He rolls out of bed, pulls on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt. He moves to his window, pulls it open and climbs out... 
EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - CONTINUOUS 
Quincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly. 
Long beat, then Monica sleepily stumbles to her window, wearing boxers and a tank top.  She pushes it open and Quincy pulls himself through... 
INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Now a routine, Monica tosses Quincy one of her pillows and blankets, then crawls back into bed. He lays out on the floor and closes his eyes.  Monica casts a long, sleepy glance at him, then drifts back to sleep. 
DISSOLVE TO: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - LATE DAY 
Posters of Magic line three walls.  A hand-made collage of 
female college and Olympic ball-players fills the fourth. The only real "soft" touch is the teddy bear laying on the pillow. 
Monica sits on the floor between Lena's legs, as Lena puts Monica's hair in cornrows. 
LENA That too tight? 
MONICA No. 
LENA Mom's going to hate it. 
MONICA Always on my ass, anyway. 
LENA Like you don't give her a hard time. 
MONICA Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you... 
Lena yanks Monica's head back. 
MONICA (cont'd) Ow!!! 
LENA You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind. 
MONICA No one's forcing her. 
LENA Just try and chill a little bit, alright. 
Monica doesn't answer.  Lena yanks her head back again. 
MONICA Ow!!!  Okay! 
They crack up. 
LENA So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet? 
MONICA (sarcastically) Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker. 
LENA I found you someone. 
MONICA Found?  I'm not some charity case. 
LENA I know... 
MONICA Mom tell you to do this? 
LENA No. 
MONICA Damn, Lena... (then) Who is he? 
LENA This brother from my college. 
MONICA He's in college? 
LENA And he's fine, girl. 
Fourth quarter.  One minute left.  Cougars down three. 
Monica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her opponent plays her tight. 
Monica zips a no-look pass to a teammate, who lays it up. Quincy punches one of his friends - "Oh shit!"  She is having the game of her life. 
On the defensive end, Monica steals the ball.  She drives the length of the court, lays it up between two defenders.  The crowd is hyped. 
Twenty seconds left, up by one.  Monica hounds the opposing guard as she brings up the ball. Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose.  As she goes for the ball, a WHISTLE. 
REFEREE Reaching in, number thirty-two.  One-and- one. 
Boos fill the gym.  Monica's eyes widen. 
MONICA No! 
Anger rushes through her as she starts for the ref. 
MONICA (cont'd) That's bullsh--! 
COACH HISERMAN Monica! 
Monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref. 
Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists.  The girl hits the first one.  Then, she hits the second. 
With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court and throws up a prayer.  EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM.  AND THEN...IT POPS OUT.  An opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice but to foul her. 
Monica has just fouled out.  She walks to her bench and drops down.  She buries her face in a towel and sobs. 
The buzzer goes off.  Cougars lose. 
Quincy stares at Monica, feeling almost as bad as she does. 
DISSOLVE TO: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Monica sits slumped on her bed in a bathrobe, as Lena stands 
in front of her, putting the finishing touches on Monica's 
make-up. 
LENA 
Might help if you didn't look so evil. 
MONICA I don't even want to go. 
She steps back, looks at her work. 
LENA Mom! 
Beat, then Camille enters. 
LENA (cont'd) Talk to me. 
Camille stares at her daughter, taken aback by how great she looks. 
CAMILLE Go in my top drawer and get my pearls. 
Lena exits.  Monica still looks miserable. 
CAMILLE (cont'd) You okay? 
Monica shrugs. 
CAMILLE (cont'd) Well, can you promise me one thing? 
MONICA What? 
CAMILLE Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that? 
Monica takes this in as Lena returns with Camille's pearls. 
LENA Here. 
Camille puts them around Monica's neck.  Monica looks back at her. 
MONICA You really think I look beautiful? 
Camille smiles at her daughter, nods.  Monica touches the pearls. 
INT. CRENSHAW GYM - NIGHT 
An R&B song jams through the speakers, filling the dance floor with high school kids in suits and dresses. 
In the middle of the floor, Quincy gets his groove on with his date, Shawnee.  She dances so provocatively, there is no mistaking what she has in mind for later. 
Over at the doors, Monica enters with her college date, JASON, 21, and fine.  Heads turn in surprise.  Monica feels the stares, shifts nervously. 
JASON Can I take your coat? 
MONICA You're cold? 
JASON (cont'd) Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a glass slipper behind. 
Monica's face lights up.  Jason smiles. 
JASON (cont'd) There we go. 
He crosses away to the refreshment table.  Monica smiles wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed.  She catches herself and quickly crosses them. 
A couple of guys pass by and check her out.  Monica smiles wider.  Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch. 
QUINCY Hey. 
MONICA Hey. 
QUINCY You having fun? 
MONICA Yeah. 
QUINCY Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. (beat) So who is this clown? 
MONICA He ain't Spalding. 
QUINCY Guess not. 
MONICA So you took Shawnee, huh? 
The DJ puts on "Make It Last Forever" by Keith Sweat. Couples move to the dance floor. 
QUINCY (embarrassed) You know, it was late and she asked... 
JASON You want to dance? 
Jason stands behind her chair.  Monica smiles shyly. 
MONICA Sure. 
Jason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her to the dance floor. 
Quincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs Shawnee's hand. 
QUINCY C'mon. 
He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor. 
ANGLE ON 
Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax. 
Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows. 
Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't. Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight. 
Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his hands lower down Shawnee's back.  The music continues... 
INT. JASON'S CAR - NIGHT 
Jason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive.  LL Cool J's "I Need Love" plays on the tape deck. 
Jason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move. 
MONICA (rattling) Freshman year, my free throw percentage was fifty-one percent, cause I was shooting it like a jump shot. 
Jason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder. 
MONICA (cont'd) Um...but then sophomore year I was shooting seventy-five percent from the line. 
Jason kisses her neck. 
MONICA (cont'd) ...uh, by keeping my feet set and really following through. 
Jason goes in for the slam dunk.  Kisses Monica on the lips. It's the first time she's really been kissed.  Jason pulls away, smiles. 
JASON That was nice. 
MONICA Uh-huh. 
JASON Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself... 
Jason leans in.  Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some more.  Monica tries to follow his practiced lips. 
Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down.  His hand moves across her breast.  Monica's eyes pop open. 
MONICA Wait... 
JASON Shh.  It's okay. 
Naive and inexperienced, Monica shuts her eyes tight. 
DISSOLVE TO: E WRIGHT HOUSE -NIGHT 
Jason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door. 
She looks in the living room window.  Her mom is asleep in a chair, trying to wait up. 
MONICA I know, right? 
But they both want more.  They lean in, kiss deeply.  They fall back on the grass.  And kiss.  And kiss. 
Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.  Quincy follows, instantly apologetic.  Monica stares at him, then to his surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with her finger. 
Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie.  He nervously unbuttons his shirt.  He fumbles with the last two buttons. 
Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self- conscious.  Quincy can't keep his eyes off her. 
He pulls off his pants.  Monica glances down and her eyes widen.  She looks scared to death.  Quincy smiles softly, leans in and gently kisses her.  She relaxes.  They lay down. 
Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom.  His hands shake as he puts it on.  They stare at each other as he moves on top of her. 
Quincy pushes inside her.  She flinches back in pain.  Quincy immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes. 
QUINCY (softly) You want to stop? 
Monica shakes her head.  Quincy pushes inside again.  He looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her tears... 
FADE TO BLACK.

TITLE CARD: "THIRD QUARTER" 
INT. USC - CAMPUS GYM - MORNING 
Championship banners hang from the ceiling. 
TWELVE YOUNG WOMEN sit on the first two rows of bleachers. The eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row, comfortable, confident.  Monica and the three other freshmen sit in front of them, jiggling nervously. 
COACH MILLER stands in front of the team. 
COACH MILLER I don't know some of you very well yet, and you don't know me because I'm still being nice to you. 
Laughter from the upperclassmen. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) But my philosophy is simple. Hard work and sacrifice. There's a lot of basketball history and pride here at USC, but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a great player.  Hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player.  What you were doesn't matter anymore.  For the first time in your life, you won't be the best. You'll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined.  So the question is, how will you respond?  Well, your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because that's the only way you're gonna make it through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and I teach it, "There is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything." 
Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in. Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions. Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on time, no exceptions.  Attend every class, no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no getting pregnant.  And finally, respect yourselves, respect your coaches and respect your teammates, right Sidra? 
SIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row. 
SIDRA That's right, Coach. 
COACH MILLER By the end of this year some of you will hate me... 
The upperclassmen crack up. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) Some of you will want to go home... 
UPPERCLASSMEN (cat-calling) Cree! 
CREE, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly.  Coach Miller smiles. 
COACH MILLER But I guarantee you, if you work hard and sacrifice, all of you will be better basketball players and better people. 
Monica nods, accepting the challenge. 
EXT. TRACK - EARLY MORNING 
It's cold, it's dark.  It's six a.m. 
The team pounds down the track, pushing through a two-mile run.  Monica and her freshman teammate/roommate SHAYLA, 18, breathe heavily from the back of the pack. 
From the sideline. 
COACH MILLER Let's go, freshmen, you're getting spanked! 
Monica sucks it up, runs faster.  She reaches the middle of the pack, then runs out of gas.  She drops back to the rear. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of Oz team.  No brains, no courage and no heart! 
INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING 
Defensive drills.  One by one, players crouch low and move backwards down the sideline.  ZVETTE, a junior guard, hustles through the drill. 
COACH MILLER Way to work, Zvette. 
Monica starts the drill. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) Get lower, Monica, move your feet. 
Monica grimaces as she squats lower. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) I said lower! 
Coach Miller stops her, squats down low beside her. 
QUINCY It's okay, little baby. 
MONICA (struggling) Quit. 
Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her.  Students pass by, laugh. 
QUINCY Shhh.  Daddy's here. 
Monica finally cracks up. 
MONICA You're such a punk. 
He gives her a kiss. 
QUINCY All these girls...you're the only one I know who's for real. 
Monica smiles, kisses him back. 
MONICA Always. 
INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING 
A heated scrimmage between the women's "A" team (the starting five) and "B" team (five who want to be starting).  Monica runs point for the "B" team, playing opposite Sidra. 
Sidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica starts to come on.  She does a quick cross-over and loses Sidra.  She dishes off to Shayla, who scores. 
COACH MILLER Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"? 
Sidra scowls as she runs down court.  She gets a pass in the corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose. 
Monica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the shot.  SWISH!  Monica stays posed, with her arm up. 
Sidra takes advantage, sprints back down court.  She get the long pass, lays it up.  Coach Miller blows her whistle. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) Monica!  Get over here. 
Monica jogs over, sheepish. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) While you're so busy posing, your man just scored! 
Monica drops her head. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) Show me again. 
MONICA What? 
COACH MILLER You love to pose so much, let's see it again. 
Beat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the ball.  Snickers from her teammates. 
COACH MILLER (cont'd) I want you to stand like that for the rest of practice. 
MONICA Coach... 
COACH MILLER I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me? (then) Dora, take her spot. 
DORA, freshman, jogs onto the court.  Coach Miller blows her whistle and the scrimmage resumes. 
Monica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like an asshole. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING 
Monica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing after the shower.  Shayla sits next to her. 
Nearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror.  Zvette passes by, already dressed.  Lisa turns. 
LISA Z, I know you're gonna shower first. 
ZVETTE I don't smell bad. 
SANDRA And you wonder why your ass sits alone on the bus. 
Cree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain on her CROSS NECKLACE. 
CREE You guys curse too much. 
SANDRA Since when is "ass" a curse? 
MAEYEN walks past. 
MAEYEN Whoa, it's as big as yours. 
They crack up.  Cree just shakes her head.  Two TEAMMATES pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose. Monica shakes her head. 
Sidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench. 
SIDRA That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman. 
MONICA I was just playing ball. 
SIDRA You were trying to make me look bad. 
MONICA Didn't have to try very hard. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Hold up... 
MONICA All's fair in love and basketball. Strip. 
Quincy pulls off his shirt.  Monica moves back into position. Quincy drops down low.  Monica fakes, gets him to leave his feet.  She slips under him and scores.  She laughs. 
MONICA (cont'd) Too bad you got your mama's height, huh. 
Quincy pulls off his sweats, leaving him in just drawers. Monica takes in the view as she moves back into position. 
She holds the ball out, taunting.  Quincy pretends to reach for it, but grabs her breast instead. 
QUINCY Oh, my bad. 
She drives.  Quincy just steps out of the way and lets her score.  Monica snatches the ball off the floor. 
MONICA Yo, where's the "D"? 
QUINCY Right here. 
Monica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked.  He moves her against the wall and kisses her.  Monica drops the ball, wraps her arms around him.  She smiles. 
MONICA I won. 
QUINCY I wanted you to. 
Game over.  They hit it. INT. ESPN STUDIOS 
Sportscaster DICK VITALE talks animatedly about the upcoming season. 
DICK VITALE It's the start of the new college season and I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Too many great teams to choose from.  You have your Dukes', Kentuckys', Arkansas', but my surprise treat this season... 
INT. BASKETBALL COURT 
Sportscaster ROBIN ROBERTS reports on the upcoming women's season. 
ROBIN ROBERTS ...USC.  The women of Troy made it to the Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning four starters from that squad.  And many consider their recruiting class one of the best in the nation.  The highlight of that class,... 
INT. ESPN STUDIOS 
DICK VITALE ...is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper dandies.  He's a real P.T.P., a prime- time player.  Every college in the country wanted him but he chose to follow in his father's footsteps and become a Trojan.  He's gonna have a lot on his shoulders this season... 
INT. BASKETBALL COURT 
ROBIN ROBERTS ...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if just one of her freshmen has a breakout year, they can go all the way.  It's a long season, anything can happen, but one thing is for sure... 
INT. ESPN STUDIOS 
DICK VITALE It's gonna be awesome, baby!

INT. UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT - GAMPEL PAVILION - NIGHT 
Sidra crashes to the floor, immediately grabs at her ankle. Monica rises off the bench... 
CUT TO: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT 
Televisions hang from every corner, broadcasting various games. 
Zeke and Quincy sit at a bar.  Quincy is still hyped from his game. 
QUINCY ...up and under between two defenders, with the left hand.  That's gotta make SportsCenter. 
Zeke just nods as the Bartender/Owner crosses over.  He is an ex-ballplayer named TERRY. 
Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass. 
QUINCY Last time I remember you drinking was when Marvin Gaye died. 
No response from Nona. 
QUINCY (cont'd) This about Dad? 
NONA Guess he talked to you. 
QUINCY Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out. 
NONA (beat) Whose truth are you talking about? 
QUINCY Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family. 
She doesn't respond.  Quincy studies her. 
QUINCY (cont'd) I mean, you believe him, right? 
Nona sits silent, humiliated. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Mom? 
NONA Just...leave it alone. 
QUINCY This is just about money, you know that. 
NONA Quincy, please... 
QUINCY I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's? 
NONA Guess I should have been telling your father. 
QUINCY So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie. 
Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him. 
Confused, Quincy opens it.  HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS: 
Zeke outside a party.  IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a young woman.  IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.  AND YET ANOTHER, they climb into his car. 
QUINCY (cont'd) What...what's this? 
NONA I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that? After all his late nights and "meetings" and I still needed proof. 
Quincy just stares at the photos. 
NONA (cont'd) I used to think I was lucky just to be married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too tired. 
Quincy looks stricken, but he moves to Nona, comforts her as she cries... EXT. TRACK - NIGHT 
Monica sits with a devastated Quincy, high up in the bleachers.  In the distance, the clock-tower glows 10:50. 
QUINCY Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something... 
MONICA I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you. 
QUINCY What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy. (then) And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense... 
MONICA She understands. 
QUINCY He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I. 
MONICA You're not stupid. 
QUINCY I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this... 
Monica puts her arms around him.  They sit there, quiet. Monica glances up at the clock tower.  She reacts.  Quincy notices. 
QUINCY (cont'd) What? 
MONICA Nothing. (beat) Why don't we walk to my dorm? 
QUINCY I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright? 
MONICA I...can't. 
QUINCY Why not? 
MONICA Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up. 
Quincy looks at her, almost in shock. 
QUINCY Didn't realize you were watching the clock. 
MONICA I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. 
QUINCY Nah.  Don't sweat it. 
MONICA Quincy... 
QUINCY For real.  I should be alone, anyway. 
The female players continue to celebrate as they undress. 
MAEYEN Shoot, you see that crowd?  We need to be playing in the Sports Arena. 
KELLI Hell yeah. 
They give each other a pound. 
Lisa looks at Monica, standing in her shorts and sports bra. 
LISA Oh damn, Mon. 
MONICA What? 
LISA I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis with that charge. 
The women break into laughter.  Monica smiles. 
MONICA Kiss my ass. 
SANDRA Nah, I think she took that too. 
MONICA Sandra, please, last time you chest- bumped me, it took you three tries. 
More laughter.  Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at the bench. 
MONICA (cont'd) Yo, T, why you so quiet? 
TONI (beat) I don't want to go play overseas. 
DORA I thought you were hyped about going to Portugal next year. 
TONI It's never gonna be like this.  Playing in front of my family, hanging out with my girls.  Probably not even a McDonald's. 
SANDRA Nah, there's always a McDonald's. 
SIDRA Least you got an offer.  My agent's still looking. 
CREE (to Lisa) What about you? 
LISA (beat) Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day I could come back here and play.  But for right now, it's law school. 
COACH MILLER (O.S.) Monica. 
Monica turns, sees Coach Miller standing in her office doorway.  She motions for her.  Monica heads over.  Sidra watches. 
INT. COACH MILLER'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER 
Trophies, plaques and photos fill every empty space. 
Coach Miller sits behind her desk.  Monica stands before her. 
COACH MILLER You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart. 
MONICA Thanks. 
COACH MILLER We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again. 
MONICA (confused) I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game. 
COACH MILLER You want the job or not? 
Realization finally hits. 
MONICA Yeah.  Yes. 
Monica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown. 
COACH MILLER What? 
MONICA It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me. 
COACH MILLER You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry. (then) Go get dressed. 
Monica nods, crosses out. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As Monica walks back to her teammates, Coach Miller steps into the doorway. 
COACH MILLER Sidra. 
Sidra looks at Monica as she rises, crosses over.  Monica avoids her eyes as they pass.  Sidra enters the office and the door closes. 
SHAYLA Yo sis, what's going on? 
Beat, then Monica smiles. 
SMASH CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Black folks pack the cramped houseparty, bumping to a phat 
hip hop joint. 
SIDRA (O.S.) Monica. 
Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway.  There is no escaping this confrontation.  She glances at Quincy, then crosses over.  Quincy turns, sees her disappear back inside. 
INT. HOUSEPARTY - CONTINUOUS 
MONICA What's up? 
SIDRA Just wanted to say good game. 
MONICA But? 
SIDRA No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge. 
MONICA Thanks. 
SIDRA But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock. 
Monica shakes her head.  An awkward silence. 
SIDRA (cont'd) I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed. 
MONICA I know. 
SIDRA Just one word of advice for next season. 
MONICA What's that? 
SIDRA Never let a freshman take your spot. 
Sidra turns and walks away. 
EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 
Quincy takes one long drink from his cup.  KERRY, 20, and spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously. 
KERRY Excuse me. 
QUINCY Excuse me. 
He steps aside as she tries to work the keg.  Nothing comes out.  She nods at his cup, smiles. 
KERRY If that's the last beer, you and I are sharing. 
Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of times.  Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up. 
KERRY (cont'd) I like watching you play.  Number twenty- two. 
QUINCY Guess you didn't see the game. 
Quincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the attention.  He hands her back her cup. 
QUINCY (cont'd) What's your name? 
KERRY Kerry. 
QUINCY Q. 
KERRY I know. 
ANGLE ON 
Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the hoochie.  The girl looks too damn comfortable.  Monica moves back outside. 
KERRY (cont'd) I'll see you.  Q-man. 
She swishes past Monica.  Shayla "accidentally" bumps her. Kerry glares. 
MONICA Who was that? 
QUINCY Nobody. 
MONICA Who's nobody? 
QUINCY Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go? 
MONICA You want to go talk? 
QUINCY Not really. 
He leans in, kisses her drunkenly.  She pulls away. 
MONICA We could finish what we were talking about last night. 
Quincy kisses her again. 
MONICA (cont'd) Q... (pushing him off) Quincy, quit.  You're drunk. 
They fall silent. 
QUINCY You know what, I'm just gonna crash. 
MONICA (agitated) Fine...Maybe I'll come by later. 
MONICA Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer. 
QUINCY The "man" again. 
MONICA (smiles) Woman... 
A knock at the front door.  Quincy exits. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Monica follows, then stops short.  Kerry, the spandexed girl from the party, stands in the doorway. 
QUINCY Hey, you. 
KERRY Hi. 
Quincy gives her a hug.  Monica stares at him in disbelief. Reggie and his teammate smack each other, "Oh shit!" 
QUINCY Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry. 
MONICA What the hell's going on? 
QUINCY We're going to get some food. 
MONICA Are you out of your mind? 
KERRY Maybe I should come back? 
MONICA No.  You stay, I'll leave. 
She storms out. 
EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK 
BAM!  Monica slams her car door.  Her face is a mask of anger and confusion. 
Camille exits the house, car keys in hand.  She sees her. 
CAMILLE Monica.  What are you doing here? 
MONICA Didn't know I needed a reason to come home. 
CAMILLE Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you. 
MONICA Dad around? 
CAMILLE He's still at the bank. 
Monica glowers.  Camille looks at her. 
CAMILLE (cont'd) Everything okay? 
MONICA (clearly not) Yeah. 
Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again. 
CAMILLE Well, I'm going to get dinner. 
She pulls open her car door.  Beat, then... 
CAMILLE (cont'd) It's just a game. 
MONICA What? 
CAMILLE Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game. 
Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves. 
EXT. DORMS - NIGHT 
Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica slowly makes her way up the walk.  She sees him, stops. 
QUINCY Can we talk? 
MONICA Talk to your new girlfriend. 
QUINCY I just took the ho to Burger King, alright. 
MONICA Cheap date. 
QUINCY Least she had time for me. 
MONICA So you fucked around to prove a point! 
QUINCY I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me. 
MONICA What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else? 
QUINCY You forgot to be there. 
MONICA That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do? 
QUINCY Stay! 
ZEKE Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been? 
NONA Happy.  And he won't want to see you. 
Nona walks over to a MAN standing nearby.  He puts an arm around her and they move down the hall.  Zeke watches for a beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside. 
INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Quincy lays in the bed.  His knee is bandaged and propped up by pillows.  He stares out the window. 
ZEKE Hey, son. 
Quincy turns, sees his father.  He turns back to the window. 
ZEKE (cont'd) Well, you made SportsCenter. 
QUINCY What do you want? 
ZEKE Came by to check on you. 
QUINCY After five years. 
ZEKE Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom. 
QUINCY Look, I'm busy. 
ZEKE I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself. 
QUINCY I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget? 
ZEKE No. 
QUINCY Good. 
ZEKE Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me. 
QUINCY And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?" 
ZEKE You want me to fuck off? 
QUINCY Yeah. 
ZEKE Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something. 
Silence.  Then. 
ZEKE (cont'd) You're a better ballplayer than I ever was.  But you got a lot of other things going for you.  You're smart.  I always felt...I always knew that you could do anything you wanted.  You want to be a ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know you ain't like everybody else on that court.  You ain't like I was.  You got options.  That's all I ever tried to show you. 
QUINCY You're still trying to tell me what I should and shouldn't do.  How come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me? 
Zeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an answer. 
ZEKE I just couldn't 
With nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and leaves.  Quincy stares at the door long after it closes. 
DISSOLVE TO: INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
A NURSE enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  She moves 
past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing 
with flowers.  She pulls open the blinds and light floods the room.  She crosses back out. 
A toilet flush.  Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his gown. 
VOICE (O.S.) And I thought this was gonna be awkward. 
Quincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing there, laughing.  She has clearly made an effort with her appearance. 
QUINCY Monica? 
He stumbles.  Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm before he falls. 
MONICA I'm sorry. 
Quincy stares at her, completely thrown.  It's been five years.  An awkward beat. 
MONICA (cont'd) So, how you doing? 
QUINCY Alright.  I heard you were in Spain. 
MONICA I was. (smiling) I see your peach fuzz finally grew in. 
Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously. 
QUINCY Just something I'm trying. 
MONICA No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool. 
QUINCY Thanks. 
Quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain. 
MONICA Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations. 
KYRA Thank you. 
MONICA I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great. (then) Well...I should go. 
QUINCY It means a lot that you came by. 
KYRA Yes, we appreciate that. 
MONICA Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything. 
QUINCY Thanks. 
Monica forces one last smile, pulls open the door and leaves. 
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Monica walks down the hall, shell-shocked. INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE DAY 
Camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up 
a couple pecan pies.  Monica enters. 
MONICA 
Hey. 
CAMILLE Hi. 
MONICA Need any help? 
CAMILLE I can manage. 
Monica nods and moves to the barstool. 
CAMILLE (cont'd) Your sister's bringing the baby over. You should try to be here. 
MONICA Yeah.  Can't wait to see him (she falls silent, then) I just saw Quincy. 
CAMILLE How is he? 
MONICA Engaged. 
CAMILLE To that stewardess? 
MONICA Yeah, you met her? 
CAMILLE His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me. 
MONICA Maybe she is. 
Camille looks up, studies Monica for a moment. 
CAMILLE I thought you were over him. 
Monica shrugs. 
MONICA So what do I do? 
CAMILLE Find out where they're registered and send them a gift. 
MONICA (disgusted) Whatever. 
CAMILLE You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask? 
MONICA I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy. 
CAMILLE Don't curse. 
MONICA There you go. 
CAMILLE What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad. 
Monica stares at her mother.  There's no going back. 
MONICA So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot? 
CAMILLE You're the one always turning your nose up at me. 
MONICA No I don't. 
CAMILLE Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say. 
MONICA I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume. 
CAMILLE What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you? 
MONICA Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not. 
CAMILLE So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume? 
Monica is busted.  It takes her a moment to come back.

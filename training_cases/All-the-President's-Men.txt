"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN" 
by 
William Goldman 
Based on the novel 
"All The President's Men" 
by 
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward 
Pre-rehearsal version March, 1975 
Start with as few credits as possible. When they're over-- 
FADE IN ON: 
A TINY BLACK PIECE OF TAPE. 
We see it in the center of the large, dimly lit screen. As the tape is pressed around a door-- 
BEGIN THE BREAK-IN SEQUENCE. 
It's a major piece of action, running maybe five minutes and it's all as detailed and accurate as we can make it, with as many "if only's" included as possible. ("If only" the tape had been attached up and down instead of around the door, Wills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; "if only" the first police car called had gone to investigate, Baldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would have seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely away.) 
The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men. He thought he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was surprised. The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber surgical gloves. HOLD on the hands a moment; then-- 
GO TO: 
A DARK APARTMENT. 
The phone rings. WOODWARD fumbles for the receiver, turns on the bed light. He listens a moment. 
WOODWARD No, no trouble, Harry, be right down. (he hangs up) Son of a bitch. 
He lies back. The apartment is one room, a small terrace beyond. Not much of a place. 
WOODWARD lies still, staring at the ceiling. He blinks, blinks again. HOLD... 
CUT TO: 
THE ENORMOUS FIFTH FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON POST. 
It looks, early of a Saturday morning, pretty deserted. Those reporters that are around are young, bright, and presently involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and thumbing through the papers. 
HARRY ROSENFELD surveys the scene from his office doorway as WOODWARD approaches, hangs his coat at his desk, not far from where ROSENFELD is standing. 
ROSENFELD Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love? 
WOODWARD You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling? 
ROSENFELD As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly. (chomps on some Maalox tablets) Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters-- (WOODWARD is surprised-- he hadn't known) --and (b) these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying-- (consults a piece of paper) --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices. (puts paper down) Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills. 
WOODWARD Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse? 
ROSENFELD (nods) Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go. 
CUT TO: 
THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. 
WOODWARD hurries along, goes inside as we 
CUT TO: 
A CORRIDOR INSIDE. WOODWARD comes down it, looks around, sees a door marked "Counsel's Offices" and heads toward it. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
A CLERK AT A DESK as WOODWARD comes up. Behind them, two lawyers are clearly angry about something, talking and gesticulating to each other. 
WOODWARD (to the COUNSEL'S CLERK) Could you give me the names of the lawyers for the men arrested in the Watergate. 
CLERK These two were appointed-- (indicates the angry men) --only now it turns out the burglars got their own counsel. (he starts to laugh) 
FIRST ANGRY LAWYER (to CLERK) When you gonna stop thinking it's so funny. 
SECOND ANGRY LAWYER (To CLERK) We wouldda done a terrific job protecting those guys. (neither lawyer, by the way, is Clarence Darrow) 
FIRST ANGRY LAWYER You think we're not as good as some hotshot fancy lawyer?-- 
CUT TO: 
THE COURTROOM and business is booming. Muggers, pimp, hookers, their families and friends. In the scene that follows, a constant counterpoint is what's going on up at the front as an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous night, the aforementioned muggers, pimps, and hookers, are shuttled in, given a quick appearance before a JUDGE who sets bond, and then shuttled out. 
The JUDGE indicates the bald burglar. 
JUDGE Your name, please. 
MCCORD James McCord. 
JUDGE Will you step forward, sir. (MCCORD obeys) 
WOODWARD at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but it's hard. 
JUDGE And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord? 
MCCORD (softly) Security consultant. 
JUDGE Where? 
MCCORD (softer) Government. Recently retired. 
JUDGE Where in government? 
MCCORD (we can't really make this out) ...Central... Intelligence... Agency... 
JUDGE (he can't either) Where? 
MCCORD (clearing his throat) The C.I.A. 
And on these words, 
ZOOM TO: 
CLOSE UP--WOODWARD leaning over the fence practically falling over it in a desperate straining effort to catch what's going on. 
WOODWARD (stunned) Holy shit. 
Now from the courtroom-- 
CUT TO: 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WASHINGTON POSTS. 
We are at the end of the press run, the papers are all assembled and being cabled and sent off by machine to various places. As the papers continue to roll past-- 
A UNION TYPE EMPLOYEE grabs a paper, looks at the front page. 
The Watergate story, headlined whatever it was headlined, is visible. The byline was by Alfred E. Lewis. The union type Post employee glances at the article-- 
UNION POST EMPLOYEE (reading half-aloud) "Five men, one of whom said he is a former employee..." (stops reading, gives a shrug) Schmucks. 
And he turns happily to the sports section-- 
CUT TO: 
A CLOSE UP OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. 
It's new money and looks as if it's been recently ironed. Someone is going through the cash, making a quick count. During this-- 
FIRST VOICE (V.O.) Hurry it, huh, Bachinski? 
BACHINSKI You said I could look at it-- 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
We're in a room in a police station and two men are present. One, a COP, is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the door. The other, BACHINSKI, is taking hurried notes in a reporter's type notebook as he examines the evidence. 
COP --I said look, not memorize-- 
BACHINSKI --almost done, give it a rest, all right... (and he looks at an address book, he stops) 
CUT TO: 
THE ADDRESS BOOK. Beside the name "Howard E. Hunt" is the notation "W.House." Now, BACHINSKI hurriedly opens the other book to the letter "H" and there is the same name, "Howard E. Hunt" and beside it, the letters, "W.H." 
COP (V.O.) What'd you find? 
BACHINSKI (V.O.) Beats me. These notebooks belonged to Cuban guys? 
COP (V.O.) S'right. 
BACHINSKI (V.O.) It's gotta mean either White House or whore house, one or the other. 
We HOLD on the HUNT name, and the address notations. Then-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 
The phone rings, waking him. He fumbles for the phone and the light, finally gets them both. 
WOODWARD Bachinski? (reaches for a notebook) What?--hold it-- (gets it open, starts to write) --OK, go on, go on... 
WOODWARD Thanks, anyway. 
And he's about to hang up again when-- 
SECRETARY (V.O.) Have you tried Mullen and Company Public Relations? He works at Mullen and Company Public Relations as a writer. The number is 555-1313. I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. 
WOODWARD Listen, forget it. 
He hangs up, sits there. His hands are a little twitchy... HOLD. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
ROSENFELD hurrying (he always hurries) toward his office. WOODWARD, looking for something in his desk throughout this scene, speaks to him. 
WOODWARD Who's Charles Colson? 
ROSENFELD (stops dead) I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?" 
WOODWARD Who's Colson, Harry? 
ROSENFELD The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name. 
WOODWARD, unfazed by anything, continues to open drawers, close them, as ROSENFELD rolls on. 
ROSENFELD The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel. 
WOODWARD (rising) Thanks, Harry. (looks at ROSENFELD) Know anything about Colson? 
ROSENFELD Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow." 
WOODWARD nods, heads back toward the files as we 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD AT HIS DESK dialing the phone. 
He's got the Colson file spread out now, and we see pictures of the man and articles the Post had done on him. But basically what we see is WOODWARD plugging away on the goddamn phone and you'd think his finger would fall off from all the dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage goes on, you can hear it grow raspy. But a lot of what a reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're compressing here. The dialing never stops, the voices are continuous. 
WOODWARD Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and... (beat) Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? (surprised) He is? 
HUNT (V.O.) Howard Hunt here. 
WOODWARD Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and-- 
HUNT (V.O.) (impatient) --yes, yes, what is it? 
WOODWARD I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate? 
HUNT (V.O.) (blind panic) Good God! 
And he bangs the phone down sharply-- 
--more dialing SOUNDS. Now snatches of conversation-- 
WOODWARD I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett, but we're doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard Hunt. 
BENNETT (V.O.) Well, if you've been doing some investigating then obviously it's no secret to you that Howard was with the C.I.A. 
WOODWARD (he hadn't known) No secret at all. 
More dialing. Then-- 
WOODWARD (tired, voice deeper) Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward, of the Washington Post--get me Personnel-- 
Dialing again. WOODWARD's voice is showing genuine fatigue. 
WOODWARD Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post--and--what's that?--you've never heard of me?--I can't help that--you don't believe I'm with the Post?-- what do you want me to do, Madam, shout "extra--extra"? 
There is the SOUND of the phone being slammed down in his ear. Hard. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
ROSENFELD AND SIMONS approaching WOODWARD who is working at his desk. He has put in a lot of hours on this and looks it. 
ROSENFELD Whaddya got, whaddya got? 
WOODWARD Hunt is Colson's man-- (to SIMONS, explaining) --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- (SIMONS almost says something, decides against it) --they both went to Brown University-- (consulting his notes) --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in. 
SIMONS What else have you got? 
WOODWARD According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me. (reading) "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee." 
He looks up at them. 
SIMONS Isn't that what you'd expect them to say? 
WOODWARD Absolutely. 
ROSENFELD So? 
And as he rises-- 
PAN TO: 
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking silently out of the newsroom then turning left down a darker corridor, passing bulletin boards and wall lockers and it's all nice and quiet as they amble on, nodding to the few people they pass on their way and after a while they turn right and enter the coffee lounge which is empty; the walls are lined with Norman Rockwell reproductions and various kinds of vending machines are visible, selling coffee or milk or fruit or sandwiches and there are some plastic tables and chairs and the minute they are alone, the silence ends. 
WOODWARD What the hell were you doing rewriting my story-- 
BERNSTEIN --I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?-- 
WOODWARD --it was fine the way it was-- 
BERNSTEIN --it was bullshit the way it was-- 
WOODWARD --I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?-- 
BERNSTEIN (a sore subject) --what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen-- 
WOODWARD --and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau-- 
BERNSTEIN --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale-- 
WOODWARD --Bradlee went to Harvard-- 
BERNSTEIN --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart-- 
WOODWARD --I'm smart enough to know my story was solid-- 
BERNSTEIN --mine's better-- 
WOODWARD --no way-- 
BERNSTEIN (handing them over) --read 'em both and you'll see-- 
And as WOODWARD glances at the two stories-- 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN watching. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD. He glances from one story to the other. Then, disconsolately-- 
WOODWARD ...crap... 
And he sinks down in a chair. 
BERNSTEIN Is mine better? 
WOODWARD nods. 
WOODWARD (handing the stories back) What is it about my writing that's so rotten? 
BERNSTEIN (as he exits) Mainly it has to do with your choice of words. 
And as he goes, leaving WOODWARD just sitting there-- 
CUT TO: 
BERSTEIN, re-entering the newsroom, returning to his desk. He starts to insert some papers into his typewriter, hesitates, lights a cigarette. He inhales, as, behind him, WOODWARD briefly is visible going to his desk behind the pillar. 
Finally BERNSTEIN inserts the paper, starts to type as 
WOODWARD (V.O.) (from behind the pillar) Carl? 
BERNSTEIN (turns) Yeah? 
WOODWARD (pushing his chair briefly into view) Fuck you, Carl. 
And as he rolls forward again, out of sight-- 
CUT TO: 
RICHARD NIXON ON THE TUBE. 
(It's the June 22 Press Conference.) He talks on about something, it doesn't matter exactly what here, the point is, it should include that strange smile of his that kept appearing when the man should not have been smiling. Hints of pressure maybe, that's all, and once it's established-- 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
WOODWARD sitting alone, gloomily staring at the set. We're in the Post Cafeteria, it's the next morning, and the place is pretty much empty. He sips the coffee, it tastes rotten. BERNSTEIN moves up behind him, carrying a cup of coffee of his own. He stands by WOODWARD briefly. 
BERNSTEIN You heard? (WOODWARD glances up) They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together. (WOODWARD nods, BERNSTEIN sits down) Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit. 
WOODWARD It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure. 
BERNSTEIN Forget it, the main thing-- (stops) --did you call me a failure? 
WOODWARD I was sure trying. 
LIBRARIAN (V.O.) (elderly-sounding lady) Library. 
BERNSTEIN Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. I was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books that Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy. 
LIBRARIAN (V.O.) I think I do remember, he took out a whole bunch of material. Let me just go see. 
SOUND of the phone being laid down. 
BERNSTEIN --what do you think?-- 
WOODWARD --Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant. 
BERNSTEIN Maybe a political operative of some sort-- 
WOODWARD --a spy, you mean? 
BERNSTEIN It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy. 
LIBRARIAN (V.O.) Mr. Bernstein? 
BERNSTEIN Yes, ma'am. 
LIBRARIAN (V.O.) What I said before? I was wrong. The truth is, I don't have a card that Mr. Hunt took out any Kennedy material. (WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN listen, and now there is something in her voice that wasn't there before: fear) I remember getting that material out for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt. The truth is, I've never had any requests at all from Mr. Hunt. (beat) The truth is, I don't know Mr. Hunt. 
There is the SOUND of the phone being dropped into its cradle. BERNSTEIN continues to hold his. He and WOODWARD just look at each other. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. 
Now, as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN get out of a cab, start inside-- 
CUT TO: 
A MALE LIBRARIAN IN HIS OFFICE. 
LIBRARIAN You want all the material requested by the White House? 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN standing there. The nod. One of them maybe says "yessir," the other maybe "please." The LIBRARIAN moves out of his office into a corridor. They go with him. No one else is around. The LIBRARIAN looks at them, quickly-- 
LIBRARIAN All White House transactions are confidential. 
And just like that, he's back into his office, and as he shuts the door-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking along through the Library of Congress. 
WOODWARD You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet. 
BERNSTEIN We need a sympathetic face. 
On the word "face"-- 
CUT TO: 
A BEARDED YOUNG-LOOKING CLERK. We're in the reading room of the library, and WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are with him. 
YOUNG CLERK You want every request since when? 
BERNSTEIN (to WOODWARD) When did Hunt start at the White House? 
WOODWARD July of '71. 
BERNSTEIN About the past year. 
CLERK (starts to smile) I'm not sure you want 'em, but I got 'em. 
Now-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN seated at a table with from anywhere between 10 to 20 thousand slips of paper. In front of them, seated at a high desk, the bearded clerk looks down on them, shaking his head. It's a staggering amount of work to thumb through. 
CLERK I can't believe you guys are actually doing this. 
WOODWARD (to the clerk) You do a lot of things when you're on a story. (to BERNSTEIN, quietly) Can you believe we're actually doing this? (BERNSTEIN can't) 
Now we have a series of shots of the two of them going through the slips; it took them hours and hours, and the afternoon darkened as they worked. And they're tired. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN getting back into a cab. 
BERNSTEIN That was fun. (slams the door) What now? 
WOODWARD I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion. 
CUT TO: 
A STREET as WOODWARD runs by. It's not the nicest area in the world. He is going faster now. 
CUT TO: 
A CAB GASSING UP AT A STATION. WOODWARD hurries to it, gets in and-- 
CUT TO: 
THE SECOND CAB roaring along some Washington streets. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD INSIDE THE CAB. He looks at his watch, tries not to seem nervous. But his fingers are drumming, drumming and-- 
CUT TO: 
THE SECOND CAB stopping, as WOODWARD gets out, pays. The cab starts off, but slowly. WOODWARD waits. The cab doesn't turn as the first one did. WOODWARD still waits. Finally the cab turns and the second it does, WOODWARD starts to run again and-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD turning a corner, running on and-- 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER CORNER as WOODWARD turns it, finally stops and catches his breath as we-- 
CUT TO: 
A GIGANTIC UNDERGROUND TYPE GARAGE 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD ENTERING THE GARAGE. It's an eerie place, and his heels make noise and if you wonder is he edgy, yes he's edgy. He comes to the ramp leading down to lower levels, hesitates. 
CUT TO: 
THE RAMP. It seems to descend forever. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD starting down. HOLD on him as he walks. Down he goes, the shadows deepening, then disappearing, then covering him again. He continues on. He must be at least at the first underground level now but he doesn't stop, and we don't stop watching him as he continues to go down, turning, the SOUND of his shoes softer now and he's a smaller figure as we watch him circle around and around until we-- 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER LEVEL UNDERGROUND. Dimly lit. A few cars parked here and there. WOODWARD hesitates on the ramp, looks around. 
THE GARAGE. Dark, dark, eerie. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD quietly stepping off the ramp, continuing to glance this way, that way. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
TWO CARS PARKED BESIDE EACH OTHER. 
Nothing unusual about that. But then some cigarette smoke appears, trailing up and disappearing from between the cars. As WOODWARD moves forward-- 
CUT TO: 
A MAN SITTING ON HIS HAUNCHES BETWEEN THE CARS, smoking. He leans with his back against the wall. 
DEEP THROAT I saw the flag signal--what's up? 
WOODWARD Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground. 
DEEP THROAT You thought I'd help out on specifics? (headshake) I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all. (looks at WOODWARD) Are you guys really working? (WOODWARD nods) How much? 
WOODWARD I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up. 
DEEP THROAT Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand. 
WOODWARD If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me? 
DEEP THROAT Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in. (inhales) You come up with anything? 
WOODWARD John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth. (DEEP THROAT nods) Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag. 
DEEP THROAT Follow the money. Always follow the money. 
WOODWARD To where? 
DEEP THROAT (shakes his head "no") Go on. 
WOODWARD This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what. 
DEEP THROAT (lights a new cigarette) You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you? 
at the water fountain on the 5th floor. He chews up a few Maalox tablets, notices BERNSTEIN steaming up. 
BERNSTEIN Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker-- 
ROSENFELD --so? 
BERNSTEIN I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami. 
ROSENFELD heads for his office, BERNSTEIN pursuing. 
ROSENFELD I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein-- 
BERNSTEIN (trying to head him off) --that was awhile ago-- 
ROSENFELD --"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters." (whirls on BERNSTEIN) I'm still waiting for it. 
He enters his office, BERNSTEIN follows. 
BERNSTEIN Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do? 
ROSENFELD You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill? 
And he looks unsympathetically at BERNSTEIN-- 
CUT TO: 
SIMONS circling around the 5th floor. ROSENFELD falls into step. They keep moving throughout. 
ROSENFELD I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein." (SIMONS gestures for ROSENFELD to continue) I want to send a reporter to Miami. 
SIMONS Anyone but Bernstein. 
ROSENFELD Howard-- 
SIMONS --remember Toronto, Harry. 
ROSENFELD That was awhile ago. 
SIMONS I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him. 
ROSENFELD I know, I did, but damnit Howard-- (SIMONS looks at him) For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping... 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN'S APARTMENT. 
A shambles. He is busy doing two things at once, studying notebooks and packing. Music plays, lovely stuff; the Bach Brandenburgs. As the phone rings-- 
BERNSTEIN (answering) Yeah? (pause) Yes, this is Carl Bernstein. (stunned) You're repossessing my bicycle? (softer) Listen, I'm sure I paid this month's installment, so why don't you check your records before you go around hassling people? (pause) Oh... 
And as he stands there-- 
AN ATTRACTIVE, EFFICIENT-LOOKING WOMAN of BERNSTEIN's age. She has just entered the apartment. Vivaldi is playing now. 
BERNSTEIN Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast. 
HANNAH (glancing around the chaos) Where are your bills, Carl? 
BERNSTEIN Oh, they're here. (starts lifting debris from his desk) I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah. (grabbing a big manila envelope) See? (hands it to her) 
HANNAH (looks inside) Carl, it's a jungle. (sits at his desk, takes out a mass of papers--glancing at the top bill) I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles. (studies another bill) You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for. 
He smiles, gently begins massaging her shoulders as she studies his finances. 
BERNSTEIN Hey... very tense. 
HANNAH (nods) Lot of pressure at the Star. (looking at the bills) Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. (sighs) How much did the damn bike cost? 
BERNSTEIN Five hundred; six maybe. 
HANNAH (looking at paper) You're two months behind--you got enough to cover? 
BERNSTEIN I think. 
HANNAH Give me your checkbook then. 
BERNSTEIN It's right under that pile. 
He indicates a mound of papers. She pulls it out as he continues to massage her, more sensually now. She reaches back, puts her hand on his. 
HANNAH I thought you had to get to Miami. 
BERNSTEIN There's always a later plane. 
HANNAH You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl? 
BERNSTEIN Nobody's perfect. (more rubbing now) I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper. 
HANNAH looks at BERNSTEIN a moment; then she smiles gently, shakes her head. 
He hangs up. 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN watching from phone booth as the SECRETARY hurries across the hallway. As we see her open the door of the clerk's office, BERNSTEIN bolts out of the phone booth and runs into the reception room heading straight for the SECRETARY's desk. 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN at her desk, looking at the telephone console, receiver in hand. He punches the button marked Intercom and we can hear it BUZZ somewhere. 
VOICE (V.O.) Dardis. 
BERNSTEIN Carl Bernstein's here to see you--I don't know why, but he seems angry-- 
CUT TO: 
DARDIS emerging through one of the doors behind BERNSTEIN. BERNSTEIN see him. 
BERNSTEIN (to DARDIS) Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so. 
DARDIS Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow? 
BERNSTEIN (headshake) I'm on deadline. 
CUT TO: 
DARDIS' OFFICE. He is fiddling with a combination lock at a filing cabinet. BERNSTEIN is seated across DARDIS' desk. 
DARDIS You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff? 
BERNSTEIN Whatever. 
He hands BERNSTEIN some papers, glances at his watch. 
DARDIS I'll never get out of here in time. 
BERNSTEIN (flying through what he's been handed) The telephone calls... we know about that. 
DARDIS The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks-- 
BERNSTEIN --yeah, that was in The Times this morning. 
BERNSTEIN continues to fly through the papers. 
BERNSTEIN (continuing stops) What's this Dahlberg check? 
And as it's mentioned-- 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP--CASHIER'S CHECK. It's drawn on the First Bank and Trust Company of Boca Raton, Florida, it's dated April 10 and it's for 25 thousand dollars, payable to the order to Kenneth H. Dahlberg. 
DARDIS' VOICE That the twenty-five grand one?-- Don't know-- 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN starting to copy the check in a meticulous facsimile. DARDIS watches. 
DARDIS I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was. (watching BERNSTEIN) Think it might be anything? 
BERNSTEIN (casually) This? (shrugs) Naw... 
And from here quickly-- 
ZOOM TO: 
BERNSTEIN IN A PHONE BOOTH in the lobby of the Justice Building. Wildly excited-- 
BERNSTEIN --Woodward--Woodward, listen, I don't know what I got-- (holding the Dahlberg facsimile) --and I think the Times has it too-- (big) --but somewhere there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg in this world and we've gotta find him-- 
And now comes 
THE HUNT FOR DAHLBERG. 
This is a compressed montage sequence in which we CUT from one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying to locate a man names DAHLBERG. 
WOODWARD is maybe in the reference room of the Post, sweating, surrounded by Who's Who and Dictionary of American Biographies and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities-- 
BERNSTEIN is maybe in the phone booth of the Justice Building, sweating, with a pile of dimes as he dials away. 
This took them hours, and that effort should be visible to us. They tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone book and dialing numbers and God knows what else. The point is, we want to get to DAHLBERG in a reasonably short amount of time, but we also want people to know there was effort involved. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD, bleary, in the reference room, a girl comes in, a researcher librarian type. 
RESEARCHER Were you after the Dahlberg articles from the files? (WOODWARD nods) There aren't any, sorry. 
And now she drops a piece of paper, a photo-- 
CUT TO: 
THE BUDGET MEETING 
SIMONS --OK, last go-round. Foreign, anything else? 
The foreign editor, an enormously thoughtful-looking and respected man, indicates "no." 
SIMONS (to another editor) National? 
NATIONAL EDITOR I'll stand with the Eagleton follow- ups and McGovern not being able to get a replacement--that's your page one stuff right there, Howard-- 
SIMONS --Metropolitan?-- 
ROSENFELD --you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions-- 
NATIONAL EDITOR --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions-- 
ROSENFELD (to NATIONAL EDITOR) --quit equivocating, say what you mean-- (to SIMONS and BRADLEE) --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances-- 
BRADLEE --and we printed that, didn't we, Harry? And when the frigging audit's done, we'll print that too-- 
NATIONAL EDITOR --let me tell what happened when I was having lunch today at the Sans Souci-- 
ROSENFELD --correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci-- 
NATIONAL EDITOR --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein? 
ROSENFELD Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk-- 
NATIONAL EDITOR --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?-- 
ROSENFELD --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting-- 
NATIONAL EDITOR --well, what if your boys get it wrong-- 
BRADLEE (after a beat) Then it's our asses, isn't it? 
SIMONS (indicates the meeting is over) And we'll all have to go to work for a living. 
As the men rise and head for the door, the FOREIGN EDITOR moves toward BRADLEE and SIMONS who remain seated as before. 
FOREIGN EDITOR I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story. (BRADLEE and SIMONS look at him) I don't think we should cover the story, period. 
BRADLEE Go on. 
FOREIGN EDITOR It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff. 
SIMONS What then? 
FOREIGN EDITOR I don't believe the goddamn story, Howard, it doesn't make sense. 
BRADLEE It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time. 
FOREIGN EDITOR Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom? 
BRADLEE and SIMONS say nothing. They respect this guy. 
FOREIGN EDITOR Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em. (sits on the table, talks quietly on) Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans? 
BRADLEE You saying the Democrats bugged themselves? 
FOREIGN EDITOR The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one. (rises, starts out) Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business. 
He leaves. BRADLEE and SIMONS stay where they are, both of them flattened by what the guy's said. Because they're not sure he's wrong... HOLD. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
THE PAPERS POURING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY LINE. 
We're back with the UNION GUY from before. He pulls out a paper again, looks at a story on the front page-- 
CUT TO: 
THE WOODWARD/BERNSTEIN STORY that said the GAO found that CREEP has mishandled over $500,000 in campaign funds. 
UNION GUY (to another UNION GUY who's reading over his shoulder) What'd'ya think? 
SECOND UNION GUY Politics as usual, someone just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, that's all. 
UNION GUY (he's not so sure) Big fuckin' cookie jar. 
As he turns to the sports section-- 
CUT TO: 
GETTING THE CREEP LIST SEQUENCE. 
Either they get it as it is now, or as they really did, from a Post researcher who knew someone. In ant case, we see the list, with the columns of names and numbers meaning offices and phone extensions. 
AN ELEVATOR, the numbers of the floors being lit as it rises. 4--5--6-- WOODWARD stands alone in the elevator. As it reaches seven and the doors slide open, he steps out and 
CUT TO: 
THE MARRIOTT SUITE. It's numbered 710. WOODWARD approaches but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls, knocks on the door nearest him. Now 710 is wide open and several maids leave, watched by a large black man. 
FIRST MAID We'll be back after lunch. 
BLACK MAN (it's the voice from the phone) We'll be here. 
WOODWARD waits by his door as 710 slowly closes. The maids look at him a moment. He knocks again, louder. 
SECOND MAID I think they went out. 
WOODWARD (shrugs) I don't mind waiting. 
The maids nod, move out of sight. WOODWARD stands tense and still, watching the closed door numbered 710... Now-- 
CUT TO: 
NATIONAL AIRPORT IN D.C. - LATE AFTERNOON. 
People are getting off the shuttle, WOODWARD among them. BERNSTEIN waits. 
BERNSTEIN (as WOODWARD reaches him) See her? (WOODWARD nods) Get anything? 
WOODWARD For the paper, no; for us, plenty. (The two of them head for the terminal) I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile. 
BERNSTEIN And?--And?-- 
WOODWARD (looks at BERNSTEIN) --she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell. 
BERNSTEIN Were you eyebrow reading? 
WOODWARD (shakes his head "no") It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...? 
They look at each other, neither has a clue. HOLD. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
THE RED KARMANN GHIA 
moving along a residential area in Washington. It's later that night. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE CAR - NIGHT. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN driving along. 
BERNSTEIN Left up ahead. 
WOODWARD nods. 
WOODWARD Who's first? 
BERNSTEIN Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street. 
As WOODWARD turns left. 
BERNSTEIN Now hang your second right-- (explaining) --this was my turf when I was a kid. 
And on those words-- 
CUT TO: 
A DEAD END SIGN. We hear BERNSTEIN explaining-- 
BERNSTEIN (V.O.) I brought you over one street too many--go back and hang a left again. 
Now on those words-- 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER DEAD END SIGN. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pulled over to one side. BERNSTEIN, baffled, stares around; WOODWARD looks at a map with the aid of a flashlight. 
BERNSTEIN I don't get it... this really was my turf... 
WOODWARD (concentrating on the map) You're not a kid anymore. 
BERNSTEIN (shaking his head) My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow." (WOODWARD is getting interested in the story now) And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper." (BERNSTEIN looks at WOODWARD) Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all. 
WOODWARD goes back to his map. BERNSTEIN continues to smoke, staring around at the night. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD - AT THE FRONT OF A HOUSE. A sweet old lady is looking out at him. 
The BOOKKEEPER kneads her hands together silently. BERNSTEIN watches. 
BERNSTEIN I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it? 
BOOKKEEPER ...No... never in so many words... 
BERNSTEIN (gently) It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone. 
He takes out his notebook. 
CUT TO: 
The BOOKKEEPER. And she does want to talk. But the notebook scares her terribly and she can only stare at it. 
BERNSTEIN I'm not even going to put your name down. It's just so I can keep things straight. (beat) Start with the money, why don't you? 
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (returning with coffee) How do you like it? 
BERNSTEIN Everything, please. 
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (going again) I won't be a minute. 
BERNSTEIN (to the BOOKKEEPER, quietly) The General Accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans' safe. Did you know about that from the beginning? 
BOOKKEEPER (about to fold) There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot-- 
BERNSTEIN --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it? 
BOOKKEEPER A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that. 
BERNSTEIN Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars. 
BOOKKEEPER (her words are coming faster) I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried. 
BERNSTEIN Which people? 
BOOKKEEPER The ones who could disburse the money. 
BERNSTEIN Who were they? 
BOOKKEEPER There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names. 
BERNSTEIN Sloan knew which five, didn't he? (she nods) 
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (back with cream and sugar) Here we are. 
BOOKKEEPER I don't want to say anymore. 
BERNSTEIN (indicating coffee) It's awfully hot-- (smiles) --and you haven't finished telling me about the money-- 
BOOKKEEPER (long pause; then--in a burst) --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it. 
BERNSTEIN (heart starting to pound) Gordon Liddy, you mean? 
BOOKKEEPER (nods) It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. (more and more moved now) ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it. 
BERNSTEIN Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way. 
There is a pause. Then-- 
BOOKKEEPER If you guys... if you guys could just get John Mitchell... that would be beautiful... 
And now, as long last, she begins to cry. HOLD on her tears, then-- 
CUT TO: 
A TYPEWRITER 
clicking away. The words "INTERVIEW WITH X. SEPT. 14" are visible. There is music in the background, really blasting away, Rachmaninoff or worse. 
We are in WOODWARD's apartment and BERNSTEIN is dictating notes from the BOOKKEEPER interview. It's very late, and BERNSTEIN has notes on everything, matchboxes, and it's hard for him to read. They're both really excited, BERNSTEIN from his coffee jag, WOODWARD by what BERNSTEIN's dictating. 
BERNSTEIN I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth. 
WOODWARD Go on, go on-- 
BERNSTEIN --we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in. 
WOODWARD Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit. 
BERNSTEIN It goes very high--we've got to find out where-- 
WOODWARD --we will-- 
BERNSTEIN --she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper. 
WOODWARD That happens to people. (he goes over, turns the hi-fi on even louder. Shouts--) OK, go on. 
The noise blasts away as BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD hunch over the typewriter. It's a moment of genuine exhilaration. Paranoid, sure, but for the first time, they're really on to something; it's all starting to split open... 
MITCHELL (V.O.) --all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard. 
BERNSTEIN Sir, I'd like to ask you a few-- 
MITCHELL (V.O.) --what time is it? 
BERNSTEIN 
MITCHELL (V.O.) Morning or night? 
BERNSTEIN Night. 
MITCHELL (V.O.) Oh. 
And he hangs up. 
CUT TO: 
BRADLEE and BERNSTEIN at BERNSTEIN's desk. BRADLEE is going over BERNSTEIN's notes. 
BRADLEE He really made that remark about Mrs. Graham? (BERNSTEIN nods) This is a family newspaper--cut the words "her tit" and run it. 
And now suddenly-- 
THE PRESSES OF THE POST 
rolling the story. They're modern and gigantic and 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. They're in the lobby of the Post at night and through a thick-pane of glass they're watching their story roll and on their faces is something you don't expect to see: panic. 
BRADLEE comes up behind them, looks down at the presses, starts to talk. 
BRADLEE Once when I was reporting, Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the day it appeared Johnson called a press conference and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life... And when he was done, he turned to his top guy and the President said, "Call Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you." (shakes his head) I took a lot of static for that-- everyone said, "You did it, Bradlee, you screwed up--you stuck us with Hoover forever--" (looks at WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN) --I screwed up but I wasn't wrong. 
They all watch the presses now. 
BRADLEE You guys haven't been wrong yet, is that why you're scared shitless? (as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN nod, BRADLEE starts away) You should be... 
CUT TO: 
THE PRESSES continuing to roll. The SOUND is incredible. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
A TELETYPE MACHINE 
clacking away like crazy. We can read the words, "The Senator finished by saying that although he was..." and from there-- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A SENATOR and while the words "although he was" are still very fresh in our minds-- 
SENATOR Although I am a Republican, I would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the Democratic Party-- 
The SOUND of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part and we see three people and it's very important that their voices are immediately recognizable and distinct. One, the SENATOR is from the West and will have that twang. The next two whom we are about to meet are PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE from CREEP and the WHITE HOUSE. The CREEP voice is very southern, the WHITE HOUSE GUY sounds like an NBC announcer. The WESTERN SENATOR will be seen in a corridor of the Senate office building, talking to reporters, the CREEP P.R. SOUTHERNER will be talking to reporters in front of the CREEP office doors and so identified. The WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to one side. As the teletype goes on-- 
CUT TO: 
THE SOUTHERN CREEP P.R. MAN 
CREEP P.R. MAN (in mid-sentence) --hearsay, innuendo, and character assassination. I can only conclude that the so-called sources of the Washington Post are a fountain of misinformation-- 
CUT TO: 
THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN 
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN --the White House has long since stopped being surprised at this type of reporting by certain elements of the Eastern liberal press-- 
CUT TO: 
BRADLEE'S OFFICE 
A lot of activity. BRADLEE is at his desk reading the teletype dispatches. SIMONS and ROSENFELD are there, WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, too. A kid comes in with more teletype stuff. The editors look at it. 
SIMONS (reading) Same kind of crap-- 
BRADLEE (glancing through; nods) --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate. 
BERNSTEIN What's a real denial? 
BRADLEE If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- (little pause) --it's time to start circling the wagons. 
CUT TO: 
THE UNION GUYS IN THE POST 
looking at a new headline: 
in a state of anger, pacing around the tiny teletype room. WOODWARD hurries in. 
WOODWARD What? 
BRADLEE says nothing, just points to the AP teletype. WOODWARD looks at it, clearly is upset. 
BRADLEE I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- (to BERNSTEIN who tears in--) --you think I like being aced out? 
BERNSTEIN --what?-- 
WOODWARD --The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin-- 
BERNSTEIN --the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- (WOODWARD nods) --he say anything we don't know?-- 
WOODWARD (headshake) --just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway-- 
BRADLEE --it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this-- 
BERNSTEIN --there's nothing new in it-- 
BRADLEE --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story-- (starts out) --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it-- 
And he stalks out. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN stand staring at the teletype which keeps on clacking and clacking as the L.A. Times story keeps getting longer. 
BERNSTEIN Goddamnit-- 
WOODWARD --shit-- 
BERNSTEIN --we gotta top the Times-- 
WOODWARD --I know, I know-- 
BERNSTEIN --if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again-- 
WOODWARD --shit, who do we know?-- 
BERNSTEIN --I know a lawyer at Justice-- 
WOODWARD --has he got an ax?-- 
BERNSTEIN --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat. 
WOODWARD Then he's got an ax. (beat) Call him anyway. 
As BERNSTEIN nods, takes off out of the room-- 
CUT TO: 
THE UNION GUYS 
studying the front page, on which one headline indicates that they're named the guys at CREEP who got the reports. 
FIRST UNION GUY Who is this Woodstein? (points to paper) Two stories on the front page. 
SECOND UNION GUY If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico, to hell with him. 
CUT TO: 
A HOT SHOPPE. 
WOODWARD is stirring his morning coffee as BERNSTEIN comes in, spots him, hurries over. BERNSTEIN is maybe more excited then we've yet seen him. 
BERNSTEIN --I want you to shut up and listen to me-- 
WOODWARD --I haven't said anything-- 
BERNSTEIN --for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip-- (carefully) --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing. 
WOODWARD How high up, which Republicans? 
BERNSTEIN That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men-- 
WOODWARD --Haldeman I know, who else? 
BERNSTEIN Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories? 
WOODWARD The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans. 
BERNSTEIN Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in. 
WOODWARD So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece-- 
BERNSTEIN --because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed. 
WOODWARD If he self-destructed. 
Now, from the two of them-- 
CUT TO: 
THE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE POST 
and it's noisy. Not as noisy as it's going to get, but there is more tension around just now than there has been previously. 
CUT TO: 
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN HER MID-30s. On her desk is her name, MARILYN BERGER. She is watching BERNSTEIN who is standing by the water cooler nearby. As she gets up-- 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN drinking water. 
BERGER Do you guys know about the Canuck letter? 
BERNSTEIN (nods, drinks) Um-hmm. (stops, looks at her) Why? 
BERGER I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it. 
As she speaks-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD working at his desk, suddenly looking up as a SCREAM comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone turns to see, here comes BERNSTEIN dragging BERGER over to WOODWARD's desk. 
BERNSTEIN (hysterical) Tell him what you just told me. 
BERGER Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be a reporter here before he went to work for Nixon--I had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter. (she looks from one of them to the other) You did want to know, didn't you? 
And now from her-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN in a corner of the room, talking low and fast. 
BERNSTEIN You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names. 
WOODWARD It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon. 
BERNSTEIN You think this was Clawsen's initiation? 
WOODWARD Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. (beat) God knows it worked. 
CUT TO: 
A FROZEN SHOT OF MUSKIE IN THE SNOW in tears, standing on the flat-bed truck. This was in the New Hampshire primary, just after the Canuck letter was published. 
WOODWARD (V.O.) You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken? 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD ON THE PHONE 
WOODWARD She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you? 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas. 
WOODWARD Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen? 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Where? (beat) What do you mean, where? 
WOODWARD Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant-- 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment. 
There is a sound of him hanging up the phone. Hard. WOODWARD hangs up quietly, rubs his eyes, calls out to BERGER who is at her desk-- 
WOODWARD Non denial-denial, Marilyn-- 
BERGER is about to answer when her phone rings. She picks it up, turns to WOODWARD, mouths "it's him" and we 
CUT TO: 
BERGER ON THE PHONE. Again Clawsen on the other end. 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) For Chissakes, don't tell them I came to your place. 
BERGER I already told them. 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Oh, that's terrific, that's just so terrific, I'm thrilled you did that. 
BERGER I have a clear conscience. 
CLAWSEN (V.O.) Marilyn, I have a wife and a family and a cat and a dog. 
Now from this-- 
BRADLEE IN HIS OFFICE GESTURING 
BERNSTEIN Baldwin told the FBI it was you. 
SEDAM Baldwin told the FBI it was someone whose first name sounded like a last name. They showed him a list and he picked me but it wasn't me, it was Gordon Liddy. (looks at the reporters) My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my wife's hysterical, my kids think I'm mixed up with the burglary, my friends don't like me around all of a sudden. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP--SEDAM 
SEDAM You fucked around my life, you two. (starts off) I just wanted to say thanks. 
BRADLEE watching WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, who are clearly upset. 
BRADLEE That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been wrong? (they nod) You had a good source? (nod) Did he have an ax? (pause. Then another nod) 
CLOSE UP--BRADLEE 
BRADLEE All right, you made a mistake maybe, we all have, just don't make another. And watch your personal lives, who you hang around with. Someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years. (beat) Make sure it isn't our blood... 
Now from BRADLEE-- 
CUT TO: 
HUGH SLOAN 
holding a broom and dustpan at his front door. 
SLOAN I really can't talk now-- 
BERNSTEIN --this'll only take one second-- 
SLOAN --my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape. 
WOODWARD A boy or a girl? 
SLOAN A girl. Melissa. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE HOUSE. WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN are helping SLOAN with the housework. WOODWARD has a dust mop, BERNSTEIN a dust cloth. We are mostly in the living room throughout, and also throughout, the three guys beaver away tidying. 
WOODWARD (holding up a cup) Where does this go? 
SLOAN points to a shelf. WOODWARD moves to put the cup in its proper place. 
WOODWARD --That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control-- 
BERNSTEIN (ticking them off) --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach-- 
WOODWARD --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman. 
SLOAN --I'm not your source on that-- 
BERNSTEIN --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved-- 
WOODWARD --and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President. 
SLOAN No, none of those. 
BERNSTEIN --that leaves Haldeman, period. 
SLOAN I'm not your source on that. 
He picks up a dust pan, starts sweeping it full. 
WOODWARD (taking the dust pan, helping out) --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names? 
SLOAN Of course--everything they asked-- 
BERNSTEIN --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?-- 
SLOAN --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did. 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN look at each other while SLOAN empties the dust pan into the trash and from there, quickly-- 
CUT TO: 
A LONG LONG LONG SHOT OF A COUPLE 
walking in the park. 
We can't really make them out clearly, we never do in this little sequence. But the guy is wearing a windbreaker and has a crew cut and the woman with him is dressed casually too. He has his arm around her, and they are deep in conversation. 
WOODWARD'S VOICE (V.O.) Hey? 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sitting on a park bench swilling down a six-pack. 
WOODWARD I think that's him. 
They nod. 
BRADLEE --Bernstein, are you sure on this story? 
BERNSTEIN Absolutely-- 
BRADLEE (to WOODWARD) --what about you?-- 
WOODWARD --I'm sure-- 
BRADLEE --I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- (looks at SIMONS) 
SIMONS (to WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, after a puse) --get another source. 
Now quickly 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN huddling outside BRADLEE's office. 
BERNSTEIN How many fucking sources they think we got?-- 
WOODWARD --Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman. 
BERNSTEIN I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. (looks at WOODWARD) 
WOODWARD --We got twenty minutes to deadline-- 
And as he speaks 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN talking softly from a relatively private phone in the newsroom. The voice of the lawyer is also whispered and scared to death. 
LAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.) (barely audible) ...You shouldn't ever call me like this, Carl... 
BERNSTEIN Will you confirm that Haldeman was mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury? 
LAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.) ...I won't say anything about Haldeman... not ever... 
BERNSTEIN (desperate) All right--listen--it's against the law if you talk about the Grand Jury, right? But you don't have to say a thing--I'll count to ten--if the story's wrong, hang up before I get there--if it's OK stay on the line till after, got it? 
LAWYER (O.S.) Hang up, right? 
BERNSTEIN Right, right--OK, counting: one, two-- (he inhales deeply) --three, four, five, six-- (now he's starting to get excited) --seven, eight-- (inhales deeply) --nine, ten, thank you. 
LAWYER (O.S.) You've got it straight now? Everything OK? 
BERNSTEIN (on a note of triumph) Yeah! 
And on that shout 
CUT TO: 
A HEADLINE IN THE POST--A PHOTO VISIBLE OF HALDEMAN: 
"TESTIMONY TIES TOP NIXON AIDE TO SECRET FUND" 
CUT TO: 
THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN 
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN On the record let me say just this: the story is totally untrue. On background, I'd like to add that Bob Haldeman is one of the greatest public servants this country has ever had and the story is a goddamned lie. 
NOW FAST ZOOM TO: 
BRADLEE 
roaring out of his office doorway. 
BRADLEE Woodstein! 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN tearing into BRADLEE's office--he stands scowling at the TV set in a corner of the room-- outside, it is raining like hell. 
CUT TO: 
THE TV SET. SLOAN is walking along toward a large office building, he is flanked by a lawyer. A TV Reporter (it was DANIEL SCHORR) is walking alongside, mike in hand. 
SCHORR Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment on your testimony before the Grand Jury. 
SLOAN My lawyer says-- 
SLOAN'S LAWYER --the answer is an unequivocal no. Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman in that testimony at all. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. They look sick. Desperate, tired, stunned, confused; there is nothing to say. 
BERNSTEIN'S VOICE (O.S.) What'd you find? 
WOODWARD Jesus Christ, what time is it? 
BERNSTEIN You overslept? 
WOODWARD Goddamnit!-- 
He fumbles for the lamp, as it falls with a CRASH-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD--MOVING. Hair wild, clothes half-buttoned, he runs through the dark Washington streets as we 
CUT TO: 
TWO WELL-DRESSED MEN in the shadows across the street, going in the same direction and 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD spotting them, picking up the pace and 
CUT TO: 
THE TWO MEN moving faster too and now 
CUT TO: 
A BUNCH OF CABS. WOODWARD jumps into the first and as it roars off 
CUT TO: 
THE TWO MEN getting into a cab also, roaring off in the same direction and 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD'S CAB taking a corner fast and as it goes on, HOLD until the second cab takes the same corner, faster, and now 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD jumping out of his cab, fumbling into his pockets for change as we 
CUT TO: 
THE TWO MEN getting out of their cab, paying, and as their cab drives off 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD diving back into his cab and in a moment it is roaring again through the night and we 
CUT TO: 
THE TWO WELL-DRESSED MEN standing on the sidewalk, watching as WOODWARD disappears into the night and then suddenly, 
ZOOM TO: 
DEEP THROAT IN CLOSE UP AND MAD. 
DEEP THROAT --you were doing so well and then you got stupid, you went too fast-- Christ, what a royal screw up-- 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
DEEP THROAT and WOODWARD in the underground garage. 
WOODWARD --I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post-- 
DEEP THROAT --you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months. 
WOODWARD We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong? 
DEEP THROAT You'll have to find that out, won't you?-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD exploding. 
WOODWARD --I'm tired of your chickenshit games-- I don't want hints, I want what you know! 
CUT TO: 
DEEP THROAT. He blinks for a moment. Then he begins to whisper. 
DEEP THROAT It was a Haldeman operation--the whole business--he ran the money, but he was insulated, you'll have to find out how-- 
WOODWARD takes a breath, nods. 
DEEP THROAT --wait-- (almost a smile) --there's more... 
And from his weathered face

FADE IN 
MONTAGE OF PHOTOS 
RAY (V.O.) My fathers name was John Kinsella. A faded, sepia shot of a dirty little kid on a farm. 
RAY (V.O.) Its an Irish name. He was born in North Dakota, in 1896... Young man in doughboy uniform. 
RAY (V.O.) ...and never saw a big city until he came back from France in 1918. Chicago. Tenement. Comiskey Park. Ballgames. 
RAY (V.O.) He settled in Chicago, where he quickly learned to live and die with the White Sox. Died a little when they lost the 1919 World Series... Newspaper headlines. Photo of Shoeless Joe Jackson. 
RAY (V.O.) ...died a lot the following summer when eight members of the team were accused of throwing that Series. Dad (a catcher) playing ball. At work. Weeding. 
RAY (V.O.) He played in the minors for a year or two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved to Brooklyn in 35, married Mom in 38, and was already an old man working at the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949. Ray as an infant. With his father. In front of Ebbets Field in miniature Dodger uniform, etc. 
RAY (V.O.) My names Ray Kinsella. Mom died when I was three, and I suppose Dad did the best he could. Instead of Mother Goose, I was put to bed at night to stories of

RAY (CONT'D) Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees fan then, so of course I rooted for Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved away, so we had to find other things to fight about. We did. And when it came time to go to college, I picked the farthest one from home I could find. Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc. 
RAY (V.0.) This, of course, drove him right up the wail, which I suppose was the point. Officially my major was English, but really it was the Sixties. Ray looking foolish in long hair and tie-dye. 
RAY (V.O.) I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried to like sitar music... and I met Annie. Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship. 
RAY (V.0.) The only thing we had in common was that she came from Iowa and I had once heard of Iowa. We moved in together. After graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and stayed with her family as long as we could. Unsmiling American Gothic types. 
RAY (V.O.) Almost a full afternoon. The apartment, Ray at different jobs, the wedding. 
RAY (V.0.) We rented an apartment and I took a job selling insurance. I also drove a cab and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married that fail. Baby pictures. 
RAY (V.O.) A few years later Karin was born. She smelled weird, but we loved her anyway. Then Annie got the crazy idea that she could talk me into buying a farm.

RAY (V.0.) I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm about to become a farmer. I love my family, I love baseball, and I miss New York. Moving in on Ray's face. 
RAY (V.0.) But until I heard The Voice...I'd never done a crazy thing in my whole life. 
DISSOLVE TO 
2 THE CORNFIELD - DUSK 
It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him. 
THE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the source of this sound. All around him are empty fields. He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to work. 
THE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away, the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming. 
RAY 
(CALLS) Annie, what was that? 
ANNIE 
(CALLS BACK) What was what? 
RAY That voice. 
ANNIE What voice? 
CONTINUED

22 CONTINUED 
ANNIE Oooh, why do I not think this is a good thing? 
RAY I think it means if I build a baseball field out there, Shoeless Joe Jackson will get to come back and play ball again. 
ANNIE You're kidding. 
RAY Uh uh. She whistles. This is serious. 
RAY Yeah. 
CUT TO 
23 INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Ray and Annie are putting little Karin to bed. 
ANNIE Boy, I thought my family was crazy, but this...this is the craziest thing I've ever heard. 
RAY I know. It's totally nuts. 
ANNIE I mean, Shoeless Joe, he's... 
RAY 
(NODS) Died in '51. 
ANNIE And he's the one they suspended, right? 
-AY Right. 
ANNIE He still dead? 
RAY Far as I know. 
CUT TO 
24 INT.'BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Ray and Annie in their pajamas, brushing their teeth, getting ready for bed. 
ANNIE You know what amazes me? No one could ever get you to believe in astrology, or ESP, or reincarnation, or heaven, or any of that stuff. But this...I think this shows real personal growth, Ray. 
RAY Thank you. Annie smiles, but sees that Ray is troubled. She hugs him. 
ANNIE Oh, sweetie. I hope you know that even though I make jokes, I'm going to visit you every month wherever they put you. He offers her a weak smile and exits. 
CUT TO 
25 INT. RAY AND'ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
It is dark. For a few seconds it is quiet. Then: 
RAY Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing? 
ANNIE If I did, I'd forgotten it. Ray sits up in the dark. 
RAY I always felt cheated I never got to see him play. He was supposed to be so graceful, and agile. So to actually get to see him play again...to let him play again, to right an old wrong... He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it. Annie turns on the light. 
ANNIE Wait a minute, Bosco. Are you actually thinking of doing this? 
CONTINUED 
25 CONTINUED 
RAY No. 
(THEN) I mean, I can't think of one good reason why I should,-but... (takes a breath) I'm thirty-eight years old, I have a wife, a child, and a mortgage, and I'm scared to death I'm turning into my father. 
ANNIE What's your father got to do with this? Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of meaning for him. 
RAY I never forgave him for getting old. By the time he'was as old as I am now, he was ancient. He must have had dreams, but he never did anything about them. For all I know, he may have even heard voices, too, but he sure didn't listen to them. The man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years I knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's what growing up means. I'm afraid of that happening to me. And something tells me this may be my last chance to do something about it. (looks at her) I want to build that field. Do you think I'm crazy? She looks at him with great understanding. 
ANNIE Yes. He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly. 
ANNIE I also think that if you feel you really have to do this... then you should do it. They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms. Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting. 
CUT TO 
KARIN What's suspend? 
RAY They never let him play the game again. They continue to work in silence. 
CUT TO 
37 INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE I 7 
Ray writes a check for his purchases: bats, balls, bases pitcher's rubber, home plate, etc. He appears slightly annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the uniformed employees of the store. He turns to catch the Store Owner staring at him the most intently. 
RAY What. What! 
STORE OWNER You're the fella that plowed under your corn and built a baseball diamond, right? 
RAY Yeah. What about it? 
STORE OWNER (shakes his hand) Greatest damn thing I ever heard. The other employees beam their agreement. 
RAY At these prices, I'm not surprised. 
CONTINUED 
37 CONTINUED He wheels his shopping cart of sporting goods out through a gauntlet of approving salesmen. They smile and pat him on the back. Ray cannot decide if they're crazier than he is. 
RAY Thank you...thank you... 
CUT TO 
38 THE LIGHT STANDARD - NIGHT 38 Atop the aluminum-painted poles, an array of store-bought floodlights switch on, flaring against the blue-black sky. In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green, cool as mint, soft as a cashmere blanket. Annie and Karin watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases, which pick up the light like little moons on a cold, clear night. 
RAY My father said he saw him years later playing under a made-up name in some tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone from his step, but he could still hit. Dad used to say no one could hit like Shoeless Joe. Ray is smiling wistfully. 
ANNIE That's the first time I've ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father. Ray considers that. 
KARIN How come? 
ANNIE Come on, you. Bed time. Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt, and the three climb their way down the bleachers. Ray's hand steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps. 
RAY Careful... Moonl ight butters the Iowa night. They walk along the side of the field, and Ray stops. He looks at the field. 
CONTINUED 
38 CONTINUED 38 
RAY I have just created something totally illogical. 
ANNIE That's what I like about it. 
RAY Am I completely nuts? 
ANNIE Not completely. She looks out over the baseball field. 
ANNIE It's a good baseball field, Ray. 
RAY It is kinda pretty, isn't it? Annie smiles at him and carries Karin inside. Ray steps onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the floodlights over the field. 
CUT TO 
39 RAY AND ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 39 Annie opens her eyes and sees Ray not beside her in bed, but in th window seat, looking out at the empty field. Barely awake, she gets out of bed, shuffles to his side and curls up against him. 
ANNIE Any sign? 
RAY Something's going to happen out there. I can feel it. Annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to sleep. Outside, the trees are fully leafed.

40 RAY'S BASEBALL FIELD - OCTOBER 40 The trees are almost bare now, and there's a Halloween pumpkin in the front window of the house. The cornstalks

41 THE BASEBALL FIELD - LATE DECEMBER 41 it is covered with snow. 
42 INT. RAY AND ANNIE'S HOUSE 42 
Ray looks forlornly out the living room window towards his snow-covered baseball field, the merrily blinking lights of the Christmas tree behind him belying his true mood. 
56 IN THE OUTFIELD 
The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style glove, and waits to field the ball. 
57 AT HOME PLATE 57 Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat, and tries again. This time he connects. 
58 THE FIELD 58 He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it up cleanly and throws it back to the plate. Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him. 
RAY How's the field play? 
THE MAN It's good. The ball bounces true. Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps. 
RAY Hi. The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel its weight. 
RAY Ray Kinsella. 
THE MAN Joe Jackson. Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there. Finally, he can't help himself. 
RAY I bet its good to be playing again, huh? 
SHOELESS JOE It was like having part of me amputated. 
CONTINUED 
58 CONTINUED Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain his steady voice tries to conceal. 
SHOELESS JOE I've heard that old man wake up and scratch itchy legs that've been dust for fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up in the night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose and the cool of the grass on my feet. The thrill of the grass... He has found the bat he likes. 
SHOELESS JOE Can you pitch? 
RAY 
(WITH FALSE 
MODESTY) Yeah, I'm not bad. Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the rubber and faces Joe at the plate. 
RAY Don't we need a catcher? 
SHOELESS JOE Not if you can get it near the plate, we don't. Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during which he says aloud to himself: 
RAY I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson. He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the ball against the fence. Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch. Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball. 
RAY See if you can hit my curve. °He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear. 
CONTINUED 
58 CONTINUED (2) 58 
RAY Yes, he can hit the curve. 
SHOELESS JOE Stick with fast balls, kid. 
RAY You bet. Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base line. Ray is mightily impressed. 
RAY Wow. 
SHOELESS JOE Damn, this feels good. Put it right here, huh? Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance. 
RAY Right, you were a low ball hitter. 
SHOELESS JOE Oh man, I did love this game. You know, I'd have played for food money. it was the game, the sounds, the smells. You ever held a glove or a ball to your face? Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound. 
RAY Yeah. 
SHOELESS JOE And it was riding the trains from town to town. And the hotels with brass spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds in the rooms. And it was the crowd getting to their feet when the ball was hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for free. The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them. 
RAY My family. Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights.

58 CONTINUED (3) 
SHOELESS JOE What's with the lights? 
RAY "All the stadiums have them now except Wrigley Field. 
SHOELESS JOE Makes it harder to see the ball. 
RAY The owners found that more people could attend night games.

MARK (CONT'D) give you a more than a fair price and you walk away with a nest egg. 
RAY Thanks, Mark, but no. 
MARK What are you holding on to this place for? You've never even liked Iowa. You don't like farming, you don't know the first thing about it --- 
RAY Hey; I know a lot more about farming than you think. 
MARK How could you plow under your major crop? 
RAY 
(TO ANNIE) What's a crop? Karin enters breathlessly. 
KARIN Daddy, the baseball game is on. Ray beams. Karin returns the smile and reaches her arms out to be picked up. She scissors her legs around her father at belt level, hugging his neck. 
RAY Excuse us. He exits, carrying Karin. Mark shakes his head. 
MARK I don't believe this guy. I'm trying to bail him out and he goes off to watch television. Annie stifles a laugh. 
MARK He used to be so normal. 
MOTHER Does he beat you? 
ANNIE What??? 
CONTINUED 
59 CONTINUED (2) 
MARK He's drinking, right? 
ANNIE He doesn't drink, and he doesn't beat me, okay? Now I'll grant you, he has gotten me to worship Satan with him, but just a little. Her mother gasps. 
ANNIE Kidding... I'm kidding! Her family has no sense of humor about this whatsoever. 
ANNIE I think we need more cheese. She goes into the kitchen, and when she has rounded the corner, she raises her eyes to heaven and mutters: 
ANNIE Families. 
60 THE FIELD 6 0 Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three, including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.) The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five years to the game they love. Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder. 
RAY Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the pitcher gets the sign and starts to pitch. A good left fielder knows what pitch is coming, and he can tell from the.angle of the bat where the ball's going to be hit. At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches up, and the ball smacks into his glove. Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos. 
HAPPY FELSCH Showoff!

BUCK WEAVER Aw, stick it in your ear, Felsch. 
EDDIE CICOTTE Yeah, if you'd run like that against Detroit I'da won twenty games that year.

SWEDE RISBERG Hey., you guys wanna play ball, or what? 
HAPPY FELSCH .you muscle-bound jerk. 
EDDIE CICOTTE Oh yeah? At least I got muscles. 
HAPPY FELSCH No. At most you got muscles. 
BUCK WEAVER Come on, asshole, pitch! The good-natured banter stops short, and the other players glare at Weaver who looks sheepishly toward the little girl and her father in the bleachers. 
BUCK WEAVER Sorry, kid. 
KARIN It's okay! 
PLAYERS All right,'Karin! The players resume their practicing and ribbing. 
61 EXT. HOUSE 
Annie emerges with-her Mother, Mark and Dee, walking toward the bleachers where Karin and Ray are still watching the spirited practice. 
(TO RAY) See you later, Ray. 
RAY Right. See you guys. The players call their "good-byes" to Ray and head for the door in the outfield fence. Ray watches them fade out as they go through the door. Then he takes a moment to look around him. The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite beautiful. Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back toward his house. He is the very picture of contentment. Then he hears The Voice. 
THE VOICE 'Ease his pain.' Ray stops short. 
RAY What? No response. 
CONTINUED 
62 CONTINUED (2) 
RAY I'm sorry. I didn't understand. 
THE VOICE 'Ease his pain.' Ray stops short.

THE VOICE 'Ease his pain.' 
RAY Whose pain? What pain? No response. 
RAY Why me? But there is no response. 
63 INT. HOUSE 
Ray enters as Annie and Karin are putting dinner on the table. Ray plops- into his chair at the head of the table. 
ANNIE Come on, wash up. We've got a PTA meeting after dinner. They're talking about banning books again. Really subversive books like, Wizard of Oz, Diary of Anne Frank --- She notices Ray is strangely silent. 
ANNIE What happened to you? 
PAY The Voice is back. 
ANNIE Oh Lord, you don't have to build a football field now, do you?

RAY (shakes head no) He said...'Ease his pain.' 
ANNIE Ease whose pain? 
RAY I asked him. He wouldn't tell me. 
ANNIE Shoeless Joe's? 
RAY I don't think so. 
ANNIE One of the other players? 
RAY I don't think so. 
ANNIE This is a very non-specific voice you've got out there, Ray, and he's really starting to piss me off. Ray nods as Annie serves the meal in silence. 
CUT TO 
EXT. IOWA CITY PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT 64 
Parents stream in past the "PTA Meeting Tonite" sign. Ray and Annie stand by the doorway, talking with Miss Corser, Karin's teacher. (Ray is too distracted by his own thoughts to pay this much attention.) 
MISS CORSER Karin has such a wonderful imagination. Lately, she's been making up these charming little stories about ghosts who play baseball in a cornfield... wonderful imagination. 
ANNIE 
(WITH A 
MYSTERIOUS 
SMILE) Yes. She gets that from Ray. Miss Corser smiles approvingly. Ray realizes both women are looking at him, now, and he emerges from his thoughts.

ANNIE (CONT'D) here? Who wants to burn books? Who wants to piss on the Constitution of the United Sates? Anybody? The majority who had sided with the book-banner wants to vote for censorship, but under these terms just can't raise their arms. Little Annie is on a roll, now. 
ANNIE All right. Now: who's for The Bill of Rights? Come on...who thinks freedom's a pretty good thing? Let's see those hands. Some people start raising their hands. 
ANNIE Who thinks we have to stand up to the kind of censorship they have in Russia? Reluctantly, just about everyone raises their hands. Annie is thrilled. 
ANNIE There you go. All right, America! I'm proud of you. I mean it. You're beautiful! 
RAY 
(RISING) Annie, we gotta go. 
ANNIE (to the crowd) We gotta go. Ray pulls her from the room. Each is proud as hell, each for a different reason.

RAY Terence Mann. 
ANNIE What about him? 
RAY That's whose pain. 
ANNIE How do you know that? 
RAY I don't know. I just know. I was right about building the field, wasn't I? 
ANNIE What's his pain? 
RAY I don't know. 
ANNIE Then how are you supposed to ease it? 
RAY I don't know. None of this questioning has dampened Ray's pride and excitement. Annie shakes her head. 
ANNIE Ray...

A montage of Ray at the library: checking indices, reading old magazines, finding newspaper interviews on microfilm, s couring old anthologies, and taking copious notes. Some of the articles include: "Where is Terence Mann Now That We Really Need Him?". ."20 Rumors About America's Greatest Living Ex-Writer" ... and , "Terence Mann: Still Ignoring Us After All These Years ". The photographs show Mann to be a large black man with gentle eyes. 
RAY (V.O.) Annie, it's incredible. 
68 EXT. LIBRARY 
PISSED) But why do you have to go? Why can't the voice send someone else? What's wrong with Shirley MacLaine, she too busy? What does this have to do with you??? Ray hears her anger and sits her down. 
RAY That's what I need to find out. 
ANNIE Ray, we're behind on the mortgage. That field ate up our savings. We could lose the farm. 
RAY I won't even stay in motels. I'll sleep in the car, and I'll beg for food. 
ANNIE No. This is too much.- I understand your need to prove to the world you're not turning into your father, but you've done it! You believed in the magic, and it came true. Isn't that enough?

RAY Annie, it's more than that. I know this- is nuts, but there's another reason I'm supposed to do it. I feel it. I feel it as strongly as I've ever felt anything in my life. There's a reason. 
ANNIE What. Just tell me what it is. 
RAY I think something's going to happen at the game. I don't know what, but...there's something at Fenway Park in Boston, and I have to be there with Terence Mann to find it. Something he just said changes Annie's mood. 
ANNIE Fenway Park... Is that the one with the big green wall in left field? 
RAY Yeah. 
ANNIE I dreamt last night you were at Fenway. 
RAY Uh, was I sitting on the first base side? 
ANNIE Yes...

ANNIE .you take that to 93, and then it gets all squiggly, and after that you're on your own. How are you going to find him, anyway? He won't exactly be in the phone book, you know. 
RAY The article says he has a storefront on Harvard Street next to some place that sells Kosher food. Shouldn't be too hard to find. I don't need a tie, do 
I? 
ANNIE No, dear. Not for a kidnapping.

RAY So long Tiger. He get into the car and looks up at Annie. 
RAY I'll call you every night. If the team shows up while I'm gone, just tell them... (shakes his head) On second thought, stay away from them. Those guys haven't been near a woman since 1922.

RAY This isn't a cause. I don't need money, or an endorsement. 
MANN Refreshing. 
RAY You once wrote: 'There comes a time when all the cosmic tumblers have clicked into place, and the universe opens itself up for a few seconds, to show you what is possible.' 
MANN Oh my God. 
RAY What. 
MANN You're from the Sixties! 
RAY Well, actually --- 
MANN Out! Out! 
RAY Just wait a second --- Mann picks up an old-fashioned bug sprayer -- the kind with a long arm that pumps in and out -- and starts spraying it at Ray as if he were an unwanted insect. 
MANN Back to the Sixties! Back! He is backing Ray out the door. 
RAY If you'd just --- 
MANN There's no place for you here in the future! Get back while you still can! He gets Ray just past the door and slams it shut. Ray slams it open. He's pissed. 
RAY You've changed, you know that?

85 CONTINUED (2) 85 Mann stops fuming and considers that. He sighs, sadly. 
MANN Yes. I suppose I have. How's this? (smiles and makes the peace sign) 'Peace, love, dope.' 
(ROARS) Now get the fuck out of here!!! And he slams the door shut again. Ray is flabbergasted. He is thinking furiously. Then he notices that in slamming the door, the latch has not locked in place. He thinks, makes up his mind, and quietly opens the door. Mann has returned to work, his back to the door. Ray enters the loft, his left hand in his jacket pocket. When he is halfway across the loft, he clears his throat. Mann spins around. 
MANN Now you've pissed me off. 
RAY Okay, hold it right there. He juts his pocketed hand forward, as if he had a gun in his jacket. 
RAY I was hoping I wouldn't have to do it this way... 
MANN What the fuck is that? 
RAY It's a gun. What'd you think it is? 
MANN It's your finger. 
RAY No it's not. It's a gun. 
MANN Yeah? Let me see it. 
RAY Get out of here, I'm not going to show you my gun. Mann sighs, and stands. 
CONTINUED 
85 CONTINUED (3) 
RAY Now look. I'm not going to hurt you, I just need you to go with me for a little while, then -- what are you doing? Mann has found a crowbar among his tools, and is advancing toward Ray. 
MANN I'm going to beat you with a crowbar till you go away. Understandably, this makes Ray nervous. 
RAY Whoa! Wait! You can't do that. 
MANN 
(STILL ADVANCING) What, are there rules? There's no rules. Mann is almost to him, now, the crowbar raised above his head. 
RAY You're a pacifist! Mann stops. He thinks. He lowers the crowbar. 
MANN Shit. Ray breathes a sigh of relief. 
RAY Thank you. 
MANN All right, are you kidnapping me? What's the deal here? 
RAY I'm sorry. I was hoping I could-just convince you to come with me. 
MANN No, I never slept with her. 
RAY You never slept with who? 
MANN Whoever you were going to ask me about. If I'd been with one-tenth the famous women they said I was with, I'd be in formaldehyde by now. 
RAY 
(INTERESTED) You slept with a lot of famous women? 
MANN 
(SOURLY) What's your question? 
RAY How'd you get a name like Terence? Mann cannot believe that's the question. 
MANN Rastus was taken. 
CONTINUED 
86 CONTINUED (2) 
Ray knows now to shut up. He returns his attention to his driving, glances up to his rearview mirror, and sees something that causes his eyes to widen in horror. 
87 REAR-VIEW MIRROR 
A Boston police car on his tail, red lights flashing. 
RAY (O.S.) Oh no. 
88 INT. RAY'S CAR 88 
Mann looks behind him, sees the police car, and turns back to Ray. Ray wears a look of resignation as he pulls the car over to the side of the road, and shuts off the ignition. Mann just looks at him, and starts to chuckle. 
MANN Nice going, Boze. 
RAY Okay. I don't really have a gun. So don't say anything to this guy, okay? I swear to God there's a reason we're supposed to be at this game. Mann gives him a "Give me a break" look. Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and walking towards them. Ray is desperate. 
RAY If I get arrested, the press'll be all over you, you'll have to appear in open court, you'll be the lead story on Entertainment Tonight, and your picture'll be on the front page of every tabloid in America. The Policeman knocks on Ray's window. He is young, fresh-scrubbed and earnest. Ray holds up one hand to him. 
RAY Just a second. 
(-CO MANN) 'Terence-Mann Kidnapped... Also seen in UFO with Elvis.' Mann's eyes narrow. The cop knocks again, more insistently. Ray rolls down-the window." 
CONTINUED' 
88 CONTINUED 
RAY Sorry. 
POLICEMAN License and registration. Nervously, Ray complies. Mann turns his face toward the passenger side window. Ray's mouth dries up. He has no idea what Mann will do. The Policeman scrutinizes the license, turns it over to look for convictions, and checks Ray's face against the felonlike photo. Then he looks at Mann. 
POLICEMAN And what's your name,-sir? Mann keeps his face averted. 
MANN Terry. 
POLICEMAN Where is it that you and Raymond are going, Terry? 
RAY Fenway Park! We're going to the ball game. 
MANN (turns to cop) Actually, Officer, I'm being kidnapped. Discreetly, under his breath, Ray sings the "Entertainment Tonight" theme song. 
RAY 'Entertainment Tonight, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo... Mann winces. The officer looks at him questioningly. 
MANN, What I mean by that is, I don't care much for baseball, but Raymond insisted. 
POLICEMAN Yeah, I hate baseball. (hands Ray back 
HIS ID) Your right taillight is out, Raymond. I want you to get it fixed at the first opportunity. 
CONTINUED 
88 CONTINUED (2) 
RAY Yes. I will. Thank you. The Policeman walks away, and Ray heaves a sigh of relief. 
RAY 'Terry?' 
MANN 'Raymond?' 
RAY Ray. My...hostages call me Ray. Can I call you Terry? Sourly, Mann nods. Ray smiles and drives off. 
91 CONTINUED (2) 
Ray nods. Mann is making sense. 
MANN They'd bleed me dry. 
92 SECTION SEVENTEEN 
Ray and Mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the aisle toward the field. 
RAY God, this place is so beautiful. The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice; a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage as one player hits to several others in the field. A few sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts. Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk. 
RAY It could be 1912 out there, for all this place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on that very mound as a pitcher long before anyone knew he could hit home runs. Same mound. 
MANN Why are we here, Ray? 
RAY Something.. about the game. 
CUT TO 
93 THE GAME - NIGHT 
The game is in progress. Ray and Mann are in their fifth row seats. They do not speak. At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard. 
94 THE SCOREBOARD 94 Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant replays of some of the action. 
CONTINUED 
94 CONTINUED 
Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the crowd fade out. There is only the message: 
ARCHIBALD "MOONLIGHT" GRAHAM Chisholm, Minn. New York Giants 
LIFETIME STATISTICS: 1 Game, 0 At Bats The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard. 
95 RAY AND MANN 
Ray looks around him. The sounds of the game return, and from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this, but cannot see what Ray is writing. Then Ray hears The Voice. 
THE VOICE 'Go the distance.' 
RAY Oh my God. 
MANN What's the matter? 
RAY Nothing. 
MANN You okay? Ray sighs. 
RAY Yeah. 
;THEN) Whenever you wanttogo,wecan go. 
CONTINUED 
95 CONTINUED 
MANN What??? 
RAY If you want to go, we can go. Mann looks at Ray curiously, trying to read this new attitude. 
MANN Then let's go. Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham, who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark. 
CUT TO 
96 THE RIDE BACK TO BOSTON 96 It is nighttime, and Mann drives. Ray slumps, dozing, troubled. Mann looks curiously at Ray, but says nothing. They ride in silence. 
CUT TO 
97 MANN'S STREET - NIGHT 
The street is blue with moonlight as they park in front of the storefront. 
MANN Where are you goingfrom here? 
RAY Home. 
MANN What is it you're not telling me? 
RAY (shakes head no) I've taken up too much of your time. Mann gets out of the car. 
Ray is using the pay phone on the wall of the office, while the car is being gassed. 
ANNIE (V.0.) 
(PHONE; FILTERED) Uh, fine. 
RAY Hey, guess what? Terence Mann is with me. We're going to Minnesota together. 
ANNIE (V.0.) 
(PHONE; FILTERED) Are you kidding me? Oh, Ray, that's unbelievable! 
RAY I know. I gotta go. Hug Karin for me. I love you. 
ANNIE (V.O.) 
(PHONE; FILTERED) I love you too. You guys behave yourselves. Hurry home.

Ray smiles and hangs up. 
CUT TO 
101 ANNIE'S KITCHEN 
She hangs up, and loses her smile as she turns back to the kitchen table, where her brother Mark sits with two men in business suits. 
MARK Why didn't you tell him? 
ANNIE For the same reason I've never pissed on your birthday cake. 
MARK Annie, you don't have a choice in the matter. Annie looks vertroubldye. 
CUT TO 
102 ON THE ROAD - MINNESOTA 
They are north of Duluth,andthelandscape hasgrown harsher, the trees shorterandmore gnarled, thegrass tougher and wirier. After Virginia, Minnesota, all the land is scarred. Above the town the mines sit like sand-colored bunkers in the cliffs,- stern and silent. Near Chisholm, the land is getting ever weirder. It looks like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs. It has been split and gutted; greenery has grown back, but at weird and unnatural angles. But as they swing into town; the highway divides and they cross a beautiful and tranquil lake, so smooth and shiny it might be a scene painted on a glass plate. A sign reads 
WELCOME TO CHISHOLM. 
103 CHISHOLM, MINNESOTA 
Ray and Mann have parked on the main street next to a corner phone booth. Ray is flipping through the thin phone book attached to the booth by a chain. 
CONTINUED 
103 CONTINUED 
RAY Half a dozen Grahams...no Archibald, no Moonlight. 
MANN Follow me. 
CUT TO 
104 EXT. CHISHOLM FREE PRESS 
The local newspaper is located in a small storefront that was probably once a confectioners or a dry-goods store. 
105 INT. CHISHOLM FREE PRESS 
Ray and Mann are talking with the paper's publisher, Veda Ponikvar, a handsome woman in her sixties, with a sweet, innocent smile, and eyeglasses hanging from a fine chain around her neck. 
MANN We're trying to find an ex-baseball player named Archibald Graham. 
VEDA You mean 'Doc' Graham. 
RAY No, I think his nickname was 'Moonlight.' 
VEDA Yes, that's Doctor Graham. 
MANN Doctor Graham. This is interesting news to Ray and Mann. 
VEDA His baseball career never amounted to much, so he went back to school. His father was a doctor. 
MANN Do you know where we can find him? 
RAY It's nothing bad. We're not from the IRS, or anything --- 
CONTINUED 
124 CONTINUED (3) 
RAY There is a place where things like that happen. And if you want to go there, I can take you. Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed smile as he wipes away a tear. 
DOC GRAHAM If it means leaving Chisholm... He shakes his head.no. Ray is surprised. 
RAY I understand, but I think you're supposed to come with us. 
DOC GRAHAM This is my most special place in the world, Ray. Once a place touches you like this, the wind never blows so cold again. You feel for it like it was your child. I can't leave here. Ray cannot believe the man won't leave Chisholm for his dream. 
RAY But your wish... 
DOC GRAHAM It'll stay one. I was born here, lived here, and I'll die here. That's okay. I'll have no regrets. 
RAY But sixty-five years ago -- for five minutes -- you came this close. (holds up two 
FINGERS) It would kill some men to get that close to their dream and never touch it. They'd consider it a tragedy. 
DOC GRAHAM Son...if I'd only gotten to be a doctor for five minutes. .now that would have been a tragedy. Those words fill up the room, and Ray sinks back against the couch. 
CONTINUED 
124 CONTINUED (4) 
DOC GRAHAM Well, I'd better get home before Alicia starts to thinking I've got a girlfriend. And Doc Graham smiles at him. 
RAY (V.0.) And he smiled. 
CUT TO 
125 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 125 
It is later that same night, and Ray has been recounting his experience with Doc Graham to Mann, who appears quietly troubled. 
RAY And then I figured maybe we're not supposed to take him with us. So now I don't know why the hell we were supposed to come here. 
MANN Maybe it was to find out if one inning can change the world. 
RAY Did it? 
MANN It did for these people. If he'd gotten a hit, he might've stayed there. 
(THEN) Your wife called before. She wants you to call her tonight. 
CUT TO 
126 INT.RAY AND ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 126 
Annie is asleep. The phone rings, and the speed with which she picks it up suggests that her anxiety to get this phone call prevented her from sleeping very deeply. 
CONTINUED 
126 CONTINUED 126 
ANNIE Ray. 
(PAUSE) I asked the bank if we could miss a payment or two, and they told me they'd just sold the note on the farm to Mark and his partners. So they own the paper now, and he says if we don't sell to them, they'll foreclose. Ray, we don't have the money. 
127 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 127 
Ray holds the phone, pained. 
RAY Okay, look. They can't foreclose for thirty days, or something like that. I've got to take Terry back to Boston first, so it'll be --- 
MANN No. Ray looks over at Mann. 
MANN I'm going to Iowa with you. 
RAY We're coming home.- 
CUT TO 
128 ON THE ROAD - MORNING 128 Ray drives with purpose and speed. Mann looks relaxed. 
MANN Hell, I couldn't quit now. I've got see this ballpark. 
RAY Not everybody can see it. You might not. 
MANN I'll give it a try. As they turn onto the highway near the lake, a Teenager with a dufflebag appears on the side of the road, his arm raised in. a hitchhiker's stance. Ray pulls the car over to the side of the road. 
130 POINT OF VIEW 
Something down the road, in the midst of all this flat farmland, is glowing in the night. It is an illuminated baseball diamond in a cornfield. 
131 RAY AND ANNIE'S FARM - NIGHT Ray turns the Datsun into the long driveway and, with a rumble, crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock from escaping to the roadway. He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as the three men unfold themselves from the car, Karin bolts from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and pink pedal pushers. She flings herself into Ray's arms, and hugs his neck in unrestrained joy. 
KARIN Daddy! Then Annie appears too. They kiss while Mann and Archie wait to be introduced. Finally, Mann clears his throat. 
RAY 
( (BEAMING) Karin, Annie... This is Terence Mann 
MANN Terry. 
KARIN Hiya Terry. Annie steps forward, wining some curls from her eyes with ahand that has recently been immersed in flour'. She smiles, wipes the hand on the thigh of her jeans, and shakes his hand. 
ANNIE Welcome. 
MANN Thank you. 
RAY And this young fellow is Moon -- uh, Archie Graham. Karin and Annie shake his hand. 
RAY He's come to practice with the team. 
CONTINUED 
131 CONTINUED 
ANNIE He'll be able to do more than just practice. 
RAY What does that mean? 
ANNIE Come on. They walk towards the field. 
ANNIE Let's enjoy this place while we still have it. 
132 EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT 
Ray and Annie walk silently with their arms around each other as they lead Mann, Archie and Karin to the bleachers. Mann's eyes widen as several of the players shout greetings to Ray. 
SHOELESS JOE Hi, Ray, welcome back. 
RAY Thanks, Joe. Good to see you. 
MANN Oh my Lord. 
RAY What. 
MANN That's Shoeless Joe Jackson! 
RAY Well of course it is. 
MANN I've seen pictures. Those are the White Sox! 
RAY You mean you still didn't believe me? 
MANN I thought I did, but... Oh my Lord. They have reached the foul line where Shoeless Joe waits for them. 
CONTINUED 
132 CONTINUED 
RAY Terry, I'd like you to meet Joe Jackson. Joe, this is Terry Mann. Mann and Jackson shake hands. 
MANN It's a pleasure to meet you. 
SHOELESS JOE Pleasure's mine. 
(TO RAY) Ray, I hope you don't mind, but we got tired of just having practices, so we brought another team out with us so we could have some real games. He points to the visitors' bench, and, indeed, there are a dozen or so more old-time baseball players in old-time baseball uniforms. 
RAY I don't mind. Where'd they come from? 
SHOELESS JOE 
(CHUCKLES) Where'd we come from. Man, you wouldn't believe how many guys wanted to play here. We had to beat 'em off with a stick. 
ARCHIE 
(FROM THE 
BLEACHERS) Hey, that's Mel Ott. And Carl Hubbell. Those are the New York Giants! 
134 CONTINUED 
CHICK GANDIL We sleep. 
HAPPY FELSCH And wait. 
SHOELESS JOE We dream. 
RAY You can't leave the field any other way, can you? 
SHOELESS JOE Not if we want to come back. 
RAY I'd love to go with you sometime. The silence that follows is long and ominous. 
RAY I'd like to see what's out there. There is still no response. 
RAY I'll take that as a no for now. He spots Archie jogging off the field. 
RAY Hey, slugger, congratulations! Archie jogs over. 
ARCHIE Thanks. I can't stop shaking I'm so happy. 'Course, I would've liked a base hit... 
KARIN But you got a RBI! 
ARCHIE I sure did, didn't I? 
SHOELESS JOE 
(YELLS BACK) A rookie's luck! They all laugh at that. 
RAY Well come on, this calls for a drink. 
CONTINUED 
134 CONTINUED (2) 
Archie hesitates. 
ARCHIE I can't. I'm... He motions with his head toward the other players disappearing through the outfield door. Ray nods understandingly. 
RAY Good game, Archie. 
ARCHIE Thanks. 
MANN Good night, kid. Ray, Karin, Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the rest of the players. When he reaches the fence, he turns back to them. 
ARCHIE Mr. Kinsella? Ray turns toward him. Archie looks as if he knows more than he's saying. 
ARCHIE Thank you for bringing me here. I couldn't have wished for anything more. Ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than just a teenager's pleasure. But he decides not to ask any questions. 
RAY I know. You're welcome. Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes.

135 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Mann and Karin eat their country breakfasts at one and of the table, while at the other end, Annie and Ray sit in front of the bank books, ledgers, and the sheaf of bills puffed up around the paper spike. 
ANNIE Once we fell behind in the payments, the full amount of the mortgage became due. 
CONTINUED 
135 CONTINUED 
RAY And they own the paper, so they have the legal right to foreclose. 
ANNIE Unless we sell. 
RAY Either way we lose the farm. Maybe we can make it a condition of the sale that they keep the field up. 
ANNIE Forget it. They're buying up single farms all around us, make it one big farm. First thing they'll do is plow under your field. Ray just sits there, letting that sink in. 
CUT TO 
136 EXT. FARM - DAY 
Ray and Mann walking. 
MANN I don't have a lot of money, Ray, but maybe I could pitch in a little. 
RAY Fine. You can put in twenty bucks for groceries. 
MANN How long? 
RA Y Its a twenty-minute drive. Mann winces. He knows that could be fatal. Ray kneels by Karin. Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped by the fall. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across her cheek and down her neck. She is becoming bluer and her cough is faint, as though she is in another room. 
CONTINUED 
147 CONTINUED 
Mark takes off his $300 pale-green velvet corduroy jacket and is wordlessly holding it out to Ray. Ray takes the jacket and covers Karin gently. Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more strained and distant. 
RAY Karin... Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field. The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham. 
148 ARCHIE GRAHAM 
has noticed the'commotion in the bleachers, and he starts to lope across the field. 
149 BLEACHERS 
Annie has pulled the car over and honks. Ray holds up his hand to her to wait. His eyes are on young Archie Graham. 
150 YOUNG ARCHIE GRAHAM 
As Graham gets closer, his features begin to change, and his step slows. He reaches the end of the fence -- around which no player can pass -- and when he emerges from the shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago...but Doc Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota. His baseball glove has turned into a black doctor's bag. 
151 THE BLEACHERS 
as Doc Graham approaches. 
DOC GRAHAM What have we got here? 
RAY She fell. Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong. 
DOC GRAHAM This child's choking to death. 
CONTINUED 
151 CONTINUED 
He picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand, he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder blades with the heel of his other hand. Annie honks again. Ray waves her to him. Mark cannot believe what he is seeing. Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air. Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a sizable piece of hog dog and bun. As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a few seconds, and lets the eye close. 
DCC GRAHAM She's okay. I don't think the fall really hurt her, just the dog in her throat. She'll be coming around in a minute or two. 
RAY 
(SIGHS DEEPLY) Thank you, Doc. Doc looks deeply into Ray's eyes. 
DOC GRAHAM No, son. Thank you. It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed to save the child. Ray looks to the field, and then back at the Doctor. 
RAY 'Oh, my God, you can't go back. 
DOC GRAHAM It's okay... 
(NODS KNOWINGLY) It's okay. 
152 MARK AND ANNIE 
Mark is slack-jawed. He has seen something magical happen and cannot explain it. 
MARK I saw...A11 of a sudden this kid runs off the field and turns.into...

He looks questioningly at Annie. She smiles reassuringly. 
ANNIE There's hope for you yet, Mark. 
153 RAY AND DOC GRAHAM 
Doc Graham stands, and picks up his black bag. 
DOC GRAHAM Well, I best be getting back home before Alicia starts to thinking I've got a girlfriend. He walks around the edge of the fence, and heads for the outfield door. The players respectfully make way for him. 
HAPPY FELSCH Good work, Doc. 
EDDIE CICOTTE Way to go, Doc. 
DOC GRAHAM Thanks, boys. Win one for me, someday, will you? He passes them. 
SHOELESS JOE Hev rookie! Doc Graham turns. 
RAY 
(NODS) Out. 
ANNIE 
(HUMS TWILIGHT 
ZONE THEME) Doo-doo-doo-doo. Be careful. She smiles brightly and gives Mann a kiss on the cheek. Mann shakes Ray's hand. 
RAY-- I want a full description. 
MANN -You take care of this family, Ray. Mann joins several of the White Sox as they leave the field. 
155 MARK 
is absolutely dumbfounded as'he sees the players fade out upon walking through the outfield gate. He turns to Annie. 
MARK He just... Where'd he...? 
CONTINUED 
15.5 CONTINUED 
ANNIE You go inside and lie down. I'll explain later. Mark walks off toward the people in their cars outside the house. 
MARK Where'd all these people come from...? 
156 BACK AT THE FIELD 
Only a few players are left on the field. 
RAY We're keeping this field. 
ANNIE You bet your ass we are. Ray realizes Shoeless Joe is staring at him, with a shit-eating grin on his face. 
RAY What.. Shoeless Joe just keeps smiling. 
RAY What're you grinning at, you ghost? 
SHOELESS JOE 'If you build it... He nods toward where the catcher is taking off his gear at home plate. 
SHOELESS JOE ' .he will come.' Ray looks at the Catcher. The hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand up. 
RAY Oh, my God. 
ANNIE What is it? 
RAY Its my father. 
157 THE YOUNG CATCHER has taken off his mask. He is in his early twenties. He is in the same pose as the photo we saw in the prologue. 
158 RAY AND SHOELESS JOE Ray blanches and turns to Shoeless Joe, his voice a strangled whisper. 
RAY Say it ain't so,- Joe. 
SHOELESS JOE I'm afraid it is, kid. The Catcher is now walking toward Ray. 
RAY 
(FINALLY 
UNDERSTANDING) 'Ease his pain...' 
SHOELESS JOE (smiles and nods) 'Go the distance.' When he says those words, Shoeless Joe sounds just like The Voice. 
RAY It was you. 
159 SHOELESS JOE 
SHOELESS JOE No, Ray. It was you. Shoeless joe winks and walks away, disappearing through the door in the outfield fence. 
160 RAY AND ANNIE 
The Catcher is halfway across the field. Ray turns to Annie. He cannot even swallow. 
RAY My God, I only saw him later, when he was worn down by life. Look at him. The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass. Ray walks down to the edge of the outfield.

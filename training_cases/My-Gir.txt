Setting: MADISON, PENNSYLVANIA 1972 
CLOSE UP OF VADA 
VADA (to camera) I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction. (to Harry) Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying. 
HARRY (ignoring Vada) O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge. 
FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE 
Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group of boys 
VADA All right, who's in raise your hand. 
All the boys raise their hands except Thomas J 
BOY Are you coming or not Thomas J? 
THOMAS J I don't think so. 
VADA I knew he wouldn't come. 
THOMAS J I can't, I have to go home. 
BOY#2 Yeah, to play with his DOLLS. 
VADA Leave him alone! Come on, let's go. 
Group of boys enters house lead by Vada 
Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped 
VADA (to boy#2) Hey, you didn't pay me! 
BOY#2 How do I know you were gonna show us one? 
VADA You're such a baby. 
BOY#2 All right, here. 
Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it to Vada 
VADA All right, follow me and don't say a word. 
They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns around 
You ready? 
They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the coffin in the middle of the room 
You sure you wanna see it, or is someone gonna go yellow belly? 
BOY#3 I'm not chicken! 
VADA Okay. Lean forward. 
A tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and the boys gasp as they look inside 
GIRL#1 It's empty! 
SHELLY Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common. 
HARRY You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone. 
SHELLY Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal. 
HARRY Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the.... 
SHELLY I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks. 
Harry and Vada exchange weird looks 
OUTSIDE SHOPPING MALL-AREA DAY 
Vada and Thomas J are riding their bikes through town 
THOMAS J Hey look at this, no feet! 
VADA Oh wow, a real evil canieval. 
Vada and Thomas J ride up through a garage 
PSYCHO MECHANIC WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY GARAGE, GET OUTTA HERE!!! 
Vada and Thomas J arrive outside the entrance to the Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room 
INSIDE DOCTOR WELTY'S WAITING ROOM 
NURSE RANDALL Hi Vada, what's wrong today? 
VADA I'm very sick. 
NURSE RANDALL Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor can see you. 
She picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the doctor 
NURSE RANDALL Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in? 
Vada opens door to doctors surgery and enters 
OVER DR WELTY'S SHOULDER, CLOSE UP OF VADA HAVING HER EAR EXAMINED 
VADA Well, what is it? I can handle it. 
DR WELTY You are perfectly healthy. 
VADA That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms. 
DR WELTY Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today? 
VADA Yes. 
DR WELTY Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you! 
Vada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door, stopping and says with condescending intonation... 
VADA I'll just have to get a second opinion. 
OUTSIDE DOCTORS SURGERY DAY 
Vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike 
THOMAS J So, what'd he say was wrong with you? 
Vada is turning and beginning to ride away 
SIDE ON SHOT OF VADA AND THOMAS J RIDING DOWN STREET, CAMERA IS MOVING WITH THEM 
THOMAS J Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some peaches? 
VADA No, I'm going home. 
THOMAS J Why? It's not dinner time yet. 
VADA Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat. 
Vada accelerates leaving Thomas J in her tracks 
Don't pee on the hydrant!! 
VADA'S BEDROOM 
Vada puts a record on to play. (song is "Wedding Bell Blues") She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph, with Mr. Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape. Music begins to play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking at the photo longingly 
SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON THE FLOOR SPRAWLED OUT, HARRY AND PHIL ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION, AND GRAMMOO IS SITTING STARING INTO SPACE, SHELLY ENTERS 
SHELLY Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's hair. He kinda looked...... (she sees Vada lying down sprawled out on the floor) Harry, what's wrong with her?? 
HARRY Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli! 
Shelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada 
VADA (very sick sounding voice) I think it's my prostate. 
All of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing 
GRAMMOO I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in green pastures, I got my man, who could ask for anything more? 
As this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a VERY weird expression, this is too much for her 
OUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J SITTING ON STEPS DAY 
Shelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then crouches down beside Vada and Thomas J 
SHELLY Who's winning? 
VADA I am. 
As Vada and Thomas J continue to play, three Vada-aged girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway 
GIRL#1 Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND (very mocking voice) 
VADA He is not my boyfriend! 
GIRL#2 I bet she kissed him on the lips! 
VADA Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing? 
THOMAS J Yeah anyway. 
GIRL#2 Come on let's go. 
GIRL#1 & GIRL#2 Judy's father owns the movie theater and we get to see all the movies WE want for free. 
JUDY Maybe you can come some time. 
GUY#2 Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to bring her boyfriend. 
The two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends 
GIRL#2 (together) Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S- I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage. 
VADA Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer. 
HARRY Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist. 
Harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the TV screen 
VADA Dad? 
HARRY (referring to TV) I love this guy! (he laughs) 
VADA Dad?? 
HARRY What? 
VADA The money? 
HARRY Ahh, maybe next summer. 
VADA'S THOUGHTS He forgot about the time I wanted to be a magician, I was really great at making myself disappear. 
FOYER OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA BOUNCING BASKET-BALL, ARTHUR ENTERS 
VADA Wanna play? 
ARTHUR No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me. 
Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a demonstration 
See. You were looking at the ball. All right? Keep your head up. Gimme some skin, 
They both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands, Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the basement 
SCARY MUSIC 
Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy- diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on the step 
SHELLY Vada? VADA?? What happened?? 
VADA (extremely frightened and timid) My ball, I lost my ball. 
SHELLY (picking Vada up onto her feet) Come on sweetie. 
The two exit the scene 
SHELLY PUTTING MAKEUP ON DEAD LADY, BASEMENT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE 
SHELLY Excuse me Harry? 
HARRY Uh huh? 
SHELLY Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter? 
HARRY Yeah. 
Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed 
Didn't I give you a picture of what she looked like? 
SHELLY Yeah, (searches pockets, eventually pulling out a photo) 
Harry compares photo with Mrs. Porter's face 
SHELLY You don't like it? 
HARRY This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker. 
Shelly notices Vada reading the book 
SHELLY Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a little too old for you. 
She takes the book away from her 
VADA Did you read ALL these books? 
SHELLY Uh huh. 
VADA What are they about? 
SHELLY Mostly love, and romance. 
THOMAS J Eeeeuuuww, gross. 
SHELLY They're just fun to read. 
Shelly hands the soda around 
Here, cheers. 
Everybody takes a mouthful of drink 
VADA Are you married? 
SHELLY No, I'm divorced. 
VADA Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced. 
SHELLY Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other. 
THOMAS J Mine aren't divorced. 
Thomas J gets up and reaches for the cookie jar 
Shelly, can I have a cookie? 
SHELLY With bottle of soda in mouth Hmmmph gurgle gurgle... 
Thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination 
THOMAS J Hey, where are all the cookies?? 
Vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows she has an idea 
SHELLY Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place. 
THOMAS J What are you saving for? 
SHELLY Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day. 
Cuckoo clock goes "Cuckoo." Lunch time, 12 o'clock 
THOMAS J I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch, thanks Shelly. 
Thomas J leaves 
SHELLY Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back? 
VADA Can I use your bathroom first? 
SHELLY Sure. 
VADA You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late. 
OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, THEN INSIDE ON SHELLY AT DESK, TUBA IS BEING PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND 
Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and proceeds to the living room 
Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a tune to Grammoo on his tuba 
HARRY (sung, to Grammoo) Can not do without, Harry's wild about me. 
SHELLY Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up. 
HARRY Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh. 
SHELLY I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much. 
HARRY After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though. 
SHELLY I'm sure she will. 
VADA AND THOMAS J AT THEIR FAVORITE SPOT, EDGE OF LAKE WITH VERY LARGE BEAUTIFUL WEEPING WILLOW JUST UP THE BANK A LITTLE FROM A SMALL PIER WHERE TWO FISHING POLES ARE SET UP, ONE HELD BY VADA AND THE OTHER BY A HOLDER AS THOMAS J HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE TREE 
THOMAS J Nothing's biting today. 
VADA Maybe they had a big breakfast. 
THOMAS J (hanging from tree) I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up. 
VADA Big deal, I can do that too. (Thomas J's reel begins to click) Thomas J, you got something! 
THOMAS J Oh no! (he jumps down from the tree) UUH. 
VADA Hurry! 
THOMAS J I'm trying. 
VADA Reel it in. (Thomas J reels the fish in) He's only tiny, throw him back. 
THOMAS J I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it? 
Thomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls 
VADA You're hurting him, don't kill him!! 
The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier 
Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor error in film} and in the process pricks herself 
VADA Ouch! Darn hook! 
Vada puts the fish back 
VADA I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look. 
Thomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of the water 
THOMAS J Yeah he got away. Come on let's go. 
VADA Hey, we can become blood brothers. 
THOMAS J Naah, I don't wanna. 
VADA You could pick that scab on your arm. 
THOMAS J It's a mosquito bite. 
VADA It'll bleed. 
HARRY Oh come on. 
PHIL Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry. 
HARRY Are you sure about all this? 
PHIL Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh? 
HARRY Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute. 
PHIL Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track. 
HARRY No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look? 
PHIL Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em. 
Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way 
HARRY Goodnight Vada. 
VADA Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo? 
HARRY Ahh, I just wanna look nice. 
VADA You never cared before. 
HARRY Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together. 
VADA Why? 
HARRY She likes to play bingo. 
VADA Can I go too? 
HARRY Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company. 
Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out the door 
OUTSIDE THE SENNET'S HOUSE, VADA IS CREEPING ALONG NIGHT 
Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does 
THOMAS J Vada? Vada?? Where are you?? 
Vada springs up from her hiding place 
VADA Here. 
THOMAS J Don't DO that!! 
VADA Sorry. 
THOMAS J What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here. 
VADA Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight. 
THOMAS J I told you i'll get in trouble. 
VADA Pacifist! 
THOMAS J I am not. 
VADA Bed wetter! 
THOMAS J I stopped that! 
VADA (in semi-deep fake voice) BINGO! 
BINGO ANNOUNCER We have a winner. Will the winner please raise their hand? 
CARL There was no bingo, it came from outside. 
VERNON How could someone outside get a bingo? 
CARL Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone outside yelled bingo you moron! 
VERNON Who are you calling a mowon? (false teeth) 
VERNON'S WIFE Put a lid on it Vernon! 
CARL Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!! 
The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break it up 
HARRY Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game. 
Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing 
OUTSIDE 
VADA We can go now. 
Vada and Thomas J run off down the street 
VADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING 
As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her window and looks out it through the venetian blinds 
OUTSIDE STOPPED CAR 
Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, eventually 
SHELLY I had a good time tonight. 
HARRY I haven't had a bingo partner in ages. 
They walk up to Shelly's camper 
SHELLY Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute. 
HARRY Okay, sure. 
They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room 
INSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER 
SHELLY Home sweet home. 
HARRY It's nice. 
SHELLY I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces. 
HARRY Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems. 
SHELLY You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush. 
Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the bathroom, and then flushes the toilet 
HARRY Yeah. 
SHELLY Are you mad at me? 
HARRY Goodnight Shelly. 
SHELLY Goodnight. 
Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the door 
OUTSIDE CAMPER NIGHT, HARRY HAS JUST GOT OUT OF SHELLY'S CAMPER 
SHELLY Well, I guess it's official we had a date, maybe we can play bingo again sometime. 
HARRY I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours. 
SHELLY Goodnight. 
Harry waves 
VADA'S ROOM 
Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed 
SUMMER WRITING CLASS DAY 
MR. BIXLER Before the class started, Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation. 
WOMAN Ooooh that's really cool. 
JUSTIN Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes out into the group. 
Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play weird music 
RONDA Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. Relax your muscles and take deep breaths. 
JUSTIN Now, try to feel what the other person is feeling, without speaking any words, send out your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at the same time. Can you feel it? 
RONDA Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody feel? 
GUY I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength. 
OTHER GUY I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, she's so cosmically in tune. 
RONDA So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, and I felt like, you were full of inner peace and harmony. 
MR. BIXLER Vada, what did you feel. 
VADA I felt Justin's hangnail. 
JUSTIN No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, feel my aura. 
VADA I don't think I'm allowed to. 
JUSTIN I tell you what, let's try it again, hold hands. 
VADA'S THOUGHTS Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. It got infected and traveled to her vocal chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't think Grammoo thought it was insignificant. 
VADA'S ROOM, VADA LYING ON BED THINKING 
Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual healing 
SUPERMARKET DAY, VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING 
HARRY Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce. 
Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out 
SHELLY Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada. 
Vada backs off, followed by Shelly 
THE TWO MEN THAT GOT OUT OF THE CAR ARE PROCEEDING UP THE SULTENFUSS' DRIVEWAY 
FOCUS ON PHIL, HARRY, VADA, SHELLY AND GRAMMOO AT THE TABLE OUTSIDE, SHELLY SAYS A SEMI-GRACE 
SHELLY Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God. 
HARRY I'll second that. 
VADA Hey Shelly, like seafood? 
SHELLY Uh huh, why? 
VADA See food! 
Vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed BBQ cuisine to Shelly 
SHELLY (laughing) That's attractive. 
Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing looking around 
SHELLY (under her breath) Oh shit! Excuse me... 
Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space 
MAN Hey Shelly, who lives here? (pointing at hearse) The Addams Family? 
SHELLY Danny, what are you doing here? 
DANNY What am I doing here????? What am I doing here? 
SHELLY (to other man in background) Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here? 
DANNY You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home. 
Scene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment 
PHIL These two people do not have a good relationship. 
SHELLY (in background) No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it... 
Scene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing 
SHELLY I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine. 
DANNY Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be "OUR MUTUAL ASSET", not "Shelly's recreational vehicle". Gimme the keys. 
SHELLY Keep your voice down! 
DANNY What? 
SHELLY The boss is watching us... 
DANNY (sarcastic) I'm impressed. 
SHELLY God I guess i'll have to introduce you now. 
DANNY Yeah, all right... 
Shelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind 
SHELLY (Talking to Danny, pointing at the people respectively) This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss... 
DANNY Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break. 
RALPH WHY?? 
HARRY Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front yard. 
Ralph looks rather disturbed by this 
FOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL, VADA STILL GAPING 
PHIL (quiet voice, to Vada) Your father is a savage. 
Vada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods 
ROAD IN FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, DANNY AND RALPH IN CAR, SHELLY LEANING OVER WITH HER HEAD IN WINDOW NIGHT 
SHELLY Bye Ralph. 
The car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly waves 
SHELLY (to Harry) Well, you were pretty great! 
HARRY Is it really your camper? 
Shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting "sort of" 
Suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks 
SHELLY Can we see it from the back yard? 
HARRY You can get the general idea... 
They move off to the back yard... 
HARRY Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year... 
SHELLY Pointing upwards Look... 
HARRY Did you ahh, love him? 
SHELLY I would never marry anybody I didn't love. 
VADA AND PHIL SITTING ON SEAT-SWING WATCHING FIREWORKS 
VADA He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life. 
PHIL He likes her. 
VADA Does he love her? 
PHIL Probably. 
VADA Do you like her? 
PHIL Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father. 
VADA Why? 
PHIL After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny. 
VADA Really? 
PHIL Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry. 
VADA My Dad was funny? 
PHIL Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh. 
Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down the stairs 
FOREST DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE RUNNING THROUGH IT FIRING THEIR WATER GUNS AT EACH OTHER AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER, HAVING FUN 
Suddenly Thomas J stops in his tracks 
THOMAS J Woah!! 
VADA What? 
THOMAS J Pointing There's a beehive right there! 
VADA So? 
THOMAS J Stand back. 
Thomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and begins to squirt the beehive 
VADA Are you crazy, you'll get stung!! 
THOMAS J You're right, let's knock it down. 
VADA What do you want it for anyway? 
THOMAS J For their meat. 
The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets damaged and eventually falls to the ground 
THOMAS J Got it! 
VADA My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it! 
They begin to search for Vada's mood ring 
Suddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas J notices in time 
THOMAS J They're alive!! Run for your life!!! 
Vada just stands there looking, Thomas J comes back and grabs her arm, this wakes her up and they begin to run 
THOMAS J Run faster they're after us!! 
VADA I am running faster!! 
THOMAS J Hurry!!! 
They have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the pier, they run out on to the pier 
VADA Jump in the water!! 
THOMAS J But I have my clothes on! 
VADA Do it! 
UNDER WATER VIEW OF THEM BOTH, HOLDING THEIR BREATH 
INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR TO SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA ENTERS DRENCHED 
HARRY (in the distance, from upstairs) Vada is that you? 
VADA Yes.. 
HARRY Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes. 
Vada likes this news, she hurries up the stairs 
VADA Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish. 
SHELLY Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish? 
VADA (angry) NO!, He's fine. (less angry, talking to fish) Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish. 
Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem to have understood 
ANNOUNCER THE BUMPER CARS!! THE BUMPER CARS!! FOR JUST 50 CENTS A HALF DOLLAR, FIVE DIMES, 10 NICKELS, WE HAVE A RIDE THAT'S GUARANTEED TO REARRANGE ALL OF YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS. 
SHELLY Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars. 
HARRY I fall asleep at the wheel. 
VADA (malicious grin) I'll ride on the bumper cars with you! 
SHELLY Oh great Vada, come on... 
They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the fish 
SHELLY (to the attendant) Uhh, two. (to Vada) I got the blue one!! 
Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car 
VADA NO! 
SHELLY Yes!! 
Shelly gets in the blue one 
SHELLY (pointing at Vada) I am gonna get you. 
Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the song is "Bad Moon Rising" 
HARRY Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!! 
Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't escape Vada 
HARRY Careful Vada, careful. 
HARRY Shelly LOOK OUT! 
WWHHAAMMM 
Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin 
VADA IS RIDING HER BIKE ALONG HER STREET TOWARDS THE CAMERA, SHE STOPS AND DISMOUNTS OUTSIDE THOMAS J'S HOUSE 
Vada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers 
MRS. SENNETT Hi Vada. 
VADA Hi, can Thomas J come out? 
MRS. SENNETT Sure, come in. 
Thomas J is coming down the stairs 
THOMAS J Hi Vada. 
VADA Hi, wanna ride bikes? 
THOMAS J Sure. 
MRS. SENNETT Ohh, did you make your bed? 
VADA He likes her better than me. 
A TREE DUSK, THOMAS J AND VADA ARE UP THE TOP OF IT 
THOMAS J I'm hungry, I can't last any longer. 
VADA Then go home, baby. 
THOMAS J I have to anyway, my mom will be worried. 
VADA Leave then, some friend you are. 
THOMAS J You can come to my house for dinner? 
VADA No, I'm hiding out. 
THOMAS J Okay, seeya. 
Thomas J climbs down from tree, and leaves 
DISSOLVE INTO NEXT SCENE 
VADA STILL IN TREE NIGHT, SHE LOOKS AROUND AND THEN DECIDES TO GET DOWN 
Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on the Sultenfuss' front lawn 
INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR, VADA ENTERS AND CLOSES IT 
As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, they were so worried etc., Nothing happens, all she can hear is the noise that the TV is making. So she opens the door again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up, and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs 
Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed 
VADA'S THOUGHTS In social studies we learned some people stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN tonight. 
OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, A LOUD HIGH PITCHED SCREAM IS HEARD 
VIEW OF CORRIDOR LEADING TO BATHROOM 
VADA OH MY GOD!!! 
Vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs 
VADA DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?! 
Vada runs into a room where Shelly is 
VADA Daddy??!?!?!

Vada nods her head

VADA (extremely worried) He's okay isn't he? 
HARRY (shakes head, near tears) There were just too many of 'em.

VADA His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses on! (Harry and Shelly are rapidly approaching Vada, Shelly takes hold of her and tries to pull her away) Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an acrobat. 
HARRY He's gone sweetheart. He's gone! 
VADA Get away, get away!! 
Vada breaks away from Harry's grip and runs out of the room, followed closely by Harry and Shelly 
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, VADA IS RUNNING DOWN THE STEPS, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY HARRY

Harry stops running after Vada as she sprints off down the road 
Vada arrives at Mr. Bixler's house 
MR. BIXLER Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J. 
Vada covers her ears and begins to sing "doo-wah-diddy- diddy" 
MR. BIXLER Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right? 
VADA (crying) Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel. 
MR. BIXLER (nods) Come here, sit down over here. 
The two of them sit down on Mr. Bixler's porch 
Vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop 
VADA Mr. Bixler, (emotional pause) I love you. 
MR. BIXLER Oh, Vada... 
VADA I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here. 
MR. BIXLER Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you. 
VADA No he wouldn't, I can't go home. 
A woman appears at Mr. Bixler's front door 
SUZANNE I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem to find my other earring.... 
MR. BIXLER Suzanne, this is Vada. 
SUZANNE (comes over to Vada and crouches) Vada, hi, I'm really sorry. 
MR. BIXLER Could you just give us a minute? 
SUZANNE Yeah. 
Suzanne goes back inside 
VADA Who's that? 
MR. BIXLER That's Suzanne. (pause) She and I are gonna be married this Fall. 
VADA I will I promise. 
SHELLY Okay, get in to bed. 
Vada gets into bed and extends her arms to Shelly, they hug each other, Vada has finally accepted Shelly 
SHELLY Goodnight. 
VADA Goodnight. 
Shelly exits and turns off the lights 
DOWNSTAIRS, HARRY ENTERS 
SHELLY (sitting on stairs) She's in. 
BACK IN VADA'S ROOM 
Harry enters, walks over and kisses Vada, then turns around and begins to exit 
VADA Did I kill my mother? 
HARRY What?? 
VADA The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother. 
HARRY No, no. 
Harry pulls up a chair and sits down next to Vada 
HARRY No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things like that aren't anybody's fault, it just happened. 
Vada pulls out the photo of Harry and Vada's Mom from under her pillow 
VADA I found this. 
HARRY I forgot about that picture, where did you find it? 
VADA In the garage. 
HARRY Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car. 
VADA What was my mama like? 
HARRY She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her. 
VADA Really? 
HARRY Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl. 
VADA Do you miss her? 
HARRY Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked. 
VADA I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J. 
HARRY That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me. (Vada puts the photo back under her pillow, Harry gets up and kisses her) Seeya in the morning. 
Harry begins to leave room 
VADA Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.

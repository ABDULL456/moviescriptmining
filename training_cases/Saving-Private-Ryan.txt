FADE IN: 
CREDITS:  White lettering over a back background.  The THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back the hair and rattles the ears. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. OMAHA BEACH - NORMANDY - DAWN 
The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING. Huge fifteen inch guns. 
SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT 
Heads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers, pour out a red snowstorm of bullets. 
OFFSHORE SUPERIMPOSITION: 
OMAHA BEACH, NORMANDY June 6, 1944 
0600 HOURS HUNDREDS OF LANDING CRAFT Each holding thirty men, near the beaches. 
THE CLIFFS At the far end of the beach, a ninety- foot cliff.  Topped by bunkers. Ringed by fortified machine gun nests. A clear line-of-fire down the entire beach. 
TEN LANDING CRAFT Make their way toward the base of the cliffs.  Running a gauntlet of explosions. 
SUPERIMPOSITION: THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows through the waves. 
THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN 
Boys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough. Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them. 
A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT 
A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh. 
THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT 
The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them. FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into the bow. 
THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS 
BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes the controls. 
A YOUNG SOLDIER His face covered with the remains of the motorman.  Starts to lose it. Begins to shudder and weep.  His name is DeLancey. 
THE BOYS AROUND HIM 
Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects them.  It starts to spread. 
A FIGURE Pushes through the men.  Puts himself in front of DeLancey. 
The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened, powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's helmet and lights the cigar. 
DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is terrified. 
Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die? 
Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops. 
Delancey Oh, Jesus... 
Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the cheek and moves on to the bow. 
MILLER Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL IN FRONT OF THEM. 
PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND 
It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his eyes back to the objective. 
THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH 
The six surviving boats alongside. 
EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE 
JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more. SARGE gets one.  Not enough. 
THE SECOND SIX Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are KILLED. 
MILLER Turns, looking for the next six. His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker. Reiben smiles. 
REIBEN (heavy Brooklyn accent) Captain, can I put in for a transfer? 
MILLER Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork. 
THE THIRD SIX Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller exchange a look.  They both see the madness of what they're doing. 
MILLER AND THE OTHERS 
OPEN UP on the Germans. 
MILLER GO! 
SARGE Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind. 
IN THE GAP BULLETS EVERYWHERE. 
Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce down.  EXPLODE below. 
THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN. 
A perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE. 
THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER 
SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward Miller. 
A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant from death. 
SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE 
Under the overhang to safety. 
MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL IS BLOWN OFF. 
UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves. 
REIBEN I'll be Goddamned!  I'm not dead! 
Sarge hollers back to Miller. 
SARGE CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET! 
MILLER I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER. 
Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE. HIT more Germans. 
SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed. 
THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE. 
Putt out the two worst machine gun nests. 
MILLER Crosses the gap.  His men follow. 
AT THE CREST The Americans swarm over the top. FIRING. 
TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat. 
Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans are CUT DOWN. 
MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel charges. 
MILLER Okay, Wade, your turn. 
Wade Captain, I love it when you say that. 
Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside. Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker. 
MILLER AND SARGE Survey the field. 
SARGE What the hell were you doing?  Drawing fire! 
MILLER Worked, didn't it? 
SARGE You tryin' to get yourself killed? 
MILLER Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered. 
INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY 
Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries. GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.  Half- a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the file. 
GENERAL MARSHALL (softly) Goddamn it. 
One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau. 
GENERAL MARSHALL Any contact with the fourth brother, James? 
One-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines. 
General Marshall hardens. 
GENERAL MARSHALL Well, if he's alive, we're going to send someone to get him the hell out of there.  That's just what the General's staff wanted to hear. 
EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY 
NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE. Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in the distance. 
SUPERIMPOSITION: Normandy 1300 hours June 9 
MILLER Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through the fire and dives into a sludge- filled crater.  He surfaces, sees Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a horrific smell.  Their conversation is repeatedly broken by FIRING And DUCKING GERMAN FIRE. 
MILLER Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we swimming in? 
REIBEN Shit, sir. 
SARGE Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog. 
REIBEN Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine. 
MILLER Look at the bright side, the Krauts sure as hell don't want to advance and hold this cesspool. 
Miller barks to his RADIOMAN. 
MILLER Get Fire Control, we need some artillery... 
Radioman Trying, sir. 
MORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben's worried. 
REIBEN Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here? 
MILLER Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen. 
SARGE Who cares? 
REIBEN I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge? 
SARGE Frogs? 
REIBEN Lingerie. 
SARGE Yeah?  So? 
THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant.  Miller, Sarge and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck down again. 
REIBEN So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen. 
MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS. 
REIBEN Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night? 
MILLER Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie? 
REIBEN Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion. 
Another pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE. 
MILLER There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen. 
REIBEN Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private. 
REIBEN Happy to, sir. 
Radioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at H.Q., right away. 
MILLER Maybe the war's over. 
A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben looks dubiously at Miller. 
REIBEN I don't think so, Captain. 
COLONEL ANDERSON Spit it out, Captain. 
MILLER HESITATES, THEN: 
MILLER Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense. (beat) Sir. 
The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel Anderson glares at Miller. 
COLONEL ANDERSON You think just because you hold the Congressional Medal of Honor, you can say any damn thing you please to your superior officers? 
Miller considers the question, then smiles. 
MILLER Yes, sir, more or less. 
Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head off, then he smiles, too. 
COLONEL ANDERSON Alright, I'll give you that. Continue. 
MILLER The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is. 
Miller Shrugs. 
MILLER Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan? Fine officer, regular church goer, writes poetry, he might like a mission like this. (beat) And he's taller than me. 
Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's time to get back to business. 
COLONEL ANDERSON That's enough, Captain, you have your orders.  Major Thomas will fill you in. 
Miller knows when to back off.  He salutes. 
MILLER Yes, sir. 
Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look. 
COLONEL ANDERSON Good luck, John. 
MILLER Thank you, sir. 
Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables. Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they go back to work. 
EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY 
A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the deck of the enormous ship. 
EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY 
HUGE EXPLOSIONS.  The big naval shells SLAM into the German position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field. 
IN THE CRATERS Miller's Ranger company ducks and covers.  The BARRAGE SUBSIDES.  The Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging from crater to crater, advancing against the remaining Germans who return SMALL ARMS FIRE. 
MILLER Crouch-runs and dives into a crater with Sarge. 
MILLER Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge, we're heading out. 
SARGE Caen? 
MILLER I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission. 
SARGE You?  Leading a squad? 
MILLER Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home. 
SARGE What about the company? 
MILLER Simpson. 
SARGE Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick! 
MILLER I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition. 
SARGE Beasley's dead. 
MILLER Okay, Wade.  Translators? 
SARGE Fresh out. 
MILLER What about Talbot? 
SARGE Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport. 
SARGE Yes, sir. 
They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the crater and crouch-run in opposite directions. 
Miller points the way for Sarge. 
EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY 
Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE. SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out. 
MILLER Wait here. 
He strides into the tent. 
INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY 
Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious, detailed work. 
One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old, patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work. Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham. 
Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses. 
Upham Sir, I'm Upham. 
MILLER I understand you speak French and German. 
Upham Yes, sir. 
MILLER Do you have an accent? 
Upham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a touch of the Bavarian. 
MILLER Good, you've been re-assigned to me, we're going to Ramelle. 
Upham knows enough geography to know what that means. 
Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle. 
MILLER That's my understanding. 
Upham Lots of them. 
MILLER Do you have a problem with that, Corporal? 
Upham Sir, I've never been in combat.  I make maps.  I translate. 
MILLER I need a translator, all mine have been killed. 
Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training. 
MILLER It'll come back to you.  Get your gear. 
Upham hesitates. 
Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter? 
Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking. 
Upham I'm writing a book and I... 
Miller's expression gives him his answer. 
Upham Uh, how about a pencil? 
MILLER A small one. 
Miller shoos him off. 
MILLER Go, go... 
Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs. 
EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY 
Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion in military history. 
The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off- shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE. 
It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny band of men, weave their way through the middle of it, speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned equipment, bodies. 
Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in the back of the jeep. 
REIBEN Captain, can I ask you a question? 
MILLER Sure, Reiben. 
REIBEN Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir? 
REIBEN Well, you're a happy idiot. 
THEY ROUND A TURN 
SKID TO A STOP AT A: 
BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES 
A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him. 
MILLER How's the road up to St. Mere? 
Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic. 
MILLER Anybody getting through? 
Lieutenant The lucky ones. 
Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters. They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing. 
AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS 
On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's reaction. 
IN THE BACK The men bounce up and down like stuffed animals, doing their best to not be thrown out. 
REIBEN Hell, this is better than Coney Island! 
A HUGE BUMP Bounces Reiben up and slams his back down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN PAIN. 
MILLER Just trying to make room for Ryan. 
Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his shovel from under his bruised ass. 
THEY ROUND A BEND 
See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning, obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run. 
AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN 
Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER 
MILLER (sweetly) Sarge? 
SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on. 
ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES Thirty yards ahead of them. 
MILLER Directs Sarge off the road. 
MILLER They've got the road zeroed. 
SARGE Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep off the road. 
THE JEEP BOUNCES Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing everyone out.  Somehow they hang on. The jeep tears along the rutted field. 
ANOTHER EXPLOSION Just behind them. 
SARGE DRIVES MADLY Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid the biggest ruts and bumps. 
ANOTHER EXPLOSION Close on their side.  Showers them with debris. 
SARGE Jesus Christ! 
MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN 
Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead. 
MILLER They've got a hell of a spotter somewhere. 
ANOTHER EXPLOSION Even closer.  The jeep's PEPPERED WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH the smoke. 
MILLER S-curves, Sarge. 
SARGE Turns shallow curves without slowing down. 
SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER 
Tries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned earth.  STOPS SHORT. 
REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON 
THROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt. 
UPHAM You think he really believed it? 
WADE Who knows?  It worked. 
REIBEN Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear. 
WADE Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes. 
REIBEN You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this. 
WADE Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining. 
Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a shot. 
UPHAM Well, as a matter of fact, I was just thinking... 
The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst. 
UPHAM (continuing) That I'm so fucking tired of this goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand dollars to see that bastard Ryan crawl on his belly over an acre of broken glass to hear my great-aunt Martha fart through a field-phone. 
The men are stunned. 
REIBEN Jesus Christ, he's a natural! 
MILLER Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat? 
Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain I'd remember. 
Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men. 
MILLER He's good. 
They walk on. 
JACKSON Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable. 
Miller smiles, situation normal. 
EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans. 
Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across and disappear into the remains of a building. 
Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread out down the block behind him. 
Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of an alley across the street and down the block.  They are CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN. 
As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before. 
Miller motions Jackson across first. 
MILLER Stay low. 
Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST, kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and makes it to the cover of the far side. 
JACKSON Dang!  That was close! 
Miller nods to Upham. 
MILLER Your turn. 
Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him very gently. 
MILLER Zig-zag, change your pace a couple times, you'll be alright. 
Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs. 
MILLER Okay, I'm going to draw fire for you. (sternly) But if I do, you goddamned well better go. 
Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath. 
CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers. 
MILLER Looks to Upham 
MILLER Ready? 
Upham nods, still terrified. 
MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN 
Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers. 
UPHAM Pass. 
MILLER Sarge? 
SARGE I'm just here to keep a bunch of numb-nuts, including one certain, frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate, from getting themselves killed. 
Reiben eyes Miller. 
REIBEN And what about you, Captain? 
Miller looks at Reiben, shocked. 
MILLER Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army? 
REIBEN I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. (beat) But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say? 
Miller considers his response. 
MILLER In that case, I would say this is an excellent mission, with an extremely valuable objective, worthy of my best efforts. 
Reiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no obvious sarcasm. 
MILLER (continuing) In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance. 
REIBEN Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar. 
MILLER But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in... 
The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're about to find out Miller's home town.  Miller smiles. 
MILLER (continuing) ...my home town, which shall remain un-named. 
The men ease back, disappointed. 
MILLER Any further thoughts on the subject? 
REIBEN Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan. 
MILLER I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead. 
The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets serious. 
MILLER We move out in two hours, try and get some sleep. 
The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow suit. 
Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light, he studies his maps while his men rest. 
EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER) 
Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson, Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake, watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him. 
SARGE You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps. 
MILLER Maybe. 
SARGE It's not normal, not reading letters from home. 
MILLER Since when have things been normal? 
SARGE You got me.  Afraid of bad news? 
MILLER Nope. 
SARGE Good news? 
Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at the men. 
SARGE You think they'll be alright? 
MILLER They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright. 
SARGE And what about you? 
Miller considers the question, doesn't answer. 
MILLER They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up. 
SARGE Nope. 
MILLER Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender. 
SARGE Three for three. 
Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes the ammo back. 
MILLER Let's move out. 
Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness, lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a strange bit of hope. 
EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT 
The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear. Sarge How long's your hand been shaking? 
MILLER A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading. 
SARGE Is it getting worse? 
MILLER No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it. 
SARGE You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore. 
MILLER I'll be alright. 
Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk on. 
EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER) 
Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge brings up the rear. 
A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate only with hand signals. 
JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming. 
MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY MEN appear. 
REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of relief and lowers hi B.A.R. 
THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed with fear.  The others are stone-faced. 
THE GERMANS PASS. 
MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions. 
UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear. 
UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly exposed.  Shitting bricks. 
Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad approaches. 
Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak- kneed, amazed that he's still alive. 
MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries after Miller, staying close on his heels. 
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 
The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field, parallel to a cart path.  Wary. 
Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so. 
EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT 
Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn is visible. 
MILLER It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it up. 
EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN 
First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five. 
Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass. The war is far away. 
Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together without speaking for a moment. 
MILLER It looks like a Renoir. 
UPHAM Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy? 
MILLER I've been humming it. 
UPHAM I heard. 
MILLER It seemed appropriate. 
UPHAM You know classical music? 
MILLER Some. 
Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack. 
REIBEN Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around. 
MILLER We can't leave it here. 
JACKSON We left them eighty-eights. 
MILLER They don't send planes to put out machine guns. (beat) Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast. 
Upham steels himself and steps forward. 
UPHAM Sir, I ran the 220 in high school. 
REIBEN He's fast, Captain, I saw him. 
Miller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer. 
WADE How fast? 
UPHAM Twenty-four-five. 
WADE Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat. 
MILLER Wade goes left. 
Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is impressed. 
UPHAM Twenty-two flat? 
Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap. 
WADE I would have won the states if some bastard hadn't tripped me in the finals. 
Miller points the others to their firing positions. 
MILLER Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben, ten yards, either side. 
As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly, out of earshot of the men. 
SARGE Rule of thumb, Captain, says you ought to detail this one, instead of going yourself. 
Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers. 
MILLER Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that? 
SARGE How about I go right, sir? 
MILLER How about you take your position? 
Sarge hesitates. 
SARGE How about...? 
MILLER (interrupting) How about you shut up and take your position? 
Sarge nods. 
SARGE Yes, sir. 
Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions. 
UPHAM Good luck, Captain. 
MILLER Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives. 
UPHAM The men said, nine. 
MILLER What do they know? (beat) I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here. 
UPHAM That only leaves three. 
MILLER Plenty. 
Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade. 
MILLER Ready? 
WADE Yes, sir. 
Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now. 
MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS. 
REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade. 
SARGE Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder. 
MILLER About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal. 
MILLER Damn it! 
Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack. 
SARGE Fumbles with a second sulfa bag. 
SARGE Sulfa, more sulfa... 
WADE Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller. Sees him preparing the morphine shot. They both know. 
WADE Yeah...morphine...make it a double...huh...Captain...? 
MILLER SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge. 
MILLER More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on... 
SARGE Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine. 
MILLER Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before. 
REIBEN On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off. 
REIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... 
UPHAM Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't. 
JACKSON Watching. 
MILLER Gives Wade the second shot. 
WADE Feels the effects of the first shot. He sees Upham and manages a pained smile. 
WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame, without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE DIES 
ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE 
UPHAM begins to weep. 
REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS: 
REIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... 
MILLER Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices. 
Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it. 
Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa, rises and picks up his Thompson. 
Upham shakes his head. 
UPHAM That was no twenty-two flat. 
Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson. 
MILLER He lied.  Let's move out. 
Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men hesitate, then slowly follow him. 
EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY 
A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel. The five G.I.'s walk, spread out. 
REIBEN Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch. 
JACKSON Shut up, will you? 
REIBEN You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard. 
JACKSON Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade. 
REIBEN The hell he didn't. 
Miller motions to them curtly. 
MILLER Keep it down. 
They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly, the men don't hear. 
MILLER But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted. 
Sarge allows himself a slight smile. 
SARGE Yes, sir. 
Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back to the men. 
EXT. CLEARING - DAY 
The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade. No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing. Miller barks at the men. 
MILLER Up.  We're moving out. 
REIBEN I thought you said we had an hour, sir? 
MILLER Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass. 
The men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow. 
MILLER What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson? 
JACKSON Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade. 
MILLER Who's Wade? 
No one responds. 
MILLER I said, who the hell is Wade? 
The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them. 
JACKSON Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner. 
MILLER You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand? 
JACKSON Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand. 
MILLER Good, now get your goddamned gear. 
The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out. Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit to work.  He knows they have no choice. 
EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY 
Miller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent, grim. 
EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY 
Miller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds up the map, points the way and they move out. 
EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY 
More progress.  The men are still grim. 
REIBEN You know what the best possible thing that could happen is? 
JACKSON Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live. 
Miller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben. 
REIBEN I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead. 
MILLER Why's that? 
REIBEN Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive. 
MILLER Except for the last part, that one's not bad. 
REIBEN B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another. 
MILLER I don't like that one. 
REIBEN Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him. 
MILLER But we accomplish the mission. 
REIBEN Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division. 
MILLER Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material? 
REIBEN No, sir. 
MILLER That's a mystery to me. 
Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge. 
REIBEN Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain. 
MILLER ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN. 
A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back. 
VOICE FROM BRIDGE KISS MY ASS, FRITZ. 
MILLER YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT. 
VOICE FROM BRIDGE WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME? 
Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty. 
MILLER I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME. (to his men) Cover me. 
REIBEN What if our guys open up, sir? 
MILLER You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules. 
REIBEN Have it your way, Captain. 
Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward the bridge. 
THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP 
Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller. 
MILLER'S MEN POUR FIRE at the German positions, SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE. 
ON THE BRIDGE The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM OF BULLETS at the German positions. 
Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies. 
He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime. 
MILLER I'll keep it in mind. (calls to Sarge) OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME. 
Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE. 
Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days. 
MILLER Things are tough all over.  We're looking for a Private James Ryan. 
Forrest Ryan? 
MILLER Is he here? 
Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers. 
Forrest Go get Ryan. 
(TO MILLER) What do you want him for, sir? 
Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them. 
MILLER Jackson, get a hold of command. 
Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to Forrest. 
MILLER How many men do you have? 
They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men to leap over the barricade. 
Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone. 
Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's hailing I.D.   No response. 
JACKSON Not yet. 
MILLER Keep trying. 
Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan? 
Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees: 
PRIVATE JAMES RYAN Dashing from cover to cover, making his way toward them.  Ryan is an American classic, nineteen years old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky. Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and smeared with dirt and blood, he's very alive.  His eyes shine, his face has a spark.  You can't help but love this kid. 
MILLER'S MEN All watch Ryan run toward them. 
JACKSON So, that's Ryan. 
Miller slowly turns and glares. 
REIBEN (continuing) So, what are a few tanks, sir? 
Miller's more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles. 
REIBEN (continuing) He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is. 
JACKSON STEPS FORWARD. 
JACKSON Cap'n...? 
Miller turns his glare on Jackson. 
JACKSON (continuing) Seems to me, we got us a opportunity, here, to kill two birds with one stone.  Command seems to think keepin' this boy alive is worth somethin'. If we was to do that and hold this bridge, good chance we'd get us a bucket full of medals.  I might even get me one 'a them big, fancy ones like you got, so's I could sass any officer in the whole dang army, you included. 
Miller does a slow burn. 
UPHAM STEPS FORWARD 
UPHAM I'd like to stay, too, Captain. 
MILLER You don't count. 
SARGE STEPS UP 
SARGE I do and personally, I'd rather get the hell out of here, but somebody's got to stay and take care of you and these pin-head privates of yours. 
Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS. 
Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir. 
Reiben smiles. 
REIBEN See, Captain?  The vote's unanimous. 
Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote? What the hell are you talking about?  We don't vote.  This isn't a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you follow them.  We don't vote! 
REIBEN Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir. 
MILLER You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear? 
They all quickly nod. 
JACKSON Yes, sir. 
REIBEN Of course, sir. 
All the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir. 
Miller looks from face to face. 
MILLER In that case... (beat) I vote we stay. 
That's what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn't give them time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders. 
MILLER Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson, get up on the bridgekeepers hut with your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and Upham move that machine gun so it can cover the left flank, it's worthless where it is.  Forrest, I want a full inventory of all your weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go. 
They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller for a moment. 
RYAN Thank you, sir. 
MILLER (gruffly gentle) Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand? 
Ryan salutes. 
RYAN Yes, sir. 
MILLER Alright, come with me. 
Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side. 
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 
Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory. 
Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy guns and about sixty rounds per man. 
MILLER That's it? 
Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry. 
REIBEN Sir, can I change my vote? 
UPHAM Goddamn it, sir... 
MILLER That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers. 
REIBEN Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us. 
MILLER See to it. 
RYAN Steps up to Miller. 
RYAN I'd like to go, sir. 
MILLER No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid. 
REIBEN Aren't they the same thing, sir? 
Miller smiles. 
MILLER Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive. 
SARGE Yes, sir. 
Miller checks Jackson and Forrest. 
MILLER You ready? 
Forrest Yes, sir. 
JACKSON You betcha, sir. 
Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out. 
REIBEN (southern accent) Y'all come back. 
JACKSON Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk? 
REIBEN (heavy southern accent) Hell, no! 
Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go. 
EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT 
A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the night.  It's eight-man crew re-loads. 
IN THE DARKNESS A slight movement.  It's Miller.  He crawls to the edge of the emplacement and freezes in the shadows. 
A moment later he's joined by Forrest.  A moment after that, Jackson silently crawls up to them. 
MILLER Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a weakness.  There is none.  He motions to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The three of them settle into the darkness. 
EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT 
Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller's men eye him. 
SARGE Private, I'm sorry about your brothers. 
Ryan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was the name of the guy who got killed coming up here? 
SARGE Wade. 
RYAN Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here to keep me alive...I never met him...he didn't know me from Adam, strange.  What was he like? 
SARGE A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben, here, used to call him a happy idiot. 
REIBEN Like hell, I did. 
RYAN My brothers would be mighty pissed off at me, if they knew I let some guy get killed trying to keep me alive. 
SARGE You didn't let anybody get killed, you didn't even know we were coming up here. 
RYAN Sure, I know, but... (sighs) Goddamn it all... 
The others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan. 
EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT 
Dark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch. 
A SHADOW It's Miller.  Easing through the darkness.  Closer to one of the sentries. 
Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS. 
BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT Forrest removes the wheel-blocks. 
THE GERMANS Open up with a volley. 
SARGE Is almost there. 
ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE 
As best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It's not enough. 
SARGE Five feet from the sandbags, his back is TORN APART by Germans fire. He looks down, stunned at his chest. Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An instant of surprise, more than fear. 
He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies. THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY 
THE GERMANS Who killed Sarge are killed.  The others back off for now. 
REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans. 
MILLER Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the barricade.  Sees that he's dead. 
THE GERMANS RETREAT. 
Around the corner. 
MILLER Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling next to him. 
THE OTHERS Watch, start to gather. 
REIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... 
MILLER Get back to your positions! 
They hesitate. 
MILLER Go! 
They follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn't move. He can't take his eyes off Sarge. 
MILLER Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body. 
RYAN Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside. 
RYAN I'll take care of Sarge... 
Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made as he kneeled over Wade's body. 
MILLER Sarge?  Who's Sarge? 
But this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's called his own bluff. 
EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
Dark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once. 
Waiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have tightened their perimeter. 
Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously. 
They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper. 
Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks: 
MILLER English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania. 
Slowly, Miller's men turn to him. 
UPHAM What'd you say, Captain? 
MILLER I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania. 
REIBEN Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it. 
JACKSON Like hell, you did. 
UPHAM Captain, what about our deal? 
MILLER I changed my mind. 
REIBEN What deal? 
MILLER I coach the baseball team, too. 
JACKSON No kiddin'? 
REIBEN What deal? 
REIBEN Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one German.  STABS the other. 
RYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt. 
REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE GUN. 
OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A LONG BURST.  Germans drop. 
MILLER FIRES again.  More Germans drop. 
THE GERMANS Take positions in the building near the bridge. 
They start working their way to the tops of the nearby buildings. 
Making their way along the riverbanks. 
REIBEN AND RYAN Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding the ammo belt. 
REIBEN MORE AMMO! 
UPHAM Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS toward Reiben and Ryan. 
SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM 
OPEN UP on him. 
BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there. 
UPHAM TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart. Stumbles the final few steps to the machine gun nest.  Falls on the sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD. 
RYAN STUNNED. 
For just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the one almost out. 
REIBEN Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans. 
THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK 
MILLER Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS. 
MILLER TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME! 
RYAN AND REIBEN Immediately grab the machine gun and ammo and race back to the rear nest. 
Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two German infantry platoons. 
JACKSON On the bridgekeeper's hut.  Picking off German soldiers who follow the tank. 
A GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON.  Hollers into the tanks voice-tube. 
THE TANK Stops.  Grinds its gears.  Turning it's turret towards the bridgekeepers hut. 
MILLER JACKSON! 
JACKSON Knows what's coming but he holds his position, continuing to pick off German soldiers. 
THE TANK BLASTS THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION. 
MILLER AND RYAN SEE JACKSON DIE.  A bare moment to react.  Then, they turn their attention back to the eighty-eight. Frantically turning the aiming cranks. Lowering the barrel to point blank. 
TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT. 
Which can fire first. 
MILLER AND RYAN Win the race. 
FIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT BLAST THE LEAD TANK DESTROY IT IN A SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES 
MILLER AND RYAN Quickly reload the eighty-eight. FIRE AGAIN. 
DESTROY THE SECOND TANK. 
MILLER Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech of the eighty-eight.  Pats Ryan on the back.  Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE. 
RUNS down the bridge.  Right toward the two advancing tanks. 
RYAN FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT. 
DESTROYING THE THIRD TANK. 
MILLER Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS. 
REIBEN With the machine gun.  Covers Miller. Keeping most of the German infantry down.

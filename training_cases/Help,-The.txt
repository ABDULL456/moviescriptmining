WILLIAM FAULKNER wrote of Mammy Callie after her death: 
"...she gave to my family a fidelity without stint or calculation or recompense and gave to my childhood an immeasurable devotion and love". 
JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI 1963 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
AIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and grips a tattered spiral notebook. Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear. Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses. Aibileen swallows hard. 
AIBILEEN I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont Plantation in Cherokee County. An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen. 
WOMAN (O.C.) Did you know as a girl, growing up, that one day you'd be a maid? 
AIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. I did. 
WOMAN (O.C.) And you knew that because? 
AIBILEEN Momma was a maid. My grandmother was a house slave. 
WOMAN (0.C.) Oh. The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes. 
WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay. Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap. 
WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) Now, did you ever dream of being something else? Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet. 
WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) Well then, what's it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home...being looked after by somebody else? 
Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water. She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) I done raised seventeen kids in my life. Lookin' after white babies, that's what I do. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING 
MAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying. AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoes 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) I know how to get them babies asleep, stop cryin' and go in the toilet bowl before they mommas even get outta bed in the mornin.' Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into her expansive bosom. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Babies like fat. They like big fat legs too. That I know. Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair. 
AIBILEEN (V.O) (CONT'D) I work from eight to four, six days a week. Ninety-five cents an hour comes to a hundred seventy-two dollars ever month. I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing and grocery shopping, but mostly, I take care a baby girl...And law, I worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna be no beauty queen either. Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen kisses her and whispers in her ear. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) You is kind. You is smart. You is important. Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and double-stick tape hold it all together. Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle hair. 
ELIZABETH Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour! Did you finish the chicken salad? 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No paprika! Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Does this dress look homemade? 
AIBILEEN I reckon when you finish, it won't. Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby Girl up but once a day. The birthin' blues had got holt a Miss Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it happen plenty a times...once babies start havin' they own babies. And the young white ladies of Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin' some babies. 
INT. JACKSON JOURNAL NEWSPAPAER - OFFICE - SAME DAY 
A smoking RECEPTIONIST, 50, leads EUGENIA "SKEETER" PHELAN, 23, across a smoke-filled news office. Even the light bulbs have yellowed. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) But, not Miss Skeeter... Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her shoulders. She carries a red satchel. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) No babies...No man...And not lookin'. She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her unfamiliar attire. 
INT. MR. BLACKLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
The receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD BLACKLY, 68. He has greased, grey hair and the face of a mean man. Smoke pours into the room. 
MR. BLACKLY Shut the Goddamn door! He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down. 
MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D) They announced last week cigarettes'll kill you. 
Mr. Blackly pours a pack of nuts into his mouth. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) You drunk up two glasses a grape juice, I know you got to tee-tee. 
MAE MOBLEY Nooo. Mae Mobley shakes her head. 
AIBILEEN I give you a cookie if you go. Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Mae Mobley! You going! Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms into the bathroom in her finished dress. The hemline now slants in the other direction. 
ELIZABETH Aibileen, the girls are pulling up, and the table isn't set! 
MAE MOBLEY Mae Mobley go, Momma! 
ELIZABETH Get in your room! Right now! Mae Mobley rises behind Aibileen's leg. 
MAE MOBLEY I sorry. Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack of potatoes. Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her eyes have welled up. Aibileen mouths "I love you" and blows her a kiss. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is destined to become income property one day. FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two collapsible card tables arranged in the living room. Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) I lost my own boy, Treelore, right before I started waitin' on the Leefolts... Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly. 
CLOSE ON: Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the L-SHAPED CRACK making sure it's hidden. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) After Treelore died, a bitter seed was planted inside a me. And I just didn't feel so accepting anymore. Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat. 
HILLY Hey, girls! 
YOUNG WOMEN 
(IN UNISON) Hey, Hilly! Minny follows behind holding the pie and Missus Walters' arm. 
HILLY (over her shoulder) Put Momma in a chair before she breaks a hip. 
MISSUS WALTERS I'm not deaf yet, Hilly. Minny spies Aibileen in the corner and gives her a "here we go" look as she lowers Missus Walters into a chair. Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat. 
HILLY Aibileen, I want you to have this coat. It's too big for Momma now and it's way too expensive to put in the coat drive. Hilly extends the coat with a smile. 
HILLY (CONT'D) All yours. Aibileen takes the coat. 
AIBILEEN Thank you, Miss Hilly. 
HILLY Go on. Try it on. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Minny plows through the swing door and reaches for Hilly's deviled eggs. Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared coat. The sleeves are about a foot too short. 
AIBILEEN Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's. Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Gots to have paprika on `em. Minny takes an egg. It disappears in a single bite. 
MINNY Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have to kill that woman. 
Aibileen removes the coat and lays it over a chair. 
AIBILEEN Watch yo mouth, Minny. 
MINNY Looks like a walking Christmas present with all them bows. Aibileen shakes with silent laughter. 
MINNY (CONT'D) And, now she gone to puttin' pencil marks on the toilet paper. 
AIBILEEN Oh, law! Did she? 
MINNY Uh-hum. But, I carry paper in from my own damn house. That fool don't know. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Elizabeth and Hilly cackle with a group of girls as Missus Walters sits on the couch watching "Guiding Light." Skeeter suddenly rushes through the front door. 
SKEETER Hey, girls. 
GIRLS 
(IN UNISON) Hey, Skeeter. JOLENE FRENCH, 24, approaches and hugs Skeeter. 
JOLENE Well, if it isn't Long-Haul- Skeeter. We didn't think you'd ever leave Ole Miss. 
SKEETER Well, it's supposed to take four years, Jolene. Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by the cleaners and pick up my black dress. Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) What? 
HILLY About supper club tonight...Honey, Stuart had to cancel. 
JOLENE Oh my God! 
HILLY Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU game and sold him a hotdog. And, boy, he got a whole lot more. All the girls laugh. 
SKEETER Could have been you, Hilly. 
HILLY And live thirty minutes outside of town? Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit. 
SKEETER Aren't we taking non-members? The benefit's gotten so big. 
HILLY Yes, but we're not telling her. Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of coffee. Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles. 
SKEETER Thank you, Aibileen. Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point. Elizabeth leans over. 
ELIZABETH Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use the bathroom. 
HILLY Ah-hem. I'm fine. Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa. 
MISSUS WALTERS She's upset cause the nigra uses the guest bath, and so do we. Elizabeth turns to Aibileen. 
ELIZABETH Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley. Aibileen disappears. Elizabeth leans into Hilly. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Just go use mine and Raleigh's. Hilly hiss-whispers. 
HILLY If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours too. 
ELIZABETH 
SHE DOES NOT! Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops. 
HILLY Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside? Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a picture in the hall. Skeeter tries to change the subject. 
SKEETER Did y'all see the cover of "Life" this week? Jackie's never looked 
MORE REGAL- 
HILLY -Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. I double. Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her cards. 
ELIZABETH I can't ask Raleigh until tax season. But, it would be nice. 
HILLY That's why I've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative. 
SKEETER "The Home"...the what?! 
HILLY As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi. I'll pass. Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet. 
SKEETER Maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside, Hilly. The room grows eerily quiet. 
HILLY You ought not to joke about the colored situation. Hilly leans in toward Skeeter. 
HILLY (CONT'D) I'll do whatever it takes to protect our town. Your lead, Jolene. Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and throws her cards to the table. 
JOLENE I have to skedaddle! Gotta get over to the station! 
(EXCITEDLY) Daddy's letting me do the weather tonight! 
EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY 
Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers. As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison. Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) Now, Miss Celia had her a man. `Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi. But, no baby and no friends. JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband, sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie. 
JOHNNY Roses look like weeds next to you. Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully. 
CELIA Johnny, you scared the daylights out of me! Johnny begins kissing her neck. 
CELIA (CONT'D) You're home early. Celia pushes him back. 
CELIA (CONT'D) Johnny, I can't get any of your old friends from school to call me back. 
JOHNNY Oh, who cares, honey. We got all we need right here. Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass. 
CELIA Johnny, honestly! 
JOHNNY Doctor's orders. Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy and rolls out from under him. 
CELIA I don't know what's taking us so long. I'm sorry. Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face. 
JOHNNY Hey, we've never done it in the yard. Maybe that's the trick. Celia seductively bites her lower lip. 
CELIA Watch my hair. Johnny's hand slides up her thigh. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY 
Bridge over, Skeeter smokes while watching through a window as Minny arrives in Hilly's car. Skeeter blows smoke toward Hilly and Elizabeth saying good-bye. 
Skeeter enters and looks around curiously at an ARRAY OF WIGS resting atop a dresser. 
SKEETER Momma? Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50, glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats. Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored, `pixie' cut. 
CHARLOTTE Is this a little too young? 
SKEETER It's a little too everything. 
Charlotte removes the wig with a sigh. Only now do we realize her decision to wear wigs isn't elective. Thinning hair detracts from her perfectly made up face. Charlotte puts on a classic bouffant/flip in dark brown. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Much better. 
CHARLOTTE Your daddy bought me this dress in 
SKEETER Mom, I want to ask you about 
CONSTANTINE- 
CHARLOTTE -Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl. Charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Come on, you try it on. 
SKEETER What really happened? Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach. 
CHARLOTTE I told you...she went to live with her people in Chicago...Now, Skeeter, your mother is dying, and she wants to see you in this dress. Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress. Skeeter begins taking off her clothes. 
SKEETER How could she just take off without telling me? 
CHARLOTTE I told her not to write you. I didn't want you upset in the middle of final exams. Honey, we were just a job to her. With them it's all about money...Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After she got that teller job, her mother said she was just swimming in proposals. 
SKEETER Good for "Fat Fanny Peatrow." She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it. 
CHARLOTTE This looks precious on you! Four years ago my daughter went off to college, and what did she come home with? 
SKEETER CHARLOTTE A diploma. A pretty piece of paper. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Hilly and Elizabeth have such lovely children. 
SKEETER They dropped out of college to become housewives, Mother. 
CHARLOTTE If only you'd show a little gumption, Eugenia... 
SKEETER Well, I did get a job today. 
CHARLOTTE You did? 
SKEETER Writing...for The Jackson Journal. Charlotte plumps up the dress around Skeeter's behind. 
CHARLOTTE Great. You can write my obituary. "Charlotte Phelan dead. Her daughter still single." 
SKEETER Momma, would it really be so terrible if I never met a husband? With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a love seat. They sit. This is serious. 
CHARLOTTE I need to...ask you something, Skeeter. I read the other day about how some girls...get unbalanced, start thinking these...well, unnatural thoughts. Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Are you...do you...find men attractive? Are you having unnatural thoughts about... Charlotte shuts her eyes tight. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Girls or...or women? 
SKEETER Oh my God! 
CHARLOTTE Because, this article says there's a cure, a special root tea. Skeeter jumps up. 
SKEETER Mother, I want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with Jameso. 
CHARLOTTE Eugenia! Skeeter storms out of the room. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) 
(SHOUTING) Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner. Try to look presentable! 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
The Phelan dining room is lit solely by candles. The Phelan's new maid, PASCAGOLUA, 40, rolls a cart of casseroles around the table. Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl of broth. Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60. Skeeter's brother, CARLTON, 25, sits next to his fiancé, REBECCA, 21. They're perfectly groomed with Hollywood good looks. 
CARLTON What the hell do you know about cleaning a house, Skeeter? 
SKEETER It's a start, Carlton. 
CARLTON 
(MOCKINGLY) I thought you wanted to write books. 
ROBERT Leave your sister alone, Son. I'm proud of you, Sweetheart. Charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon. 
CHARLOTTE Oh, the irony of it all. Givin' advice on how to keep up a home when she... Charlotte's spoon goes in her mouth. Pascagolua tries to scoop some sort of casserole covered in almonds onto Skeeter's plate. Skeeter stops her. 
MISS STEIN What gave you this idea, Miss Phelan? I'm...curious. 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - PANTRY - SAME TIME 
Skeeter sits on a huge sack of flour. A millennium's supply of can goods fills the shelves. 
SKEETER I was...well, I was raised by a colored woman. I've seen how simple it can be and...well, how complex it can be, too...between the families and the help. 
MISS STEIN Continue. 
SKEETER I'd like to write something from the point of view of the help. These colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer. It's that irony, Miss Stein, that we love them and they love us yet...we don't even let them use the toilet in the house. Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up. 
MISS STEIN I'm listening. 
SKEETER Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one...ever asked Mammy how she felt about it. There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here. 
MISS STEIN So, a side to this never before heard. 
SKEETER Yes! Charlotte knocks on the pantry door. 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) Skeeter, who are you talking to in there? Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door. 
SKEETER Go! Away! Skeeter slams the door. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) So, yes, their side of the story. Skeeter leans back against the shelves. 
MISS STEIN Who was that? 
SKEETER My mother. She just dropped by to- 
MISS STEIN Look, no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth. That's a hell of a risk in a place like Jackson, Mississippi. I watched them try to integrate your bus station on the news. Oy! They jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail built for four. Skeeter panics. 
SKEETER I already have a maid. Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. Miss Stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk. 
MISS STEIN Really? A negro maid has already agreed to talk to you? Skeeter blinks hard. No turning back now. 
SKEETER Yes, ma'am... 
MISS STEIN Well...I suppose I could read what you come up with. The book biz could use a little rattling. 
SKEETER You'd do that? 
MISS STEIN I'm saying I'll let you know if it's even worth pursuing. 
SKEETER Oh, thank you, Miss Stein! 
MISS STEIN And for God's sake, you're a twenty- four-year-old educated woman. Go get an apartment. She hangs up. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY 
Skeeter sits across the table from Aibileen, reading the `Miss Myrna' letters. 
Outside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark. Jolene's forecast appears to be a bit off. 
SKEETER "Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too..." 
AIBILEEN Which one she want a get rid of? Them rings or the husband? Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol soak. Then let it set in the sun a bit. Skeeter writes this down. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Bout an hour. Let it dry. Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside. Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, BILLY, 3, perched on her hip. A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans. Skeeter turns to the open window. It's already started to sprinkle outside. 
HILLY Build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage. The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Oh, mercy! Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the moment. 
SKEETER Aibileen, do you ever wish you could...change things? Aibileen turns slowly from the window. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) I mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what Hilly's up to. Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor. 
AIBILEEN Everthing's fine. 
SKEETER My momma fired Constantine. Thank you for telling me that. 
AIBILEEN I never tolt you that! Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out. 
SKEETER Aibileen, I have an idea...Something I want to write about...But I need your help. Skeeter rises. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) I want to interview you...about what it is like to work as a maid. Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of its handle. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) I'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families. Show what it's like to work for, say...Elizabeth. Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady herself, then moves toward her chair. 
AIBILEEN You know what'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin' stories on her? 
SKEETER I was thinking we wouldn't tell her. The other maids will have to keep it secret, too. 
Minny crouches down and covers her head. A draft sucks the candle's flame toward the bottom of the door. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley against an interior wall, holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) On top a Minny losin' her tenth job, eighteen people died in Jackson that day. Ten white. Eight black. 
EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SAME TIME 
Skeeter stands in her backyard facing Jackson. Cool winds head toward the dark, swirling horizon. In the distance, lightning strikes. 
EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME 
Celia leans on the porch railing, gazing helplessly as the relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) God don't pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose. Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone. 
INT/EXT. BATHROOM/BACKYARD (INTERCUT) - THREE MONTHS LATER 
Aibileen uses the newly completed bathroom Hilly has built in the garage. The walls consist of unpainted plywood with a small window hugging the ceiling. Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single bulb hanging above. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) Soon after, that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast... Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house with Mae Mobley at her side. She wears an awful, homemade maternity dress. 
ELIZABETH Hurry, Aibileen. Mae Mobley's up, and I'm off to the doctor. Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. Mae Mobley gets excited and points to the garage bathroom. 
MAE MOBLEY Aibee bafroom, Momma! Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out. 
MAE MOBLEY (CONT'D) Aibee? Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step. 
ELIZABETH No! 
AIBILEEN Be right there, Baby Girl. Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose. 
EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
Aibileen waits with YULE MAY, 45, as well as other maids and black males at a bus stop. Yule May is tall, pretty and graceful. Her hair is pulled tightly into a bun. Skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them. She and Aibileen catch eyes. Skeeter waves. Yule May inches away from Aibileen. One BLACK MAN in particular looks with concern as Skeeter walks up. 
SKEETER Afternoon, Aibileen. Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Can I talk to you? A bus pulls up. 
AIBILEEN You got some "Miss Myrna" questions for me? 
SKEETER No. Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Please. Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her. 
AIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. The bus pulls away. 
SKEETER Please let me interview you. I know it's scary, but I really believe this has to be done. We'll be careful. 
AIBILEEN This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter. You not knowing that is what scares me most. I'm sorry. Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number written on it. Aibileen turns and walks off down the sidewalk. 
EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Dark outside, Aibileen approaches another, more integrated bus stop. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) I know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them. Womens, they ain't like men. Women don`t beat you with a stick. Naw, they like to keep they hands clean. Got a shiny set a tools they use, sharp as witches' fingernails. As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse uniforms push in front of her and sit. 
INT. MISSISSIPPI LAW LIBRARY - NEXT MORNING 
Skeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high as if to provide a shield of sorts. Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling at the edges. It's titled: "Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South" Skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) Any person printing, publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Aibileen sits at a table wearing a nightgown. She carefully combs and styles her wig for work in the morning. Her real hair is bound tightly in dozens of tightly bound nubs. 
The rotary wall phone rings. Aibileen hangs the wig on her chair and answers. 
INT. MINNY'S HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - SAME TIME 
Minny is hysterical. 
MINNY Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it now! Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord. 
MINNY (CONT'D) Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in town I stole a candelabra! That's why I can't get no job. 
AIBILEEN Everbody know you honest, Minny. 
MINNY Oh, but I got her back...I did something awful, Aibileen. 
AIBILEEN What you did?! 
Skeeter delivers the "Miss Myrna" columns to the receptionist, who hands her back a paycheck. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN 
Celia and Minny stand at a fried chicken assembly line. 
MINNY What can you cook? Minny dips pieces chicken in an egg wash, then drops them in a paper bag. A puff of flour rises out of the bag. 
CELIA I can cook corn pone, boil potatoes, and do grits. Minny bursts out laughing. 
CELIA (CONT'D) We didn't have electric current where I was raised. 
MINNY Well, I reckon if there's anything you ought to know `bout cooking... Minny holds up a can of Crisco. 
MINNY (CONT'D) It's this. The most important invention since they put mayonnaise in a jar. You don't even know the things you can do with this here can. Celia peers into the skillet as Minny spoons out a mound of Crisco. 
CELIA How pretty. Looks like frosting. Minny rolls her eyes and hands Celia the bag of Chicken. 
MINNY Shake that. Celia starts shaking the bag. 
CELIA This is fun! 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - LATER 
Minny sits down at the table with a plate of chicken. Celia sits down next to her. 
CELIA Looks so good! I'm starved. Aggravated, Minny stands. 
MINNY You supposed to eat in the dining room, Miss Celia. That how it works. Minny grabs Celia's plate. 
MINNY (CONT'D) Here, I'll take your plate in the dinin' room for ya. Want tea? 
CELIA I'm fine right here, Minny. Minny sits back down with a sigh. Celia touches her arm. 
CELIA (CONT'D) I'm real grateful you're here. 
MINNY Miss Celia, you got a lot more to be grateful for than me. A car is heard pulling up in the driveway. Minny panics. 
MINNY (CONT'D) Mister Johnny?! 
CELIA Oh, no! Hide! Minny slides down underneath the kitchen table. 
CELIA (CONT'D) Oh...It's just the florist. Johnny must have sent me flowers. Minny pulls herself up off the floor. She's mad. 
MINNY Miss Celia, I ain't playin' around no more! He gone catch me here and shoot me dead right here on this no- wax floor! You gots to tell him. Ain't he wondering how the cooking so good? 
CELIA FOOTE You're right. Maybe we ought to burn the chicken a little. The doorbell rings. Celia runs off to answer. 
MINNY Minny don't burn chicken. 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - DAY 
Skeeter sits with a towel draped across her shoulders. Charlotte, now in an auburn wig, squirts mounds of goo from a pink tube onto Skeeter's hair. 
CHARLOTTE This is bound to work, Sweetie. It even smells expensive. She begins twisting Skeeter's hair into gooey spikes. 
SKEETER I feel the hope in your fingers. Skeeter resembles a papier maché starfish. 
CHARLOTTE How can you not know his last name? 
SKEETER He's William's cousin. That's all I know. 
CHARLOTTE That's just so sweet of Hilly. Charlotte takes a drag from her cigarette, then lifts up a silver machine complete with power cord and rubber hose. 
SKEETER What is that?! 
CHARLOTTE The Shinolator! It cost eleven dollars. I'm a good mother. Charlotte puts a shower cap device on Skeeter's head and reads from the Shinolator manual. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) "The Miracle Straitening Cap" must remain on the head for two hours." 
SKEETER Two hours?! Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag. The machine groans to life. Skeeter's cap inflates. 
CHARLOTTE I'll have Pascagoula bring you a magazine. Skeeter snatches her mother's cigarette and takes a drag. 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Skeeter sits under the Shinolator buried in a magazine. Pascagoula enters and sets down a glass of tea. 
SKEETER Thanks, Constantine. Do you think this dress is cute? Skeeter holds the magazine up to Pascagoula. Only now does she realize what she's said and done. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Thanks, Pascagoula. Pascagoula nods and starts to walk away then turns. 
PASCAGOLUA I knew Constantine. She was a mighty fine woman. 
INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
STUART The money's good. If that's what you really want to know. 
SKEETER That's not what I- Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on the front of the restaurant. Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube. 
STUART Isn't that your old boyfriend, Hilly? Johnny Foote? Hilly scowls. 
STUART (CONT'D) Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter than Delta asphalt. Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave. 
HILLY William! The Lieutenant Governor just walked in. Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns with Stuart's drink and the water backs. 
STUART So, what do you do with your time? 
SKEETER I write a...a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal. Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink. 
STUART You mean housekeeping? Skeeter nods and grabs her water. 
STUART (CONT'D) Jesus, I can't think of anything worse than reading a cleaning column. Except maybe writing one. 
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LOBBY - SAME TIME 
Hilly and William finish shaking hands with the Lieutenant Governor. As he walks away, Hilly shouts out. 
HILLY We'd love your support on election day! Celia and Johnny walk up. Hilly stiffens. 
JOHNNY Hilly, you look lovely tonight. 
HILLY Thank you, Johnny. 
JOHNNY William, have you ever met Celia? William steps forward and shakes Celia's hand. 
WILLIAM Nice to meet you. Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm. 
HILLY Sweetie, we need to go order our dinners. Celia musters up all the courage inside her. 
CELIA FOOTE Hilly, did you ever get the messages that I've been calling you? 
HILLY I did not. 
CELIA FOOTE Well, I would love to help with the benefit. I have a lovely hand if you need invitations addressed. 
HILLY "Save the dates" were mailed weeks ago...You didn't get one? Celia shakes her head. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Mail's a lot slower way out there in the country, huh? 
HILLY (CONT'D) 
(TO WILLIAM) Now, come on, before they run out of Trout Almondine. Hilly pulls William away. Johnny grabs Celia's hand. 
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
STUART Sounds like a ploy to find a husband...becoming an expert on keeping house. 
SKEETER Well, you must be a genius. You figured out my whole scheme. Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit. 
HILLY What'd we miss? 
STUART Isn't that what you women from Ole Miss major in? Professional husband hunting? 
SKEETER I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant? Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands. 
HILLY Who? Is? Hungry? Skeeter stands. 
SKEETER Not me! A kiss from God couldn't turn this `frog' into a `prince.' Tables begin to stare. 
STUART Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart! As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into a glass of water, knocking it over into Stuart's lap. 
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING 
Hilly and William each have a section of newspaper in their face as Yule May clears breakfast dishes. Yule May lingers nervously. 
HILLY Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's baby shower. 
YULE MAY Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you and Mister William something. Hilly lowers her paper and nods. Yule May begins wrenching her hands. 
YULE MAY (CONT'D) My twin boys finished high school, both on the honor roll...My husband and I have been saving for years to send them to college. 
HILLY Okay... Only now does William lower his paper. 
YULE MAY We are short seventy-five dollars on one of the tuitions. William stands up, kisses Hilly on the cheek. 
WILLIAM Well, I'm late. Gotta go. William leaves. 
HILLY Go on... 
YULE MAY Now...We're faced with having to choose. Which son gets to go...if we don't find all the money. Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May. 
HILLY Well...You. Are. Welcome. Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into Hilly and hugs her. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) One thing I got to say about Miss Hilly, she love her children. Always tellin' them they smart and beautiful. Can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss. Hilly kisses her son gently. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) And, law, do they love her back. When she starts up on me, I just try and think a my sweet Treelore and how much he loved me. That kind a love makes me cry. Even when it going to Miss Hilly. Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out. 
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY 
Yule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their "good-byes" on the street. Skeeter slips into the kitchen. 
YULE MAY May I get you something? 
SKEETER No, thanks... 
(HUSHED) Yule May, I wanted to talk to you. Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still cackling out on the street. 
YULE MAY I know what you want to ask, Miss Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny already did. Yule May closes the kitchen door. 
YULE MAY (CONT'D) I'm trying to get my boys off to college. It's worthwhile what y'all doing, but my boys are worth more. 
SKEETER I understand. 
HILLY (O.C.) What do you "understand," Skeeter? Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the swinging door leading into the dining room. 
SKEETER Ah...Yule May was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college. 
HILLY Is that true, Yule May? 
YULE MAY Yes, Ma'am. Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow laws in her hand. 
HILLY Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money? 
SKEETER Of course not, Hilly! Hilly approaches Skeeter. 
HILLY Skeeter, I'm starting to think you're intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter. Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen. 
SKEETER Not at all. I'm just so busy right now with Mom. 
HILLY Skeeter...I'm sorry about your mother. And I know you must be so worried. Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet. 
HILLY (CONT'D) But I'm worried about you. All this carrying on lately and now you're reading this stuff? 
SKEETER My dad had me get that for him. 
HILLY I mean, around your friends is one thing...But, believe it or not, there are real racists in this town! If the wrong person caught you with this...you'd be in serious trouble. Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly. 
SKEETER Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for going through my things. 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY 
Skeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette. Keys type out: "Home Help Sanitation Initiative." Skeeter picks up Hilly's document and shakes her head. She types: Don't risk your children's and family's health! 
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Yule May vacuums. She pulls the sofa away from the wall to clean beneath it. Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over. She rises holding a SMALL RUBY RING. Years of dust and hair blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold. The vacuum seems to roar louder now. Yule May breathes heavily. She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket. 
INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON 
As Skeeter bangs away on her typewriter, Charlotte bursts into the room, stuck somewhere between panic and joy. 
CHARLOTTE Skeeter! 
SKEETER What?! 
CHARLOTTE Don't panic, but there's a very tall man named Stuart here for you. 
SKEETER He's a drunken asshole, Mother. You wouldn't like him. Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet. 
CHARLOTTE Skeeter, love and hate are two horns on the same goat. And, you need a goat! 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Skeeter, Charlotte and Stuart sit in the living room. Pascagoula serves finger sandwiches. Stuart looks nice in khaki pants, a blue blazer and a red tie. His nose is pink from working in the sun. No one says a word. Finally... 
CHARLOTTE Stuart, would you like a cocktail? Skeeter shoots her mother a "What the..." look. 
STUART No, Ma'am. Little too early. 
SKEETER Ha! Charlotte moves on. 
CHARLOTTE What's your last name, Stuart? 
STUART Whitworth. 
CHARLOTTE Hmm...Where are you from? 
ELIZABETH (O.C.) (CONT'D) Mae Mobley! No! Stop! Aibileen panics. She gets up, looks out the window. 
INT. LEEFOLT BACKYARD - SAME TIME 
Mae Mobley sits on Aibileen's toilet in the garage. Door wide open, pants around her ankles. 
MAE MOBLEY Me and Aibiee bafroom, Momma. Elizabeth runs over and yanks Mae Mobley off, popping her hard on the behind. 
ELIZABETH It! Is! Not! Mae Mobley begins to cry. Aibileen watches as Elizabeth hiss- whispers and yanks Mae Mobley hard on the arm. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) This is dirty out here! You'll catch diseases. Elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) No! No! No! 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Aibileen sits on the couch with Mae Mobley who eats a cookie. Mae Mobley's face is red and damp. 
AIBILEEN I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here. Aibileen kisses her on the cheek. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) You is kind. You is smart. You is important...You want me to tell you one a our secret stories? Mae Mobley nods. The phone rings. Aibileen rises. 
ELIZABETH (O.C.) I got it! 
Aibileen sits back down and leans into Mae Mobley. 
AIBILEEN One day this wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two. 
MAE MOBLEY Martian? How big? 
AIBILEEN Oh, he about six-two. 
MAE MOBLEY What's his name? 
AIBILEEN Martian Luther King. 
MAE MOBLEY What did he look like? 
AIBILEEN Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair on his head. But, sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him. 
MAE MOBLEY Why Aibee? Why was they so mean? 
AIBILEEN `Cause he was green. Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room. 
ELIZABETH Aibileen! Come on! We have to go help Hilly. Now! Come on! Elizabeth runs outside. Aibileen grabs Mae Mobley. 
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Elizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant belly. Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow. A stream of people walk toward them, laughing. They round a corner to see FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn. Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top, providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by. The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors still open with LUGGAGE tied to the roof. Two OLD BLACK MEN struggle to remove a toilet under William's supervision. 
Aibileen hides her smile. Mae Mobley points. 
MAE MOBLEY Look! Look, Aibee. Hilly flies out of her house as a REPORTER snaps a picture of her. 
HILLY Get out of here! Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Skeeter! She put it in the newsletter. I specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house. Not commodes! Hilly faces the toilets again and screams. 
HILLY (CONT'D) She put it in the newsletter when she knew we'd be down at the beach. Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Go help those boys GET THOSE 
TOILETS OFF MY LAWN! 
INT. BUS - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Aibileen rides in the back of a bus with a YOUNG BLACK MAN. Two white men sit right behind the white driver. The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road. In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block. A few people gather. 
DRIVER Y'all stay put. Let me find out what's going on. As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by followed by a police motorcycle. Aibileen leans in the aisle and looks ahead. The driver returns. The young black man speaks up. 
YOUNG BLACK MAN What happen up there, Mister? 
DRIVER Colored people off. White people lemme know where y'all are going. I'll get you as close as I can. 
As the young black man helps Aibileen down the aisle, a white passenger taps the driver on the shoulder. 
WHITE PASSENGER What's going on? Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs. 
DRIVER I don't know. Some nigger got shot. Where you headed? The bus door shuts and the driver backs away. 
EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER 
Aibileen and the young man walk along a dark street. The sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air. 
YOUNG BLACK MAN You all right? You close to home? 
Celia yells at Minny for the very first time. 
CELIA (O.C.) I said go home, Minny! Minny sees water creeping out from under the door. She steps back and charges, shoulder first. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The bathroom door bursts open with splinters of wood. Minny slips in a pool of watered down blood. Celia sits against the wall in a bloody nightgown. 
MINNY Miss Celia! Celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth. 
CELIA There's so much blood. Why is there so much blood this time? Minny crawls over, peers into the toilet bowl and gags. 
CELIA (CONT'D) Please, Minny. Will you get it out? I can't look at it again. Shaken, Minny reaches for a trash can. She puts her hand on Celia's neck and pushes it down. 
MINNY Keep your head down. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE- BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
Celia lies in bed while Minny presses a cool rag to her forehead. Celia stares out of her bedroom window. 
CELIA'S POV: The two rosebushes stand in the middle of the front lawn. A DOCTOR enters the room. 
DOCTOR Give her another pill if she gets too agitated. There'll be more bleeding, but don't call me unless it's heavy. Minny nods as the doctor leaves. 
CELIA We got married because I was pregnant. But it slipped out too. 
MINNY That's just God's way. Next one's gonna catch. 
CELIA Johnny wants kids now. I thought if I was real still, brought somebody in to do the house and cooking, maybe I'd hold on to this one. Oh, Minny, what's he gonna do with me? 
MINNY He gone have to get over this. He needs to know this takes time. 
CELIA He doesn't know about this one, or the one before... Minny turns to Celia, stunned by this revelation. 
CELIA FOOTE Minny, you know how to play bridge, don't you? Minny nods. 
MINNY Yes, ma'am. I used to help Missus Walters practice. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING 
Aibileen holds a plate of grits covered in toasted marshmallows, strawberries and three lighted candles. 
AIBILEEN Happy Birthday! Mae Mobley two today! Mae Mobley laughs as Aibileen sets down the grits. 
MAE MOBLEY Mae Mobley three! 
AIBILEEN You sure is, Baby Girl. Blow'em out `fo they run up in your grits. Mae Mobley blows out the candles. 
MAE MOBLEY How old are you, Aibiee? 
AIBILEEN Fifty-three. 
MAE MOBLEY Do you get burfdays? 
Mae Mobley picks up a candle and licks off the grits. 
AIBILEEN Gone be fifty-four next week. 
MAE MOBLEY Do you have some babies? 
AIBILEEN I gots seventeen of `em. 
MAE MOBLEY Where are the babies? 
AIBILEEN They all over town. 
MAE MOBLEY Aibee...You're my real mama. 
AIBILEEN Now, you know who your momma is. 
MAE MOBLEY I'm your real baby, Aibee. Those other ones are just pretend. 
EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT YARD - EARLY MORNING 
Celia digs a hole next to the two existing rosebushes. A closed shoebox and new rosebush wait to be planted. Celia lowers the box in the grave, covering it with dirt. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING 
Celia and Minny sit at a card table holding playing cards. Two additional hands lay face up on the table in front of two empty chairs across from them. Minny lays down one of her cards then looks over to Celia's hand. She removes a card from Celia's and lays it down. She then points to the hand next to Celia. Celia nods. 
INT. JUNIOR LEAGUE - MEETING HALL - DAY 
Hilly stands at her podium, tan and ready to lead. She holds her gavel like a weapon. 
HILLY Okay. First order of business. We're updating our newsletter. Hilly stares right at Skeeter who sits alone in the back. 
Hilly and the usual suspects play bridge at Hilly's house. Aibileen pours coffee an earshot away. 
HILLY Please! A nigra walks in a pawn shop with a ring of such size and clarity. It took'em all of five minutes to figure out where she worked. Hilly leads the girls' nods of acknowledgement. 
HILLY (CONT'D) I knew that girl was a thief the day she started. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
As Minny wipes her nose with her sleeve, Skeeter approaches. 
SKEETER I'll ask daddy to get her a good lawyer. 
MINNY She had a lawyer. A white lawyer! But Miss Hilly friends with the judge's wife. Whole thing took two days. Arrested on Tuesday, in the state pen by Wednesday. 
AIBILEEN The church gone send them boys to college. Gone pass the plate `til they graduate... The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a seat at the kitchen table. PEARLY, 58, sits next to Skeeter and touches her arm. 
PEARLY I'm on help with your stories. Another WOMAN walks over. 
BLACK WOMAN I'm on help too. Another woman speaks from the living room. 
BLACK WOMAN 2 We all are. Women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads. Skeeter looks around in awe. 
SKEETER Thank you. I don't know what to- 
MINNY 
(STERNLY) They doing this for Yule May. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Skeeter sits and writes as Pearly begins the interviews. 
PEARLY Been there thirty-eight years and Miss Margaret still makes me put my hair up in a rag. Say she know coloreds don't wash theys hair. But, I love her. She love me too. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CORA, 70. 
CORA I had been workin' for Miss Jolene's mother up `til she died. Then her daughter, Miss Nancy, asked me to come work for her. Miss Nancy a real sweet lady. 
CORA (CONT'D) But her momma left it in the will that I had to work for her daughter, Miss Jolene. Miss Jolene a mean woman. Mean for sport. I tried to get another job, but in everbody mind, the French family and Miss Jolene owned me. 
DISSOLVE TO: CALLIE, 60, takes off her glasses and wipes her eyes. 
CALLIE I used to take a shortcut ever day to work at Doctor Dixon's house. Cut through this farmer's lower forty to get there. One day, that farmer was waitin' on me with a gun, said he'd shoot me dead if I walk on his land again. Doctor Dixon went and paid that farmer double for two a those acres. Told him he `bout to start farmin' too. But he bought it just for me. So I could get to work easy. He did. Skeeter closes her eyes for moment. When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDING 
BEFORE HER. Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the vision is gone. Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26. 
GRETCHEN All these colored women have been real nice, haven't they? 
SKEETER Yes. Very nice. 
GRETCHEN Well, they hate you. You know this? Every little thing about you. But you're so dumb, you think you're doing them a favor. Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback. 
SKEETER You don't have to do this. 
GRETCHEN You know the nicest thing a white woman's ever done for me? Gave me the heel of her bread. These women are playing a trick on you. They'll never tell you the truth! 
SKEETER You don't know what they've said. 
GRETCHEN Say it, lady, say the word you think every time one us stands in front of you. Nigger. Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen. 
AIBILEEN That's enough, Gretchen. 
GRETCHEN You just as dumb as she is. 
AIBILEEN Get out a my house! 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Aibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely. Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An unwrapped present rests on the coffee table. 
AIBILEEN Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. Then them dogs will stay away. As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles. About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot. Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter. 
SKEETER Well, happy birthday, Aibileen. You should have told me. 
AIBILEEN And, from all over the county, my babies find they way home. Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down next to Skeeter. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Some even from overseas. Alton Spears lives in Paris now. Married him a real pretty French girl. Got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies. 
Aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads the card aloud. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) I still don't drink coffee. Happy Birthday. Love Alton. Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is touched. The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers. Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her. The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen waves back and smiles. Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for Skeeter. She wipes her eye. 
MINNY (CONT'D) I told God I'd never speak of it again. But we got no choice. It's time...Time to tell you both "the terrible awful" I did to Miss Hilly. It might be the only thing to protect us. 
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - KITCHEN - 6 MONTHS EARLIER 
We continue with the earlier flashback where Minny arrives at Hilly's with her famed chocolate pie. Hilly leads Minny into the kitchen, Missus Walters follows behind. Hilly slices a big piece and grabs a fork. She leans against the counter and takes a big bite. 
HILLY Nobody wanted to hire a sass- mouthing, thieving nigra, did they? Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Pie's as good as always, Minny. 
MINNY I'm glad you like it. Hilly cuts another piece for herself. 
HILLY If...I take you back, I'll have to cut your pay five dollars a week. Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly. 
MINNY Take me back? Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice. 
HILLY What do you put in here that makes it taste so good? 
MINNY That good vanilla from Mexico... Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile. 
MINNY (CONT'D) And...something else real special. Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie. 
MINNY (CONT'D) No, Missus Walters. That Miss Hilly's special pie. 
HILLY Momma can have a piece. Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter toward Minny. Minny stops it before it falls to the floor. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Cut her one. 
MINNY 
(IMMEDIATELY) Eat my shit. Hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter. 
HILLY What did you say? 
MINNY I said eat my shit! 
HILLY Have you lost your mind?! Minny moves toward Hilly. 
MINNY No. But you're about to, `cause you just did. Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice. 
HILLY Did what? Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing so hard she has to lower herself to the floor. 
MISSUS WALTERS Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I guess. And you didn't just eat one. You ate two slices! Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in. As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Aibileen and Skeeter are speechless. 
AIBILEEN You trying to get yourself killed?! 
MINNY No! I never planned to tell her! I just wanted to see her take a bite and leave so I could be done with her. Forever! She was never supposed to ask me back. Minny eyes narrow. 
MINNY (CONT'D) And, then for less pay! That got me even madder. And, then she went slid that pie at me. Oh lord! That was it! I just lost control, Aibileen...you know how I get, now. 
MINNY (CONT'D) So, before I knew it, it just came on out my mouth...and I had tolt her what was in that pie. Aibileen looks to Skeeter shaking her head. Minny suddenly gets misty. She wipes her eyes. 
MINNY (CONT'D) I've asked God to forgive me. But, more for what happened to poor Missus Walters. Miss Hilly threw her in that nursing home just for laughing. 
AIBILEEN 
(GRAVELY) We can't put that story in the book. 
SKEETER It's too dangerous, Minny. 
MINNY We need insurance! Hilly Holbrook can't never let people know that pie story is about her. 
AIBILEEN Exactly! If people find out "The Terrible Awful" was you and Miss Hilly, then we in trouble. Trouble there ain't words for! 
MINNY Right! But don't you see? Miss Hilly gone go to her grave convincing people this book ain't about Jackson. Then we safe, insured! Minny gets up and walks toward Aibileen. 
MINNY (CONT'D) You brought me into this, and I'm on finish it! Either put it in or pull my parts out all together. Minny storms out of Aibileen's kitchen. 
INT. HARPER ROW PUBLISHING/PANTRY (INTERCUT) - DAY 
Miss Stein talks to Skeeter on the phone. 
MISS STEIN The last editor's meeting is December 17th. If you want a chance of this getting read, I need it in my hands by then. 
SKEETER But that's in a week, Miss Stein! 
MISS STEIN Otherwise it goes in The Pile. You don't want it in The Pile. 
SKEETER Yes, Ma'am. 
MISS STEIN And you must get a piece in about the domestic who raised you. It'll add something personal to it. Skeeter nods with frustration. 
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Jolene finishes up the winners list. 
JOLENE I hope you enjoy your new set of tires, Missus Atwell. Now, on to the baked goods. Jolene flips a page. 
JOLENE (CONT'D) Oh, yum! Yum! The highest bid in baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's chocolate pie. Congratulations, Hilly Holbrook! The room erupts in applause. Hilly now sits at a table with her family, Missus Walters, and the Leefolts. Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they don't know. Minny clears dishes nearby. Hearing her name, she becomes very alert. 
HILLY What? I didn't bid on anything. Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone signed me up for that pie. 
SKEETER 
(TO STUART) Oh, no. Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred. 
CELIA Congratulations, Hilly! I didn't know you're a fan of Minny's pies. Hilly remains calm. Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve. 
CELIA (CONT'D) I've wanted to talk to you all night. Minny told me why you won't be my friend. You think me and Johnny went behind your back. 
HILLY Let me go! Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through the air. Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands. 
STUART Oh, God. 
CELIA I'm so sorry. 
HILLY 
(GRITTED TEETH) What are you trying to do to me? What are you and that nigra up to? 
Jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice. 
CELIA I don't know what you- 
HILLY -You liar! Who did you tell?! Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but Celia is still yelling. 
CELIA Hilly, I got pregnant after you and Johnny broke up! The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's noses wrinkle. 
MISSUS WALTERS Oh, shit. 
HILLY Shut up, Mother. Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm. Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead. 
CELIA Johnny never cheated on you...At least, not with me. Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water. 
HILLY Johnny would never- 
CELIA And I'm sorry I thought you'd be tickled to win that pie. 
HILLY You tell that nigra if she tells anybody, I will make her suffer. Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen. They all immediately look away. Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking her head back and forth. 
JOHNNY Celia, what's wrong, Honey? 
CELIA Uh-oh. Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet. The entire room gasps in horror. 
JOHNNY Oh, shit! Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and runs for the bathroom. He follows. Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby. 
HILLY Get that cleaned up before it starts to smell. 
AIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. 
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Minny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink filled with sudsy water, washing dishes. Minny approaches from behind as Sugar holds court with five other young girls. 
SUGAR That big-boobed lady Momma works for was drunker than an Injun on payday. Upchucked in front a everbody! As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of her head. 
MINNY Don't you never let me hear you talking bad about the lady who puts food in your mouth. Clothes on your back! You hear me? Minny storms off. 
SUGAR 
(TO HERSELF) You do it all the time. 
EXT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Hilly and William walk to their car. Missus Walters follows closely behind, holding Minny's pie. 
HILLY Just come on home and stay with us tonight, Mother. 
MISSUS WALTERS No thanks, I got a pie to eat. Hilly spins around and sees the pie. 
HILLY You throw that pie away right now! 
MISSUS WALTERS I spent good money on this. Won it just for you... 
HILLY You?! You signed me up? Missus Walters steps up to Hilly. 
MALE HOST (CONT'D) Touching and enlightening, it's filled with testimonials from Mississippi's own housekeepers. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Minny watches transfixed as she and Celia eat dessert in front of the television. 
CELIA Look how cute that dress is. 
MALE HOST Takes place in the fictional town of "Niceville." The book is dedicated to C and T. If you're out there C and T, we'd love to have you on the show because Niceville sounds like Jackson, if you ask me. The host starts laughing. Jolene snaps. 
JOLENE FRENCH It's not Jackson! It's a disgrace to the South! A disgrace to good Southern women who've spent their lives taking care of their help. 
LEEFOLT HOME Smoke rises from the shirt Aibileen is ironing. She snaps to attention, pulls the iron off the burned shirt. 
MALE HOST But did you read that ending? 
JOLENE FRENCH I know I personally treat my help like family, and every one of my friends does the same. 
MALE HOST 
(INTO CAMERA) Bertha, if you're listening, I have a new found respect for what you do. And, believe me, I'll be passin' on dessert at your table! 
FOOTE LIVING ROOM Minny walks like a zombie over to Celia and gathers her dirty plate, never taking her eyes off the television. 
JOLENE FRENCH Do not buy this book! Ladies of Jackson, do not support slander with your husband's hard earned- Poof! Jolene disappears by way of a Seal-Lily ice cream commercial. 
HILLY'S HOME 
HILLY Don't cut her off like that. 
LEEFOLT HOME 
ELIZABETH What's that book called, Aibileen? 
AIBILEEN I...I wasn't paying attention. 
INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER THAT DAY 
Stacks of "The Help" rest on tables in the store. Elizabeth enters, pick up two copies and pulls them close to her body. She races to the register like a teen buying a Playboy. 
TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY Back at the table of books, we see in rapid succession the books quickly disappearing by the hands of Jacksonians. 
INT - AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny sit at the table. Aibileen's phone rings off the wall, but she won't answer. 
SKEETER I knew nothing about it. Miss Stein's P.R. Department called the station directly. 
AIBILEEN Ever maid callin' to say they white lady's gone and bought the book. They so scared. 
MINNY `One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss Hilly in less than a hour. She better read it quick and start the "this ain't Jackson crusade." 
SKEETER Don't count on it. In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book. 
MINNY Oh, she gone read it. Especially after that man made such a stink on the tee-vee. She gone read it. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME/HOLBROOK HOME (INTERCUT) - DAY 
Elizabeth and Hilly read the book aloud over the phone with each other. They stop and nod with speculation. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
A bus is filled with domestics en route to work. Everyone is either reading the book or having it read to them. 
INT. NURSING HOME - NIGHT 
Missus Walters reads to a group of women in the home. 
INT. PHELAN HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Charlotte lies in bed reading the book next to Robert, who is asleep. As she turns a page, her face reveals a dawning realization. Troubled, she starts to wake Robert but doesn't. Charlotte trembles as she brings the book in close to her chest. She slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling. 
EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PORCH - DUSK 
Skeeter sits on the swing with Stuart who's just arrived from the rig, still wearing his dingy work clothes. 
STUART That month felt like a year. I missed you so much. 
SKEETER Me, too. 
STUART Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going back on the rig. Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket and places it in Skeeter's lap. A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires. Skeeter's smile quickly fades as she raises the ring. 
SKEETER Stuart...I have to tell you something. 
STUART How about "yes?!" I had this with me down in New Orleans, you know. Skeeter touches Stuart's face. 
SKEETER I'm serious...and...you have to promise not to tell anyone. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) The voters of Hinds County had spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone have no political career. One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes William's campaign poster taped to the window. 
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Hilly reads the book in bed. William is fast asleep. Suddenly, her eyes widen, her breath becomes heavy. She slowly turns a page and freezes. Her face turns white. Hilly balls both fists, looks to the ceiling and screams louder than humanly possible. 
THE SCREAM CONTINUES OVER: 
INT. SKEETER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Skeeter lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Aibileen lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. 
INT. MINNY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING 
Minny lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. But, this time, Hilly's scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder. Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake. Sugar and Kindra enter, jumping in bed with Minny. 
SUGAR Momma, there's a white man at our door! 
MAN (O.C.) Minny Jackson! Are you in there?! Minny covers the girls with a blanket. She puts on a robe and grabs a bat from behind the door. 
MAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) I can hear you. Open the door. 
INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Minny approaches the door. 
MINNY Who there? 
MAN Johnny Foote. Minny Jackson, I want to talk to you. Open up. Minny slowly opens the door. Johnny is all smiles. 
JOHNNY Finally, I meet Minny Jackson... As Johnny enters, Minny raises the bat and swings. Johnny turns and stops the bat with his hand. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) What the hell are you doin'?! Minny lets go of the bat and cowers on the floor, raises her hands in front of her. 
MINNY Please don't hurt me! My babies are in the house. Johnny drops the bat and pulls Minny up from the floor. 
JOHNNY Calm down, girl. I'm not here to get you. 
He suddenly throws his arms around her and squeezes hard. 
INT. MINNY'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Johnny and Minny sit at her kitchen table. 
JOHNNY When I finally confronted Celia about you, she told me about the baby. All of them. You saved her life. 
MINNY I don't know about that. 
JOHNNY Well, I know the day you came to our house, she started getting better. And I'm not just talking about the cookin' either. 
MINNY You knew I was there? 
JOHNNY Fried chicken and okra on the first night? Y'all should have at least put corn pone on the table. 
MINNY I couldn't make you eat anymore corn pone, Mister Johnny. 
JOHNNY Next morning, I snuck back up to the house, peeked in the window, and there you were. Given ol' Oscar a wipe down. Minny smiles for the first time. 
MINNY So I ain't losing my job? 
JOHNNY You have a job with us for the rest of your life, if you want it. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Bridge is underway at the Leefolt house with the usual suspects, except Skeeter. LOU ANN TEMPLETON has taken her place. Aibileen nervously pours coffee. 
JOLENE FRENCH I heard that Betty character might be Charlene. 
HILLY It's not Jackson, and that book is garbage. I bet the whole thing's made up by some nigra. Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup. 
LOU ANN TEMPLETON And, Jolene, didn't your momma leave Cora to you in her will? 
JOLENE Well, yes...But that's not odd is it? Happens all the time, right? A sudden realization washes over Jolene. 
LOU ANN TEMPLETON Did anybody ever figured out who C and T are? 
HILLY The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON! Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate. Hilly looks up to Aibileen slow and deliberate. 
HILLY (CONT'D) You spilled some, Aibileen. Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and dabs the spilled coffee. Aibileen glances at Hilly. A secret burns between them. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Get me a new plate. One you haven't soiled with a dirty cloth. 
CHARLOTTE Why, Hilly...It's been such a long time, Dear. Everything okay, you two? Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance. 
HILLY Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to- 
CHARLOTTE Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill? Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister. 
HILLY Well, I...I didn't have time to get fixed up before- 
CHARLOTTE Darling, no husband wants to come home and see this. Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) And that...that is horrendous. 
HILLY Missus Phelan, I'm here- 
CHARLOTTE You know, Hilly. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been eating too many...SWEETS? Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte moves in for the kill. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get one of those on our lip. Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother, not knowing what to say. Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into the living room. Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away. 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D) Eugenia? 
SKEETER Yes, Ma'am. 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) Come in here, please. Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room. 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Charlotte pats the sofa as Skeeter enters and sits. 
SKEETER Ma'am? 
CHARLOTTE Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible study? Anything like that? 
SKEETER No, Ma'am. 
CHARLOTTE Good. We're going shopping. Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief. 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) `Cause no single daughter of mine is going to New York, representing the great state of Mississippi, without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe. 
SKEETER What? 
CHARLOTTE I'm very proud of you, Eugenia. 
SKEETER How do you know about New York? 
CHARLOTTE A friend of Constantine's told me. Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help". 
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Would you do me the honor of signing my copy? Skeeter nods. Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen. Her hand trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good it would feel. 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING 
Aibileen washes dishes as the phone begins to ring. She answers. Minny screams on the other end of the line. 
EXT. GAS STATION (INTERCUT) - SAME TIME 
Minny stands barefoot inside a phone booth, her lip swollen, face bleeding. Her kids stand outside, crying. 
MINNY They fired Leroy last night! And when Leroy ask why, his boss say Mister Holbrook told him to do it. Said his nigger wife the reason. 
AIBILEEN Oh, Law! 
MINNY He try to kill me with he bare hands! He threw the kids in the yard, lock me in the bathroom, and say he gone set the house on fire. 
AIBILEEN Where are you now?! 
MINNY The gas station. I climbed out the window, and we all ran here. 
AIBILEEN I'm on come there now. 
MINNY Wait, Aibileen...I'm pregnant. 
AIBILEEN Minny, now, you listen to me. That baby gone be fine, and you ain't never gone lose your job. Mister Johnny told you that hisself. They's more book money coming. Your baby ain't gone know about gettin' beat. You hear me? You free, Minny! You are free. Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) You hear me? 
MINNY I hear you... The Leefolt front door opens. Elizabeth calls out. 
ELIZABETH (O.C.) Aibileen? 
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Aibileen enters to find Elizabeth and Hilly staring at her. Elizabeth is two weeks WAY PAST DUE. 
AIBILEEN Good morning. Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table, drawing Aibileen's attention to it. 
HILLY Aibileen, the silver I lent Elizabeth last week.

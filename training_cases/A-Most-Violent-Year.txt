1981 was the most violent year in NYC history as recorded by overall Crime Index in relation to population. 
JANUARY 31, 1981 Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. The light spills in and we see. 
EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC - SUNRISE 
Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with his morning jog. 
EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY 
It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug boats. 
JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its way to the dock in front of the tanker truck. 
JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of the head and no words. 
They connect the hose and start a large generator as it begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the horizon again as the sun begins to come up. 
EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME 
ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings. 
INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor. 
INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY 
STANDARD HEATING OIL, "We set the Standard" is written in logo form on the side of the tank. 
The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor. 
JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the toll booth and pays. 
JULIAN Good morning. 
JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a smile. He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps. 
The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing masks. It's very brazen. 
Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw. 
INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME 
Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain- link gate with a small sign that says "STANDARD HEATING OIL: WE SET THE STANDARD". The DISPATCHER opens the gate. 
They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit. ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not want to cross this woman. 
ABEL Ready? ANNA Yes. 
ABEL You look very nice. 
ANNA Thank you. 
JOSEPH And you have brought the money? (ABEL nodes yes) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction? (MORE) 
JOSEPH (CONT'D) No extensions, no... contingencies whatsoever. ABEL I understand. 
JOSEPH I want you to know this up front. I am a very fair man but I believe in honoring contracts. You will fulfill your end of this contract and the property is yours. If you can't we will keep your money and will sell it to your competitor who has been chasing us almost as badly as you have. I like you, but know that the only reason I am choosing you is because of the favorable terms of this contract. So this is business... and when you sign this.... 
ABEL I understand. 
JOSEPH Well then, let's see this money, and then I will sign these papers. 
ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake hands. 
EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM PARKING LOT - DAY 
ABEL stands next to ANDREW's car. 
ANDREW WALSH Congratulations. 
ABEL It's not ours yet. 
ANDREW WALSH Well, it was a hell of a job just getting them to this point. It's a good day for us. Take a walk around. Enjoy it for a second. 
ANDREW gets in his car and drives away. ABEL looks around and decides to go for a little walk. 
He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view. It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his watch. 
INT. 1981 MERCEDES 500 SEC 
ABEL drives away from New York City. We see it behind his head. 
INT. CAR ON MERRITT PARKWAY 
The terrain turns to upscale country. 
EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY 
ABEL's car drives into a long driveway through the woods. Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under construction, appears. He pulls up in front. 
He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large house. He walks into the house and we see more clearly that it is nearing completion. It is empty. 
INT. 80'S MODERN HOUSE - DAY 
ABEL walks over to the massive floor-to-ceiling windows and stands looking over the large pond that sits down the hill from the house. As he stares out his CONTRACTOR comes quietly walking in behind him. 
CONTRACTOR Hello? 
ABEL There he is. 
He walks up behind him and they both look out in silence for a beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You have done a beautiful job here. 
CONTRACTOR Thank you. 
ABEL I mean it. You and your men should be very proud. 
CONTRACTOR We are. 
ABEL Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. You are a lucky man. 
CONTRACTOR I am. 
ABEL Well I thank you... my family will be very happy here. 
CONTRACTOR I hope so. 
ABEL Now I think I owe you some money. CONTRACTOR That may be true. 
ABEL It is. 
ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick envelope of cash. As he does we see a transformation of his personality from pleasant philosopher to a direct voice of unquestioned authority. 
ABEL (CONT'D) This is the seventeen outstanding. But we are arriving here in four days. It must be done. 
CONTRACTOR Yes. 
ABEL Well, I'll let you go. 
He says this as he leads him to the door. 
ABEL (CONT'D) And the tile in the master bath... 
He watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital room. He enters. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 
ABEL walks into the room and looks at JULIAN. He looks up and ABEL has trouble putting it to words. 
ABEL I have to get going. 
JULIAN gives a nod. ABEL (CONT'D) Can we get you anything? 
Nods no. 
ABEL (CONT'D) We'll pick you up when they let you out of here. 
They look at each other. 
ABEL (CONT'D) These men are cowards. Too weak to make a living... or even fight with their own hands, and too stupid to think up anything else to do. 
Finally he turns and leaves. 
EXT. ABANDONED RACETRACK PARKING LOT - QUEENS NY - DAY 
ABEL drives up to the drop off scene. There is the large bulk transport truck and one lone police car just sitting in the middle of the parking lot. 
ABEL gets out, walks up, and stops to stare at the truck. A young beat cop is sitting on the hood of his car waiting. ABEL May I take it? 
BEAT COP Excuse me? 
ABEL May I take it now? 
BEAT COP Is it yours? 
ABEL Yes. 
BEAT COP Well, I'm sorry about that. Once the owner or an owner's representative files the claim form in Corona she's yours... again. 
ABEL So you guys have done what you needed to? 
BEAT COP Yes. 
ABEL And what was that? 
BEAT COP I'm sorry? 
ABEL You just said you've done what you needed to... so what was it that you've done? 
BEAT COP (looks back dumbfounded) 
ABEL Did you fingerprint or anything? 
BEAT COP No need, these guys always wear gloves. 
ABEL So you've done nothing. 
BEAT COP I'm not exactly sure, I just got here at four. My shift is actually up. 
ABEL So who's coming? 
They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up and we see he knows his way around the truck. He goes up top and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty. 
BEAT COP Sorry. 
The cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away. 
BEAT COP (CONT'D) Why did they want it? 
ABEL They stole the $6,000 of fuel that was in it. 
The cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea. The sun is setting. 
EXT. STANDARD HEATING TRUCK YARD - DAY 
A sign on the inside of the gate reads. "It's not safety first... It's safety always". The motor on the gate starts in and it opens. In drives ABEL'S car. 
INT. ANNA'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY 
ANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. She is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk. We can see that she is in her comfort zone. 
INT. BROOKLYN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
The ASSISTANT D.A. is sitting behind his desk as DEPUTY LANGE stands off to the side. He is only in his early thirties but with confidence and ego to spare. They know each other. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE I'm just looking here through these reports. It looks like out of the nineteen registered heating oil companies in the city your trucks have been getting hit three to one. ABEL Yes? 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE So are you maybe doing something to bring this on yourself? 
ANDREW WALSH Like what? 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE Like enter a new market? 
ABEL I am always trying to expand my business. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE Of course. But I think you understand what I'm saying... there are always some markets that are more difficult than others to enter. 
ABEL Every new market is a difficult market. (MORE) 
ABEL (CONT'D) But my driver was assaulted and my truck and oil were stolen in broad daylight in front of fifteen toll collectors and six police officers yesterday. And yet no one saw anything. That is a problem... no? 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE I have a lot of problems coming across my desk every day Mr. Morales. 
ABEL I'm sure you do. 
INT. HALLWAY OF BROOKLYN D.A. COURT BUILDING - DAY 
ABEL walks out in front of ANDREW. 
ANDREW WALSH Abel. Abel. 
He stops and turns. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) (his words escape him) 
ABEL Exactly. 
ANDREW WALSH No... let's not overreact. We don't even know what they are bringing against us. It could be total bullshit, and they are just trying to use us along the way. This isn't anything yet. 
ABEL I know. 
INT. ANNA'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY 
ANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. She is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk. We can see that she is in her comfort zone. ABEL enters. 
ANNA How'd it go? 
ABEL The DA... He said he's going to bring down charges on us next week. 
ANNA For what? 
ABEL We don't know yet. ANNA Who else? 
ABEL Right now they are just saying us. 
Beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Where are we exposed? 
ANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. 
ABEL Anna? 
ANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. 
Beat. 
ABEL Okay. 
INT. HOSPITAL LONG HALLWAY - DAY 
ABEL walks down the long hallway and enters a room. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
JULIAN is sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting. His jaw is in bandages, and there are crutches sitting next to him, but he looks much better than the previous day. They look at each other intensely but say nothing. 
INT. SHIT-HOLE TENEMENT STAIRWELL - DAY ABEL is helping JULIAN up the stairs. They struggle together. Finally they get to the top floor and stand outside apartment number . JULIAN stops, not really wanting to open the door in front of his boss. 
ABEL I'm very sorry this happened. Do you need anything else? (JULIAN nods no) If you do, you call the office... Okay then. 
He turns to leave and walks back to the stairs. 
JULIAN Abel? 
ABEL turns and looks at him. 
All six raise a glass. 
ABEL (CONT'D) A toast to our new home. It's as beautiful as my wife and daughters and as strong as me...(kids laugh) May we be happy, prosperous and safe here. Cheers. 
INT. GYMNASIUM GIRLS YOUTH SOCCER GAME - NEXT MORNING 
ABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee to come out of the snack bar. Over his shoulder we hear... 
PETER FORENTE So you made the move? 
ABEL turns and sees PETER FORENTE standing there. He's in his mid-forties, very well-dressed, and handsomely bald. 
ABEL Peter... it's official as of yesterday. 
COUNTER PERSON Sir. ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to the side from everyone else. 
PETER FORENTE So I heard about your rig getting picked off again. ABEL Yes. 
PETER FORENTE We should probably get together to discuss this and go over some of the preventative measures that we've been taking. We haven't had an incident since November. It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us. 
They both stare out at the court for beat. PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) So I think I may have seen one of your new trucks the other day. 
They look at each other. 
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) Out near here, at the Miller Road diner? 
ABEL That's possible. 
PETER FORENTE The driver looked like a member of the Hitler Youth. I haven't seen a teamster that blond and blue-eyed since I was a kid. 
ABEL He's from Ohio. Played football. I like my drivers to fit in with the neighborhood... 
PETER FORENTE That's new territory for you, no? 
This brings them both back in to look at each other. 
ABEL Just picked up a few new accounts over there. Weekend houses of some old clients from in the city. 
PETER gives a bit of a stronger look. Then finally turns back towards the field. 
PETER FORENTE Which one is yours? ABEL Right there. 
They look out. 
PETER FORENTE She's beautiful. 
ABEL Thank you. 
PETER FORENTE Welcome to the neighborhood. You should be proud. ABEL Proud? 
PETER FORENTE Yes. 
INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY 
The garage is filled with boxes. ABEL stands in the middle of a few that are partially unpacked. He has set up an old radio in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York Giants football game. ABEL takes an object out of one of the boxes and looks at it with significance. 
Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ABEL'S oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage. 
ANNIE Dad. Mr. Walsh is here. 
ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there. He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost to the ceiling around them. 
ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in but your phone doesn't seem to be working. 
ABEL It's not set up yet... So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night. ANDREW WALSH No... It looks like they are coming after us. 
ABEL That describes many people at this point. 
Slight smile. 
ANDREW WALSH The D.A. 
ABEL How bad? ANDREW WALSH I still haven't seen it yet. But my guy in his office just gave me a heads up an hour ago. It's not good. 
ABEL Where are we exposed? 
ANDREW WALSH I'm not sure, a couple places probably. 
ABEL A couple places? 
This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the door to the house and calls for his wife. 
ANNA What's he doing? 
ABEL is now standing up to go look. ABEL Quiet... don't worry. It's nothing. 
ANNA tries to go back to sleep. 
INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall to his kids' rooms. He looks in each room and the CHILD is sleeping soundly with nothing out of place. 
INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME 
As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down over the balcony into the living room. The dog is starting to quietly growl once again. 
ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to total paranoia. He slowly walks down the hall. He stops off in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy club. Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying not to freak himself out. 
INT. OPEN LIVING ROOM/ENTRY HALL/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 
ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the top, still growling every now and then. ABEL comes into the living room and everything seems perfectly normal. He then relaxes and turns towards the dog. 
ABEL Quiet. It's nothing. Come down here. 
He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes down the stairs. 
ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but then the dog starts growling again and looking out the windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the front door but the dog refuses to go out. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Go. Oh come on. Go. 
ABEL thinks he hears something. He clicks on the lights and pulls his bat back up into position. He heads outside. 
EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing. The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side entrance. It is dark. The dog starts barking and going crazy. ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway. 
All hell now breaks lose. A BURGLAR, in all black, comes blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster than we expect. 
EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS 
There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running full throttle through the very thick woods. ABEL is keeping up with him and in fact may be gaining on him. 
ABEL is still in his pajamas. He has a rage that has been building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down. They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of an easier/quicker path down. 
EXT. WOODS BEHIND ABEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his legs. BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ABEL falls as he swings at him. They both sit on the ground for a beat. ABEL is exhausted. They stare at each other. 
A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. Then he is up again and running off into the woods. 
ABEL gets himself up and chases after him. 
EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT 
ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with its lights and engine on. The guy gets into the passenger side of the van, and it peels out. 
ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able to breathe and holding the bat. 
EXT. ABEL FRONT DOOR - NIGHT ABEL comes walking back towards his front door. ANNA is standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next to her. She looks at him in shock. 
ANNA Where were you? 
ABEL (looking to the dog) A lot of help you were. 
ANNA Abel? 
They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice. His feet are bleeding all over the walkway. 
INT. POWDER ROOM OF ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
ANNA is in warrior mode. Any panic in her voice has disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly seriousness. She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting bandages on them as they talk. 
ANNA Who was it? 
ABEL What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was? 
She gives him a look. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I don't know. 
She gives him another look. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I think it was just some punk, looking to rip us off. 
ANNA If you... 
ABEL Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have... and he didn't. 
She drops the mail. And goes right up to her daughter. CATHERINE Mommy. 
As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little hands. ANNA is besides herself. 
ANNA Where did you get this? Catherine where did you find this? 
CATHERINE Right here. 
The little girl points over towards the bushes near the side door where LOUIS SERVIDIO was hiding and got hit the night before. 
ANNA Show me. 
The little girl walks over to bushes and kneels down. 
CATHERINE It was just sitting right here. 
ANNA turns to the middle daughter, ELIZABETH. 
ANNA Did you see this? ELIZABETH Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it. 
ANNA Maria! ANNA yells towards in the house. 
ELIZABETH What is it? 
ANNA walks towards the front door to retrieve the NANNY MARIA. 
ANNA Maria! 
ELIZABETH Mom, is it real? 
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY ABEL is sitting down at his desk. ANNA comes to the door. She gets his attention and then walks right up to the desk. She puts the handgun down right in front of him. 
ABEL What is that? 
ANNA A gun... It's a gun Abel. 
ABEL Where did you get it? 
ANNA Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. She was playing with it. 
ABEL is totally speechless. 
ANNA (CONT'D) It's loaded... with the safety off. 
This sits like a bomb in the room. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Those weren't kids looking to rip off our TV Abel, that was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our windows! What the hell is going on here? 
ABEL Let me see that. I'll take care of this. ANNA Damn right we will. Who is this? 
ABEL I don't know, but I will take care of it. 
ANNA What does that mean you will take care of it. This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. This is your daughter playing with a loaded gun! He turns back quickly. And stares at her. 
ABEL (YELLS) I know what it is! 
He slowly walks back across the room and picks up the gun. His hand shows a shake ever so slightly as he touches it. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Let me deal with this. 
ANNA You better. Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved. 
This causes him to stop in his tracks. He turns very seriously. 
ABEL You are not to tell your father about this. 
She looks back at him with a tinge of a smile. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Do you hear me. ANNA'S look changes and she understands. 
ANNA ...I won't. 
ANDREW comes to the door and knocks. ANDREW WALSH Can I talk with you both? 
ANNA I found a gun outside our front door. Somebody left it there last night. 
ANDREW WALSH Who? 
ABEL I don't know. 
ANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust. ANDREW WALSH Well... 
BILL O'LEARY It will stop immediately. 
ABEL No, it won't. 
He resets, again. BILL O'LEARY You seem to be under pressure from many sides right now... which I understand. Trust me I understand. So let me think this through. But whatever decision I make on this, it stands. Those men show up every morning for you because I tell them to. It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. It's not like when we were driving. 
ABEL Yes. 
BILL O'LEARY Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right tools. 
ABEL It may seem that way... but if you are weak eventually it will show... it always does. And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me. 
BILL O'LEARY It's not always as simple as it appears. 
ABEL I'm sure that's true. 
BILL O'LEARY It is... well, I got to get going. 
ABEL Thank you for coming Bill. 
EXT. GATE AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY 
O'LEARY walks over to ANDREW as he is getting in his car. 
ANDREW WALSH How did that go? 
BILL O'LEARY Not well. ANDREW WALSH He feels very strongly about this. 
BILL O'LEARY I can see that. 
ANDREW WALSH I don't think he fully understands it. 
BILL O'LEARY What's to understand? 
ANDREW WALSH It's illegal. 
BILL O'LEARY It's not illegal if I say it isn't. My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I care about that I can't do my job. That can not and will not continue. 
ANDREW WALSH I understand. 
BILL O'LEARY So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. This is very serious. Just know that. 
ANDREW thinks this through. 
ANDREW WALSH How would this work? 
BILL O'LEARY What does that mean? 
ANDREW WALSH I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting. 
BILL O'LEARY Are you kidding me with this? 
ANDREW WALSH No. BILL O'LEARY Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun. 
ANDREW WALSH And a permit? O'LEARY nods yes. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) When? 
BILL O'LEARY By Friday. 
ANDREW WALSH Are the permits legit? 
BILL O'LEARY That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. 
ANDREW WALSH Who is it? 
BILL O'LEARY I don't fucking know... 
ANDREW WALSH I'll talk to him. 
INT. MORALES' GARAGE - DAY 
ANNA is struggling through the boxes in the garage. She moves some things and then finds what she is looking for. A pile of about nine matching file boxes that are all labeled the same. It is their off the books bookkeeping. 
INT. STUDY/LIBRARY OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY 
The library is filled with custom made bookshelves that are still waiting to be filled. There is a large desk sitting in the corner that hasn't been fully unpacked yet. 
ANNA comes in struggling carrying the file boxes from the garage, she piles them on the desk. She looks around her feet at the pile, it's literally the skeletons from her closet. She resets, walks over to the window to look out over her new beautiful home. Then she turns back at the pile of boxes that hold their past and their future. 
EXT. LONG SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY 
ABEL Jesus. 
ANNA I mean it. We can't just leave it here. 
EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT 
ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on the side of the road. 
He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares back at him. ABEL walks back to the car. 
ANNA Is it dead? 
ABEL No. 
ANNA Well you need... 
ABEL I know. 
He reaches down to open the trunk. 
ANNA What are you doing? 
ABEL Getting the tire iron! This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on edge. 
ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on something, or many things. He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it. Then he sits with the animal a beat longer. 
We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron waiting... BANG! BANG! 
Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder. He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special- style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the pistol. The deer is dead. 
He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun? She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car. He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road. 
INT. ABEL'S DAMAGED CAR - NIGHT 
ANNA is sitting in the car waiting. We hear ABEL'S footsteps as he approaches the open driver's side door. He gets in without saying a word. We stay with them as they drive on in silence. 
INT. MORALES HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The door opens and ABEL walks in. ANNA is already in the house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting. 
ANNA Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. They were fine? 
NANNY MARIA Oh yes. All is good. 
ANNA Great, thank you. We'll see you in the morning then. 
NANNY MARIA Okay. NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod. ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each other. 
ANNA What? 
ABEL What? 
ANNA Yes... what? 
ABEL Are you kidding? 
ANNA No. ABEL Okay then... what is this gun? 
ANNA I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... I did something about it. 
ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the room from each other. He just waits... finally. 
ABEL Where did you get it? 
ANNA You know where I got it. 
ABEL Do you have a permit? 
ANNA Not yet. This sets him off. He comes walking across the room at her as if he might hit her. He gets closer and closer. 
ABEL You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. You are trying to protect your children? Protect them? Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing? 
He is now standing right over her. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You dress yourself up in these fancy clothes, and look at you here in your mansion. I've given you everything you could possibly want but you still can't stop thinking like the Brooklyn corner-store gangster's daughter that you are. 
ANNA You've given me? You? Are you delusional? Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound? 
They are really going at it now. He tries to grab her purse, which she still has over her shoulder. They struggle for it. 
ABEL Where is this thing? Let me see it. 
ABEL comes down the hall carrying file boxes and brings them out onto the deck. ANNA comes out onto the deck as he is looking over the edge. 
ANNA Where are you going? ABEL Bring the last few out. 
ANNA You've got three minutes. 
ABEL What's going on out there. 
ANNA Our guests are leaving. 
ABEL tries to speak but can only shake his head. Finally he jumps over the edge and she starts handing boxes down to him. He then stops again. 
ABEL Do we even need to be doing this? What exactly are we hiding here? 
She thinks this through. 
ANNA I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to. 
EXT. GROUND BELOW DECK 
The camera is now on the ground level with ABEL. 
ABEL Is that the last one. Get back out there. 
ABEL looks around for a place to stash them. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
ABEL exhales then takes three of the boxes and sneaks off into the woods. We follow him as he struggles. Finally he gets to a small clearing and starts to stack them. 
EXT. FRONT LAWN - DAY 
ANNA is standing out front trying to hand out goody bags and to maintain pleasantries with the parents as they leave. 
ANNA Thank you for coming. Here you go. Bye, Rebecca. Thanks. I'm sorry. Bye. 
When the last one goes she looks up at the ASST. DA to give him the all-clear. But as she does she gives him a look that could kill. The police file into the house in front of her. 
EXT. UNDERNEATH THE DECK - DAY 
ABEL has placed the load of file boxes underneath the deck and is putting the last one in place. He sits down on the pile and looks out into the woods in sadness. 
INT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE 
ANNA is looking around the house as the cops search through everything. She seems oddly calm. She decides that they are being respectful and heads out into the driveway. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY ANNA walks outside and stands, waiting. LAWRENCE comes out of the house and stands near her. They wait. 
ANNA This is probably one that you are going to regret. 
LAWRENCE looks at her trying to figure her out. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE Excuse me? 
ANNA My husband is a very honorable man. Coming on a Saturday? It's very aggressive. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE This is standard. 
ANNA Really? I know you think you are just doing your job. But we are not what you think we are. And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends. 
She gives him a long, almost scary look. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE I think I know your father. ANNA Good for you. My husband is not my father. Not even close. So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. This was very disrespectful... and you are not going to find a fucking thing. 
With that she walks back towards the house as the POLICE start filing out. 
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE - MORNING 
ABEL is sitting at his desk looking out the window as the trucks come and go. As he looks across the lot he sees JULIAN coming walking across towards the locker room. A smile crosses ABEL'S face. 
INT. STANDARD HEATING OIL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS As ABEL comes out into the hallway SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking by his door. ABEL stops to check in. 
ABEL Hey, how are you? 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Good. A bit nervous. I'm heading out on my first calls alone today. 
ABEL You'll do great. Remember... When you get them there. Hold the eye contact longer than you would like... but you watch what happens. 
He gives him a big smile and a pat on the back and sends him on his way. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Good luck. 
HUSBAND It's just outside on the other side of this wall here. 
MRS. ROSE I'm going to head up. Can I get you something to drink? Coffee... tea? 
The KID gives himself an ever-so-tiny smile. SALES STUDENT ALEX Tea would be great. 
The man walks over to a back basement door and opens it. He ushers the SALES KID through. 
HUSBAND Please. 
I/E. DOORWAY OZONE PARK BASEMENT - DAY 
As the SALES KID goes through the door a massive fist of SOMEONE who has been waiting on the other side of the door comes swinging into frame and pounds the side of our KID'S head. Knocking him out instantly. 
INT. TRUCK CAB, 59TH STREET BRIDGE RAMP - DAY 
JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to feel better. Just as the traffic in front of him starts to clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something. In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of a random car behind him. His heart starts racing. He looks over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up. Again. 
JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO. 
JULIAN Cathy! They are coming again. Over. Help. Help. On Bridge. 
He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab. He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are still coming for him. 
The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to know what he is doing with it. 
But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO sees him and is very surprised and stops. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there. 
He glances over at THUG #2. JULIAN Get the fuck away from me! 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Okay, man. 
People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk. Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way and is hiding behind the wheel. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Watch it now, man. You're going to hurt someone. 
JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. He is hiding back in front of the truck. The three men are basically doing a slow- motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. The two THUGS now have their guns out. 
The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic is backing up. Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. He tries to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN to protect THUG #2. They miss as well, but one hits the main section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating oil starts pouring out onto the roadway. 
Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the background. This adds a new element. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Where are you? 
THUG #2 Over here. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Where is he? 
THUG #2 Over here. 
JULIAN is just trying to decide what to do next. The sirens are now getting much closer. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Get the car! THUG #2 takes off. This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. As he does: 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Run for it! JULIAN thinks for a second and then runs. 
EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY 
JULIAN runs all along the bridge and then sees LOUIS SERVIDIO run through a small door into the body of one of the four massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge. 
INT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE, SUPPORT COLUMN - DAY 
Once he is inside, there's another set of stairs. He locks the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs. As he heads down he hears someone just in front of him. He stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and looking up at him about three flights away is LOUIS SERVIDIO. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Oh, there he is. Had to be the hero eh? 
JULIAN Fuck you. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Couldn't just let us take the truck. 
JULIAN Fuck you! 
JULIAN is screaming in a fit of panic at this point. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Hey man relax... calm down. Did they see you come in here? 
JULIAN can't stop breathing very heavy at this point. 
JULIAN I don't think so. 
They both smile. His father is an old-school gangster. 
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) A bunch of thugs invaded our home when I was a baby... My mother was there with us... My brother remembers it. Nothing happened. They were trying to scare my father. They ended up just leaving and we never found out who it was. But after that we moved to a fortress just like this. And those guys who let you in. They are here to shoot anyone who isn't invited. 
ABEL I refuse to live my life that way. I won't do it... I am going to ask for a meeting. 
They both look out and think it through a bit. 
PETER FORENTE Who? 
ABEL Anyone with more than 20k of storage. Can I count on you being there? 
PETER looks away for a long beat. 
PETER FORENTE Yes... When are you closing on the terminal? 
ABEL Monday. 
PETER FORENTE Congratulations. ABEL Hold that... it's not done yet... you may be hearing from me. (Trailed by an awkward laugh.) 
PETER FORENTE Well, good luck. 
ABEL stands up ready to go. 
ABEL Thank you for seeing me. I want more than this... 
PETER FORENTE I know you do. My father is in jail... as you know. And I have always wanted to conduct myself differently than he did. 
ABEL And you have. 
PETER FORENTE Almost exclusively, yes. But I know why he did what he did. Because at the time it's easier. 
ABEL But it's not. 
PETER FORENTE Yes it is. You are a good man. I will see what I can find out. This isn't good for any of us. 
ABEL Thank you. 
EXT. PETER FORENTE'S DRIVEWAY - DAY ABEL is walking across the beautifully-manicured driveway, and as he gets nearer to his car he starts to hear the mayhem that is coming from the CB radio in the front seat. As he gets closer he gets more and more details. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. Where is the truck now? RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. It's still on the bridge. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. Is it still leaking oil? 
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. No. They have stopped the leak. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. Did it reach the river? 
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. Some did. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. How many shots were fired? 
ABEL now slams open the door and gets into the driver side and picks up the microphone. 
ABEL Joanne it's me. What are you talking about... what shots? 
The camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking back at ABEL through the windshield. The mansion is looming in the background. We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the news of the incident on the bridge. The camera pulls back as ABEL'S face goes totally cold. 
INT. COURT ROOM - DAY 
ABEL walks into an almost empty courtroom. LAWRENCE is packing up his things at the front of the room. They catch each others eye. ABEL makes his way forward as everyone else leaves. They look at each other for a beat. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE I heard. 
ABEL I need to make sure you know that we had nothing to do with this. It's not the way I do business. In fact I have been warning my men against doing this sort of thing. It is terrible for me. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE It's not good... for either of us. ABEL Yes. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE In my job we use whatever leverage we can gain, as I'm sure you do in your business. It's an ongoing investigation, and it will be just one piece of many. So while I appreciate you coming here... I have nothing I can tell you. 
LAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says nothing, just waiting. A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D) What a fucking mess this place is... Do you know where he is? 
ABEL No... but I'll find him. 
A.D.A. LAWRENCE You should. And when you do, bring him to us. A situation like this, happening in such a dangerous and public way, within an industry I'm charged with cleaning up. It's very bad for me... professionally speaking. 
They look at each other one last time. ABEL gets the message. 
EXT. SMALL QUIET SIDE STREET, QUEENS - DAY 
SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking down the street looking terrible. His clothes are ruined by garbage, and he is scared. As he approaches his car his face drops. 
ABEL No... I'm not... They're out. 
This gets her attention. ANNA Who? 
ABEL The bank. 
With that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops him. 
ANNA So what does that mean? 
ABEL It means we need to find the money somewhere else. 
ANNA We have two days! 
ABEL I'll figure it out. 
INT. ANNA'S CAR, WESTCHESTER SCENIC HIGHWAY - DAY 
ABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. ANNA is in the passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. ANNA and ABEL do not look any better. In fact there is now a tinge of anger mixed into the sadness. 
The DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room in the back seat. 
DAUGHTERS Move. 
ANNA Quiet. 
DAUGHTERS You move. 
ANNA turns and snaps at them a bit. ANNA Stop. I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this... but since the second you all woke up. It's this, it's that. Just stop. The world does not revolve around you! This shuts them up for a beat. ABEL is seething. But then ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. ANNA sees it and freaks. 
ANNA (CONT'D) That's it Annie we've told you... 
Before ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls the car off the side of the highway into the grass. Everyone in the car is taken aback. The road is a smaller scenic highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by right next to them. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
ABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. He walks around the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway. He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE from the car. They stand behind the car and go at it with the traffic flying by. ABEL is louder than he has been in the entire film. He is losing it from all the pressure but his daughter bears the brunt. 
ABEL You are thirteen years old. What are you doing? Your mother asks you an hour ago to help her get out of the house smoothly and you are acting like an... 
ANNIE Oh fuck you! 
ABEL What? What? What are you talking about? 
ABEL is looking around for someone to help him and witness this. He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up in her face. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I'm not sure who the hell you think you are, but you don't talk to me that way... You are in serious danger of becoming a rich little spoiled brat and I can tell you from experience there is nothing worse in the world than a rich little girl who thinks the whole world revolves around her. ANNIE is yelling back over the traffic. 
ANNIE The world revolves around me? Me! What about her? And what about you? You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing! 
This stings. He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. But he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling again. ABEL First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. And we help people stay warm... which isn't all that bad. (now he is yelling again) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up... So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again! 
ANNA Stop!! 
They both look over and ANNA is standing there. A calmness suddenly falls down on all of them. 
INT. ANNA'S CAR ON HIGHWAY - DAY All five of them are sitting in the car, sadness prevails. 
INT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT 
The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. She is deep in it crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. 
ABEL Hey. 
She looks up with a small but sweet smile. 
ANNA Hi. 
ABEL How's it coming? 
ANNA I've made it to 1975. 
ABEL That was a good year. 
ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? 
ANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... Turns out I kinda knew what I was doing. 
They give each other a slight smile. 
ANDREW WALSH Good. Your background check with us says you have never been arrested, is that true? 
JULIAN Why is this putting everything at risk? 
ANDREW WALSH Have you ever been arrested? 
JULIAN No. 
ANDREW WALSH Because no bank will touch us right now. So we can't close on the new property. And he's going to lose everything on his deposit. 
This sits heavily on JULIAN. ANDREW hands him a card. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) This is a lawyer who will meet you when they bring you to the station. You no longer work for us. You've been fired. But Abel wants to pay for the lawyer. So... this guy should be able to help you. Good luck. 
With that JULIAN gets out of the car. ABEL is standing there. They meet. 
JULIAN I'm sorry. 
ABEL I know. JULIAN I was scared. 
ABEL I know. 
JULIAN Aren't you scared? 
ABEL Sometimes. 
JULIAN What do you do? 
ABEL thinks this through long and hard. 
ABEL I have always been much more scared of failure than anything else. 
JULIAN I... 
ABEL It wasn't always like this. 
JULIAN Are you ruined? ABEL Not today... but by the end of the week... maybe. 
JULIAN I'm sorry. ABEL Good... 
JULIAN No... I am not strong. 
ABEL That does not have to be true. 
JULIAN Trust me... I am not... I'm sorry. 
With that JULIAN walks across the parking lot towards the POLICE to turn himself in. ANDREW walks up behind ABEL and stands there looking. ANDREW WALSH I'm late. I will meet you at four. 
ABEL I'm gonna try to get us a little more time. 
The three COPS are standing waiting as JULIAN walks towards them. ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his eyes in sadness. 
With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to the COPS, then he stops. 
COP 1 Hey. 
ABEL'S face tells us he knows what is coming. 
JULIAN sets off running. Before the COPS can get close to him he is off. ABEL turns and sees what is happening. He does not follow chase. His head just drops. 
EXT. VARIOUS 1980'S URBAN DECAY LANDSCAPES We are now with JULIAN again, running. But as this chase continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to a creeping sense of evil. He does not know how it has come to this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning. 
As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed sections of Queens, he just never stops. With each step his fear turns to... anger. 
EXT. BLOWN-OUT BUILDING 
He stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building wall just as a COP CAR drives by. He starts to almost cry, but then it again becomes something else. His survival instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become of it. Anger. 
INT. OLDEST HASIDIC BUSINESSMAN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
ABEL sits across from the oldest Hasidic member of the family, JOSEPH, from the first scene. ABEL Thank you for seeing me. 
JOSEPH Of course. 
ABEL I need more time. 
JOSEPH Of course you do. 
ABEL I know our agreement doesn't allow for that. But... I need more time. 
JOSEPH Why? 
ABEL I need $500,000. SAUL and his GRANDDAUGHTER look at each other. They say nothing but clearly know each other well. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ Would you give us a minute. 
ABEL Of course. 
INT. WAITING AREA, OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
ABEL sits in a simple chair outside the conference room looking around at an office that is similar to his. A phone on the receptionist's desk rings. She picks it up. 
LEFKOWITZ RECEPTIONIST You can go back in. 
INT. SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
ABEL sits down. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year. (MORE) 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) And we would need a five-year straight wholesale holding agreement for 250,000 gallons a year at your new facility. 
This hits ABEL hard. 
ABEL Okay. Thank you. They shake hands and then he hugs the old man good bye. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ So, I guess we will see you tonight? 
ABEL Tonight? Oh yes, of course. 
INT. LONG ISLAND ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A HOSTESS leads ABEL and ANDREW through the whole main dining room and through a side kitchen. 
INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Finally they come through a door and into a small back private dining room where fifteen of their COMPETITORS, a couple of whom we have already met (Including LORRAINE and SAUL LEFKOWITZ, and ARNOLD KLINE), are sitting around the table meeting and waiting for them to arrive. The whole room looks up at them. 
O'LEARY is at the head of the table at the far end of the room. He stands up to greet them and then so does the rest of the room. 
BILL O'LEARY Abel. Please sit. 
Finally everyone settles and the room falls quiet. 
BILL O'LEARY (CONT'D) Abel. 
Now the room is silent as it waits and waits for him to speak. 
ABEL Stop... 
ABEL is deadly serious. He just lets this sit and looks around the room at each person. They all seem to be waiting for him to continue. But he doesn't. He just lets this sit. Finally PETER FORENTE, who is across from ABEL, shifts in his seat and leans forward. 
PETER FORENTE Um... Abel... we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here and... of course everyone in this room is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds, but... the conclusion we have come to... I should say we are fairly convinced after a very frank conversation... that these guys who are doing this... that they don't actually work for anyone in this room. As you know there are many other smaller providers in the area that might be responsible who are not here tonight. 
This sits in the room for a long beat. Everyone then shifts back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response. Finally. ABEL Peter... thank you... That may be true. 
He stops and thinks about how to continue. 
ABEL (CONT'D) But over the last six months 110,000 gallons of fuel has been stolen from my family and I. Now the reason we asked Bill to get you all here is because the people in this room are the only people within two hundred miles of here who have the ability to purchase and store that kind of quantity. So... no matter what bullshit you have been telling each other one of you... or two... or three... has been allowing this to happen by buying this from these cowards or worse yet hiring these guys just to do it. And profiting from it. So what I am saying is... Stop! Now. Have some pride in what you do and stop. 
INT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. She is deep in it crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. 
ABEL Hey. 
She looks up with a small but sweet smile. 
ANNA Hi. 
ABEL How's it coming? 
ANNA I've made it to 1975. 
ABEL That was a good year. ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? 
ANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... I guess I knew what I was doing. 
They give each other a slight smile. 
ANNA (CONT'D) How'd you do? 
ABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. But we're still about a million short. 
They stare at each other. 
ABEL Your friend is dead... who do you work for. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO You know I could never tell you that. 
ABEL Stop... just stop. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO This was it anyway. Okay... Okay. ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up and looks back at ABEL. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Thank you. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens. ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. Finally he looks around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him. 
INT. BROOKLYN BARBERSHOP - DAY 
ABEL walks into the shop and is a little put back together but is worse for the wear. ARNOLD KLINE is sitting in one of the chairs waiting. He turns to ABEL. 
ARNOLD KLINE Hey. 
ABEL Jimmy, can you give me a minute? 
Jimmy looks around then walks into the back. 
ARNOLD KLINE Abel, that was well said. 
ABEL Thank you. 
ARNOLD KLINE What can I do for you? 
ABEL I've just come to collect that check you owe me. 
This takes him back a step. 
ARNOLD KLINE What check is that? 
ABEL The one for $213,000. ARNOLD KLINE I'm sorry? 
ABEL That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months. ARNOLD KLINE I had nothing to do with that. 
ABEL Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel last week off one of my stolen trucks. 
ARNOLD KLINE That's not possible. 
ABEL I was standing on top of one of my hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago thinking about the cowards who did this when I remembered I had bought the load of fuel off a friend's tanker straight from Texas. As I'm sure you know Texas #4 is marked. But that was just one load, so every truck that has left my lot for the last two weeks has been marked with dye that I've put in... And luckily four more of my trucks got jacked since.... My guess is there are at least 4600 gallons of marked fuel in your small tank right now. 
No answer. Finally. 
ARNOLD KLINE How much? 
ABEL I said...213,000. 
ARNOLD KLINE I'll need a day. 
ABEL Okay. 
ABEL gets ready to leave. 
ARNOLD KLINE I've just been buying this stuff off these guys, it was only a couple loads, I don't know who they are. I would never do that. 
ABEL My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year. And if you're this fucking desperate it doesn't seem like it will even take that long. 
He walks away. 
ARNOLD KLINE Abel, I wasn't the only person buying this shit. 
He turns. 
ABEL I don't care. 
ARNOLD KLINE It may ruin me. ABEL When you find out who else it was you can get them to pay you back the difference. Kinda makes you miss having your father around? But I need the whole lot tomorrow or the feds will be at your doorstep by noon. 
He leaves. 
EXT. UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY 
ABEL is sitting on a bleacher totally alone watching a prep school football practice. We stay with him as he sits quietly just watching. 
Eventually his 21-YEAR-OLD YOUNGER BROTHER, ELIAS, comes walking off the field over to him. PLAYERS start leaving the field. 
ABEL You look good out there. 
With that they both smile, she signs it and then gives him a kiss. 
INT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY ABEL comes back in and hands the docs to JOSEPH, the oldest Hasid, who signs them. 
JOSEPH Mazel Tov. 
EXT. TRAILER/TANK FARM - DAY 
ABEL walks across the lot with joy although it seems masked by a sadness. He looks around as ANDREW and ANNA come up next to him. 
ANDREW WALSH Congratulations. ABEL To you too. Did you know...about the money? 
ANNA Abel. 
ANDREW looks him right in the eye. 
ANDREW WALSH Yes. 
ABEL You should have told me. 
ANDREW WALSH I know. I'm sorry. 
ANNA Abel...congratulations. Now cheer up. And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for? 
ABEL, ANDREW, and ANNA walk towards the tanks looking around. They come around the corner to THE VIEW. 
EXT. BEHIND THE TANKS, WITH A VIEW OF THE CITY - DAY They all look out. 
ANNA What a hell-hole this city is. 
ABEL No. ANDREW WALSH I don't know why but I guess I never realized we even had this view from back here. 
That line sits for a long beat. 
ABEL I did. 
Then they hear someone behind them. They turn. It's JULIAN. He is standing holding a gun. They stare for a long beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I thought you said you threw that into the river? JULIAN I didn't. 
ABEL I see that. 
JULIAN I have nowhere to go. 
ABEL Nowhere easy. 
JULIAN Fuck you. I have nothing. And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted. 
ABEL looks at the gun in his hand. 
ABEL It wasn't meant to be. 
JULIAN What is that supposed to mean? 
ABEL I know what you wanted. But you need to forget that. You are looking backward. Only look forward, that is what you can control. 
JULIAN I'm sorry. You gave me a very good chance. Right? ABEL Yes. 
JULIAN Probably a better chance than I deserved. 
ABEL No. 
JULIAN Please take care of my family. 
ABEL Julian. JULIAN Please... 
ABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at. 
ABEL I will. 
With that JULIAN takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and pulls the trigger. 
The gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side of the fuel tank that is behind him. 
ABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. They are beside themselves. But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out through the bullet hole onto the ground. 
ABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. He picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the hole plugging the flow of oil. 
ANDREW WALSH What... what should we do? 
ABEL turns and looks back at him. ABEL We call the police.

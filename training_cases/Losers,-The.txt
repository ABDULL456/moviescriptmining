THE LOSERS 
Written by 
Peter Berg & James Vanderbilt 
February 2007 
FADE IN ON: 
THE DESERT. Sizzling dunes. Harsh. Unforgiving. 
Afghanistan - Three Years Ago 
We hear faint SCREAMS. A man BEGGING... 
MAN (O.S.) No... please... There's no way... 
Sand dunes stretch to the horizon. Nowhere to run... 
MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Nothing... can defeat... A SHADOW FALLS across the sand. Then a second. One looks like a Dog's Head. The other like... 
MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Gojira. 
HAND PUPPET SHADOWS. LAUGHTER from OTHER MEN. "Godzilla" pursues "Dog Head", catches him, and begins HUMPING HIM. 
MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me love you long time! 
SECOND MAN (O.S.) C'mon Jensen, you in or not? 
WHIP PAN to the Puppeteer and FREEZE-FRAME ON: 
Jensen. 20's, Lennon glasses, wild blonde hair, shirt open. Bald eagle tattoo on his chest. RESUME SPEED: 
JENSEN And get cheated again? 
WHIP PAN to and FREEZE-FRAME ON: 
Pooch. Mid 30's, black and solid. Eagle tattoo on right bicep, his NINE MONTH OLD DAUGHTER'S FACE tattooed on his left. Currently mock offended. RESUME SPEED: 
POOCH The Pooch don't cheat. The Pooch may lie, the Pooch may steal-- 
JENSEN --the Pooch may refer to himself in the third person-- 
POOCH --but the Pooch will not cheat. 
JENSEN The Pooch can rest easy, I was referring to Cougar. 
WHIP PAN and FREEZE FRAME ON: 
Cougar. Age unknown. Tan camo cowboy hat pulled low over his eyes, long hair. Sniper Rock-God. He doesn't say or move much. Ain't no rattling him. RESUME SPEED: ROQUE (O.S.) It's Liar's Poker, Jensen, how in the hell is the man gonna cheat you at Liar's Poker? 
WHIP PAN as he asks the question and FREEZE FRAME ON: 
Roque. 30's. Close cropped black hair. If Lance Armstrong bred with Darth Vader. Doesn't smile much, but he's smiling now. The four are in 
EXT. HUMVEE -- DAY 
Open air, the guys sit in the back. In the middle of the desert with nothing to do but wait. Roque holds the deck. 
ROQUE Cards. The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three (Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards. 
JENSEN Got a feeling about this one, Roque. 
ROQUE Your mama had that feeling too. 
At which point, JENSEN PULLS A KNIFE... 
...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET. Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in. 
ROQUE (CONT'D) Raise you. 
POOCH (INTRIGUED) That the one with the hollow points? 
ROQUE Yup. 
POOCH Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then. 
He puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner looking knife. Twirling it. JENSEN This even me up? 
ROQUE Exactly how many knives do you have, anyway? 
JENSEN (INTO RADIO) Dropkick, we strongly recommend cancellation of payload delivery- 
RADIO VOICE (O.S.) Abort order can only come from MISSION CONTROLLER- 
Clay GRABS THE RADIO from Jensen: 
CLAY Mission Controller is Agency, Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max, so get him on the horn and- 
RADIO VOICE (O.S.) Already have, Pinball, your orders stand. Prep for exfil. 
STATIC. A beat. The others stare at Clay. 
CLAY Cougar? 
Cougar takes the butt of his rifle and SMASHES THE LASER DESIGNATOR TO BITS! Clay, into the radio: 
CLAY (CONT'D) Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting equipment has suffered system failure, am calling an abort. 
STATIC. Then, a DIFFERENT VOICE: 
MAX (O.S.) Well, that was stupid. 
The voice is even. Distinctly unmilitary. Almost stoned. 
CLAY Who is this? This is a secure MILITARY NETWORK-- MAX (O.S.) Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin... Clay. 
Clay blinks - no one uses names on comms. 
CLAY Max? There are children on site- 
MAX (O.S.) And you think I didn't know that? Not the sharpest of knives in the drawer, are you? We locked coordinates the moment you painted; delivery will occur on schedule. Max out. 
STATIC. Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a SQUELCH. Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen: CLAY Shit! Jensen, call the General at the Firebase, get him to abort- 
JENSEN Can't, they're jamming us- 
ROQUE Then contact the plane directly- 
JENSEN (trying all channels) Negative, we're screwed! (LOOKING UP) There's nothing we can do... 
His face, stricken. They all are. And then: 
CLAY There's something we can do. 
Clay hefts his rifle. 
The others stare at him. Automatically begin checking their own weapons. Roque runs it down for them: 
ROQUE Five against a fortress, and we've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire. 
CLAY So? 
ROQUE So, I'll drive. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY 
WHAM! BAD GUYS firing wildly as our guys' HUMVEE PLOWS through the GATE! 
POOCH I guess we're going with the fifty mujas with AK's option after all! 
A SERIES OF SHOTS -- We see just how good these guys are. Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS -- takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. As the guys hop out: 
CLAY Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for the kids, the rest of us will be out in five- 
ROQUE (CHECKING WATCH) -airstrike's in four and change- 
CLAY -out in four. On me! 
Clay leads ZONE COVERAGE toward the building -- Roque and Cougar run middle -- QUICK DEATH STRIKES. Images BLAST fast and savage as these men KILL THEIR WAY INTO THE FORT. 
INT. AL GHOZAR FORT - KHYBER PASS - CONTINUOUS 
Roque calmly kicks in the door -- kills FIVE MEN sitting around a table with TWO YOUNG GIRLS in the middle -- the terrified girls run to him. The BAD GUYS have no chance -- Fast. Precise. SPECTACULAR. Our crew takes the fort. 
MOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children locked in a large empty room. They start leading them out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN: 
LITTLE BOY 
Clay checks the time. 3 MINUTES TO AIRSTRIKE... 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRESTORM: All Pooch can see is FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the destruction. Glances in the REAR-VIEW: 
POOCH Uh, Coug? 
Cougar's sleeve, FULLY ABLAZE. He casually rips it off and tosses it out the back. 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears... to reveal a 30 FOOT DROP. The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT... 
WHOOMP! The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand. 
EXT. AFGHAN DESERT -- DAY 
Silence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out: 
JENSEN Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours? 
Sounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING... 
POOCH Exfil incoming. How are we gonna explain the kids, Colonel? 
Clay doesn't seem to hear him. 
POOCH (CONT'D) Colonel? (Clay looks up) The kids. What do we tell 'em? 
A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK sets down. Walking up to the chopper: 
CLAY Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately- 
BLACKHAWK PILOT Negative, our orders are to transport a five-man team only. 
Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer: 
CLAY You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die? 
A beat. 
BLACKHAWK PILOT Not enough room for them and you... 
CLAY Then it's them. 
The Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on... 
JENSEN 
Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement. OMAR 
Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys. 
Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR... 
POOCH Cute little buggers. Hope they can make it to our court-martial. 
ROQUE Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel? 
CLAY (IGNORES THIS) Jensen, see if you can cut into that Blackhawk's chatter--I want to know if he rats us out. 
As Jensen tunes his radio... 
POOCH So, how we getting back? Hitchhike? Magic carpet? I say magic carpet... 
ROQUE (NOTICING) Guess they hustled up some air support after all - that's a Pakistani MiG up there... 
Jensen's tuning into the MIG's frequency. Looking nervous. 
JENSEN Guys... This is bad... 
TURNS UP THE VOLUME: 
MIG PILOT (O.S.) Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked, twelve o'clock low... Their eyes go wide with understanding.... 
MAX (O.S.) Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit. 
Clay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the receding chopper on the horizon. As the MIG SWINGS IN BEHIND THE BLACKHAWK.... 
MIG PILOT (O.S.) (CALMLY) Fox One. 
WOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP! The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper spinning and falling but still intact... 
Pooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING: 
POOCH Auto-rotate, go with it, you can still put her down if you- 
ROQUE Shut up. 
POOCH Hurry... 
ROQUE Shut up... 
Third set out, ripping the frame from the window... 
EXT. KARACHI SAFE HOUSE -- SAME 
WIDE ON THE CITY BLOCK: As the SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES! Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar being held two blocks East. HOLD on the smoldering ruins. AS WE SLOWLY FADE TO... 
EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT 
A rain slicked tarmac. MARINES carrying FIVE FLAG DRAPED COFFINS off a troop transport carrier. Our guys' FAMILIES watching. Clay's mother. Jensen's girlfriend. Pooch's wife and daughters. Tears in their eyes. 
INTERCUT WITH... 
INT. CIA BACKROOM -- NIGHT 
Somewhere secret. Our guys' PERSONNEL FOLDERS. Each being opened. Each being stamped "DECEASED". BACK TO... 
EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT As the Marines SALUTE the passing coffins. POOCH'S WIFE lowers her head, weeping. CUT TO: 
BLACK SCREEN. OVER IT IN SMALL LETTERS: 
THE LOSERS 
FADE UP: 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 
A nice quiet neighborhood. White picket fences, the whole nine. WE'RE WATCHING from outside the kitchen window of a Cape Cod two story. POOCH'S WIFE JOLENE doing dishes. 
Older. Hair cropped. Springfield, Massachusetts - NOW. 
She dries her hands and heads upstairs. We catch a glimpse of her in the upstairs hall. Then in her DAUGHTER's bedroom. 4 YEARS OLD NOW. Mom, putting her down. 
In the backyard, by the swingset, a figure watches. POOCH. Indulging in a nightly ritual... 
EXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHT 
Mexico City. CARNIVALE. Day of the Dead. Jesters and masks. Music. A man with a cowboy hat walks among them. COUGAR. Sees Mexican Police eyeing him. Walks a little faster. Hat pulled low as fireworks explode above... 
EXT. DESERT STRIP MALL -- NIGHT Phoenix, Arizona. A late night internet cafe, wedged between a donut shop and spinning studio. JENSEN sits. Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT... 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - HOLLYWOOD DOG TRACK -- MORNING 
Hollywood, Florida. DOGS IN FULL SPRINT. A few thousand SPECTATORS. Not the Derby, but reasonably enthused. 
IN THE CHEAP SEATS -- CLAY and ROQUE. Three years older. But in no way bolder. They look almost... Broken. 
Roque's got his feet up. Sucks lazily on a straw embedded in what looks like a SODA POP. Clay's got BINOCULARS, following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded greyhounds tearing over the dirt. One crosses the FINISH LINE. Roque checks their ticket. Yawns. 
ROQUE (FLAT) You lost again. 
CLAY We lost again. 
Clay's got the binoculars up, slow-checking the track. 
ROQUE You placed the bet. 
CLAY You gave me the money. 
ROQUE Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't it? 
Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger - A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's... 
ROQUE (CONT'D) That makes, what, three in a row? 
CLAY Four. 
Something glint-flashes...catches Clay's eye. He looks across the track, towards the PARKING LOT. ROQUE You know where you're messing up? You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds. 
CLAY Yeah, I've just gone crazy with that approach. 
CLAY SCANS THE LOT -- A YOUNG WOMAN in tight jeans walks towards a black pick up, carrying a PAIR OF BINOCULARS. 
ROQUE Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win. 
Clay doesn't respond. Watching her. Roque exhales. ROQUE (CONT'D) We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. - could this get any more sleazy? 
CLAY (turning to her) I know you? 
AISHA Relax, slugger... I like arms. That's all. 
CLAY Do I not look relaxed? 
AISHA No. (PAUSE) Think we can change that? 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL. - GOLD COAST MOTEL - LATER 
Clay and Aisha enter his motel room. Aisha checks out the sparse accommodations. 
AISHA (DEADPAN) Wow, it's everything a girl could dream of. Got a bathroom? 
CLAY No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom. AISHA You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here? 
Clay points to the bathroom. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - GOLD COAST - BEDROOM / BATHROOM 
Aisha checks herself in the mirror. A touch of lip gloss. 
AISHA So what brings you to Florida? 
Clay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up. 
CLAY Convention. 
AISHA (O.S.) Convention for what? 
Shit. Clay looks around. Weakly: 
CLAY ...Air conditioners. 
IN THE BATHROOM - Aisha studies herself in the mirror. Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity... 
AISHA They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners? 
IN THE BEDROOM 
CLAY You'd be surprised. 
Aisha comes back out. Both now stretched and loose. 
AISHA Bet I would. Where were we? 
They study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay. 
CLAY You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track... Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach... 
AISHA Saw me there did you? 
Clay strokes her cheek... 
CLAY Uh-huh... 
AISHA Didn't see me at the McDonald's though... 
Their lips, inches from touching... 
AISHA (CONT'D) I have a proposition for you... 
WHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE. Both breathing hard. Staring at one another: 
AISHA (CONT'D) Just hear me out. I don't want to hurt you. 
CLAY You're not going to. 
AISHA Yes, I am. 
He foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and IT IS ON! INSANELY VISCOUS: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES. 
She HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him. This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors... 
They continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE -- 
AISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight against the other's throat. Blades on skin. TIE GAME. Neither giving. FLAMES AROUND THEM: 
AISHA (CONT'D) Room's on fire. CLAY Noticed. What do you want? 
AISHA I'd expect no less. (TO CLAY) Have fun... 
The guys admire her form as she leaves. When she's gone: 
CLAY What do you have on her? 
JENSEN Besides a pants-busting crush? (OPENING LAPTOP) Her intel checks out. The cargo will be arriving here in two days. 
ROQUE (DEADPAN) Wow, I completely trust her now. 
CLAY What else? 
JENSEN Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad was white devil... oh, and CIA's got a kill order out on her. (MORE) 
JENSEN (CONT'D) As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD-- pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick amscrayed. 
POOCH Why? 
JENSEN Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special project... (looks up at them) "Codename: MAX". A moment as this sinks in. 
POOCH They want to wet her cause she's lookin' into Max. That sounds familiar... 
ROQUE (DUBIOUS) Could those files- 
JENSEN (finishing his question) -have been planted for us to find? (shaking his head) CIA timestamp, digital watermark... Someone would've had to go to a lot of trouble, and I mean a lot, to fool me. 
Clay nods. Looks to the others. 
CLAY I say we go with her. Pooch? 
A beat. Pooch nodding: 
POOCH I'm in. 
CLAY Jensen? 
JENSEN Hell yeah. Cougs? 
Cougar nods his assent. Only one left. ROQUE. They all turn to him. A beat. 
ROQUE For now. 
Jensen smacks his fist on the table, excited: 
JENSEN Hot damn! Back with the Colonel, doing another bid for God and COUNTRY- ROQUE Country turned her back on us, and God can screw. This one's for us. 
CLAY And anyone who calls me "Colonel" better be ready to take a beating or an order. We ain't soldiers anymore. 
POOCH (HAPPY NONETHELESS) So what's the plan, my civilian brothers? 
CLAY Sleep. We start tomorrow. 
JENSEN Start where? 
CLAY We're going bird hunting. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FIJI - BLUE ISLAND SKY - DAY 
A White Bell AB-139 CHOPPER glides into frame -- FLYING over a small series of white sanded jungle islands... 
MAX (V.O.) It used to be so simple. A post 9/11 world... 
LOOKING UP FROM ONE ISLAND: 
HOWLER MONKEYS taunt-scream up as the chopper slow-circles over the beautiful deserted island. Outer Fijian Islands. 
MAX (V.O.) (CONT'D) As a country we spoke with one voice, moved with one purpose. We had a wicked boner for doing the right thing, and now look at us! 
INT. BELL AB-139 - SAME 
Max wearing a Hawaiian shirt and Raybans. ZINC on his nose, rubbing suntan lotion on his forearms. To Wade: MAX 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we're too busy losing our nerve to notice. It's Us versus Them and right now my money would be on them... 
CAMERA DROPPING FAST out of the chopper -- SOARING DOWN low -- TRACKING WITH a howler monkey up a PALM TREE -- Then airborne as the monkey leaps twenty feet to another. 
MAX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Wasn't it Thomas Jefferson who once said the tree of freedom must be watered with etcetera, etcetera? We need to wake people up, Wade. We need to hit them in the face, angry up the blood, give them their balls back. We TRACK WITH our lead monkey up to something very un- monkey like... Something SINISTER. A metallic, trunk- like object. Flashing lights and transponder devices... 
MAX (CONT'D) We need to give them a ten megaton reality check. (ala John Lee Hooker) Boom Boom Boom Boom... 
A half-millisecond breath. Then, UTTER DESTRUCTION! 
INT. BLACKED OUT COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
CLAY Go. 
The sound of HEAVY IRON RELEASING as the WALLS START TO SEPARATE, revealing we are INSIDE THE BROKEN-DOWN TRUCK. 
CLAY (CONT'D) Make the call. 
Jensen taps into the military emergency band. Takes a breath, centers himself, then... 
JENSEN Base One, this is Cavalier 415! We have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle! Carvey's dead an' Freeman's hurt bad! He's messed up his neck! He can't move! Oh god, it's horrible! We need medevac immediate! HE'S GOT KIDS, BASE ONE, HE'S GOT KIDS! 
BASE ONE (O.S.) Roger, Cavalier 415! We're scrambling a chopper, hang in there! Jensen, all smiles, looks up at Clay. 
JENSEN Robert De Niro who? 
Pooch and Roque have the four drugged soldiers laid out on the sand. All four are clearly breathing. 
POOCH Sleeping like babies. 
ROQUE What about their ride? 
Clay steps off the trailer with a heavy duty air hoist. 
CLAY Flip it. TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the ground... higher... Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck... 
Pooch and Jensen, on one side. Quietly: 
POOCH What do you think's up with that "don't call me Colonel" stuff? 
JENSEN Classic loss of identity. Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure. (MORE) 
JENSEN (CONT'D) It was his way of measuring the good he did in the world. Without it, he's just another loser like the rest of us. 
Pooch blinks, impressed. Then: 
JENSEN (CONT'D) You know there's a website where you can download MP3's of donkeys farting? How cool is that? 
A FINAL PUSH... and the Humvee FLIPS. FROM JENSEN'S RADIO: 
BASE ONE (O.S.) Cavalier 415 this is Medevac Delta. Be advised, we are airborne and in- bound to your position! 
CLAY All right, everyone get into character... 
CUT TO: 
Jensen and Roque LIE ON THE GROUND by the flipped Humvee. 
JENSEN Lot of work to bum a ride. 
ROQUE Shut up, Jensen. 
JENSEN You shut up, Roque. You're dead, I'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can't. 
ROQUE Stop talking or I'll break your neck for real. 
JENSEN Seriously, you have to get more into your role! Dead guy! No talking! Dead guy! 
Clay leans against the truck. In the distance, the faint outline of a massive DOUBLE ROTOR TROOP TRANSPORT CHOPPER. 
CLAY Here we go... 
INT. CHOPPER - NEW MEXICO SKY - SAME 
Behind the pilot as he moves in on the accident scene... 
PILOT (INTO RADIO) Base One, this is Medevac Delta. We have visual on Cavalier 415. 
EXT. CRASH SITE - NEW MEXICO DESERT - CONTINUOUS 
Clay waves the chopper in. It lands on the road. TWO EMTs leap out and race towards the fallen soldiers. The first EMT kneels by Jensen. 
EMT Alright buddy, we're gonna get you patched up in no time... 
JENSEN Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been gut shot... 
EMT Sure, in Iraq. What a mess... 
Jensen pulls his COLT, presses it up into the EMT's GUT. 
JENSEN Means you know what's coming to you if try to play hero. Now, lose the radio mic, Bones. INT. CHOPPER COCKPIT - SAME 
CLAY No, you're not. 
ROQUE Yes, I am. 
CLAY No. 
ROQUE Right now. 
He thumbs back the hammer... A TENSE MOMENT... And then Roque lowers the gun. 
CLAY See? 
ROQUE She's coming with us. And if anything feels like a set-up, I put a bullet in her skull. (TO AISHA) Sound fair? 
AISHA Oh, completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers. 
ROQUE You're Muslim? 
AISHA You know, you are a sharp one--and don't let any of these other boys tell you different. 
With that, she turns and walks away into the shadows. Roque lowers the weapon. A beat. To Clay: 
ROQUE I don't like this. 
CLAY I picked up on that. 
POOCH I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks we're dead. We show up alive and kickin', start waving our dicks around in public, they're gonna make it their business to bury us. They'll call us terrorists, all KINDSA SHIT- 
CLAY What do you think we are now? (to all of them) Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max- ROQUE What if it doesn't? What if we never get face to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever? 
Clay doesn't reply. A pall, cast over the guys. Finally: 
POOCH Hell, let's just say it out loud... (PAUSE) We do this, we're declaring war on the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Silence, as the guys take this in. Then, from the corner: 
COUGAR They started it. 
SMASH TO: 
EXT. NEW ORLEANS -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY 
SWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between buildings, past the islands slamming into 
EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT, NEW ORLEANS 
A G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT- LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO. 
A fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles, surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine guns, frag grenades, body armor. 
BY THE JET -- WADE and FENNEL, our briefcase bomb friends, talks with a G. Gordon Liddy wrinkle muscleman. 
FENNEL As of this moment, the truck is designated an extraterritorial zone of immunity. Under no circumstances whatsoever are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before it's secure in the compound - to do so would be considered an act of treason and punishable as such. 
LIDDY Understood and acknowledged, sir. As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG... 
WADE Ten men ride with the package and another ten ride chase. 
Ten rock hard WARRIORS in a beefed up chase van. 
WADE (CONT'D) Let's go. 
EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY 
The two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private airport and passes a parked TOWN CAR... 
INT. TOWN CAR - SAME 
Clay, Roque, and Jensen watch the armored trucks pass by. Roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck passes. As Roque PULLS THE TRIGGER... 
EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS 
A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker. 
INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Jensen's laptop GPS goes hot. Green dot indicates CONVOY. CLAY Are we wired? 
JENSEN Like Belushi. (INTO RADIO) Target is westbound. Heading for the bridge... 
Clay fires up the Town Car and follows. 
EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY 
Wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles: 
CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.) This is Chopper Support--we are inbound your position, ETA five minutes! Hang in there! As a HORRIFIED LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade's face and he stares up into the sky... 
INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- DAY 
The SWAT Guys pull off their masks and high-five. They think they kicked ass. Fennel, reaching for the cockpit door handle... He can't turn it. 
FENNEL What the hell? It's welded shut! 
SWAT GUY (REALIZING) The windows too! We're sealed in! 
INT. CHINOOK COCKPIT -- DAY We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips up his goggles to reveal -- 
It's POOCH! AISHA sitting co-pilot. Both grinning as they hear the protestations from behind them... 
FADE TO: 
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EVENING 
The middle of nowhere. A small clearing. Skeeters and crickets harmonize. Clay waits with Jensen and Roque. THE CHINOOK crests the tree line. Hovers above... 
INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING 
Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each other... The chopper SETS DOWN. The men gather themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off. 
FENNEL We're down, okay! You go the second the ramp lowers! Hit them hard, three round bursts, center mass! 
EXT. CHINOOK -- EVENING 
Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin: 
AISHA Open the valve. 
TIGHT ON a 3-inch turn valve. Hard hands grab and open... 
INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING 
FENNEL These guys are about to get the surprise of their lives... 
Cut off as a CLEAR LIQUID begins to rain down on them from the SPRINKLER SYSTEM... 
FENNEL (CONT'D) What the hell they trying to do, drown us? SOLDIER 1 Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline! 
Their EYES GO WIDE... 
HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched soldiers BURST OUT, weapons up. Squinting through the fumes... 
CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless: 
FENNEL Eat the ground, or they blow your head off! 
CLAY I don't think so. 
FENNEL First and only warning, Clay! 
Clay calmly LIGHTS A CIGARETTE. TIGHT ON THE BURNING CHERRY: The soldiers, wide eyed... 
CLAY Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think about it. AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died. 
GASOLINE DRIPS from the muzzle of his own tooled up H&K G36 assault rifle... Clay takes a long smooth drag. 
CLAY (CONT'D) Things'll kill you. 
A beat... and then the fight just goes out of the SWAT Team. They DROP THEIR GUNS and RAISE THEIR HANDS... 
CLAY (CONT'D) Good boys. Now, let's see what kind of cargo you got in there. 
FENNEL Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we all die. Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose. 
CLAY I'm already dead, remember? 
WHAP! Clay's fist to Fennel's jaw. Knocking him cold. 
CUT TO: 
TIGHT ON FENNEL as he and the Team sit bound and gagged in the back of the Chinook. As the ramp rises, he shoots panicked glances to Clay. The ramp closes between them. 
Clay turns back to 
No way. They're fucked. 
POOCH Okay, someone pick a color! 
AISHA (STRANGELY CALM) Pull out all the wires. ROQUE What? 
AISHA You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged it--pull out all the wires. 
With no other options POOCH DOES. The clock, STILL GOING: 
The end of the wires FIZZLE. Then NOTHING. 
SILENCE. 
JENSEN Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer... 
POOCH You think? 
And then Roque PULLS HIS GUN. Levelling it at Aisha: 
ROQUE Did you know? 
AISHA I just saved our lives- 
ROQUE (FEVER PITCH) Did you know? 
AISHA Of course not! 
Clay TURNS SUDDENLY, stalking towards the Chinook... 
ROQUE (CONFUSED) Where the hell are you- 
CLAY Fennel. 
INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- NIGHT 
The Losers stand around Fennel, who's been CRYING. Urine stain on his pants. Sniveling, spilling his guts rapidly: FENNEL Max thinks the country's lost it's way, gone soft in the War on Terror! This is his solution! 
Clay JAMS A GUN to his temple... 
CLAY Elaborate. 
FENNEL He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target, pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again! The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot! POOCH What was the target? 
FENNEL I CAN'T- 
BLAM! Clay FIRES - INCHES FROM Fennel's HEAD! Fennel SCREAMS 
FENNEL (CONT'D) The Mall of America! Christ! 
They stare down at him in disbelief... 
FENNEL (CONT'D) I'm serious! It's his sense of humor! He told us we could choose between there and Epcot Center... 
A beat as our guys take this in. 
JENSEN (AMAZED) Holy shit, it's like we were framed by Dr. No... 
AISHA What about Goliath? 
JENSEN Yeah, what would an oil company want with the Middle East? 
FENNEL (STILL FREAKED) The ships that service their offshore oil rigs are exempt from US Customs! It's how Max gets the drugs in and out of the country- 
ROQUE This is conspiracy theory bullshit- 
FENNEL It's not! There's proof! 
CLAY Where? FENNEL Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments! 
JENSEN Come on, dude, they'd be morons to keep records of shit like this- 
FENNEL It's on a stand-alone hard drive! It's their insurance policy against Max - they know he's crazy, this way they have something on him! 
CLAY So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing? 
FENNEL Yes! 
Our guys exchange looks... 
CLAY Can you get us this drive? 
He stalks away. Roque glowers. Heads the other direction. 
JENSEN Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight? 
Cougar grunts in response. 
POOCH So what do we do about the nuke? (PAUSE) Did I just actually say that? 
On Aisha. A smile forming... 
AISHA I have an idea... 
INT. NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY 
The DESK SERGEANT sips a cup of coffee. Doing the Sunday crossword. Poorly. A quiet afternoon... 
A HUB-BUB outside. Rising voices. 
PATROLMAN (O.S.) Holy- Sarge, come quick! 
The Sergeant rises, and we follow him through the station towards the front doors. Moving faster and more nervously as the NOISE OUTSIDE GROWS. Finally stepping out into 
EXT. NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY 
The street where a CROWD has gathered. Lookie-loos with camcorders. The Sergeant pushes through them to find 
FENNEL. Eyes wide with fear. DUCT TAPED TO THE WARHEAD. 
A SIGN hangs around his neck that reads Death to America! in big cheery letters and has a SMILEY FACE on it... 
MATCH WITH: 
INT. SMOKED UP ASIAN BAR -- BACK ROOM -- DAY 
The image of FENNEL tied to the bomb, broadcast on the THAI NEWS on a black and white TV. Wade squints at it. 
WADE That's gonna be a quick trial... 
MAX Wonderful guy, salt of the earth, he'll be missed--who took my bomb, Wade? 
WADE You're not gonna like it... MAX Because I've been such a fan of how things have gone up till now? 
Wade shrugs and slides some PHOTOS across the table to him. SCREEN-GRABS from TRAFFIC CAMERAS -- CLAY, ROQUE, and JENSEN in the towncar during the heist. A long beat... 
MAX (CONT'D) Who the hell are these people? 
WADE Colonel Clay and his unit. You had them killed three years ago? 
MAX I also had several African nations overthrown three years ago, I'm a BUSY GUY- WADE The Jamal al-Fadhil situation? 
A beat. 
MAX Shit. 
WADE Yeah. 
MAX Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. 
WADE So what's the plan? 
MAX What's the plan? The plan is - get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. 
WADE Okay. 
MAX Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to try a third go-around? 
WADE WE'RE CLEAR- 
MAX Because what I'm going to need you to do is get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. You get that, right? 
WADE I get it. 
Wade heads for the door... 
MAX And Wade? 
Wade turns back. Max, SMILING: 
MAX (CONT'D) We're gonna need a new bomb. 
INT. NORTH DELHI - PRIVATE HANGAR - DAY 
INT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE 
HENDERSON, a middle aged mid-level manager reaches for his phone as the secretary looks on from her desk. 
HENDERSON This is Henderson. 
INTERCUT WITH JENSEN IN ELEVATOR JENSEN Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson, Richard Hertz from Internal Security. If you'd be kind enough to make your way down to the lobby? 
HENDERSON Uh... Can I ask what this is about? 
Jensen is just about dressed. 
JENSEN It's a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an (MORE) 
JENSEN (CONT'D) individual exposing himself to women in the elevators--best discussed in person. If you'd just head on down... 
EXT. HALLWAY BY ELEVATORS -- CONTINUOUS 
Henderson plods into his elevator. As the DOORS CLOSE on his elevator, the DOORS OPEN on the SECOND ELEVATOR. JENSEN, suited and pressed, steps out. Briefcase in hand. 
INT. HENDERSON'S OUTER OFFICE 
Jensen enters, looking down at Henderson's secretary. JENSEN Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support. Is Henderson around? I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system- 
SECRETARY Oh, you just missed him by like two seconds. Can you come back in like an hour or so? 
Jensen checks his watch. Big sigh. 
JENSEN Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs breathing down my neck. They want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a sudden. 
Jensen, already moving into HENDERSON'S OFFICE: JENSEN (CONT'D) Five minutes and I'll be out of your hair! 
INT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE 
QUICK TIGHT SHOTS OF JENSEN doing what Jensen does best: Tearing into Henderson's computer. FROWNING... 
Henderson's secretary reaching for her phone... 
SECRETARY Security? 
BACK IN HENDERSON'S OFFICE: 
Jensen checking his download. Smiles at the Secretary, then looks back to he screen. Pressing his RADIO EARPIECE... 
JENSEN According to this, the drive exists, Clay. 
INTERCUT WITH THE VAN: Clay shoots a look at Roque. 
CLAY You're sure? 
JENSEN Abso-tootly. 
CLAY Is it in the building? 
JENSEN No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta be a remote location, stand-alone. I'm checking their security logs-- wherever they've detailed the most guys is probably where it'll be... 
FROM BEHIND JENSEN: 
SECURITY GUARD 1 (O.S.) "Skippy"? 
Jensen turns. He's face to face with a solid looking SECURITY OFFICER. He tries a smile: SECURITY GUARD 1 (CONT'D) Show me some ID. Real easy. 
Jensen stands up, holding his briefcase. 
JENSEN Whoa! Take it easy. You're the- 
WHAM! Jensen SMASHES his metal briefcase across the security guard's face! The guard is unconscious before he hits the ground. Keying his RADIO EARPIECE: 
JENSEN (CONT'D) Get me out of here, Clay... 
CLAY (O.S.) (THROUGH RADIO) There's a fire exit thirty yards north of your position. 
Jensen, heading for it... 
BIG SECURITY 1 (O.S.) Freeze like a statue, pretty boy! 
Jensen slow turns to find THREE GUNS trained straight at him. Major security. These guys look extremely competent. 
JENSEN I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal weapon... Jensen turns on the big fellah. 
JENSEN (CONT'D) It was this secret government project. They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff. Anal stuff. Turned me into a dangerous Telekinetic. (wiggles index fingers) As the old saying goes - you don't start none... there won't be none. 
JENSEN They've hired Par-Sec. A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them. 
CLAY (HONESTLY) Oh, shit... 
AISHA Who's Par-Sec? 
JENSEN Paradigm Security Services. Ex- Special Forces. 
POOCH Basically guys like Cougar but without the warm and cuddly side. 
Cougar just glowers. CLAY Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck... 
Silence as they ponder the significance of a Par Sec security force. 
JENSEN Our drive is being guarded by military trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers... Am I the only one who's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags? 
Silence. 
CLAY Comb that drive for every last scrap of info. We're on a plane for New York tomorrow... 
INT. BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Clay's room again. Knock at the door again. Aisha again. 
CLAY Oh, hi. 
She covers his mouth with hers... 
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table. Both with laptops. Jensen tapping his keys. Roque enters, carrying a coffee. Stops short, seeing the others. Surprised. 
ROQUE Thought you guys'd be back at the hotel. 
POOCH Couldn't sleep. 
ROQUE Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one? 
He slides into a chair. 
POOCH No thanks. JENSEN You won't believe how detailed these files are. Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts- 
ROQUE Life insurance? 
JENSEN Yeah. 
ROQUE What's the biggest payout? 
JENSEN (STILL TYPING) Gotta be wrongful death... 
ROQUE Pretty much what we're gonna be risking. (TO POOCH) What are you doing up? 
POOCH Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier. 
ROQUE The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then: 
POOCH When we first went over in 2001, Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right? Only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been cleaned out. 
ROQUE Military neighborhood... 
POOCH No doubt. And Tina's four at the time, and what she can't understand is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow. So Jolene sings her the song, right? To show her where the idea comes from. And when she's all done, Tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye and says "that's the dumbest song I ever heard." (LAUGHING) So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home... 
ROQUE (SMILING) Thought that counts, right? 
POOCH Yeah... 
THEN: 
POOCH (CONT'D) Jolene dated a guy last summer. Didn't turn into anything and I sure as hell can't blame her, but that man was in my house, Roque. I know you're not a hundred percent on this op, but if it can get me back to them... 
ROQUE I hear you, man. 
A moment between them. Broken by: 
JENSEN (READING) Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath exec ever - 14 million and it was wrongful death - Vice President of Operations in Afghanistan, three years ago, paid to his daughter... 
HE TRAILS OFF IN SHOCK. Looking to Pooch and Roque: 
JENSEN (CONT'D) We're going to need to drive fast... INT. BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Clay and Aisha, in bed. After. She traces her fingers along his Teddy Bear tattoo. Clay looks down at her. She gives him a smile. Mixing just the right amount of sensitivity and curiosity... 
CLAY You really want to know about Afghanistan? 
Roque, looking out the back window: 
ROQUE Here they come... 
Sure enough, the COBRAS are now tracking the VAN. Spotlights, swinging towards them... 
The asphalt behind them ERUPTS. CANNON-FIRE blowing HUGE CHUNKS OF ROAD into the sky! SCREAMING over the SOUND: 
CLAY Somebody shoot something! 
Cougar HEFTS HIS RIFLE. Setting up shop in the back. Sighting the choppers through his scope. Jensen, excited, and a little delirious from blood loss: 
JENSEN I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug, do you have a plan? (to the others) He's got a plan! 
POOCH (trying to steer) Stop yelling at the sniper! THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the chopper on the left... Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER... 
And we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters. 
The bullet strikes the tail rotor DEAD CENTER -- it SHORTS and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin -- COLLIDING with it's TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND 
Our guys. Driving away from the carnage of two exploding Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road... 
Safe. 
EXT. LEAR JET 550 (FLYING) -- DAY Coming in for LANDING... 
INT. LEAR JET 550 -- DAY 
As it taxis towards a HANGAR. Max straightens his suit. Wade on the phone, frowning. Bad news. He flips the phone shut. To Max: 
WADE They got away. 
MAX So? (MORE) 
MAX (CONT'D) (off Wade's look) We know exactly where they're going, Wade. Port of New York, for their big final awesome stand against the forces of evil where they die. 
He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps... 
INT. HANGAR -- DAY 
...where the TWO INDIAN SCIENTISTS wait. The Indian THUG CREW has been beefed-up to about TEN BIZARRE LOOKING, BLACK SUITED TOUGH GUYS. 
SHORT SCIENTIST Do you have the money? 
MAX Jesus, always with the money! So impersonal! How are you? How have you been? 
SHORT SCIENTIST I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window. How have you been? 
MAX Can't complain. I'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car... 
SHORT SCIENTIST I think you're a freak. Too much Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy football. 
Max smiles and spreads his arms... 
MAX Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby. 
SHORT SCIENTIST We have your ordinance. You have twenty four hours to get the money. 
Max looks over to Wade. 
MAX Time to go make a withdrawal... 
As he turns back to the plane... 
SHORT SCIENTIST New change of plan. You stay. 
MAX I've got to go get your money. 
SHORT SCIENTIST He'll get your money. You stay right here. 
A PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist. 
MAX God, are you short. SHORT SCIENTIST Twenty three hours, fifty nine minutes... 
Max looks at Wade. 
MAX Get it done. 
Wade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time, looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist. 
MAX (CONT'D) How much do you weigh? Seriously. 
...And landing in an EMPTY ROOM. 
No computers. No stand-alone drives. No nothing. Except for PAR-SEC GUARDS with weapons trained at his head... 
INT. CHEVY VAN - GOLIATH TERMINAL 
Pooch sitting in the van, into the radio: 
POOCH Jensen, you get it? Jensen? 
Does not see the FIVE PAR-SEC SOLDIERS moving in on his car, long guns up and out... EXT. GOLIATH OIL TANK - SAME 
Cougar flexed and aimed. Scope locked in on the fire alarm... CLICK! Safety off on a gun pressed to his temple. Fuck. He LAYS DOWN THE GUN and puts his hands behind his head. Furious at himself for GETTING CAUGHT... 
INT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
From the shadows, WADE ENTERS. Clay looks up at him. 
WADE Hello, Clay. Been awhile. (NODDING) Roque. 
Head wounds bleed bad. The crowbar caused a mother of a gusher on Clay. He wipes blood from his eyes. Manages: CLAY When...? 
ROQUE After the truck. I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up, I go free. 
He begins walking around Clay as he talks. 
CLAY Traitor... 
ROQUE You gave me no choice. It was always gonna end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You made sure of it. 
CLAY (SPITTING BLOOD) Bullshit... 
ROQUE Not bullshit. You were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed. 
CLAY No... 
ROQUE Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away. 
CLAY We all could have walked... used the drive... 
ROQUE Don't you get it yet? There is no drive. There never was... 
Wade BEGINS LAUGHING. Clay looks like he's been slapped. 
ROQUE (CONT'D) Fennel made it up to save himself. When I told Wade, he planted the info at Goliath to lead you here. 
Clay stares at him. 
ROQUE (CONT'D) You really thought there was a happy ending coming? Pooch was gonna get his family back, we were gonna get to be soldiers again? (leans down; softly) We lost the moment we went off mission. This is just the logical conclusion of that playing out. You didn't want to hear it. (MORE) 
ROQUE (CONT'D) You just wanted your revenge. Your face-to-face with the big bad wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's the way of the world... 
Roque straightens back up, shaking his head: 
ROQUE (CONT'D) Guys like us don't beat guys like him. 
In the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following, a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck: CLAY Kill me now... Maybe you live through this. 
WADE Oh, we're not gonna kill you. Someone's gotta get away with the cash. Your crew? I'm definitely wasting them. But you? 
He nods to the HYDRO-WINCH slowly lowering the CASH CONTAINER onto the flat bed, with a smile... 
WADE (CONT'D) You're about to steal a billion dollars from the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Clay stares at daggers at both of them. WADE (CONT'D) It's for our replacement nuke. When a billion goes missing, people tend to ask who took it. (CHUCKLING) Max really does love to frame you... 
Several Par-Sec Guards arrive. Wade points to Clay: 
WADE (CONT'D) Take him away. Drop him in Newark. (TO ROQUE) I'll see you at Turner Airfield. 
The Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque: 
ROQUE Wait. 
They stop. Roque looks at his old friend. 
ROQUE (CONT'D) I'm sorry it had to end this way. 
Clay stares back at him. 
CLAY You're going to die very badly. The guards hustle Clay out the door... 
Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back: 
AISHA Did you kill him? 
Clay, about to respond when: COUGAR (O.S.) I did. 
They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them. 
COUGAR (CONT'D) He asked us. It was mercy. But you're his family, so I understand. 
And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet. 
SURRENDERING... 
COUGAR (CONT'D) But only me. 
Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar, equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD... Silence. We CUT WIDE to see... 
A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS... 
In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body. 
The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM! 
Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his face. He doesn't move to wipe it away. 
AISHA Wear it. Remember him. 
Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid. 
JENSEN Okay, excellent, very tribal--We need to go. 
As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar hightail it back to where Pooch lies. 
CLAY Can you stand? 
POOCH This is stupid question day, isn't it? It's stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me... 
Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style. Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked. PUSH IN on Clay's face for: 
CLAY Let's go. 
And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO, Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full on ballet of fully automatic mayhem... 
They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT... 
INT. VAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT 
Pulling on to the HIGHWAY. Silence sets in. The high of the firefight, over. Just pain and loss now. 
Five people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go. Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road. 
FINALLY: 
CLAY They won. We lost. Way it goes. 
Silence. 
POOCH Way it always goes. 
Clay looks at him. 
POOCH (CONT'D) Guess we should just head home. Oh, wait, that's right. We don't have homes. 
Clay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel: 
COUGAR Where to, Colonel? 
Clay looks up at the use of rank... 
EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP -- NIGHT 
Wade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as Roque finishes supervising Par-Sec guards finish loading the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE. 
WADE Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should we be worried? 
ROQUE Clay doesn't take risks. It's why I'm here and he's not. 
WADE You're sure? 
Roque nods. 
ROQUE It's a distinct possibility... 
They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless. 
ROQUE (CONT'D) You don't have a knife? 
CLAY Don't need one. 
ROQUE Bit of as longshot for you... 
CLAY (SMILING) No. It's not. 
Roque LUNGES AT HIM... 
But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back... 
For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin. 
ROQUE Now I really am gonna cut your head off... 
He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON... 
The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque. 
Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard... 
Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out, TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting... Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt! 
Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST: 
Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand, which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM! 
And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS. 
Which seems to make Clay happy. 
So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too. 
Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN... TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT EAGLE levelled at Clay. 
CLAY SHIT- 
The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of 
THE CORVETTE 
Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep Clay from rolling off the hood... 
THE PLANE 
TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's final run to get up to speed... 
THE CORVETTE 
Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield: 
CLAY (CONT'D) Rifle... 
Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT... VISUALIZE THIS -- 
AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off. 
AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade. 
And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway. The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands. 
She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit. 
She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the LANDING GEAR of the plane AS... 
THE CORVETTE 
PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE, causing the bike to 
CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD... 
...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES. 
Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching... 
...as Roque dies very badly.

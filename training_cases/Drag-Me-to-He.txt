INT. BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN 
22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep as the alarm clock BUZZES. She hits the snooze button and plops back down onto the pillow. After a few seconds of pure sleeping bliss, she wills herself up. She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom, past a "Hang in there, baby" poster and into the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
Stephanie turns on the shower. While waiting for the water to heat up, she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated pronunciation, recites: 
STEPHANIE There is no friction, with proper diction. Good sounds abound, when the mouth is round. She catches herself on the last word, a hint of "Missouri twang" slipping through. 
STEPHANIE Round. Yawn. She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the steaming shower. 
INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING 
She opens the refrigerator: A half grapefruit sits next to an inviting slice of chocolate cake. She's tempted, but chooses the grapefruit. 
EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD PARKING STRUCTURE - MORNING 
A sunny Southern California day. Commuters speed by. Stephanie's FORD FOCUS pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE, across the street from the BANK OF CALIFORNIA. She steps from the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward the intersection. The traffic signal changes to "Don't Walk". A BUSINESS MAN next to her, sprints across the street. Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign. She looks down to see a little KITTEN. It rubs against her ankles and PURRS. 
STEPHANIE Well, you're a little cutie. 
A car's HORN blares, spooking the kitten. It darts into the intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming VAN. Stephanie races into the intersection, snatches up the kitten and places it safely down on the other side of the street. 
STEPHANIE Hey! Slow down! The Van roars past. She pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks Stephanie's face. She sets it down. 
STEPHANIE Go on home. Shoo now! She heads for the Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back, frowning. 
STEPHANIE Shoo! 
INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA -- DAY 
Stephanie site at her desk, across from a young MEXICAN COUPLE. She studies their mortgage. application. 
MEXICAN MAN We keep getting the same thing. Because I'm not employed by an American company, they won't take my application until they get my solvency statement. And the Mexican Treasury Department says that's going to take at least four more weeks. 
STEPHANIE I told you. No. Now beat it. 
Mr. Jacks sneezes, rubs his nose. He looks suspiciously about the bank for the source of his allergy. 0 
STEPHANIE Uh Oh. You better bring the kitty home for me. 
ELLEN Sure. If I can take the shoes. 
STEPHANIE I told you, no. Mr. Jacks sneezes again, his eyes water. He turns to his 
SECRETARY. 
MR. JACKS Has someone brought a damned animal into my bank?! Mr. Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading him toward Stephanie's desk. 
STEPHANIE Okay, fine! Take the shoes! 
Hidden from Mr. Jack's view, Ellen quickly scoops up the Kitten and places it into her purse. As Mr. Jacks arrives at Stephanie's desk, he overhears: 
ELLEN Just don't expect me to take care of it. This catches Mr. Jack's Attention. He turns to the ladies, wondering what they're talking about. Stephanie takes Ellen's hand and vigorously shakes it goodbye. 
STEPHANIE Of course not. I'll take care of everything. And thanks for choosing Bank of California. Ellen plays along. 
T 
ELLEN Okay. Then I'll see you later. I mean--- whenever the next time I'm in the bank. You know-- for a loan. 
OR-- 
STEPHANIE Goodbye. As Ellen passes, Mr. Jacks sneezes again, harder. 
MR. JACKS Someone has definitely brought an animal in here. He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits. 
STEPHANIE I don't see any cats. Or any animals. 
MR. JACKS Hope to hell, not. 
STEPHANIE By the way, I put the paperwork for the Mcpherson loan on your desk. 
MR. JACKS Mcpherson? 
STEPHANIE That big corporate loan I've been trying to set up? It's just preliminary but-- 
MR. JACKS Oh, right. I'll look it over when I get the chance. 
INT. RAY'S UNIVERSITY OFFICE - LATER 
Stephanie eats a salad as she goes over a financial statement of the Mcpherson Corporation. Ray grades papers. 
RAY How're things at the bank? How's that new position looking? 
STEPHANIE I don't know. 
RAY Really? You sounded so sure. 
STEPHANIE Well, now there's this new guy... they're considering him too. Ray sees how bummed out she is. He moves close, taking her in his arms. 
RAY That job needs somebody with your experience. They know that. Stephanie nods. 
STEPHANIE Oh, I've got something for you. She rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope. He removes a coin. An old nickle. 
RAY A 1925 Indian head! Hey, good find. Where'd you get it? 
STEPHANIE One of the tellers found it for me. Ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into his pocket. 
RAY Thanks. 
STEPHANIE I'd better get back to work. She quickly gathers her things. Ray returns to grading his student's exams. The telephone RINGS. Ray hits the speakerphone. 
RAY. Doctor Dalton. It's the voice of an older woman, TRUDY. 
TRUDY ON SPEAKERPHONE Hello dear. 
RAY Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec? He turns from the phone, whispering to Stephanie: 
RAY I'll call you tonight. She kisses Ray and exits. 
INT. HALL OUTSIDE RAY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Stephanie stops at the water fountain for a drink. 
RAY'S VOICE Nothing much. Just had lunch with Stephanie. And trying to get these midterms graded-- She halts as she hears her name mentioned on Ray's speakerphone. She moves closer to Ray's office to eavesdrop: 
TRUDY'S VOICE --Stephanie? The one from the farm? 
RAY'S VOICE You know who she is. She's coming over for dinner tomorrow night to meet you and dad. 
TRUDY'S VOICE 
MRS. GANUSH The trucks are there now. The men are packing all my things. Private things. Please, make them stop. This is my home for twenty years. And I make every payment until the sickness took my eye. Mrs. Ganush turns her head to reveal a milky white eye. Stephanie hides her revulsion. 
STEPHANIE Well... do you have the payment with you now? 
MRS. GANUSH I hope to get it soon. I just need a little more time. 
STEPHANIE I don't think my manager is going to extend you anymore credit. I'd like to help but... 
MRS. GANUSH Please. Won't you try? 
STEPHANIE Okay. Wait here. Stephanie stands and moves off. The Old Woman picks through a bowl of hard candies on Stephanie's desk. Stephanie stands before Mr. Jacks. He acknowledges her without looking up from his work. 
1B 
MR. JACKS What's up? 
STEPHANIE I've got an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment.. They're in the process of repossessing her home. She's on a fixed income and she's had some medical problems. I was wondering if we could give her a break. Stephanie hands Mr. Jacks the loan file. He puts on his bifocals, studies it. Stephanie glances over her shoulder. 
STEPHANIE'S P.O.V. - HER DESK Mrs. Ganush looks around to. make sure no one's watching, then tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse. She reaches. into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that she wraps in her linen handkerchief. She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it with a wet SUCKING sound. The Old Woman's one good eye, wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat. 
MR. JACKS Apparently, we've already granted her two extensions. And you know on this type of foreclosure, the bank makes a sizable amount in fees. He hands her back the file. 
STEPHANIE It would mean I'd have to throw her out of her house. 
MR. JACKS Tough decision. Your call. He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies her. Stephanie glances to the vacant office of the Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The thick carpet. She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his workstation. 
STEPHANIE I'll take care of it. Stephanie returns to her desk. 
STEPHANIE Mrs. Ganush, another extension on the loan is out of the question. 
MRS. GANUSH What? 
STEPHANIE I'm sorry. 
MRS. GANUSH No. Please, it's my home... I'm begging you. 
STEPHANIE I tried to talk my boss into it but he just wouldn't approve. 
MRS. GANUSH But where will I live? 
Stephanie leafs through the loan documents. She finds a name. 
STEPHANIE Mrs. Ganush, you've given your granddaughter as a reference... It says here, she lives nearby... Wouldn't you be better off living with her? 
RHAM JAS Then go. There are many who would claim to be seers. But they are not. Although you would pay them little... you would receive nothing. If you.are not serious, go. Rham Jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain. 
STEPHANIE Wait. She removes some bills from her purse but Ray waves her off, handing Rham Jas a credit card. 
RHAM JAS Platinum card. Very good. He swipes Ray's card through the credit card machine. INT Rham Jas'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT A sparsely furnished, dimly lit room. The walls are lined with old books. Rham Jas stands before Stephanie and Ray, who sit at a card table. Stephanie giggles with excitement. 
STEPHANIE Sorry. Rham Jas smiles back. 
RHAM JAS That's quite all right. So, you wish to know something of your destiny. Very good. We shall see what the fates have in store. Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains. 
RAY Freud said destiny was not an act of fate but rather something created by our subconscious to control our conscious choices. 
RHAM JAS That is true. But... "We should not pretend to understand the world only by intellect." 
RAY Carl Jung... 
RHAM JAS Yes. From his treatise "Psychological types". 
Ray studies this strange man as he strikes a match and lights a candle. There's more to him than meets the eye. Ray brushes it off. 
RAY Jung-- the New Agers' favorite psychologist. 
RHAM JAS Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation. Rham Jas takes a seat at the table, across from Stephanie. 
RHAM JAS Your hand, please. Stephanie extends her hand to Rham Jas. He closes his eyes and concentrates. Stephanie smiles excitedly to Ray, who raises a skeptical eyebrow. 
RHAM JAS You,work with money. 
TO 
STEPHANIE That's right! 4 
RHAM JAS But... you've lost something. 
STEPHANIE No. I don't think so. 
RHAM JAS No. No, you're right. Something's been taken from you. 
STEPHANIE No, I- Rham Jas grabs her arm and turns it, revealing the threads. that once held the button on her coat sleeve. 
RHAM JAS A button. 
STEPHANIE Well, yes! Some Old Woman... 
STEPHANIE How did he know all that? 
RAY Know what? That you lost,a button?1 He makes some good guesses, stirs you up, leaving you with a lot of questions. And conveniently, his business card. C'mon, he's a scam artist. 
STEPHANIE He didn't want the money. He tried to give the money back. 
RAY In the end, he took it, didn't he? 
STEPHANIE I guess so. 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ray and Stephanie step from the car. They open a rusting iron gate, and walk up the hilly path to Stephanie's slightly funky Silver Lake rental house. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT 
Ray and Stephanie step inside. The kitten PURRS around Stephanie's feet. Ray picks it up. 
RAY So this is him. Got a name? 
STEPHANIE Uh... just "Kitty" so far. 
She takes the cat from Ray, cuddles it. 
RAY Sure you don't want me to spend the night? 
STEPHANIE Don't tempt me. I've got to prep a presentation for the morning. 
RAY okay. Ray kisses her, opens the front door and exits. He calls back to her from his car: 
RAY Remember, dinner at my folk's house, tomorrow night. We're supposed to bring desert. I could pick something up? 
STEPHANIE No. I'm planning on baking my special cake. 
RAY Sounds good. Try not to stay up too late. Ray waves and steps into his car. Stephanie watches him drive off. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Stephanie site at the kitchen table in her flannel pajamas, entering financial data into her laptop. An episode of "Desperate Housewives" plays in the background on TV. A baking timer CHIMES. Stephanie removes a beautifully browned cake from the oven and sets it on the counter to cool. Her roommate, ELLEN, comes down the stairs, snuggling the kitten. 
STEPHANIE Isn't he adorable? 
ELLEN Let's hope the landlord thinks so. She sets down,the kitten and picks up her overnight bag. 0 
INT. RAY'S HOUSE - LATER 
DOCTOR RANGIVERTZ, wearing jeans and a UCLA basketball sweatshirt, concludes his interview with Stephanie. He carries a small black medical bag as he steps from the living room to speak with Ray. 
DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ Ray, you were right to call me. Never a good idea to be personally involved with your patient. 
RAY What do you think? 
DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ 1b Medically, she's fine. She's just very distraught. She's displaying some paranoia and a sense of panic. Classic symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder. Probably a result of being assaulted by that old woman. Doctor Rangavertz scribbles out a prescription and hands it to Ray. 
RAY How worried should I be? 
DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ We'll have to wait and see. 
INT. RAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
'Stephanie lays peacefully in bed, almost asleep. A bottle of sedatives on the bedside table. Ray pulls up the blanket around her exposed shoulder. Stephanie sighs, turns to him. 
RAY How you doing? 
STEPHANIE Better now. At the time it just seemed so real. I'm so embarrassed. 
RAY Don't be, you had a terrible day and you.got a little wigged out. It happens. 
STEPHANIE po, what now, Doc? 
RAY I was gonna surprise you, but what the hell. I've been planning a little trip for us this week end. Saturday morning we're taking a train to Santa Barbara. 
STEPHANIE Really? 
RAY My family owns a cabin up there. In, the hills. Overlooking this little river. We'll light a fire, drink some champagne and screw our brains out. 
STEPHANIE You sure know how to talk to a girl. 
RAY It's a chance to just be together. Undisturbed. There's a lot of stuff I want to talk to you abqut but it never seems to be the right time. 
STEPHANIE Sounds nice. She draws in a deep breath and for the first time that evening, she looks at peace. Ray watches, her as she closes her eyes and drifts off to sleep. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. RAY'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
.Tweeting birds and filtered sunlight streaming in through the window, awaken Stephanie. She stretches and looks to the empty pillow next to her. Ray is gone. She tries to fall back asleep, but the sound of a dripping faucet keeps her awake. Frustrated, she gets out of bed and steps into the bathroom. WITHERED HANDS clamp around Stephanie's throat, violently SHAKING her! 
STU RUBIN Hi Steph. Just getting here? 
STEPHANIE What are you, the hall monitor? 
STU RUBIN Ha ha! You're funny, Steph. 
STEPHANIE What do you want? 
STU RUBIN I need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures. 
T 
STEPHANIE I've got a lot on my mind. Let's do it tomorrow. 
STU RUBIN Sure. I'll just tell Mr. Jacks that you don't have the time right now. Maybe he can show me. She glances up. Mr. Jacks'is still watching her. 
STEPHANIE No, no, that's all right. I'll do it. Where were we? 
STU RUBIN We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines. 
STEPHANIE Right. Okay. Let's say your client is a company that can't get traditional bank financing but 10 needs a secured loan. We offer-- 
SCRATCH... SCRATCH... Stephanie looks around for the source of the sound, but can't find it. 
STU Yeah? 
STEPHANIE .uh, we offer several types of asset-based lending which consist of revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivables, their inventory, machinery-- , 
SCRATCH... SCRATCH... Stephanie sees... That Stu's hand has been replaced by MRS. GANUSH'S... it's yellowed fingernails SCRATCH across her desk. She looks again, and Stu's hand has returned to normal. 
STU ---and? 
STEPHANIE (in her full Missouri twang) --And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk! Stu is taken aback by Stephanie's outburst. He retreats to his desk in confusion. Stephanie sits, rattled. A drop of blood falls onto a piece of paper on her desk. The blood is trickling from her nose. Stephanie grabs a tissue to halt the bleeding. She looks down to see a large black fly land upon the drop of blood. She gasps and stands, her mind racing. She knows what she must do. She finds Mrs. Ganush's loan documents. She stuffs them into a folder, grabs her purse and bolts for the exit. Mr. Jacks engaged with a customer, calls after her: 
MR. JACKS Stephanie? Where are you going? She moves quickly out the door, pretending not to hear him. 
Stu watches Stephanie go and gets up from his desk. She's left some files behind. He snoops around his desk. He notices a folder marked CONFIDENTIAL. It's the McPherson loan file. Interesting. He picks it up. 
EXT. MRS. GANUSH'S HOUSE - DAY 
An old, wood bungalow that has seen better days. A MOVING TRUCK in the driveway. Stephanie's car pulls up. she steps out, carrying Mrs. Ganush's loan documents. She passes the MOVING MEN who load the last of Mrs. Ganush's things. She arrives at the opened front door, gathers her courage and KNOCKS. No answer. She calls out: 
STEPHANIE Mrs. Ganush? No answer. She steps inside. 
The Old Woman's CACKLING can still be heard as Stephanie hurries to her car and drives off. 
EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN PARKING LOT - LATER 
Stephanie site in her parked car. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S CAR 
Stephanie is eating from a package of DOUBLE STUFF OREOS, joylessly jamming one after another into her mouth. Her eyes dart about: Who could help her? Then she remembers something. She sets down the cookies and rummages through her purse. She finds the business card of Rham Jas. She starts the car and drives off. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY 
TO 
Stephanie halts at a red light. out of the corner of her eye she sees something odd. 
STEPHANIE'S POV - ON THE STREET Stu Rubin walking with two well dressed executives. 
STEPHANIE Stu? The men warmly escort into the First National Bank. 
STEPHANIE What's he doing at First National? The car behind her HONKS! She drives on. 
EXT. RHAM JAS' STOREFRONT - DAY 
Stephanie's car is parked in the street. 
INT. STOREFRONT - DAY 
Stephanie stands before a counter facing Rham Jas. He swipes her credit card through the machine. She signs the receipt. He motions for her to follow him through the beaded curtain. INT. BACK ROOM OF RHAM Jas'S STOREFRONT - DAY on a plain wooden table.a samovar brews a musty tea. Rham Jas is reading from an ancient text. He looks up from the book,- solemn. 
RHAM JAS What did it sound like. 
STEPHANIE Like... shrieking. It was awful. He nods. Closes the book. 
RHAM JAS That would be the Lamia. The "Black Goat". 
STEPHANIE Lamia. Right. That's the word the old woman used. 
RHAM JAS It is a nasty spirit. A taker of souls. A creature of misfortune for you and those around you. It is often summoned by the Gypsies for their dour deeds. On the third day the Lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object. 
STEPHANIE Accursed object? What object? 
RHAM JAS Something that the old woman took from you, cursed, then gave back. Now it dawns on Stephanie. She looks to the threads on her coat. 
STEPHANIE Here kitty-kitty... Here, kitty- kitty-kitty... She moves closer until her face fills the screen. 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
The distant SCREAM of the kitten is heard. We hear it again and again until it is finally silenced. 4 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Stephanie having been sick, emerges from the bathroom, wiping her mouth. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN -DAY 
Stephanie throws something small and bloody inside the microwave oven and turns it on. 
STEPHANIE'S BACKYARD GARDEN AFTERNOON She buries the heart in a corner of her garden. She turns on the garden hose, washing the cat's blood from the knife. 
ELLEN'S VOICE Steph? Stephanie quickly tosses the knife into the bushes. Ellen appears. 
ELLEN t Didn't you hear me calling? I was looking all over for you. Are you power eating Clark bars again? 'Cause there's about ten thousand wrappers all over the-- Oh my God, is that blood?1 Stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden. But no blood shows. 
STEPHANIE No. Why would there be blood? 
ELLEN Right there, on your sleeve. Stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve. 
STEPHANIE That's just tomato juice. I was inside making a salad and... I cut a tomato and I must have gotten it on my sleeve. Ellen gives her roommate a worried look. 
ELLEN Look, Steph, we're friends so if something's wrong... 
STEPHANIE I had some problems. A situation. But I think everything is going to be good now. Ellen isn't so sure. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Stephanie closes her bedroom door so Ellen can't see the damage. Stephanie cleans up the place. As she picks up some of her things, she comes across an old photograph. CLOSER: It's a photo of 16 year old Stephanie. She was obese. Her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a "4- H" tee shirt. She stands before some barnyard animals, a bucket of feed in her hand. 
Stephanie looks distastefully down at her former self. She tears up the photo and dumps it in the waste basket. 
INT. KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON 
The music grows lighter as Stephanie models a couple of dresses in front of Ellen, who's helping decide on the evening's wardrobe. 
ELLEN Go with the short skirt. 
STEPHANIE What about this one? She hold up a longer, more formal dress. 
RAY Maybe. But in the end, it's about what you and I want. 
STEPHANIE Is that so? Ray gives her a reassuring nod. The front door opens revealing Ray's parents, GEORGE AND TRUDY DALTON. Behind them we glimpse an exquisitely furnished foyer. 
TRUDY 
RAYMONDL She kisses her son. 
RAY Stephanie, this is my mother, Trudy, and my Father, George. Trudy glances at Stephanie's revealing cocktail dress with thinly veiled disapproval. Stephanie self-consciously tugs it lower. 
TRUDY How do you do? 
GEORGE Nice tp meet you, Stephanie. 
STEPHANIE It's very nice to meet you, too. 
GEORGE Please, come in. 
STEPHANIE Thank you. 
A 
She steps inside. 
INT. DALTON'S HOUSE 
STEPHANIE You have a lovely home. 
GEORGE Thanks. I'll get us something to drink. As George exits, Stephanie presents her home made cake to Trudy. 
STEPHANIE I hope you don't mind. I baked something for you. Trudy hesitates, then takes the cake from Stephanie. 
TRUDY It's lovely. Homemade. 
STEPHANIE It's a harvest cake. 
TRUDY Harvest cake? Is'that some kind of cake you make on a... farm? 
STEPHANIE We used to, yeah, when you have a lot of extra duck eggs. Especially right before spring; that's when you get a real dense yolk. Makes for, rich cake. The mother forces a smile. 
TRUDY You must give me the recipe sometime. 
STEPHANIE Sure. It's easy. The real secret's in the milk. You want it unpasteurized. 
STEPHANIE Well, I was reading the Wall Street Journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was interested in expanding but didn't have the liquidity. I met with their CFO and presented a formula for restructuring-some of their long term debt. It created an environment where I was able to offer them a rather attractive loan 
PACKAGE 
GEORGE You sure sound like you've got a lot going for you, Stephanie. 
TRUDY Your mother must be very proud. 
STEPHANIE I suppose. I don't see her much. 
TRUDY Why is that? 
STEPHANIE Well, ever since my dad died she doesn't talk much. She mostly stays on the farm and... keeps to herself. Because... There is an awkward silence. 
TRUDY Does your mother have a drinking problem? 
RAY Cut her some slack, mom, she-- 
STEPHANIE Yes. I'm afraid she does. 
TRUDY I'm sorry. It's nothing to be ashamed of. And I find your honesty refreshing. 
STEPHANIE Thank you. 
TRUDY t You've got back bone. Not like that other girl Ray brought by... What was her name? Alicia? She was dreadful. So ill-mannered. And no ambition. 
RAY 
MOM- 
TRUDY (stage whisper to 
STEPHANIE) He found her through the,internet. 
RAY Mors, please. 
TRUDY Stephanie, am I being too tough on Ray? Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at Ray. 
STEPHANIE No. Not at all. That's what mom's are for. 
TRUDY Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will try that Harvest cake of yours, after all. Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie tastes the cake and emits a tiny cough. 
STEPHANIE Excuse me. She clears her throat. But the cough returns, grows larger. 
STEPHANIE Mr. Jacks, this is kind of awkward for me... I know it's not official yet, but I was wondering if I could get a copy of the employment contract for the new position you offered me? 
MR. JACKS The assistant manager's position? 
STEPHANIE Yes. See, one of my family members is having a little emergency which requires me to get them an immediate loan-- 
MR. JACKS --Stephanie... There's a problem. The McPherson deal was cancelled last night. 
STEPHANIE What? 1 
MR. JACKS Yeah, right after I informed the main branch that we had this big loan pending,,I find out that they just made their deal over at First National. I got a call in to see, what exactly happened but right now this doesn't look too good for you or me. So this assistant manager promotion has been delayed. In fact, I think that with everything that's been happening, I'm gonna have to give that job to Stu. Stephanie is devastated. 
STEPHANIE Stu. I see. Mr. Jacks sees tears begin to well up in her eyes. 
MR. JACKS I'm sorry. Look. If you've got family problems. Maybe you should take the day off and sort them out. Stephanie node and exits the bank. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
CLOSE SHOT - THE WALL CLOCK As it TICKS away the seconds. CLOSE SHOT - THE Inadequate PILE OF CASH That site atop Stephanie's Kitchen table. 
CLOSE SHOT - A DESPONDENT STEPHANIE stares down at the cash. Her mouth mechanically opens to accept a large serving spoon of Rocky Road ice cream which she eats directly from the one gallon tub. The door bell rings. A moment later Ray walks in.. Stephanie stands, surprised. 
RAY. I paid Rham Jas 
STEPHAINE But I thought you didn't believe... 
RAY' I don't. But you do. I know this is important for, you . she embraces him. 
EXT. PASADENA HOUSE - DUSK 
An old Pasadena home site alone atop a hill. Ray's car drives up, parks. 
STEPHANIE Are you coming in? 
RAY 
T I wanted to but Rham Jas said non believers weren't welcome. I still don't like this. 
STEPHANIE I know how crazy this must seem. But it will all be over after this I swear to you. He nods. She kisses him. 
STEPHANIE I'll call you when it's done. 
RAY I'll be waiting. 
SHAUN SAN DENA Once the spirit has entered me, place my hand upon the animal. Do you understand? 
STEPHANIE Yes. 
SHAUN SAN DENA I will force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat. Milos, that's when you strike. Stephanie blanches but remains silent. 
SHAUN SAN DENA We must all.be receptive. Shaun San Dena begins to intone a Romanian Gypsy chant. Stephanie leans close to speak quietly with Rham Jae. 
STEPHANIE What do I have to do? 
RHAM JAS You must allow the darkness in. You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit.. 
STEPHANIE I'm scared. 
RHAM JAS Yes. Now repeat these words... I welcome the dead into my soul... Rham Jae waits for Stephanie's response. She's shifts in her seat uncomfortably. 
STEPHANIE I welcome the dead into my soul... 
RHAM JAS You must believe it! Stephanie takes a deep breath and they begin the chant again. This time,, together. 
RAM JAAS STEPHANIE I welcome the dead into my I welcome the dead into my soul... soul... Stephanie looks around the darkened room. Shadows from the candles dance upon the walls. 
SHAUN SAN DENA I sense something here with us. 
RHAM JAS Yes. The parlor's crystal chandeleir tinkles. A tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment. Stephanie's eyes search the room. 
SOMETHING UNSEEN emits a wheezing breath... We hear FOOTSTEPS as something walks on the ceiling above them. 
A MAN'S LOUD LAUGHTER echoes about the room. 
SHAUN SAN DENA It is not the Lamia. It is the spirit of some unsettled soul from 
years ago... The unsettled ones wait near the door. 
THE PITCHER OF WATER upon the table is drained. Then the water is spat out in a stream at Milos' face. The MAN'S LAUGHTER again. 
SHAUN SAN DENA Be gone, foolish spirit! There is a HOWLING OF WIND and the room is again quiet. 
SHAUN SAN DENA Show yourself Lamia. We invite you into our circle. Quiet. Stephanie looks about. Nothing seems to be happening. 
SHAUN SAN DENA He's coming... 
A faint sound. 
SHAUN SAN DENA My heart. Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanie's arms. Rham Jas moves to assist her. They lower Shaun San Dana to the floor. 
RHAM JAS Milos, call an ambulance! 
Milos rushes from the room to call for help... Rham Jas checks for a pulse. 
RHAM JAS She's not breathing. Rham Jas attempts to administer CPR to no avail. 
STEPHANIE My God. My God... He checks her pulse one last time. The CPR is finally halted. Rham Jas closes her eyes, then touches her forehead, praying: 
RHAM JAS Gata, gata, para gata... bodhi suaha. Gone, gone, gone beyond. Gone beyond the beyond. Hail the goer. 
EXT. PASADENA HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER 
Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as PARAMEDICS load the covered body of Shaun San Dena into the ambulance. They close the doors and drive away. 
STEPHANIE It's sad: 
RHAM JAS Yes. 
STEPHANIE Strange how things work out. She waited years for another chance to overcome the lamia ..and finally she did. 
RHAM JAS No. I'm afraid you misunderstand. Rham Jas looks at her with pity. 
STEPHANIE What? 
RHAM JAS The,Lamia can not'be banished by a medium. This was our lesson tonight. I'm sorry. 
STEPHANIE 
But I saw her get rid of the thing... 
RHAM JAS No. You saw her drive the Lamia from the seance. That is all. It will be back. 
STEPHANIE But then, what am I supposed to do? Rham Jas shrugs. He fishes in his pocket for his car keys. 
RHAM JAS Perhaps on this final evening, you should finish up the business of this world. For before the night is through, the Lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object. 
STEPHANIE'S HAND Slowly emerges from her coat pocket. She studies the thin brass button in her palm. 0 
RHAM JAS Unless, of course... you were no longer the owner. 
STEPHANIE No longer the owner? I don't understand. Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank envelope. He places the button within and seals it. 
RAY Tomorrow's gonna be a new start for, us. Don't be late. They kiss and Ray drives off. 
INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A WALL CLOCK The time is 1:30 A.M. 
STEPHANIE drinks coffee and stares at the white envelope that's tucked into the side pocket of her purse. She scans the patrons and considers giving it to each of them, then one by one, rejects the idea. 
A WAITRESS Comes by, removes a dirty dish and refills her coffee. 
STEPHANIE Banana Boat Sundae. 
WAITRESS Another one? Stephanie nods absently. The waitress exits. 
THE WALL CLOCK The time is now 2:15 A.M. 
A WITHERED OLD MAN site alone at a table in a wheelchair. A portable oxygen cylinder, supplying him with air. 
STEPHANIE takes a deep breath, stands and walks to his table. 
STEPHANIE I wonder if you could help me out? The Old Man looks up, sees her desperation. 
OLD MAN 0 Yeah? 
STEPHANIE I just need you to hang on to this envelope for me. Just until tomorrow. She extends the envelope to him. He hesitates. 
OLD MAN What's this all about? 
STEPHANIE Just take the envelope and I'll explain. Please. The Old Man considers. He reaches for the envelope when an OLD WOMAN, his wife, hobbles toward the table. The Old Man helps her sit and puts away her cane. They turn to Stephanie who withdraws the envelope. 
STEPHANIE Never mind. Stephanie returns to her seat, ashamed at what she almost did. She returns the envelope to the purse pocket, racking her brains, trying to think of some way out of this. Her gaze lands upon a stack of newspapers on the next table. She grabs the paper and finds the OBITUARIES. 
CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER: MRS. GANUSH'S OBITUARY: A photo of the old woman. The location of the burial is listed: Oakwood Cemetary. Stephanie rips the listing from the paper and rushes from the restaurant. 
INT. RHAM JAS' HOUSE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT 
Stephanie, lit by a barren light bulb, paces the room. Rham Jas in his pajamas, studies an old leather bound text. 
STEPHANIE Well? Is it possible? 0 
FA 
He closes the book and gives it some thought. 
LONG SHOT - THE GRAVE Rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction. It has become the drain hole of the cemetery. 
THE INFLUX OF MUD pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie. Her grinning face led mashed against Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie's SCREAM is cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear beneath the mud. The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA STARTS TO PULL AWAY when... 
STEPHANIE'S HAND rips up through the mud, grasping the tree root. 
STEPHANIE'S HEAD Breaks the surface of the mud, sucking in air. She claws her way out, then staggers away, through the pouring rain. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN 
STEPHANIE steps from the shower, quickly towels her hair. She stops for a moment and studies herself in the mirror. She has survived. The phone RINGS in the bedroom; the machine picks up. 
MR. JACKS' VOICE Stephanie. It's Jim. Jim Jacks. Sorry I'm calling so early-- but Last night I found some troubling information about our friend Stu Rubin... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CITY STREET - PRE DAWN 
A cleaned up Stephanie, her hair still wet from the shower, drives the empty morning streets. A smile slowly comes to her face as we hear the rest of Mr. Jack's message: 
MR. JACKS' VOICE Apparently he stole your file on 4 the Mcpherson loan and then tried to broker his own deal at First Federal. I guess he thought we wouldn't find out. When I confronted him he broke down crying and well, we won't be seeing him around anymore. 
EXT. TRAIN STATION - PARKING LOT - PRE DAWN 
The Eastern sky is growing brighter. Stephanie's car pulls into the lot. She removes a week end bag from her trunk and walks briskly toward the station. 
MR JACKS 
(V.O.) It looks like the loan's coming back to us. And I just wanted you to know that come Monday morning, that assistant manager's position will be waiting for you. 
INT. TRAIN STATION - GRAND ENTRANCE - PRE DAWN 
Stephanie is smiling as she enters the station. 
A MRS. FIELDS REPRESENTATIVE holds a platter of freshly baked cookies and offers free samples to passersby. One is offered to Stephanie. She politely declines as she walks past with a bounce in her step. 
INT. TRAIN STATION - CLOTHING BOUTIQUE 
She stops at the window, admiring a coat on display. She glances down at her own coat. Notes the missing button. with distaste. Inside, a SALESWOMAN is preparing to open the shop. Stephanie taps on the window, shouts through the glass: 
STEPHANIE Hey! Good morning.

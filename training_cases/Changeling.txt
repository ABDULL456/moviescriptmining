BLACK SCREEN 
On which appears: 
EVERYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE, HAPPENED 
The words slowly FADE OUT, taking us hard into 
EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN 
A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium. 
SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928. 
INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN 
A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air. 
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
She throws water on her face as the music continues. She looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead. She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day. The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light. 
INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect. 
CHRISTINE Walter...time for school, honey. 
She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair. 
WALTER Just ten more minutes -- 
CHRISTINE Sorry, champ. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                       2. 
CHRISTINE (Cont'd) You can sleep in all you want tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are for. Now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold. 
WALTER It's cereal, it's supposed to be cold. 
She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again. 
EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING 
A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans. 
INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that only a few other kids have arrived. 
CHRISTINE We're here, sweetie.   Come on. 
She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there. 
She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it rumbles away. 
INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once. 
Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper. 
CHRISTINE Okay Sandy, what's the prob-- 
The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                       3. 
OPERATOR You deal with this one, I'm not going near it. 
Christine struggles on the headset. 
CHRISTINE Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can I -- (checks board) Yes, I can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can I -- (beat) I know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by -- (beat) Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone? (beat) Are you sure? Maybe there's a problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or -- (beat) Oh. No, I...I've never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there's a first time for everything, right? No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or... themselves. I'm sorry. I -- 
She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches. 
MR. HARRIS Everything all right? CHRISTINE Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just someone having a problem with a... with the connection. 
MR. HARRIS Tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times, that'll usually do it. 
CHRISTINE Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me.... 
She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another pink sheet of paper. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                       4. 
EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY 
Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself. 
Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up, we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun. 
She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again. She grabs her belongs and heads back inside. 
She hangs up. She doesn't like this, but there's no way out of it. She straightens and heads out of the room. 
INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
A disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts things together quickly. 
CHRISTINE There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to -- 
WALTER I can take care of myself. 
CHRISTINE Of course you can. She's coming by to check on the house, not you. 
She stops in front of him, kneels down to eye height. 
CHRISTINE Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies. Then we'll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier. How's that? That okay? (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      8. 
CHRISTINE (Cont'd) (he nods) Good. I'll be back before it gets dark. 
WALTER I'm not afraid of the dark.     I'm not afraid of anything. 
CHRISTINE I know you're not, honey. That's how I raised you. (kisses his head) Be good. See you in a bit. 
She heads out, the screen door clattering shut behind her. 
EXT. COLLINS HOME - CONTINUOUS 
She crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk, glancing back as Walter looks out at her from the window. She waves. He waves back. With one last look, she continues off. 
INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY 
If the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine around with papers and question. 
OPERATORS We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio...he insists on talking to someone in charge...I've tried everything and the console's just dead...I need your signature here for a supply requisition.... 
Christine glances up at the clock, 4:39.    She's already late. But she does what's necessary. 
CHRISTINE All right, get me the Omaha routing station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers...and let's get that console running.... 
She hurries off to take care of it all, the others following. 
INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - HALLWAY - LATER 
START on a clock which reads 5:20, then TILT DOWN as Christine comes out of the switchboard room, pulling on a sweater, ready to leave...as the floor manager steps out of his office. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      9. 
MR. HARRIS Christine...good, I was hoping to catch you. I've been following your work reports, and I just want you to know that I'm very impressed. 
She glances down the block. The street car is approaching, but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off. 
MR. HARRIS When I first suggested hiring female supervisors, my superiors weren't big on the idea. But you've held your own as well as any of our male supervisors, and -- 
CHRISTINE Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I -- 
MR. HARRIS Ben, please. Point is, we're looking for someone to take on a managerial position in our new Beverly Hills office. If you're interested I can -- 
CHRISTINE That's great, Mr. Harris, I really appreciate the vote of confidence. 
MR. HARRIS Good, good...so maybe we could -- 
She looks up to see the streetcar right at the stop. 
CHRISTINE I'm sorry, but I really have to go. We'll talk on Monday. Good night! She races out to 
EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - CONTINUOUS 
running after the streetcar as it closes its doors. 
CHRISTINE Wait...wait...hold on, just a -- 
But the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it. Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly. 
INT. STREET-CAR - EARLY EVENING 
Christine sits on the front bench, watching as the shadows lengthen, then pulls the bell. The car rumbles to a stop as she steps out onto the sidewalk. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                           10. 
EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING 
She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street. We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner, radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming. Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house -- 
-- and it's dark, closed up. No lights on inside, no music or dramas on the radio. Dead silent. 
Christine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic, he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house, where the lights wouldn't show. 
She goes to the front door.     It's unlocked.    She enters -- 
INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
It's dark, silent.    She puts her purse down.     Looks around. 
CHRISTINE Walter? 
Nothing.   She goes into 
INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Christine watches out the curtained living room windows, eyes red rimmed from worry but not from tears, not yet, as a police car finally pulls up. Neighbors look on as the officers get out and approach the house. HOLD on Christine's face, pale and worried, UNDER: 
REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.) Our thoughts go out again to Mrs. Christine Collins, of Lincoln Heights -- 
EXT. ST. PAUL'S PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - DAY Located at 5100 Coliseum Street 
REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.) -- whose young son, Walter Collins, disappeared almost two weeks ago. 
INT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - DAY 
A large radio microphone with the call letters KGF is atop a podium, where PASTOR GUSTAV BRIEGLEB stands: fifties, barrel chested, no-nonsense, a fire-and-brimstone preacher. His congregation sits in hard wooden pews, listening and nodding. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Though she is not a member of our congregation, we pray for her today (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    14. 
REV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd) as we have every day since we first learned of her situation on the radio, and in the newspapers. (beat) We are told that the Los Angeles Police Department is doing the best it can to reunite mother and child, and I am sure that is true. (beat) But given its position as the most violent, corrupt and incompetent police department this side of the Rocky Mountains, that's not saying a great deal. 
There's APPLAUSE and cheering from the pews.   He lets it pass. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Every day, new bodies show up along Mulholland, or in ditches, the work of Police Chief James Davis and his so-called "gun squad." Every day the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain. Every day, the city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption. Once the City of Angels, Los Angeles is now a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers...where to be the law...is to be above the law...where none dare speak truth to power. (beat) But we will not be silent. We will continue to put their offenses and their failures in full view of the public. We will not be intimidated. 
The place erupts into applause and cheering. 
INT. POLICE CHIEF JAMES DAVIS' OFFICE - DAY 
POLICE CHIEF JAMES E. DAVIS, 40s, hard-edged and tall, stands looking out the window as the radio drones on behind him. 
REV. BRIEGLEB (on radio) Because while the "gun squad" speaks in the only language Chief Davis understands, we speak in the language of compassion, truth and strength. We speak for our fellow citizens, beaten and killed by a renegade police department. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     15. 
REV. BRIEGLEB (on radio) (Cont'd) We speak for an innocent child, ripped from his mother's arms, now all but forgotten by the police. And that voice, my friends, will never be silenced. 
More cheers and applause as Davis switches off the radio. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
The alarm goes off, but Christine is already awake. Staring up at the ceiling. She slowly pulls herself up and moves OS. 
SUPERIMPOSE: APRIL 3, 1928 
INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Christine walks past the door to his bedroom. Looks inside. Goes over to the bed. Her hand lingers, touching it, UNDER: 
MR. HARRIS (V.O.) Are you sure you're ready for this, Christine? 
INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - HALLWAY - DAY 
Christine and Mr. Harris, the floor manager, approach the doors to the switchboard room. 
MR. HARRIS I mean, if you need more time -- 
CHRISTINE The police are doing all they can, and frankly I could use the money. It's been almost a month, and...it wouldn't do any good to find Walter and bring him home if he doesn't have a home to come back to, right? 
MR. HARRIS Of course. 
He smiles as he says it, but there's the sense that he doesn't think Walter's coming back. It's been too long. She senses it, but moves past it, pushing open the door and entering 
INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As loud as before...until the operators see Christine, and the noise stops. She tries to smile, as if to say, I'm okay, but can't quite manage it. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      16. 
Several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier. 
MR. HARRIS Well...I'll leave you to it, then. 
She nods as he exits, then heads off herself. 
INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - LATER 
Christine moves from station to station, the noise level still noticeably low. Every time she approaches an operator, they lower their voices, as if not to bother her. 
One operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this, she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says: 
CHRISTINE Excuse me, can I have your attention? 
The room grows quiet.   Everyone is looking at her. 
CHRISTINE Listen, everyone, I appreciate your consideration, but I'm not made of porcelain. I won't break down and cry if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn't go through. (a thin smile) Actually, I...promised myself that I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself cry...until I knew, one way or another, what.... (beat) Point is...I like the noise here. So don't be afraid to talk and...push buttons, and drop things. If it wasn't noisy, how would I know I was in the right place? 
She manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal. 
EXT. PHONE COMPANY LUNCH AREA - AFTERNOON 
Mr. Harris steps out into the lunch area where a number of the operators and supervisors are hanging out. 
MR. HARRIS Excuse me, has anyone seen Christine? 
OPERATOR I think I saw her in the back office. 
JONES Mrs. Collins? 
She manages a nod. Behind her eyes is the terror: he's going to tell me my son is dead. The room gets very quiet. 
JONES My name is Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division. My office supervises all runaway and missing child cases, including your son's, and.... (beat, a smile) He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was picked up two days ago by local police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's safe and unhurt. He was in the company of some drifter, we've got an APB out for him now, and -- 
But she hasn't heard anything past he's safe and unhurt. She almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her, crying and embracing her. 
For the first time, Christine cries, great wracking sobs, all the emotion she's been fighting back all this time coming out at last...he's okay...he's okay. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. UNION STATION - DAY 
Jones and Christine are in a police car pulling up to the train station. It moves through a police line holding back a crowd of reporters who SHOUT questions at the passing car. 
CHRISTINE All these reporters...you didn't tell me -- 
JONES Yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins. People love happy endings. (checks watch) Train should be pulling in shortly. We'd better get a move on. 
As Christine and Jones step out, they're mobbed by the press. Jones smiles splendidly for the cameras, waves, one arm wrapped around Christine, who looks stunned by it all. 
JONES Thank you...we'll have a statement for you in a little while. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      21. 
JONES (Cont'd) Right now the important thing is to re-unite this little lady with her son. So if you'll excuse us.... 
Beaming, Jones escorts Christine into Union Station. 
INT. TRAIN - DAY 
Seated on a bench is a POLICE MATRON, and beside her, the BOY from the De Kalb diner...who we will identify henceforth as "Walter." He is looking out the window at the passing scenery. 
"WALTER" Did you know that Los Angeles is where they make the Tom Mix movies? 
MATRON No, I didn't. 
"WALTER" His horse is named Blue. (beat) You think they'll let me watch them make a movie? 
MATRON I don't know, you'll have to ask. But with all this attention, who knows, maybe they will. 
The boy turns his attention back out the window as we HEAR the WHISTLE of the train pulling into Union Station. 
INT. UNION STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY 
We HEAR the same train whistle from this side as Christine and Jones come to the ramp, POLICE CHIEF DAVIS is waiting. The reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform. 
JONES Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you to Chief of Police James E. Davis. 
CHRISTINE Oh, my, I didn't expect -- 
DAVIS We don't get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days, so it's good to be here when there's a positive story, don't you think? 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   22. 
But she's distracted, looking off to the end of the platform, where the train is starting to pull in. 
DAVIS I take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department? 
CHRISTINE Oh...yes, of course, they've been great. Well, there was that part about having to wait twenty-four hours before filing a report, but -- 
DAVIS Technicalities aside -- 
The train stops.    Doors begin to open. 
CHRISTINE Yes...other than that, no complaints. They've all been wonderful. 
DAVIS Good, then you won't have any problem telling that to the press, and how the LAPD is concerned first and foremost with the safety of -- 
But she's already running down the platform as people start to step off the train. Jones exchanges a look with Davis. 
JONES Women.    Just a sec.... 
He trots off to catch up with Christine, who walks alongside the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager. 
Then: the Matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily blocking the view of the boy beside her...but Christine spots them. With Jones not far behind, she breaks into a run. 
CHRISTINE Walter...Walter! 
She runs toward them. The matron turns, sees her, smiles and gets out of the way, revealing the boy. 
Christine stops. Staggers so hard she almost falls. She steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth. For a moment, we're not sure what's going through her mind. She looks to the matron, who smiles. Looks to the boy, who smiles. 
Then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes jauntily alongside her. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      23. 
JONES Well?   Aren't you going to -- 
CHRISTINE He's not my son. 
Jones freezes at the words. 
JONES I...what are you -- 
CHRISTINE He's not my son. (beat) He's not my son. 
INT. HALLWAY FRONTING BATHROOM - LATER 
Carrying a pair of pajamas, Christine comes into the hall and stops in front of the bathroom door. Knocks. 
CHRISTINE I found you a pair of pajamas. I bought them for Walter but he didn't like the fabric, so -- 
CHANGELING A True Story                                       27. 
"WALTER" (O.S.) Ow! 
She hears him fall and pushes the door open. 
INT. BATHROOM 
She helps "Walter" stand, discreetly turned away from us. 
CHRISTINE Are you all right? 
"WALTER" I fell.   Stupid tub. 
CHRISTINE Did you hurt yourself?     Let me see -- 
She stops suddenly, reacting to something we don't see. Looks slowly looks up to his face. 
CHRISTINE ...circumcised.... 
She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom. 
INT. HALLWAY 
She places him against the wall where she measured Walter's growth over the years. The marks put him four inches shorter than the one labeled March. She looks at him, very serious. 
CHRISTINE The last time I measured Walter -- the last time I measured my son -- he was four inches taller than you are right now. (beat) Who are you? (beat) What are you doing here? (beat) Who are you? 
He says nothing.   HOLD on her look of growing desperation. 
INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY 
Jones walks quickly down the hall, trying to look interested in a clutch of papers in his hands, Christine following after. 
CHRISTINE He's not my son. 
JONES Mrs. Collins -- 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   28. 
CHRISTINE I don't know who he is, or why he's saying he's Walter, but there's clearly been some kind of mistake. 
JONES We agreed you would give him time to adjust -- 
CHRISTINE He's four inches shorter than Walter. Boys his age don't shrink. If anything, he should be taller. 
JONES Maybe your measurements are off. Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for -- 
CHRISTINE He's circumcised. Walter wasn't. 
Jones glances back, uncomfortable about discussing circumcision with a woman in public view. He lowers his voice. 
JONES Mrs. Collins...your son was missing for four months. For at least part of that in the company of an as-yet unidentified drifter. Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done? He could have had him...circumcised... might have -- 
CHRISTINE Made him smaller? Captain, please -- 
He's on the move again, stepping into -- INT. JONES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
-- and getting behind his desk as Christine follows him in. 
CHRISTINE -- why won't you listen to me? 
JONES I am listening, damn it, I -- (beat, calmer) I am listening. And I understand your feelings. He's changed, no mistake. You've both been through a terrible experience. That's why he needs your support and love to bounce back. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                       29. 
CHRISTINE Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof. 
He sits, shaking his head. 
JONES Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins? You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy, your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needs...so I don't understand why you're trying to run away from your responsibilities -- 
CHRISTINE I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter. 
JONES Why should we look someone we've already found? 
CHRISTINE But you haven't found him. He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt.... 
JONES His identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they're doing. CHRISTINE And I don't? Captain, look, I don't want to cause trouble for you or the department. Honestly I don't. I know you've done everything you can...but there's been a terrible mistake, and I need your help if we're going to correct it...before it's too late. Please. 
She exits.   Annoyed, Jones paces, then picks up the phone. 
JONES Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     30. 
INT. COLLINS HOME - DAY 
Christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. She opens the door to find a police officer and DR. EARL W. TARR, sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance. 
DR. TARR Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr. Captain Jones sent me. I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases. May I come in? 
MRS. RILEY My last concession to vanity; men don't make passes at women who wear glasses, you know. (checks the watch) Five o'clock. 
CHRISTINE Thank you. 
Mrs. Riley nods and heads inside as Christine looks to Tarr, who shrugs off what was just demonstrated. 
DR. TARR A boy is much larger than a watch, Mrs. Collins. (to "Walter") Come along, son. 
Tarr takes "Walter's" hand and heads away, Christine following, anger growing in her eyes as we HEAR: 
CHRISTINE (V.O.) This is absolutely outrageous! INT. COLLINS HOME - KITCHEN - DAY 
She is on the phone, "Walter" finishing up his dinner in BG. 
CHRISTINE Captain, I...no, listen to me, this so-called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldn't even recognize her own -- (beat) He found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it's not -- (beat) No, I am not reassured. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    35. 
CHRISTINE (Cont'd) I thought we had an understanding, I -- (beat) That I was embarrassed isn't the issue, the point is you're wasting time when you should be looking for my son, I -- (beat) Then I want to see this report, so I can refute it, before it goes to anyone else, all right? Fine. 
She hangs up. Hard. The events of the day have her teetering on the edge, but she's holding on. She pulls herself together and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent BEAT before "Walter" looks up from his now-empty plate. 
"WALTER" I'm finished. Can I go to my room now? 
CHRISTINE Yes.   Go on up. 
"Walter" rises, as Christine continues to clean dishes, not looking back at him. Exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally. He goes to the door, stops, turns. 
"WALTER" G'night, Mommy. 
Christine fumbles the plate and it SMASHES to the floor.   She turns furiously to "Walter." 
CHRISTINE Stop saying that! I'm not your mother! And you're not my son! She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last. 
CHRISTINE WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY SON BACK! 
He tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes. 
CHRISTINE 
I want my son back...god, please... make it stop...just make it stop. 
INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
"Walter" is in bed, his back to the door, as Christine appears in the hallway. She steps into the room, sits on the bed. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    36. 
He doesn't move.   Her voice is soft, but firm. 
CHRISTINE I was wrong to yell at you. You're still a child, and I think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but I need you to understand. Walter is...he's all I have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where I can help him. (beat) Whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we? We both know you're not Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to straighten this out before it's too late. Maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. But you're not. You don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. Just... tell them the truth. 
He doesn't respond. She gives it a moment in case he might open up, then rises and heads back into the hallway. She switches off the light and heads off down the hallway.

INT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - RECTORY - PRE-DAWN 
Pastor Briegleb is typing out his sermon for the day. He's exhausted. Looks at the clock. 6:30 a.m. He rubs tiredly at his face when he HEARS the THUMP of the newspaper being delivered. He stands, stretches and steps out to -- 
EXT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 
-- where the newspaper is visible on the front lawn. He picks it up and starts into the rectory as he unfolds the paper. 
Then: he slows, stunned by something he's reading.   He looks up again, and hurries back into the rectory. 
INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN 
She's in bed, asleep, as the telephone RINGS downstairs. She glances at the clock: 6:45. She clearly doesn't want to go down to answer it...then reluctantly climbs out of bed. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   37. 
INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The telephone is still ringing as she picks it up. 
CHRISTINE Hello? 
REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) Is this Mrs. Christine Collins? 
CHRISTINE Yes?   Who is this? 
REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) My name is Gustav Briegleb, I'm the pastor over at St. Paul's -- 
CHRISTINE Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio broadcasts after my son...you were very supportive, and I appreciate -- 
REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) Mrs. Collins...have you seen the Times today? 
CHRISTINE No, I -- 
REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) You'd better take a look. Then come by the parish in an hour for breakfast. I think we should meet. 
She starts to reply, but the line goes dead. She hangs up the phone, pulls her robe closer around her, and steps out to 
EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN where a copy of the Los Angeles Times sits on a neighbor's front lawn. She looks around, then dashes to pick it up. She unfolds it as she heads back, then abruptly stops. She can't believe what she's seeing. 
CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER. The headline reads Mysterious Transformation in Collins Boy. 
CHRISTINE Reverend Briegleb...I appreciate what you're saying, and what you're doing...but I'm not on a mission. The only thing I want is to find my son, that's all, and I just -- 
REV. BRIEGLEB A lot of mothers' sons ended up being sacrificed to expediency around here, Mrs. Collins. Yours wouldn't be the first. Do this right, and maybe yours will be the last. 
She gets up from the table, paces the garden. 
CHRISTINE If they honestly thought I was wrong, that'd be one thing...but if they don't care, if they're just trying to cover it up.... 
He picks up the article, waves it. 
REV. BRIEGLEB This is their attempt to win by framing the discussion their way. "Why, of course it's her son...yes, there have been changes...we're looking into it, and isn't it strange that they happened after the boy got home?" (beat) They're putting you in the position of having to disprove what they're saying...and that's hard. Most people believe what they hear from the police or the government. If you play it their way, you...and your son...are going to lose. 
She closes her eyes for a BEAT, then looks to him, her voice firmer, her decision made. 
CHRISTINE What do I have to do? 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     43. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Change the rules of engagement. Re- define the argument. They brought in their expert, so you bring in yours. You have an advantage they don't. You know your son better than they ever will, and in that knowledge is the proof you need. (beat) Get that information, put it out there. Make them respond to you, not the other way around. 
He gets up, walks toward her, puts his hands on her shoulders. Giving her strength...but also his concern. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Once people side with the police, it's a hard climb...but even in a town as loud as this one, the voice of truth can be heard...if you're willing to take it all the way in spite of the dangers...and they are very real, Mrs. Collins, make no mistake. Once you open the book on these people, you're going to be looking over your shoulder every day, maybe for the rest of your life. (beat) You up to it, Mrs. Collins? 
He looks in her eyes...and she meets his gaze levelly.   The answer is evident. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - ANGLE ON DOOR - DAY 
We're in a dentist's office. Christine is waiting for a BEAT before the door opens, and DR. JOHN MONTGOMERY emerges. 
CHRISTINE Well? 
DR. MONTGOMERY He had two cavities that needed filling. He put up a fight, but I took care of it. 
CHRISTINE And...? 
He casts a look back at the closed door, shakes his head. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                  44. 
DR. MONTGOMERY Your son's upper front teeth were separated by a small muscle. Made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart. The boy in that room has no such gap. 
CHRISTINE Does a gap like that get smaller with age? Because that's what they'll say. 
DR. MONTGOMERY In some cases, yes, it's possible. But the muscle between Walter's teeth prevents that from happening. They can never come together without an operation to sever the muscle, and I can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation. 
CHRISTINE Will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially? 
DR. MONTGOMERY Pardon my language, but...hell, yes. 
He hears an OS moan from the inner office. 
DR. MONTGOMERY Sounds like the anesthetic is wearing off. (starts in, pauses) On the other hand, maybe I'll write that letter first. Give the little fella something to think about. He smiles. 
INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING 
Small, with wooden desks, chalkboard, all the basics. "Walter" stands in front of MRS. FOX, fifties, wearing severe glasses and an equally severe expression. Christine stands nearby. 
CHRISTINE Well? What do you think? Is that the Walter Collins that you remember? 
MRS. FOX If it is, he's changed enormously. (to "Walter") Do you know who I am? 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     45. 
"WALTER" You're a teacher. 
MRS. FOX Yes, but even teachers have names. What's mine? 
"WALTER" I don't remember. I know you, but I don't remember your name. 
MRS. FOX My name is Mrs. Fox.   Now, take your seat. 
"Walter" hesitates, then takes a seat.    The other kids laugh. 
MRS. FOX I didn't say take a seat. I said take your seat. Your assigned seat. You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year. 
"Walter" tries another vacant seat. There are only three vacant seats in the room. More laughter from the kids. 
MRS. FOX Try again. Here's a hint: There's only one more empty seat left. 
He sits.   Mrs. Fox looks to Christine. 
MRS. FOX Mrs. Collins, if that's your son, I'll eat my yardstick. Not only will I put that in writing, I'll swear to it in a court of law and in front of President Calvin Coolidge himself if I have to. 
For the first time, Christine allows a hopeful smile. 
INT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
The lights are low. Christine sits on the floor, sorting through a box containing artifacts of affection: class projects made by Walter, trees and houses and clay dogs; a heart-shaped card Mother's Day card, hand-made, with I Love You, Mommy carefully printed on the front. She runs her finger over it, tracing the impression left by his pencil. 
She starts to cry, and a tear falls onto the pencil drawing. She frantically dabs at it, trying to preserve it from distortion...then sets it down and covers her face, weeping.

EXT. CITY HALL - MORNING (RAIN) 
The door opens, and a POLICE MATRON enters. He looks back to Christine, his voice low, his anger replaced by cool determination. This scene is about to take an abrupt change. 
JONES Mrs. Collins...do you still insist that the boy out there is not your son? 
CHRISTINE Yes. 
He nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her. 
CHRISTINE Wait...what are you doing? 
The Matron cuffs Christine's hands behind her back. 
MATRON Please don't struggle, ma'am.   You'll only hurt yourself. 
A CLICK, and the handcuffs are in place. 
JONES (to the matron) You are to convey the prisoner to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward. 
CHRISTINE No...wait, you can't -- 
JONES (still to matron) Make the following entry in the booking department: Defendant states she has been deceived by police and others, and that they have given her a boy and tried to make her think it is her son when she says it is not. 
EXT. REAR OF POLICE STATION (MONTAGE) 
Christine is led, in handcuffs, into a waiting police van. (VO has been taken verbatim from the police report.) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      51. 
JONES (V.O.) Mrs. Collins has been known to us since about March 10, 1928, when she reported her nine-year-old son Walter missing. 
INT. VAN 
A stunned and dazed Christine rides in the back of the van 
JONES (V.O.) The boy was gone until July, 1928. Since his return, she has complained that he is still missing, and has made repeated requests that he be found, saying, "This is not my Walter," even though positive identification has been established. 
EXT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY 
The police van enters the hospital at 1200 North State Street. 
INT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - DAY 
A sterile, dreary, white-on-white place where in the background, we can HEAR the sounds of the insane crying out. The matron leads a stunned Christine to the front desk. 
JONES (V.O.) She suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution, and dislocation from reality. She may be a threat to herself or others. We recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward for treatment and observation until her senses can be restored. The matron stops before the desk.   The NURSE barely looks up. 
MATRON Got another code twelve. 
NURSE Name? 
MATRON Collins.   Christine. 
CHRISTINE Wait...please, this is a mistake. 
NURSE (to matron) Certifying officer? 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   52. 
MATRON Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Heights division. 
CHRISTINE (forced calm) Please...you have to listen to me. The police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say I'm crazy -- 
She stops, noting the looks exchanged between the nurse and the matron. Her story sounds insane, even to her. She begins to realize the depth of her predicament. 
CHRISTINE Oh, god...oh god, please, no.... 
NURSE If you continue to struggle I'll have to put you in a straitjacket. Do you want that? (she shakes head) Good. Then behave yourself. (to orderlies) Code twelve. 
The matron turns Christine over to two large male ORDERLIES, who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward. 
CHRISTINE No, please, you have to listen to me...wait...please! 
They force-march her down the hall, the screams of the insane growing louder, falling deeper into the nightmare. INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM 
Christine is ushered into the room by a NURSE. 
NURSE Take off your clothes. 
CHRISTINE Why? 
NURSE Physical examination, body cavity search and de-lousing. Required for all new patients. 
The nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   53. 
CHRISTINE That's not necessary -- 
NURSE You can remove your clothes yourself, or I can have the orderlies do it for you. Which do you prefer? 
Reluctantly, Christine begins to remove her clothes. 
INT. SHOWER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
ON CHRISTINE'S FACE as she stands in a spray of water and disinfectant, some coming from the showerhead above, some from a hose sprayed on her by the Nurse in BG. Christine's eyes are closed, trying to shut out the sense of violation. 
NURSE Spread your legs. (a beat) Wider. 
The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place. The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a mess. Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen. No sound except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Old, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock. There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world. Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then STOPS at a creak of wood from a CLOSET. He moves toward it. Pauses. Reaches for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock CHIMES loudly and the closet explodes outward and -- 
-- SANFORD CLARK, 15, runs out. He slams into Ybarra, knocking him down. They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on the floor as Sanford tries to escape. YBARRA Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face through the floor! 
Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling.   Ybarra cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back. 
YBARRA On your feet. 
Sanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we PAN TO a mantle and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott. 
INT. YBARRA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Ybarra locks Sanford in the car, then climbs in the driver's side. He checks a cut on his face in the rear-view mirror.

YBARRA Jesus...what the hell's wrong with you? Don't you know assaulting a cop is against the law? 
SANFORD What difference does it make now? 
YBARRA We're just sending you back to Canada, son, it isn't the end of the world. 
SANFORD What? 
YBARRA You can't just stay in the U.S. as long as you want, pal. We've got a orders to send you back home, and -- 
Suddenly Sanford starts laughing. It's a nearly hysterical laugh, half fear and half relief...Ybarra isn't there for the reasons he thought. Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction. 
YBARRA Didn't know Canada was that funny. 
Ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off.

The aide hurries off as Briegleb turns back to the microphone and touches a switch. The ON THE AIR lamp glows to life.

Christine is in bed, wide awake, the sounds of the asylum somewhat lessened now. Her face is dimly lit by moonlight. 
BRIEGLEB (V.O.) I had hoped to have a guest with us tonight, but apparently she has been delayed. Since she can't be here to tell you what she told the press this afternoon, I'll fill in the best I can. I'm going to tell you what happened, and I'm going to keep telling you right here, every night...until someone does something about it.

Gordon Northcott makes his way to the ticket booth. 
GORDON I'd like a ticket to Canada. Alberta or Vancouver, whatever's leaving tonight. 
TICKET VENDER Don't have anything going that far tonight. Best I can do is put you on a train for Seattle. From there you can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border. 
GORDON That'll be fine. TICKET VENDER Round-trip? 
GORDON One way. 
The vender moves away to pull the ticket. Gordon glances at a cop heading his way. Stiffens. The cop continues past him. Gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across. 
TICKET VENDER That'll be fifteen dollars. 
Gordon pays for the ticket and heads toward the boarding gates.

Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept all night. She's staring at the woman on the next cot. THe woman is staring back at her. The second-hand on a clock behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL goes off, announcing the start of the day. 
We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown... looking like someone who actually belongs in this place. 
The door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes. 
CHRISTINE Can I see the doctor?   Or someone in charge -- 
The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled. 
ADMINISTRATOR He's off-duty until tomorrow, but... I'll see what I can do. No promises. 
And with that, the administrator heads away. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON 
Gordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road. A truck approaches, passes him...then slows and stops. Gordon runs up to the truck as the DRIVER leans out. 
DRIVER How far you going? 
GORDON Vancouver. 
DRIVER Hop in. 
Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts out a short length of metal pipe. DRIVER Don't worry about that, pal. Just a little insurance. A couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border. You can't be too safe, you know? 
GORDON Yeah, I surely do. 
Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over. Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off.

STEELE Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat. 
The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair. Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane. 
STEELE I hope your stay has been comfortable so far. 
CHRISTINE Fine.   Thank you. 
STEELE Really? I'd think it would be quite difficult at first. 
CHRISTINE (catching herself) Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable. 
He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going well. He motions to the bandage on her arm. 
STEELE I see they took a blood test. 
CHRISTINE Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind. 
STEELE The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis...did that upset you? 
CHRISTINE No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure. 
She smiles a forced smile.   Trying to appear level-headed.

CHRISTINE (covering her bases) But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them. (beat) However inappropriate that might be. 
She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks up the report on his desk, glances it over. 
STEELE According to your file, you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son. Is that true? 
CHRISTINE I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy. (beat) They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing. 
He starts pulling out papers from his file. 
STEELE That's strange...you see, I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming your son home. That is you in the photo, isn't it? CHRISTINE Yes. 
STEELE So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son. (beat) Has this been going on for a long time? People...changing, becoming something other than what they are?

CHRISTINE No.    Of course not. 
STEELE The police are here to protect us. 
CHRISTINE That's right. 
He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to hear. It's a chess match that ends with: 
STEELE That's odd, because according to the head nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately, to punish you. So either she and the interns are also conspiring against you...or you're changing your story. (beat) Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins? 
He sits back.    Christine's face tells the story.

SANFORD (V.O.) He'd use all kinds of different stories. Sometimes he'd say he had free tickets for the circus, or he was looking for a lost dog...that one worked real good. Other days --

KID You have?

The boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop.   There are two other boys there, also crying and screaming. 
SANFORD (V.O.) Some days he'd do 'em right off. Other days, he'd wait, pick up a few more, keep 'em in the coop until he had like four or five, 'cause -- (beat) -- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream all at once. Like they were some kinda chorus. And then....

YBARRA These...uhm...these kids...do you think...if you saw them again, do you think you'd recognize them? (sanford nods) Just a second. 
He goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing kids bound with a rubber band. Hands it to Sanford. 
YBARRA I haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be.... (beat) Just go through...and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table. 
Sanford takes the photos.   Starts going through them. 
A photo, a face, goes down on the table. Then another. A third. With each photo slapped down the SLAP gets louder, BOOMING at us. Another photo. Another. Row after row. He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos. 
Then he SLAMS down the last one and   half-falls, half-stumbles out of his chair, sobbing...goes to   the corner of the room and slides down the wall until he's   sitting in a fetal position, hands covering his face.    Sobbing uncontrollably. 
Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at it. Turns it over to the name, then picks up another. Then a third. When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over, he stops, staring at it. 
YBARRA ...shit.... The name on the back of the photo is WALTER COLLINS.

YBARRA With all due respect, sir, I don't think so. You didn't see him, the kid's scared half out of his mind --

JONES (Cont'd) There were four other photos of missing boys that looked a lot like him...this Clark kid could have been mistaken. 
DAVIS Maybe he was...which raises the obvious question: so what? 
JONES Sir? 
Davis turns back to him from the window. 
DAVIS The Mayor wants this to go away. I want this to go away. The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch. Because if the boy you brought back isn't Walter Collins, and he's not dead up at that ranch, then where the hell is he? People will want to know why we haven't found him. Why we aren't we doing our job. (beat) But if, on the other hand, he is, or could be among those poor boys killed up in Wineville...then the inquiries stop. It's a momentary embarrassment that you'll have to live with...but better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem, wouldn't you say, Captain? Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride.   Nods. 
JONES Yes, sir. 
DAVIS The boy's been gone for nearly a year. If he was going to be found, it would've happened by now. Whether he was up at that ranch or not, the truth is he probably is dead somewhere. Better his mother accepts that now rather than later, don't you think? 
JONES Yes, sir. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   90. 
DAVIS Good.    That'll be all, Captain. 
Jones starts to leave, then looks back as Davis settles back behind his desk. 
JONES Sir, there's talk of an investigation by the police commission. 
DAVIS Let me worry about the commission. But it wouldn't hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back from De Kalb and why he did this, because the press bought into his bullshit same as we did. That we were all taken in by the scheming little bastard may help take some of the sting off this. 
JONES My boys are working on it now, sir. 
And he exits as we go to 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
Detective Ybarra is sitting on one side of a table, a notepad in front of him, staring across at "Walter," who isn't very happy right now, and is staring back with substantial venom. His true, nasty personality is free to come out at last. There's a long BEAT, then: 
"WALTER" I want a glass of water. 
YBARRA Tough. 
"WALTER" (mocking) "Tough!" 
YBARRA What's your name? 
"WALTER" Walter Collins. 
YBARRA Walter Collins is dead. 
"WALTER" (shrugs) I didn't do it. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   91. 
YBARRA Look, let me explain something to you. Because of your lies, you've ruined a woman's life embarrassed the police department, and got the whole city up in arms over this. 
"Walter" considers this for a BEAT, then smiles. 
"WALTER" Got a lot done, didn't I? 
Ybarra exchanges a look with the matron, then closes up his notepad. 
YBARRA All right, if that's how you want it, then I guess we're done here. (to matron) Tell County Jail we're remanding him for trial. 
"WALTER" Wait...what's remanding?    What trial? 
YBARRA I told you, the real Walter Collins was murdered. 
"WALTER" So? I didn't do anything! I wasn't even here when it happened! 
YBARRA By pretending to be Walter Collins, you're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder. We can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact. (beat) Too bad. County Jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home. A lot worse. 
"WALTER" You can't do that...I'm just a kid! 
YBARRA Sanford Clark is a kid, too. Fifteen. But he's going to jail. All murderers and their accomplices go to jail. Everyone knows that. (to the matron) Get him out of here. It's out of my hands now. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   92. 
He heads for the door when "Walter" cries out, scared. 
"WALTER" Wait!   I don't want to go to jail. 
YBARRA Prove it. 
And on the boy's face, we HEAR: 
YBARRA (V.O.) Arthur Hutchins. 
INT. JONES' OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Ybarra is standing in the doorway to Jones' office, speaking to the Captain and looking at his notepad. 
YBARRA The boy's real name is Arthur Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
JONES Did you check the wire services? 
Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet. 
YBARRA Checks out. The report was filed by his divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's grandmother. Apparently he didn't like living with the old lady, she didn't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day...he up and left. JONES What about the man he showed up with at the diner? 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Bob quietly lets the Mounties in. They signal for Bob to get the hell out of there. Guns in hand, they climb the stairs. 
Suddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above. They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon fleeing across an adjoining rooftop. 
MOUNTIE Go around the other side!    Cut him off! 
The others take off as he and another Mountie climb through the broken window in pursuit of Northcott. 
EXT. ROWHOUSES - NIGHT 
Gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, WHISTLES blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast. 
Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance between himself and the police on the ground...and making increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop to rooftop. 
He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running. The rooftop Mounties follow. One of them makes the jump successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the ground three stories below. A leg snaps on impact. The first Mountie hesitates, looks down. The second one waves him on. 
SECOND MOUNTIE Go on!   Get the bastard! 
He nods and continues the chase. Gordon runs for all he's worth.    The Mountie keeps after him. 
Gordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short. He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free -- 
-- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming. 
Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction -- 
-- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   97. 
They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going over the edge. 
With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the Mountie backs off just a bit -- 
MOUNTIE Screw this...I'm too old for this fightin' shit.... 
-- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the two-story roof and DOWN into -- 
-- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned by Gordon. 
As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose. 
MOUNTIE YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST! 
And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers. 
INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Christine opens the door to find Reverend Briegleb and another man on her porch, S. S. HAHN, late fifties. 
BRIEGLEB Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a friend of mine, Mr. Hahn. 
CHRISTINE Hello. HAHN Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences on your loss. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Can we come in? 
CHRISTINE Yes...of course. 
She steps aside to let them in, closing the door under: 
CHRISTINE Mr. Hahn, was it? 
HAHN Yes. 
CHANGELING A True Story                          98. 
CHRISTINE I appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the...remains... as Walter's. 
HAHN But he was identified, was he not? 
CHRISTINE Yes, but...I guess I still can't accept it. It doesn't feel real to me. 
HAHN It never does. I lost a daughter to polio five years ago. There's not a day goes by I don't think, I should mention this to Claudine... then I remember she's not here. 
CHRISTINE I'm sorry.     Please, sit. 
They do as Christine looks to Briegleb. 
CHRISTINE I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not necessary. 
REV. BRIEGLEB I know. My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing. They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid...and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety. 
CHRISTINE Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer...bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a hearing by the Welfare Board. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Jut one problem. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    99. 
REV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd) Not one lawyer outside this room was willing to take on the Police Department. Too risky, they said. So finally I went to the very best attorney in town, a man who's sued the city four times and won. Unfortunately, we could never afford to hire him. 
CHRISTINE (crestfallen) I see.... 
HAHN Which is why I'm doing this pro bono. (a smile) It would be my honor to defend your honor, Mrs. Collins. In my fifteen years as a lawyer, I have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have, in what is so clearly in the cause of justice. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn here the whole story, from end to end, leave nothing out, he'll need it all if he's going to get the City Council involved. 
REPORTER What's the charge, Chief? 
CHIEF DAVIS The charge is conduct unbecoming an officer, and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs. Collins. It further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause. 
REPORTER Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the City Council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the Collins case? 
MAYOR CRYER I've heard this, yes. But since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the City Council would be to suspend Captain Jones, and since that action has now been taken, the question is moot. 
REPORTER Which makes it look like the only reason Jones is being suspended is to head off the City Council (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    104. 
REPORTER (Cont'd) investigation. Are you concerned that an outside investigation might go uncomfortably high up the food chain? 
CHIEF DAVIS I won't even dignify that question with a response. Good day. 
The two head back into 
INT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Glancing back over their shoulders at the press outside. 
CRYER Cheer up, Chief. That little show should take the wind out of their sails. By Monday, this issue will be as cold as yesterday's fish. Never underestimate the public's lack of attention and potential for apathy. Old news is dead news, you'll see. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
She opens the door as Briegleb enters with three really large, dangerous looking men, one of whom is carrying a heavy trench coat. 
CHRISTINE Reverend, what -- 
BRIEGLEB Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs. Collins, but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job. These three gentlemen are members of my congregation who, before coming to the Lord, had lived lives of brutality, vice and crime. Now they are pledged to doing god's work...and if this isn't it, I don't know what is. 
CHRISTINE I don't understand. 
BRIEGLEB People who bring charges against the police have a habit of (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     105. 
BRIEGLEB (Cont'd) disappearing right before the trial. I'm a big believer in the power of prayer, Mrs. Collins...but a little backup from time to time never hurts. 
The others nod as they make themselves comfortable in the living room. 
CHRISTINE I see...well, I...thank you.   Can I get you anything? 
BRIEGLEB Since we don't plan on sleeping, coffee would be lovely. 
She heads off to get some coffee. As one of the men puts his coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off shotgun. Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police car sits, watching the house. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - MORNING 
She's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair of gloves. Her hands are shaking. She squeezes them together, closes her eyes. Focuses. With one final, deep breath, she heads out. 
EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING 
The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls away from the curb, following both cars. EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - BRIEGLEB'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine, smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead. 
BRIEGLEB Traffic's getting heavy.   We'll go up Spring. 
He turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear view mirror to see -- 
-- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting off the car with Christine's bodyguards. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                  106. 
Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police car glide into position two cars behind them. 
Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then there's a momentary break in traffic. 
BRIEGLEB Hold on. 
He turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts off the engine. Jumps out and opens the door for Christine, who gets out. 
BRIEGLEB Start walking. Quickly. 
They do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too late as -- 
-- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot, Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance, something that could be the sound of lots of people. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Almost there. Just a few more blocks. 
CHRISTINE Where is all this traffic's coming from...? Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors, and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine stops a man passing in the opposite direction. 
CHRISTINE Excuse me, can you tell me what the problem is up ahead? 
MAN Didn't you hear? It's the biggest protest I've ever seen. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Protest? 
OFFICER Yeah...over that Collins broad, if you can believe that. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    107. 
The bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge. Christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles turn white...but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of seeing her react to his comments. The judge looks up. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                  111. 
JUDGE Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree, with an additional seventeen counts under review by the district attorney's office. How do you plea? 
GORDON Not guilty, your honor. 
He glances back at his audience.   The bailiff rights him again. 
JUDGE In light of the defendant's penchant for international travel, no bail will be set. This court will receive preliminary motions by tomorrow morning, with a trial date to be set for the earliest opening on the court's calendar. (beat) The defendant is remanded into custody. Bailiff.... 
The bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his audience, and Christine in particular. He winks at her. She doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction. But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes, fighting tears. Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says nothing. There's nothing to say. 
JONES (V.O.) The boy, Walter Collins, was reported as missing on March 10, 1928. 
INT. CITY COUNCIL ROOM - DAY Jones is at last on the stand. Hahn stands before him, the rest of the City Council, Christine and the huge audience looking on. 
JONES We then instituted a nationwide search. On July 10, we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning, he admitted to being Walter Collins, and we made arrangements to transport him back to California. 
HAHN Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy was not her son. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      112. 
JONES Yes. She denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary. 
HAHN But as subsequent events have demonstrated, she was correct. So what prompted you to send her for psychological evaluation? 
JONES Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision. Throughout this period, she acted strangely. She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent conversations. It was because of her disturbing behavior that I submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital. 
HAHN Just like that. You snap your fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward. 
JONES She wasn't -- 
Hahn turns away, playing to the council and the audience. 
HAHN Every home in this state is in grave danger when a Police Captain can take a woman into his office and, five minutes later, have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own authority! 
The crowd applauds and cheers.    Joes fights to be heard. 
JONES (over the crowd) She wasn't -- 
HAHN What was that, Captain? 
JONES She wasn't thrown.     She was... escorted. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    113. 
There's laughter from the gallery.   He doesn't like it. 
HAHN Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't matter, Captain. What does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant. 
Hahn goes to the exhibit table, picks up several papers. 
HAHN I am holding a carbon copy of the affidavit of insanity that was issued in the case of the State of California vs. Christine Collins. Who signed the affidavit? 
JONES I did. 
HAHN And what is the date on this document? 
JONES September 12th. 
HAHN But Mrs. Collins was incarcerated on September 6th. 
JONES The form is backdated. 
HAHN Yes, so it would appear. The bottom of the page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served. But it has not been filled in. May I assume from this that the warrant was never served? 
JONES That's correct. There was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody. 
HAHN Let me see if I have this straight. A woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no warrant existed, and when it was finally written six days later, there was no need to sign it or go to a judge because (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                      114. 
HAHN (Cont'd) she was already in the asylum!      Is this correct, Captain? 
JONES Technically...yes. 
More murmuring from the crowd. 
JONES Extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing with an extraordinary situation! Is it our fault that we were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be Walter Collins? No. In light of his claims and her behavior, who wouldn't begin to wonder if there was something wrong with her? 
HAHN Because she questioned you. 
JONES Because she wouldn't listen, because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best left to qualified officers, because -- 
HAHN Because she was fighting for the life of her son! A boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong! 
This silences both Jones and the crowd. You could hear a pin drop. Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly. 
HAHN And in the end, that's what happened, isn't it? At some point, while all this was going on, Walter Collins died along with as many as nineteen other youths on the Northcott Ranch in Wineville. Is that correct, Captain? 
Jones looks to Chief Davis.   It's a moment.    Then: 
JONES Yes.   It is. 
Christine's face falls into her hands.   The place erupts. 
She nods again, and stands. He heads out of the room, and she lingers for a moment, taking one last look around before turning off the night-light, and sees the drawing he made of the two of them walking together beneath an orange sun. HOLD on that image as we HEAR a gavel hammering and: 
THORPE (V.O.) This meeting will now come to order.

THORPE (Cont'd) the employees who serve under them, it nevertheless can perform the function of making recommendations.

APPLAUSE erupts from the gallery at this. 
INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Quietly PUSHING IN on Northcott, the Judge, Jury, others. 
JUDGE Bailiff, will you bring me the verdict of the jury? 
The bailiff complies. The judge reads it, hands it back to the Bailiff, who brings it back to the Foreman.

As before. 
THORPE Second, we recommend that the suspension of Captain Jones be made permanent. 
Even louder applause, some cheering. The pattern continues through the balance of the statement. INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Favoring Northcott.

(beat) Finally, restoration of public confidence in the police department can only be achieved by the removal of its chief of police, and this committee so recommends.

The place explodes with cheers. 
INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As the foreman stands again. 
JUDGE You may read the verdict. 
FOREMAN We the jury find the defendant, Gordon Stewart Northcott...guilty on all counts of murder in the first degree. 
There are gasps and cries and tears...but Northcott is defiant. 
JUDGE Does the defendant wish to make a statement before judgment is passed? 
GORDON Yeah, I want to make a statement. I want to make it real clear that I never once got a fair shake from you, your "honor," or this court. The only one of you here worth a goddamn is her -- (points to christine) -- 'cause she's the only one never badmouthed me to the press. She understands what it is when the police frame you for something you didn't do and throw you in the hole. Isn't that right? 
He looks to her.   She doesn't flinch. 
GORDON I want you to know, Mrs. Collins, I never killed your boy. I -- 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     121. 
JUDGE That's enough! Counsel, you will get control of your client or I will have him bound and gagged. 
The defense attorney yanks Gordon around to face the judge. 
JUDGE Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the judgment of this court that you will be conveyed to San Quentin Prison, where you will be held in solitary confinement for a period of two years, until October 2nd, 1930. On that date, you are to be hanged by the neck until dead. May god have mercy on your soul. 
And he brings down the gavel. 
EXT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Christine is standing outside, putting the horrors of the day out of her thoughts, as a door opens and Chief Davis comes out, followed by several reporters. 
CHIEF DAVIS -- no, as I said after the hearing, I have every intention of finishing my term as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. I will not resign. I will fight to the finish. The Collins case was merely an excuse for certain politicians who have been trying to have me removed for some time, and I -- 
CHANGELING A True Story                                  132. 
CHRISTINE Ben, it looks like dinner is on me, I -- 
She stops.   It's not Ben on the phone. 
CHRISTINE Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay? No, of course I remember you, how are you? Is everything -- 
She freezes at something she hears. 
CHRISTINE When? Where did they -- (beat) No, of course...I'll be right there. 
She hangs up, grabs her coat, and races out the door. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Christine climbs out of a taxi and rushes into the station. 
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Christine is ushered into a room with a long two-way mirror that looks out into an interview room. Mr. and Mrs. Clay are already there. In the other room is Detective Ybarra, and a young boy, DAVID, age 13. Mrs. Clay sees her, and they embrace. 
MRS. CLAY I wanted to go to him right off, but they said it was important to talk to him alone first. 
CHRISTINE Are they sure it's -- 
MRS. CLAY They're sure, but more important, I'm sure. (beat) It's my boy, all right...it's David. He's alive, Christine. They found him up in Hysperia. 
CHRISTINE But how -- 
Mr. Clay motions for them to shush. They turn their attention to the other room, where Ybarra looks up from making notes. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     133. 
YBARRA All right, so after you got into the car, what happened next? 
DAVID They drove me around for a long time, then we ended up at this ranch -- 
EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
David is shoved into the chicken coop. Several other BOYS are already there, scared, crying. They lunge at the door, trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces. 
They scream, trying to get out.   Gordon SLAMS an arm against the door, scaring them. 
GORDON SHUT UP! (grinning) I'll see you boys later.... 
He laughs and moves off, Sanford accompanying him, looking very guilty. 
YBARRA (V.O.) Were there other boys present? 
DAVID (V.O.) Yeah...six, I think. It was a long time ago. 
YBARRA (V.O.) Did you speak to them? Do you remember any of their names? 
INT. CHICKEN COOP - LATER PANNING the boys huddled against one wall, scared. 
DAVID (V.O.) Yeah...two of them were brothers, I think their last name was Winslow, something like that. The oldest was Jeffrey, I think he was around eleven.... (beat) ...and Walter. 
We STOP PAN on the last kid...on Walter Collins, at last. 
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM 
As Christine REACTS to this, her hand flying to her mouth. Not daring to breathe. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    134. 
YBARRA Walter. 
DAVID Yeah. 
YBARRA Do you remember his last name? 
DAVID Collins. 
Christine covers her face.     Can barely stand up. 
YBARRA So if you only remember some of the names of the rest, how come you remember his full name? 
DAVID Because of what happened. 
INT. CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT 
Two of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner, talking quietly, urgently. 
DAVID (V.O.) Walter and Jeffrey were talking when everybody else was screaming. They were scared, same as the rest of us, but they weren't scared stupid. They kept checking around until they found a part of the coop where the chicken wire was all messed up. 
They pull at the wiring.    Part of the roof weakens and dust sifts down. 
DAVID (V.O.) They figured we might be able to yank the chicken wire and bring down the corner, maybe make enough room to get out of there and run... but it would make an awful lot of noise and if it wasn't wide enough, we'd be stuck. It might even bring the whole place down.

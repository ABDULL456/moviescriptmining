EXT. FARMLAND - DAWN 
IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland. The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates. Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road and through a massive field of emptiness. 
The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field. GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of the car. 
Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the General scans his surroundings with concern. 
TITLE CARD UP: THE PAST 
Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and into the earth. 
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER 
They descend a metal staircase and walk with great urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading them across the room. 
GENERAL BRAT When did it start? 
SCIENTIST At 05:00. We're seven minutes in. 
INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS 
The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way mirror. 
On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject on the other side of the mirror. 
The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT. 
He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts into a coughing fit. 
The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone in the corner. 
SCIENTIST (into microphone) Private Miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. How do you feel? 
His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone. 
PRIVATE MILLER Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But... It's good. Good queer. (beat) Sir. Good queer, Sir. 
The scientists scribble madly. One of them mumbles into General Brat's ear. 
PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D) But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir, I should mention that I'm also feeling quite gay...so, a little queer, but mostly gay. 
SCIENTIST Private Miller. When you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel? 
PRIVATE MILLER (holding out the joint) This went out...Sir. 
SCIENTIST We will send someone in. Now answer the question. 
A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private, who looks at him in shock. 
SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S) (through speakers) Private Miller? Answer the question. 
PRIVATE MILLER Oh...um...what was the question again? 
The Agent in the strange suit reaches the private and holds a lighter up to the joint. 
SCIENTIST (O.S.) (through speakers) What are your emotions towards your superiors? 
Miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. The Agent exits the room. 
PRIVATE MILLER COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit. (beat) Well, now that I think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. Does that make me their `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked up. 
General Brat scowls. 
GENERAL BRAT (curtly to the scientists) I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. This never happened. 
Instantly, the scientists start packing up their equipment. Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED PHONE and dials. Two Agents in the scuba-like suits emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging him away. 
PRIVATE MILLER (freaking out) Hey! What the...what are you guys doing! Let go of me! (desperately looking at the mirror) Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!! 
GENERAL (into phone) This is General Brat. We've reached a final conclusion on Item 9. (beat) Illegal. 
He hangs up the phone. 
RADIO DJ 3 What gives you the right to say that? 
DALE Everything! They should be able to collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not? (MORE) 
DALE (CONT'D) As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f- ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better. And don't pretend you can't smell it. Ever been to New York? Great place, smells like piss, though. (takes a hit and starts coughing) Twice a week,  cough  might fix that. (starts coughing harder) Hold on one sec. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER 
Dale gets out of his car, followed by some plumes of smoke, and goes to his trunk. He chuckles as he takes out a lab coat and walks towards the hospital. 
INT. HOSPITAL - SOON AFTER 
Dale, looking very professional in his lab coat, rushes to reception. 
DALE I need Dr. Terrence, immediately. 
RECEPTIONIST Of course. One moment. 
The receptionist immediately picks up the phone. 
INT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER 
DR. TERRENCE runs towards reception, where Dale is still waiting. 
DR. TERRENCE (to Dale) Hi there, I don't think we've met, I'm- 
DALE Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who repeatedly refused to take care of the monkey tree that spills onto your neighbors property. And now, because of that, you've been served. 
INT. DALE'S CAR - LATER 
Dale hits a pipe. It is clear he strongly disagrees with what the DJ is saying. 
TALK RADIO DJ ...stay in your own country. Five simple words. And stay the hell out of mine! I'm not a racist, per se, but I'm not some hippy tree humper. 
We see his ear piece and hear that he is on hold. 
DALE Let me through, damnit. 
EXT. HOTEL - VALET 
Dale, wearing a chauffeur hat, stands by the main entrance holding a sign that reads: JOSH CORBER. A man walks out of the hotel and, seeing the sign, approaches Dale. 
CORBER My name's Corber. 
DALE You're Joshua Aaron Corber? 
CORBER (overjoyed) Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't she? I was just telling her before I left how I've never been in a limo. Can you believe it? 35 and I've never been in a limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it? 
Dale hands him a BLUE ENVELOPE. 
DALE Sorry, but you've been served. 
Dale walks away. CORBER opens the envelope and reads it. 
CORBER Ah fuck! (reads more) Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK! 
Dale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and walks out of the airport. Then, a huge smile comes across his face. He has noticed a nearby Burger King. 
DALE (excited) Hey! Nice. New chicken fries. 
He happily walks toward the food. 
INT - DALE'S CAR - DAY 
Dale sits in his car   outside a high school. An array of Burger King wrappers   surrounds him as he rolls a joint with the last of his   weed on top of a Batman comic. He lights the joint and   turns on the radio. 
RADIO DJ ...3:09 in the PM and we- 
Dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash and breath mints. 
Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes. He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some cologne, and then gets out of the car. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 
Dale walks towards the school. 
ANGIE Dale! 
Dale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend, ANGIE ANDERSON, walking towards him with her group of friends. She kisses him. 
ANGIE (CONT'D) Mmm. Minty. 
SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table. A large "Scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. There is a knock at the door and Dale enters. 
DALE What's up, Saul. 
SAUL (unpleasantly surprised) What the fuck?!? 
DALE What? 
SAUL I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here? 
DALE Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me in. I- 
SAUL That's fucked up, man! This building is filled with fuckin' assholes. What else is the buzzer for? Fuck. 
DALE I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry. I'm just not familiar with your, uh...protocol yet. 
SAUL Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. We're always cool. It's those fuckin' jaggoffs. 
DALE Um...sure. 
Dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch. 
SAUL Brass tacs. I've got this new bud. Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've smoked some dope fuckin' shit. 
DALE Better than that Blue Oyster weed? 
SAUL Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso Snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked - then this would be the shit they'd birth. 
Saul pulls out a big bag of weed. He places it on the coffee table as though it was his child. He pulls out a large bud. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Smell it. 
Dale takes the weed and looks at it. It looks spectacular. Bright red hairs and large crystals, huge purple and blue leaves - just spectacular! Dale smells it and is taken aback. 
DALE What is this? It's spectacular. 
SAUL It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red told me it's when this Hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. And, its only ten bones more for a quarter. 
DALE So...can I get a quarter? 
SAUL No doubt. Just let me grab my scale. 
Saul walks into another room. Dale looks around anxiously; he clearly wants to go. 
A moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits down. Dale notices that he didn't bring anything back from the other room. Saul notices Dale looking at him strangely. 
SAUL (CONT'D) What's with the look? What? 
DALE Where's the scale? 
SAUL Oh shit! The scale. Be right back. 
Saul hustles into the other room. 
SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D) (from other room) You know what's weird? How sometimes, your brain just chooses to like, not keep things in it, you know? (beat) Fucking scale. (beat) Shit. Where is it? 
Dale checks his watch and then looks at the door; suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross- joint Saul was constructing. 
DALE Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing? 
Saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on the coffee table. 
SAUL (nonchalantly) Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen one of these? Not surprising. They are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. NASA built the first one in the eighties. 
Saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the scale. 
DALE You can actually smoke that contraption? 
Saul puts Dale's weed in a baggie. 
SAUL You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a "trifecta" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint. 
Dale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed. Dale lingers for a moment. 
DALE Well, be careful with that thing. 
Dale gets up and heads to the door. 
SAUL Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me? 
Dale turns around. He clearly wants to smoke it, but he tries to play it cool. 
Saul passes Dale the joint. 
SAUL Yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after? 
DALE Let's see...tonight I'm going after- 
Dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket. 
DALE (CONT'D) Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his- 
SAUL Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in town. Maybe it's him! 
DALE I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot of Ted Joneses's out there. 
SAUL Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's what I want to be one day. He's like the "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like Jah. Or Scarface. 
Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in awkward silence. Dale gets up. 
DALE Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks. 
SAUL No worries dude, peace. 
They slap each other five and Dale exits. Saul turns on the TV. Saved By the Bell is on. It makes Saul chuckle. 
INT. DALE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house. It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH! Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a COP CAR! 
He sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! The FEMALE COP walks up the block - TOWARDS DALE'S CAR! 
DALE Oh shit on me. 
Fortunately,   the COP crosses the street and walks towards Ted's house.   Confused, Dale watches as she is let in. Dale waits a   moment and then re-lights the joint. He tries to see   into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOKE. 
BANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house. Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and crashes through the front window! 
Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM! BLAM! Blood splatters! 
Dale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away! 
The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips open the paper and examines the weed closely. 
TED Pineapple Express. 
INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Saul is laying on his couch watching Saved By the Bell, laughing so hard that he's crying. 
SAUL Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech. 
Suddenly, the BUZZER sounds repeatedly. 
SAUL (CONT'D) (mumbles) Fucking hell. 
He grudgingly walks to the intercom and presses talk. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Hello? 
He presses listen. 
DALE (O.C.) (through intercom) ...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me in! It's Dale! Let m-- 
Saul casually presses the talk button. 
SAUL (annoyingly casual) Denton? Dale Denton? 
He smiles to himself, then presses listen. 
DALE (O.C.) (through intercom) ...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea- 
Annoyed, Saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door. 
SAUL (to himself) ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you can't handle it. 
A moment later, Dale, completely freaking out, BURSTS through the door and SLAMS it shut. 
SAUL (CONT'D) (startled) Dude, whoa. What the fuck are- 
DALE He fucking killed him, man! 
SAUL Be quiet, man, I got neighbors- 
Pleased, Saul pats Dale on the back. 
DALE You're right. You are. I'm just being paranoid. Sorry, dude. 
Saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We hear someone pick up. 
RED (O.S.) (through phone) Ow! Hello? 
SAUL Yo, Red. You okay man? 
RED (O.S.) Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe. 
Red sounds nervous. 
SAUL Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the house. But Red, I gotta get straight to brass tacs, I need a favor. 
RED (O.S.) Sure man, anything. I'm Red. 
SAUL You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave it to me. 
RED (O.S.) Sure man, no problem. Red swears it, hombre. 
SAUL So, can I come on over now? 
Dale waves his hands in front of Saul's face. 
DALE (louldy whispering) No! We should do it tomorrow! 
SAUL (covering phone, talks to Dale) I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's just go and get this shit over with. 
DALE Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared shitless. I want to think things through before I do anything. Let's go in the morning. Please. 
Saul looks around the dark forest. 
SAUL Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in the day. 
Dale nods. 
SAUL (CONT'D) (into phone) Red? 
RED (O.S.) (talking to someone else) -I can hear him talking to someone, so- Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the morning? 
SAUL Yeah, right after I see my grandma. 
RED (O.S.) Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow! Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is that the one on Granville and 41st. 
SAUL Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be chillin' by noon. 
Saul gives Dale the thumbs up. 
RED (O.S.) Well, cool brother. Noon it is. 
SAUL We should definitely hit up the casino again sometime. 
RED (O.S.) For sure. We should definitely hit up the casino. 
Saul hangs up the cell. 
SAUL Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the house. 
INT. RED'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
RED, 30, stalky and short, sits between the BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON 
BUDLOFSKY Why isn't he coming now? What did you say? 
RED (incredibly afraid) I didn't say shit, man! There was another guy there and he said tomorrow! 
MATHESON Why did he mention the casino? The Asians run the casinos. Is Saul Asian? 
RED No, man! 
This worries the thugs. 
MATHESON This might be more than we thought. 
BUDLOFSKY Than you thought. I thought it would be more than you did. I'll call Ted. 
EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS 
SAUL I always liked smoking weed in the forest. 
SAUL (CONT'D) You ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed? 
DALE The "Blair Witch Project." 
SAUL No...Shit. That one's way scarier than the one I was thinking of. Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch. 
They inch forward, nervous. 
DALE (whispering) Stop! 
They both freeze. 
SAUL (whispering) What- 
DALE (whispering) Sshh! 
SAUL (whispering) What is- 
DALE (whispering) Sshh! Can you hear that? 
SAUL (whispering) What? 
DALE (whispering) Just listen. 
Saul listens. 
SAUL (whispering) I literally hear nothing. (gasp) Wait... 
SUDDENLY, Saul SPRINTS off into the darkness! 
DALE SAUL!!! 
Dale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees. 
SAUL(O.S.) (screaming in pain) ARGHHH!!! 
Dale hears a loud THUD. 
Scared for his life, he SPRINTS in the opposite direction! He weaves in between the trees, avoids some rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then SLAMS half his body against a tree and FALLS HARD. 
ANGLE ON: SAUL 
Saul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS into the ground. 
ANGLE ON: DALE 
Dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe the dirt off his suit. 
DALE Shit. 
Saul hears Dale and whips around, breaking a twig - CRACK 
Dale looks towards the noise, then SPRINTS off. 
Saul hears someone and BOLTS in the opposite direction. 
Like chickens with their heads cut off, they both scramble through the woods trying to evade their imaginary enemies. 
Dale spots his car! He jumps in and SLAMS the door shut. He's about to turn the ignition, but stops. Panting and wheezing, he sinks into his seat. 
BAM! Something slams into the car. 
DALE (CONT'D) AAAAAHHHHHHH!!! 
Dale sees Saul BANGING against the passenger side door. 
SAUL (muffled through the window) Let me in! Let me in! 
Dale unlocks the car and Saul JUMPS in. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Let's go! Go! 
DALE Is there anyone even out there?!? 
SAUL I don't know! 
DALE If you don't know then why the hell did you run like that?!? 
SAUL I don't know! I'm freaking out, man! Let's just go! 
DALE No! We're not going anywhere! 
DALE (CONT'D) (pissed off) I think the battery's dead. 
SAUL Are you fucking serious? 
He tries again. 
DALE It's dead. 
SAUL It's dead? 
Dale shoots Saul an angry look. 
SAUL (CONT'D) What the fuck happened? How did this happen? 
DALE How? We fell asleep! 
SAUL Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put people to sleep. 
Frustrated, Dale tries to gather his thoughts. 
DALE We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's. 
SAUL For real? 
Dale opens his door and hops out. 
DALE Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but we'll get there. Then we can fix this insane situation. 
MONTAGE: 
- Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road, each smoking their own joint. 
- Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf. Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then blows weed smoke onto it. 
DALE (CONT'D) Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave that thing alone. 
- They emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride. 
- Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his zipper. 
SAUL It's like, my thumb is my cock! 
Dale doesn't laugh. 
- Bored and tired, they wait.   Saul lights a joint. Dale notices. Saul shifts his body   away from Dale. Just then, an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. Saul snubs out the freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket. 
EXT. RED'S HOUSE - LATER 
Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler. 
SAUL (to the driver) Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid. 
Saul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul knocks. 
DALE So, what's this guy like? 
SAUL I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe. 
DALE Well, do you think he'll be there? 
SAUL I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late. (beat) That's actually pretty late. 
RED (O.S.) (through door) Who is it? 
SAUL Red! It's Saul. Open up. 
Red opens the door. He has a SPLIT LIP and has clearly been CRYING. He tries to act normal. Dale immediately suspects something is up. 
RED (sniffling) Who's this guy? 
DALE Dale. Nice to meet you. 
Red ushers them in and shuts the door. 
RED Dale who? 
DALE I think it's    better if you don't know my last- 
SAUL (oblivious) Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries. 
Red notices their dirty clothes. 
Red PUNCHES Saul in the face! Saul SCREAMS and drops to the ground. 
SAUL (CONT'D) WHY!?!?! 
Dale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. 
INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Disoriented, Dale scans the small bathroom. Saul and Red can be heard fighting outside. 
SAUL (O.S.) Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked off that shit again!?! Ow! 
RED (O.S.) I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please don't fight! 
A loud CRASH is heard from the other room. 
SAUL AAAHHHHHH!!! 
Dale throws the phone in the toilet bowl and smacks down the seat. He runs back to help Saul. 
INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Red is BEATING the shit out of Saul. 
SAUL Why, man!?! Why! 
RED I'M SORRY!!! 
Saul manages to stand up when Red boots him in the BALLS! He SHRIEKS and stumbles backwards. Dale dashes into the room and LEAPS onto Red's back. Red wobbles forward, then starts RUNNING BACKWARDS. He trips on his coffee table and CRASHES Dale through it, landing on top of him. Red gets up, sprints into the bathroom and locks the door. With great effort, Dale and Saul manage to get up. 
DALE He's going for the phone! Bathroom! 
INT. RED'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Frantically searching for the phone, Red flips the toilet seat up and grabs it. He begins to dial as Dale and Saul sprint down the hall. 
Just as Red is about to finish dialing, Dale and Saul CRASH into the bathroom door! They knock it completely off it's hinges, SLAMMING it directly into Red! The phone flies into the bathtub. 
DALE (pointing at the phone) SAUL!!! Phone!!! 
Saul jumps into the bathtub and begins STOMPING the phone. Dale continuously SLAMS his body against the door in an attempt to keep Red pinned down. 
SAUL What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is going on!?! 
RED I don't know!!! They're going to kill me!!! 
SAUL You didn't stub your toe, did you? 
Red stops struggling and tries to catch his breath. Dale kneels on top of the door, keeping him pinned. 
DALE Now tell us- 
RED They're gonna come back and kill me!!! 
In an impressive show of strength, Red shoves the door off him, knocking Dale aside. He runs. 
INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Saul chases Red and TACKLES him into a wall. Dale follows seconds later, and notices Red's LARGE GLASS BONG. He looks back to see Saul getting pummelled. 
SAUL DALE! HELP! 
Dale grabs the bong and swings around - CRASH!!! It shatters on the back of Red's head. 
Red falls to the ground moaning, blood dripping from his head. Dale and Saul stand over him, out of breath, bruised and battered. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Red, you motherfucker. 
Dale, lost in thought, starts to seriously freak out. 
DALE It's happening! It's actually happening! He knows my name! Red knows my name! 
SAUL We should beat it out of his sellout brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck the Casino! Go alone! 
DALE This is fucked, what do we do now, he knows my name!?! 
SAUL He knows my name too! 
DALE Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them! 
SAUL We're not gonna have to kill him, are we? I don't think I could do that. 
RED The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just calls them the Asians. 
Dale and Saul exchange an even more worried look. 
SAUL What else? 
RED I swear to god that's all I know...I swear... 
DALE Alright. We should...tie him up and...and get the fuck out of here. 
SAUL I made a gravity bong here once. I know where his duct tape is. 
Saul runs off. Dale puts on Saul's backpack and looks at the battered Red moaning on the floor. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Come on, let's tape this piece of shit up. 
Dale pulls Red's hands behind his back. Saul is picking at the tape. 
SAUL (CONT'D) I can't find the edge. 
DALE What? 
SAUL I can't find the, oh...wait... 
Saul rips open the DUCT TAPE. He quickly BINDS Red's hands and feet. SUDDENLY, there's a KNOCK at the door. They stop, silent. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. Red starts thrashing and trying to scream. 
SAUL (CONT'D) (whispering) Shit. They're actually here to kill him. 
DALE (whispering) What do we do? 
SAUL (whispering) I don't know. 
KNOCK! KNOCK! 
DALE (whispering) Fuck. Oh, man. 
Frozen in terror, they don't know what to do. 
RED (whispering) Guys, guys...listen to me- 
KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! 
RED (CONT'D) (whispering) I'm fuckin' sorry. Okay? I fucked up. I'm a son-of-a-bitch. I forgot bros before hoes, even though these guys aren't hoes. You know what I mean. But I can fix this. (MORE) 
RED (CONT'D) I know these guys, it's cool. Just head out the back, I'll stall `em. Won't tell `em nothing. You can count on me! 
SAUL Thanks, Red. 
Red frantically tries to wriggle out of his bonds while Saul leads Dale out the back door. SUDDENLY, the door is KICKED open! Budlofsky and Matheson enter, guns drawn. They see Red. 
RED Dale Denton! It was Saul and some dude named Dale Denton! They just ran out the back! 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
Dale and Saul run like hell. Saul spots a dumpster. 
SAUL In here! 
Saul jumps into the dumpster. 
DALE No. I've got to get to a phone! 
SAUL We should hide! 
DALE But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name, then they'll go to my apartment and find out about Angie! 
SAUL I think we should stay! 
DALE Why?! 
SAUL Because I'm in the dumpster already! Shit! Fine! 
Saul hops out of the dumpster and follows Dale. 
INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Budlofsky dashes back into the apartment. 
BUDLOFSKY They're long gone. 
Matheson stands over top of Red, talking to Ted on the phone. 
SAUL Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I want to go with you! 
DALE Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally be five minutes. Please. 
SAUL Fine. But hurry. 
Dale runs up to the front door and frantically knocks. Angie answers the door. 
INT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Dale dashes in. 
DALE Angie! 
Angie opens the door with a smile, the phone in hand. Her attention is towards the phone conversation she is having. Dale enters her apartment. 
INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
ANGIE It's Dale! You came. 
Dale freezes in horror: ANGIE'S PARENTS (SHANNON and ROBERT) are pleasantly eating at the dining room table. 
SHANNON Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and have some couscous. Can I get you a drink? 
Robert sees that Dale is DIRTY, DISHEVELLED, BRUISED and BATTERED. 
ROBERT What the hell happened to you? 
ANGIE Dale?   What happened to you? 
Robert and Shannon exchange worried looks. 
DALE Nothing, I was in the woods and... (turns to Angie's parents) ...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to finally meet you both...I apologize for my appearance. Robert, Charlotte- 
SHANNON (not amused) Shannon. 
DALE Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both of you. 
Dale walks to Robert and extends his DIRTY, BLOODY HAND. 
DALE (CONT'D) Very nice things. 
Robert smugly declines Dale's hand shake. 
ANGIE You were in the woods? 
DALE (at a loss for words) Alright, now, here's what's happened - I've been thrust into a kind of, ah...situation. So, uh, if we could all just start to evacuate... 
Dale starts gathering all their jackets and shoes. 
DALE (CONT'D) ...that'd be really, really good right now. I'll answer all your- 
ANGIE Is this a joke? 
ROBERT What is this Angie? 
SHANNON I think it is a joke. 
DALE (deep breath) Listen. There are people after us and they could come here. I'll tell you anything you want, just please, let's go! 
ROBERT He's serious? 
DALE Yes, I'm serious. Super serious! We have to get the "F" out of here! 
The Anderson's stare at him dumbfounded. Robert gets up and stands tall. 
ROBERT Get the hell out of my house. 
DALE Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I was working...this morning. The cop shot the guy then saw my car drive off, and I think they might have seen my license plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the woods, so... 
They stare at Dale as though he were crazy. 
EXT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Saul sees a car nearing. He sees Budlofsky and Matheson are in it. 
SAUL No fucking way. 
He runs like hell towards Angie's. 
INT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Dale looks at the pandemonium as everyone tries to be heard. 
DALE Guys! Please! We have to get out of here. Robert, Angie...Mrs. Anderson- 
SAUL (whispers to Dale) It's Shannon. 
DALE I know! Look, we have to get out of here. I'm sure everything is going to be fine but better safe than...not. 
SHANNON Is this...for real- 
DALE Yes. Terribly real. 
Dale and Saul lead Angie and her parents towards the back door. 
EXT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Budlofsky and Matheson are now at the front door. They've each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in. Budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge. 
MATHESON Ready? 
BUDLOFSKY No. One sec. 
Budlofsky puts in the last few bullets. 
MATHESON Hurry the fuck up. 
BUDLOFSKY Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't helping. 
Budlofsky cocks his gun and nods at Matheson. 
INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
BAM! They kick open the doors and run into her house. No one is there. Budlofsky cautiously walks over to the table and touches the food. It's still warm. Matheson bends down and picks up a bloody fork. 
MATHESON Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these people doing? 
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Dale, Angie, her parents, and Saul burst into the garage. Robert is fumbling with the keys. He manages to open the car. Saul pulls up his shirt to look at the stab wound. 
SAUL Fuck. Look at that. Fuckin' mashed potatoes in my wound. 
ROBERT Baby! Get in the car quick. Angie, in the car! 
The Andersons get in the car. 
ANGIE Dale - get in the car! 
ROBERT (to Dale) You stay the fuck away from my family! 
ANGIE Shut up dad! 
DALE (glances at Robert) I...I think it would be best if I didn't go with you. I don't want to put you in any more danger. 
ANGIE What are you going to do? What should we do? 
ROBERT Angie, get in the car! 
DALE Alright, baby. Here's the plan - go to the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake name. Something like... (looks around, focuses on Robert's car) Car...lyle. 
ANGIE Carlyle? (beat) I...I have so many questions. I just...how can this be happening? Where...where are you going? 
DALE I have to stop this. I don't know how, but don't worry. I'll keep you safe. (beat) But still, watch your back. You never know where they might be, whoever they are. 
Angie gets in the car. Dale pecks her on the lips. 
DALE (CONT'D) I love you. 
Beat. 
ANGIE Uh...thanks. 
Angie gets in the car. Dale pecks her on the lips. 
DALE Um...you're welcome. And nice to meet you guys. 
She shuts her door and the Anderson's pull out. Dale watches them depart with great concern. 
SAUL Why aren't we in that car? 
DALE Let's run, man! Run! 
She walks towards her car as Dale sits on the ground. 
ANGLE ON: Saul 
Saul merrily turns into the alley holding TWO RED SLURPEES, when he jumps back in terror! He sees the cop car up the alley. He ducks back behind the corner. 
SAUL They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck... 
ANGLE ON: Dale and the Police Liaison 
She looks at her car computer. The screen reads: 
DALE DENTON: OUTSTANDING WARRANT - DOUBLE HIT AND RUN. 
She looks back at Dale and types into her computer. 
INT. CAROL'S COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 
We see Carol (who is in fact Ted's evil accomplice) speeding down the road. Her police computer beeps. She looks at the screen. 
CAROL (smiling) Denton. 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
The Police Liaison stuffs Dale in the back of her squad car. 
DALE What is this for? What did that thing tell you? What did I do? 
POLICE LIAISON Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double, actually. You hit two parked cars two nights ago. 
A look of crippling horror comes across Dale's face as she throws him in the back seat and slams his door shut. 
ANGLE ON: Saul 
He peaks down the alley and sees Dale in the back of the car and the FEMALE Police Liaison getting in the front. 
SAUL The lady cop. She's gonna kill him. 
The car slowly makes a three point turn. 
INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 
DALE You don't understand! You have to let me go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please! 
The Police Liaison ignores Dale. 
DALE (CONT'D) This...this lady cop, and these guys Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for Ted Jones, and- 
POLICE LIAISON (suddenly interested) Ted Jones? 
DALE Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know what I'm talking about. He lives near Evergreen Heights. He- 
POLICE LIAISON Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and a police office shoot someone? 
DALE Yeah. An Asian someone. 
The Police Liaison ponders as she finishes her three point turn and drives toward the exit of the alley. 
POLICE LIAISON Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you down to the station. 
DALE (ecstatic) Yes ma'am. 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
Saul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car. He looks at the two red slurpees and thinks, then suddenly jumps out and THROWS himself onto the hood of the cop car! 
The Police Liaison and Dale see a body SLAM against the car and RED LIQUID SPLATTER everywhere, covering the windshield. They SCREAM. 
WHAM! In the impact, we clearly see Saul's BALLS getting ROCKED on the car! The Police Liaison slams on the brakes, causing Dale to SMASH into the metal cage. 
POLICE LIAISON Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god! 
She puts the car in park. As the Police Liaison gets out of her car, Saul can be seen crawling around the back of the vehicle, clutching his testicles. The frightened Police Liaison looks at the windshield. 
She notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and quickly turns around. She sees Saul jumping into the drivers seat. 
Saul sees a SHOTGUN beside the passenger seat. The Police Liaison reaches for her GUN! 
DALE NO! What are you doing!?! 
SAUL Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and Cash! 
Saul's hand flails around, grasping everything. He feels the SHOTGUN and accidentally pulls the trigger- 
BOOM! The blast blows through the roof of the car and hits an overhead TRAFFIC LIGHT - shredding it to pieces! 
SAUL                          DALE JESUS!!!                         SHIT! 
Carol flies into the intersection on a collision course with Saul and Dale. 
CRUNCH! A car smashes into the side of the Carol's cruiser. 
As Dale and Saul speed off, Carol emerges from the smoking wreckage, a look of hate in her eyes. 
EXT. QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
The stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and Saul hops out. 
SAUL Run! 
He starts running up the block at top speed. 
Dale, still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser, starts thrashing and screaming. 
DALE Saul! Saul! I'm locked in! 
Dale continues to scream as Saul obliviously bolts to the end of the block and just keeps going. 
DALE (CONT'D) You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!! 
Dale sits in the car, helpless. He has a look of utter disbelief on his face. After a moment of silence he starts wildly kicking the door window. He soon gives up. 
Just then, Dale notices Saul, over a block away, running back towards the stolen car. Saul soon arrives, completely out of breath, and opens the door. 
SAUL So... huff ... huff ...fuckin' sorry... huff ...forgot... 
Dale flops out of the car and onto the grass. Saul tries to help him to his feet, but Dale pulls away. 
DALE Don't touch me, you asshole! 
Dale wiggles to his feet runs for it. Saul follows. 
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY 
Dale and Saul enter the hardware store, walking very close together so that no one sees Dale is handcuffed. They receive a few odd looks as they search and locate what they are looking for: saws. Saul quickly finds a sturdy looking hack-saw. 
SAUL Okay, only one way to do this, hard and fast. Bend over. 
Dale gets on his knees and bends over, pressing his face up against the wall. Saul begins to manically hack away at the cuffs. 
DALE Ow! Ow! Hurry! 
SAUL I am! 
Suddenly, Saul sees a store clerk coming and shoves the saw underneath Dale's suit jacket. 
DALE Which saw do you like most? 
SAUL The brown ones nice, but the metallic ones seems more... 
They watch the clerk walk off and immediately return to sawing the handcuffs. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HARDWARE STORE - SOON AFTER 
Dale stretches his arms. The handcuffs are still on his hands, but no longer attached. 
DALE (relieved) Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be right back. 
SAUL A thank you would be nice! 
EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER 
Dale is on the phone. 
DALE Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room, please? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Angie is watching TV alone in a hotel room. The phone rings and she picks it up. 
DALE Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all that! Saul! 
A sad Dale starts picking up the money. 
INT. TED'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Carol, who is a little bruised up from the car crash, sits with Ted. They are both furious. 
CAROL Guy drove like a mother-fucker. It was amazing. 
TED This is not good. We should have this under control. We haven't heard shit from the Asians. Got these lunatics after us. Shit. 
Carol checks her watch. 
CAROL We should probably get to the farm. 
MUSIC UP: THE END by THE DOORS 
- Saul gets on a bus and sits down, sad and deject. 
- Dale sits against the phone booth, crying like a baby. He buries his hands in his pocket and pulls out his baggy of weed. He hurls it away. He gets up to retrieve it. 
- Saul is in a really shitty fast food restaurant, nearly crying as he eats his burger and fries. 
- Dale stares at a joint in his hands, thinks for a moment, and then, crying profusely, lights it and starts smoking. 
A solitary tear rolls down his cheek and drips directly onto the tip of the joint, putting it out. Dale hears the sizzle and looks at the joint. He continues crying. He puts the joint down, beside three large roaches. 
- Walking down the street, Saul sees the Point Grey Retirement Home. 
- Dale feverishly looks through the phone book. He finds what he's looking for: Belogus. 
- Saul, hiding behind a bush across the street, surveys the retirement home. Seeing the coast is clear, he walks towards the entrance. As Saul enters the building, Budlofksy and Matheson pull up. 
INT. RETIREMENT HOME - CONTINUOUS 
Saul casually walks into the lobby. The elderly residents of the retirement home are milling around the massive common room. 
ELDERLY WOMAN(O.S.) Solly? 
Saul turns and sees an ELDERLY WOMAN. 
SAUL Hey! Mrs. Mendelson! 
Saul peers over her shoulder and sees Budlofsky and Matheson walk in! 
SAUL (CONT'D) HOLY SHIT!!! 
Saul runs for it, and they chase after him. He maneuvers through the elderly like a pylon course, the thugs right on his ass. He bursts into another room. 
INT. CAFFETERIA - CONTINUOUS 
He tears through the room, filled with old people eating. Budlofsky and Matheson pursue him. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
As Saul runs through the hall, Budlofksy and Matheson appear. 
MATHESON Eat it! 
Matheson whip out his gun and fires - BLAM! The bullet whizzes past Saul and two elderly men, who don't even flinch, and then shatters a distant window. Saul turns the corner and- 
BAM! He slams into someone, sending the person crashing to the ground. 
INJURED PERSON OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow! 
Saul looks, terrified he's hurt an old person, but sees it is a young male nurse. He runs for it and sees an open door with chatter coming from inside. He runs into- 
INT. TEA ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A dead end! Several startled OLD WOMEN look up from their Majong. One of them instantly recognizes Saul- 
MRS. CORBER Solly Silver?!? 
SAUL Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me! 
The Budlofsky and Matheson bursts into the room. Saul looks around, sees a teapot and grabs it. He hurls it at Matheson and nails him in the face. The tea pot shatters and hot water pours all over his face and hand. 
MATHESON AHH!!! FUCK!!! 
Budlofsky GRABS Saul and knees him in the balls. 
As Matheson ushers Saul through the foliage, Saul notices a strange suit that resembles an old fashioned scuba diving uniform (the one from the 1930s intro) hanging on a wall. 
SAUL What the hell is that? 
They arrive at a door. Matheson opens it and shoves Saul in, causing him to almost trip. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Ow. 
It is the same room Private Miller was in. Matheson shuts the door. 
INT. RED'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
BAM! Dale kicks open Red's door and dashes into Red's, ready for anything. 
DALE Hello? Anyone here? Red? 
Dale starts looking around. He hears music and then sees he's stepping in a pool of blood. 
DALE (CONT'D) Oh my god. 
Dale follows the music into the bathroom. 
INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Dale enters and is shocked to see Red lying on the floor, clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and beer in the other. The music is coming from a small boom box. 
RED (a little out of it) What? Who the fuck! 
Red turns toward Dale and picks up a kitchen knife with his bloody hand. 
RED (CONT'D) Stay the fuck back, Denton! I didn't do shit! I'll gut ya if I have to, tooled ya once, tool ya again! 
DALE (utterly shocked) I...what? I'm not here to fight, man, I- 
RED Good, man. I'm fuckin' tired. 
Red drops the knife and then takes a puff of his joint and a sip of his beer. 
RED (CONT'D) I'm dyin', Denton. Fuckin' shot. Right here- (he points at his wound) (MORE) 
RED (CONT'D) I'm having a little going away party and I don't remember inviting you, cocksucker. So I'm gonna ask you to leave. In my dying moments, I don't want some asshole I barely know around. 
DALE Go to the hospital, man! Are you crazy. You don't have to die. 
RED Yes I do! What? I go to the hospital, I'm gonna end up in But that doesn't matter `cause once Ted finds out, which he will, I'm dead wherever I am. I'm fucked through and through. Now if you'd be willing to give a dying man his wish, could ya run on into the other room and pop in disc two of Tu Pacs "All Eyez On Me". I want to listen to it while I die. 
DALE You don't have to die. 
RED Will you stop saying that, I've excepted it, man. I'm at peace.  cough 
Red takes a hit and coughs. It clearly brings terrible pain to his bullet wound. 
DALE Red, I need you to tell me where Ted's base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail on him. I'm going to get him back. 
Red stares intensely at Dale. 
RED Fuckin eh, amigo. 
Red heroic-ish-ly rises from the floor. He hobbles over to the hall and opens a cabinet on the wall. Dale looks in and sees several hand guns inside. 
RED (CONT'D) Blaze of glory, motherfucker. 
INT/EXT. RED'S CAR - NIGHT 
Dale and Red are in Red's car, a FORD FIESTA, driving through the countryside. Dale stops the car 100 yards from the barn. 
RED This is awesome! We're so gonna show those motherfuckers. Think they can kill me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll. 
Red gets out and walks to the drivers side. Dale gets out, gun in hand. Red gets in the drivers seat. 
DALE What are you doing? 
RED So, this is the backside of the farm. If you stay low in the grass you should be fine. If someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes you harder to hit. 
DALE You're not coming to help? 
RED Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I was in shock before, but the air on the drive cleared my mind, I should get to the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs, right? I got shot in the best spot possible. I could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me. Full of possibilities. Go get `em, slugger. 
DALE But how do I get out of here if I rescue Saul? 
RED I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or just take it or whatever. Good luck, amigo! 
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
The barn door slides open. Ted and Carol walk in. 
TED You have them? 
BUDLOFSKY Got them downstairs. 
CAROL Where did you find them? 
BUDLOFSKY We found Saul at his grandmother's and Dale Denton busted in here like a madman, armed to the teeth, and- 
Budlofsky looks over at the man he shot. 
BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D) Yeah, he just plugged Frank and then I disarmed him. We got `em both holed up downstairs. 
TED He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank. 
CAROL Who the fuck is this Dale Denton? 
EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
Five Asian men lay on their stomachs in the tree line dressed in black and armed with machine guns. One of them stares through a pair of night-vision binoculars while utilizing a listening device. We see his view of Ted and hear what he hears. 
TED Well, we'll torture these two bastards and find out everything they know. What about the shipment? Ready to move out? 
BUDLOFSKY We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so. 
The Asian leader nods and does some hand signals to his men. The acknowledge they understand. He holds up a flashlight and flashes three times. From the opposing side of the barn two other flashlights blink back. They all get up and start to slowly move towards the barn. 
INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS 
Dale and Saul are still "humping" away. 
DALE This isn't working. Turn around. I'm using my mouth. 
Dale drops to his knees and starts gnawing at the tape on Saul's hands. Suddenly, they hear approaching footsteps. 
SAUL (whispering) Someone's coming! 
DALE (whispering) Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a move, if I cough twice, you take the lead. Got it? 
SAUL (whispering) What? No! What if you actually cough? 
Dale stands up just as Matheson walks in, gun drawn. Dale looks at Saul and notices that he's managed to free his hands. 
Dale COUGHS TWICE. Saul shoots him a worried look and shakes his head. Matheson notices. Saul COUGHS TWICE. Dale shoots him a confused look. Saul motions at him and COUGHS TWICE MORE. 
MATHESON Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it, okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut it- 
DALE CHARGES DIRECTLY AT MATHESON!!! 
BLAM! Matheson shoots at Dale's head! Dale falls to the ground, specks of blood hitting Saul as he dives forwards, TACKLING Matheson into the wall! 
The Matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting Dale's motionless body. Saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it. Matheson gets to his feet. Saul turns and- 
BLAM! He shoots Matheson in the gut. 
MATHESON (CONT'D) AAAHHHHH!!! 
SAUL Holy shit, man! I'm sorry! 
Matheson writhes in pain. 
MATHESON AAAHHHHH!!! ARGH!!! YOU SHOT ME! I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOT! HELP! HELP! AAAAAHHHHH!!! 
Saul turns to see Dale lying face down. 
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
Ted and Carol talk as Budlofsky and the thugs silently stands by. Ted is holding a large hunting knife. 
TED Has anyone seen my bigger knife? (beat) Do you guys hear that? 
SUDDENLY, there is an EXPLOSION and a hole is blown in the barn wall. Budlofsky is blasted back and badly torn up. 
BUDLOFSKY Arg... 
Asian assassins start pouring into the barn. One of them sees the wounded Budlofsky and blasts him away with a machine gun. 
TED BUDLOFSKY!!! 
RED (to Matheson's corpse) You just got killed by a Ford Fiesta motherfucker!!! How you like me now!?! 
SAUL R...Red? 
RED Saul! `sup! Dude, me and that Dale guy are rescuing you. And getting revenge on those whose shot us in the gut. 
BLAM! Red gets shot in the gut and drops! 
SAUL RED!!! 
Saul spins around to see Carol standing behind him, a machine gun aimed. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Oh no... 
CAROL Oh yeah! 
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 
Ted and Dale grapple violently on the ground. His gut jiggles as he lunges forwards, punching Dale in the throat! Dale falls to his knees, gasping for air. Ted kicks him in the head and picks up his GUN. 
ANGLE ON: AN ASIAN ASSASSIN 
Barely alive, the Asian Assassin with the briefcase drags himself down the corridor and enters the grow room. He opens the briefcase and we see that it is a bomb. The assassin inserts a key. 
Ted stands over Dale, aims the gun to his head, and- 
KA-BOOM!!! THE BRIEFCASE EXPLODES!!!. Flames sweep over the room as Dale rolls for cover. Ted gets blasted back. 
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
Saul tries to be brave as Carol takes final aim. 
CAROL Now prepare to eat shit and die- 
KABOOM!!! The explosion BURSTS UP from the hatch with incredible force. Saul and Carol get blown back as Red's Ford Fiesta is sent flying up in the air. The flaming car lands DIRECTLY on Carol and explodes. The entire barn is now engulfed in flames. 
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 
The air thick with weed smoke, Dale slowly rises to his feet. He sees Ted slumped against the wall, dead, partially aflame. Dale walks over to Ted's body and takes the gun out of his hand. 
DALE Sorry, Ted... 
He pulls a small BLUE ENVELOPE out of his pocket and drops it on Ted. 
DALE (CONT'D) ...but you've been served. 
Dale turns to see the exit blocked by a wall of fire. The air is thick with smoke and he can barely breath. Dale looks around desperately. He spots the FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He looks at the flames. He takes a deep breath, picks up the fire extinguisher, hurls it with all his might at the fire, and then quickly whips out his gun and shoots at it! 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He hits the extinguisher and it explodes, blasting out the fire in the hallway towards the barn. Dale runs like hell. 
As he bolts down the hallway, the flames rush back in and chase after him. 
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
The barn starts to buckle, when Dale suddenly leaps out of the trap door, flames licking his heels. Coughing profusely, Dale stands in the barn, then realizes his pants are on fire. 
DALE Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Aaaahhhh!!! 
Dale wriggles out of his pants and kicks them away. 
DALE (CONT'D) Ow. Ah. Ow. Okay... cough   cough 
He starts to walk out of the barn when he suddenly trips over someone. 
DALE (CONT'D) Saul! 
He grabs one of the unconscious Saul's feet and starts to drag him out of the barn. Just a they exit, the barn COLLAPSES in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of burning wood. Dale pulls Saul onto the grass. Saul starts coughing. 
DALE (CONT'D) Saul!  Cough   Cough  You're okay! 
SAUL (confused) Cough   Cough  What the fuck happened? 
DALE We... Cough ...we did it. We beat them. We won. 
SAUL No fucking way. Seriously? (pointing at the fire) How did that happen? 
DALE I have absolutely no idea. 
SAUL They were fighting Asian dudes, man. 
DALE Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted kill.

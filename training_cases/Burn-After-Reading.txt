FADE IN 
1   EXT. EASTERN SEABOARD - AERIALS - DAY                           1 
High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with clouds. 
As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.   We are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C. 
Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling building. Computer type quickly bleeps on: 
C.I.A. Headquarters Langley, Virginia 
2   INT. CIA - HALLWAY - DAY                                        2 
We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway. 
3   INT. PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY                                      3 
We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind his desk. A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer DeBakey Smith. 
PALMER Ozzie.    Sit down. 
Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped shirt and bow tie. 
OSBOURNE Palmer.   What's up. 
PALMER You know Peck, and Olson. 
The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at Osbourne, who is surprised to see them. 
OSBOURNE Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by reputation. Hi, Osbourne Cox. 
OLSON Yeah, hiyah. 
OSBOURNE Aren't you with...aren't you, uh... 
Palmer jumps in: 
PALMER Yeah, that's right. Oz, look. There's no easy way to say this. We're taking you off the Balkans desk. 
OSBOURNE You're----what? Why? 
PALMER In fact we're moving you out of Sigint entirely. 
OSBOURNE ...What?    No discussion, just----you're out? 
PALMER Well, we're having the discussion now Oz. This doesn't have to be unpleasant. 
OSBOURNE Palmer, with all due respect----what the fuck are you talking about? 
A beat. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... And why is Olson here? 
Another uncomfortable beat. 
PALMER ... Look, Ozzie---- 
OSBOURNE What the fuck is this?!     Is it my----I know it's not my work. 
PALMER Ozzie---- 
OSBOURNE I'm a great fucking analyst!     Is it---- 
PALMER Oz, things are not going well.      As you know. 
PECK You have a drinking problem. 
Stunned silence.         Ozzie turns to look at Peck. 
At length: 
OSBOURNE I have a drinking problem. 
PALMER This doesn't have to be unpleasant. We found you something in State. It's a, uh... 
He gropes, uncomfortable. 
PALMER (CONT'D) ... It's a lower clearance level. Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're not terminating you. 
OSBOURNE (quietly) This is an assault. 
PECK Come on, Ozzie. 
OSBOURNE This is an assault. I have a drinking problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon! 
PECK Ozzie---- 
OSBOURNE Next to you we all have a drinking problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass didn't I kiss? Let's be honest! 
Palmer nods at Olson. 
Katie tries to separate the two men by including Doug Magruder. 
KATIE Harry works with the Marshalls'                       * Service.                                              * 
Pink Revision 8/14/07 6A. 
DOUG MAGRUDER Ah. I'm on the legislative side, I                 * work with Senator Hobby.                           * 
Pink Revision 8/14/07 7. 
HARRY                                       * Used to work for Treasury, but I                      * didn't go over to Homeland Security.                  * I'm with the Marshalls.                               * 
OSBOURNE If you want he'll show you his great big gun. 
HARRY Very amusing. The gun is actually no big deal. Twenty years in the marshall's service and I've never discharged my weapon. 
OSBOURNE Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist. 
HARRY What?   I don't have a psychiatrist. 
DOUG MAGRUDER Boy, I guess my job is pretty undramatic. I'm on the legislative side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do you also carry a gun? 
Harry laughs. 
HARRY Sandy writes children's books. 
SANDY I write children's books---- 
HARRY Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who---- 
Choking on piece of cheese, coughing 
HARRY (CONT'D) ...Who Lives In The Rotunda.     Excuse me. 
TINA Those are wonderful!    My nieces and nephews---- 
HARRY Yeah, it's a beloved series. You wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh. Are you sure this is goat cheese? 
KATIE Why don't you let your wife tell them about her own books, Harry? 
HARRY I'm sorry----was I---- 
KATIE Here, come in the kitchen, help me with the crudit√©s. 
6    INT. COX KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       6 
They enter. 
HARRY Goddamnit.     He knows, doesn't he. 
He looks down at the floor.        He stamps. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Nice floors. 
KATIE Knows what? 
Harry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures. Absently: 
HARRY About us, he knows about us.          Little prick. 
KATIE Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a thing. 
Harry is staring down at the linoleum again. 
HARRY What is that, forbo? 
A6   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                            A6 
A car drives by. 
7   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT                                      7 
Harry driving, his wife next to him. 
A long beat. 
Finally: 
HARRY What a horse's ass. 
SANDY I don't know why we see them. 
Harry shrugs. 
HARRY Well, she's all right. 
SANDY She is a cold, stuck-up bitch. 
Harry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't. 
They drive. 
8   INT. COX MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                               8 
KATIE 
She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more. 
White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law- book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit, suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is Bogus Terikhian. 
TERIKHIAN ... I know this kind of man.    We've seen this. 
Wider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the table, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an assistant. 
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man take advantage of you. And he will. He will. 
KATIE Yes. This is my fear. He's trying---- he says----he's trying to pull himself together, but... 
TERIKHIAN Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things. And you should. People turn themselves around. Not unheard-of. But. You---- you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet? 
KATIE No. 
TERIKHIAN Well that's good.   Because first you should get all his financials. Before he's forewarned. Because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances. Paper files, computer files, whatever----this is your prerogative. You can be a spy too, madam. Do this before you put him on alert. Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh... 
He waggles his hands, groping for the word. 
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ... Feet. 
He shrugs. 
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ... And hopefully everything will work out. He will reform. But! If not: forewarned is forearmed. 
12   INT. COX HOUSE - DAY                                            12 
Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out- flung, like Marat in his bathtub. 
A long still beat.   A clock ticks. 
Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a microcassette recorder. 
OSBOURNE We were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do. We thought of the Agency less as... less as... 
The thought, such as it was, peters out.   Osbourne rises and wanders around the room, glassy-eyed. 
He suddenly raises the microcassette again. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... The principles of George Kennan----a personal hero of mine----were what animated us. In fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service. Like the State Department's China Hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a different venue, in a different medium, in, um... "Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in a different---- 
He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening. 
Faintly, a ringing phone. 
13   INT. COX BASEMENT STAIRWAY - DAY                                13 
At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that juts over the bottom half of the stairwell. 
The phone is louder here. 
14   INT. COX BASEMENT - DAY                                         14 
A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up: 
MACHINE You have reached The Cox Group... 
Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered feet toward the phone. 
MACHINE (CONT'D) ... We can't answer your call right now. Please leave a---- 
OSBOURNE (heavy breathing) Hello. 
He eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone.    A listening beat. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her number... No, upstairs...No she's not, but leave it on her machine. 
15   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER                                     15 
We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime game show. 
A few beats of the show. 
Roaring laughter from the studio audience.     Mild chuckle from Osbourne in the foreground. 
16   INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                                16 
Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and then stops, and looks off. 
The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate clock face Two or three minutes to five. 
Osbourne stares for a long beat. 
17   INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY                                             17 
OSBOURNE 
Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray. 
He pours coke sizzling onto the ice. 
He pauses for a long beat. 
He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet. 
He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass. 
He looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.    He conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring: 
Beat. 
LINDA DRIVING ... Agent!     Agent! 
Beat. 
LINDA ... Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke, should I give you my account number? You have it up? Okay. I was informed that I needed pre-approval for these surgeries, and then... Yes, it was denied. 
Listening, then: 
LINDA (CONT'D) ...No, those are four different operations... It's very complicated; I'm reinventing myself, it's a whole new look so it isn't just one thing, however, it's all approved by my doctor... But----madam! This is not----my job involves, you know, public interface! This is not... 
Her jaw sets.   She controls her fury.   Quieter: 
LINDA (CONT'D) ... Yes I do understand. Could I speak to your supervisor please? 
33   INT. TED'S OFFICE/LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY - MINUTES LATER         33 
We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles over, of Linda, now slumped at her desk, head in her arms. We faintly hear her sobbing. 
Reverse shows Ted Treffon, middle-aged, balding, the soulful manager of Hardbodies. He looks at Linda, puzzled and a little alarmed. He tenses as if to rise but doesn't, and hovers uncomfortably, unsure of whether to intrude. 
34   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     34 
Linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit. 
Her moving POV passes over a couple in conversation, an old woman feeding the birds, a man in a business suit reading a newspaper. 
She passes the man and turns around. He has looked up from the paper and is staring at her. He wears aviator-shaped glasses with clear plastic rims. He may have hair plugs. 
LINDA Alan? 
MAN (ALAN) Are you, uh... Linda? 
35   EXT. CIRCLE THEATRE - DUSK                                     35 
A poster advertises Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes. 
36   INT. THEATRE - NIGHT                                           36 
On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes his head to look steeply up and off. 
Linda sits next to Alan in the half-empty theatre, nervously watching the screen. 
DERMOT (OFF) First you tell me that you can't commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN FROM THERE! 
Linda laughs raucously, then catches herself and looks at Alan. 
37   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                           37 
The couple sit across from each other at a small table. They pick at their food. 
38   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT                            38 
The couple are making love in the dark room on a frilly comforter. Alan, still wearing his glasses, wheezes asthmatically. 
39   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - LATER                            39 
Alan is snoring. After a long beat Linda gets up and puts on a robe. She bends down near the bed and picks something up out of Alan's trousers. 
40   INT. LINDA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  40 
She sits into a chair near the window in the dark room and opens Alan's wallet. A Discover card, driver's license, a condom. A photograph of Alan holding a large bluefish. 
She unfolds a piece of notepaper.    Written in a feminine hand in pencil: 
Please pick up: Plunge Honey Nut Cheerios. 
LINDA Oh for Pete's sake! 
She catches herself, looks around. 
The snoring, off, continues. 
She looks out the window. 
The lights of the freeway twinkle. 
41   INT. YACHT - NIGHT                                                41 
We are in the bedroom.   The boat rides gently at anchor. 
Harry has an arm around Katie, in bed.   Both stare at a point in space. 
After a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of water against hull: 
HARRY ... and then, you know, you grow up. I guess that's what's happened with me. You just... people change. We married when I was, what, in my mid- twenties. A kid. We were kids. Twenties. You think it's forever. Then, you know, you're older----you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You go, I'm not that person. The choices you made, you can't, just through inertia---- 
KATIE I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie. 
Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction.   After more sloshing: 
HARRY ... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean, frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I guess that's what I should be thinking about too. With Sandy. 
KATIE That's what you were just saying. 
HARRY Yes! Absolutely! And you should be getting rid of that bozo.  No question about that. I agree. 
CHAD Talking about like, section heads here, and their names and shit. And then these other files are just, like, numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates and numbers... And numbers. I think                  * that's the shit, man. The raw intelligence. 
TED I am not touching this.    I want this out of here. 
CHAD Wul... Throw it out? 
LINDA You can't do that! You should put a note up in the ladies' locker room. 
CHAD Put a note up? Highly classified shit found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA shit? Hello! Did you lose your secret CIA shit? I don't think so. 
TED Look, you figure it out, I am not comfortable with this. I want this                   * out of Hardbodies... 
As he backs out of the office: 
TED (CONT'D) ... We're running a gym here! 
Chad swivels around. 
CHAD Look,   Manolo... 
He zippers his lip. 
CHAD (CONT'D) ...you didn't find this. 
MANOLO I found it on the floor there. 
CHAD Yeah, I know, but¬≠ 
MANOLO Right there on the floor there.      Lie- een there. 
46   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY                                            46 
CLOSE ON A REAR-VIEW MIRROR 
A dark blue Ford Taurus, three or four car lengths back on a quiet Chevy Chase street. 
Harry Pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror. Behind him we see the steel pipe from Home Depot laying across the top of the back seat of the station wagon. 
47   EXT. CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - DAY                                      47 
Harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the driveway of the suburban house. 
48   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  48 
Harry is struggling through the      front door with the length of pipe. 
We hear his wife call down from upstairs: 
SANDY Harry?      Is that you? 
HARRY Yeah, yeah, it's me. 
He takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar, sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door behind him. 
49   INT. CELLAR - NIGHT                                               49 
Harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise. 
His home shop is in a caged-off section of the basement. There is also haphazard storage. 
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 34. 
One shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker: "Oliver in the Oval Office," "Yea and Nay for Oliver," "Point of Order, Oliver!" 
Harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware. He drops it, a small bearing-mounted clip, onto a length of pipe held horizontal in another vise. He experimentally slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly back and forth, nicely balanced. 
50   INT. MONKEY DAVE'S - NIGHT                                     50 
Linda Litzke and Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, are at a table in the yuppie bar Monkey Dave's. To a waitress: 
LINDA Absolut Saketini, please? 
TED Just a Tab. 
LINDA You know, it wouldn't cover all of it, but if I got some advance on my salary I could at least get the surgery ball rolling. 
TED Whoa! There's a payroll company, you know. They don't just advance people money. They just don't do that. I mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I                           * authorize it, but that's not going to mean anything to them. 
LINDA Well why do they have us on a cockamamie health plan? I need these surgeries, Ted! 
TED You're a beautiful woman!   You don't need¬≠ 
LINDA Ted, I have gone just as far as I can go with this body! I---- 
TED I think it's a very beautiful----it's not a phoney-baloney Hollywood body---- 
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 35. 
LINDA That's right, Ted, I would be laughed out of Hollywood. I have very limited breasts and a gi-normous ass and I have this gut that swings back and forth in front a me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel. 
TED Oh come on! 
LINDA I am trying to get back in circulation. I have appetites and so forth, and, uh---- 
TED Well there's a lot of guys who'd like you just the way you are. 
LINDA Yeah----losers! 
LINDA Uh-huh. 
CHAD Not what we know. 
LINDA Uh-huh. 
CHAD And I also got his----do you have any water? I gotta hydrate. 
LINDA I have tap water 
CHAD Are you kidding? 
LINDA How did you find out who he is? 
CHAD Sources. 
LINDA What do you mean sources? 
CHAD Do you have like Gatorade? Anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water? 
He rises and heads for the kitchen. 
CHAD (CONT'D) ... You know how far this is from my place? 
LINDA How do you know his name? 
CHAD I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos? He does computer stuff, hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs'n shit? So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on. Fucking child's play for Ernie. 
LINDA Uh-huh. 
Chad opens the refrigerator and starts rummaging. 
CHAD I also have his telephone number. That was a little harder. 
LINDA Omygod! 
Chad straightens up with a bottle of orange juice which he rolls across his forehead. 
CHAD Shall we give him a tinkle? 
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 40. 
LINDA Omygod, why? 
CHAD Because he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure. You know, he's gonna be relieved. He might even be so relieved he gives us a reward----I would be very fucking surprised if he did not. 
LINDA Oh, wow. 
CHAD Very surprised. Like, you know, the                            * Good Samaritan tax. Which is not even a tax, really, since it's voluntary. 
54   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                        54 
Chad is looking at a crumpled piece of notepaper and punching numbers into a wall phone. In the background we see Linda watching him from the living room couch. 
A beat. 
We hear the call ring through. 
The click of the connection being made, and Chad silently gestures, with an upward sweep of his hand, for Linda to pick up her extension. 
CHAD Hello? 
55   INT. OSBOURNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     55 
He has the phone pressed groggily to his ear. 
OSBOURNE Hello? 
CHAD Osbourne?    Osbourne Cox? 
OSBOURNE Yes----uh----Who is this? 
CHAD Are you... uh... Osbourne Cox? 
OSBOURNE Who is this? What time is it?     Who are you? 
CHAD I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried. 
OSBOURNE Worried? 
CHAD About the security.     Of your shit. 
A beat. 
OSBOURNE What on earth are you talking about? Who am I speaking to? 
Katie stirs in bed. 
KATIE Who is it? 
CHAD Your files----your documents. I know these documents are sensitive. But I am perfectly happy to return to you your sensitive shit. At a time of your choosing. 
OSBOURNE What documents? What are you talking about? 
CHAD ... Osbourne Cox? 
OSBOURNE (explosive) Yes! Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox!     Who the fuck¬≠ 
LINDA And us in the driver's seat. This is our opportunity, like, you don't get many of these. You slip on the ice outside of, you know, a fancy restaurant. 
CHAD Yuh-huh. 
LINDA Or this happens. 
CHAD Right. 
LINDA And right now this has happened. 
CHAD Yup.   It sure has. 
LINDA This could put a big dent in my surgeries. 
CHAD Big time. 
58   INT. PFARRER CELLAR - DAWN                                           58 * 
SANDY PFARRER 
We are dutch on her as she leans down a staircase, one hand on its rail, calling to be heard over the buzz of a bandsaw: 
SANDY Honey! 
No answer.    The bandsaw whines higher, cutting through steel. Louder: 
SANDY (CONT'D) Honey! 
Blue Revision 8/1/07 46. 
The whine hums down. 
HARRY'S VOICE Huh? 
SANDY My cab is here, I'm off.      Mystery man. 
Her point-of-view: down the stairs, oddly cropped by the angles of dropped ceiling and walls, we see Harry's lower body as he throws a drape over his project. He emerges from the shop cage and closes its mesh door and padlocks it. 
SANDY (CONT'D) ... What is that thing? 
HARRY Oh baby.     Top secret. 
He comes up the stairs, pushing goggles onto his forehead. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... You're gonna knock 'em dead. 
At the top of the stairs he kisses her. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... How many cities? 
SANDY Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago. 
He picks up her bag and they go out. 
HARRY Why do they always have you do Seattle. Not a big market. 
SANDY I don't know, lots of independent bookstores. Rains all day, what are people gonna do. 
HARRY I can think of a couple of things. 
SANDY You can think of one thing. 
59   EXT. PFARRER HOUSE - DAWN                                         59 * 
They are walking to a black Town Car idling curbside. 
Pink Revision 8/14/07 47. 
SANDY It better be the Peninsula. The money I make for them. Are you gonna be okay? 
HARRY I'll be sad. But I'll be okay. 
SANDY Not too sad.. 
HARRY Just the right amount. 
He kisses her. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... I am crazy about you, baby. 
He slams the car door after her. As the car pulls out his look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught on: 
A Ford Taurus, parked, dark. 
Harry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards the parked car. 
When he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the car. A shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost when the headlights flash on. The car pulls out from the curb into a U-turn and drives away. 
Harry watches the tail lights recede. 
60   INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           60 
CLOSE ON A THUMB AND FINGER 
Twisting a gold cufflink like a worry bead. Wider shows the attorney Bogus Terikhian at a conference table in a book- lined room. 
BOGUS Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison and Zoe                        * Caldwell. It was marvelous. First                          * time I've attended the Kennedy Honors. Jane Alexander is a client. Old                            * friend of Zoe's. What an actress.                          * Anyway... 
HARRY (still chewing, he shrugs) It's no big deal. Never discharged it, twenty years service. Security blanket now. I don't think about it---- course, you're not supposed to think about it; (MORE) 
Pink Revision 8/14/07 51. 
HARRY (CONT'D) in a situation where your man is threatened the training kicks in. Muscle memory. Reflex----Those are outrageous. 
He stabs another dumpling off Linda's plate.                        * 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Wanna swap? 
LINDA No way! 
65   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 65 
Linda swings the door open, leading Harry in. 
Harry talks as he looks appraisingly around the apartment. 
HARRY ----but there was just a hell of a lot of political infighting, petty, petty, shit, and then basically the old man stepped on Goldberger's throat. Nice... 
He is evaluating the place.   He stamps on the floor. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Wide-plank pine? 
LINDA I guess. 
Harry is taking off his coat. 
HARRY Listen, full disclosure here Linda... 
He holds up both hands and waggles the fingers. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... I'm not wearing a wedding ring but I am married. Took the ring off, what, eighteen months ago when we agreed to separate. Agreed to disagree. That's about the only thing we ever agreed on. 
Linda cackles. 
LINDA Thanks for telling me.     I really do appreciate it, Harry. 
HARRY Well, full transparency, the only way to---- 
As Linda passes he grabs and embraces her.    Linda reacts to his gun in the shoulder holster: 
LINDA That's not gonna go off, is it? 
HARRY Well let's go in the other room and find out!   Grrr! 
66   INT. TED'S OFFICE - DAY                                         66 
TED TREFFON 
The soulful manager of Hardbodies. 
TED That's great. That sounds... exciting. 
Wider shows Linda in the manager's cubicle. 
LINDA He's very very communicative. Very accessible. He has a sense of humor. And he agrees one hundred percent about my surgeries. 
TED Well, I---- 
LINDA He thinks my ass could be smaller. I mean, not in a mean way, he kidded about it----he's got a terrific sense of humor. 
TED That's good, but... but... Linda, what do you really know about this guy? 
LINDA I told you, he's in the Treasury Department and he---- 
TED But he could be one of these people who, you know, who cruises the internet---- 
LINDA Yeah, so am I! 
A rattling knock.   Linda looks over: 
Chad Feldheimer, in his trainer's polo shirt, is knocking on the cubicle window. He gestures urgently for her to come out. 
67   EXT. SERVICE ALLEY - DAY                                         67 
Behind Hardbodies. Linda and Chad emerge from the health club through a heavy back door. 
LINDA No, you can't go like that!     You gotta wear a suit. 
CHAD Well----you mean----go home and change? 
LINDA Yeah! 
CHAD I was gonna ride my bike.     Do I have time? 
68   INT. DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY                                   68 
Harry and Katie are at a downtown D.C. restaurant in the middle of lunch. 
KATIE ----which to my mind is all the more reason to lower the boom on Ozzie. 
HARRY Mm. 
KATIE That's it?     "Mm"? 
HARRY I'm just... wondering if it's the right time. 
He slams the door. 
70   EXT. STREET/COX'S CAR - DAY                                      70 
As Chad goes over to his bike Osbourne leans across the front seat and cranks down the passenger window to bellow: 
OSBOURNE I know who you are, fucker! 
He pulls out. 
CHAD You're the fucker! 
There is the honk of a car horn----not Osbourne's. 
Chad looks, surprised.    Linda is pulling up.   Her passenger window rolls down. 
LINDA Where's the money? 
CHAD He hit me! 
LINDA Where's the money?! 
CHAD He didn't give it to me¬≠ 
LINDA Oh, for----Get in! 
Chad does. 
CHAD That fucker! 
71    INT. LINDA'S CAR/EXT. STREET - DAY                                   71 
He is thrown back against the seat as Linda floors it. Recovering: 
CHAD ... Hey----what're you---- 
Linda is coming up fast behind Osbourne's car in traffic. 
CHAD (CONT'D) Oh shit! 
The crash of impact----ramming Osbourne. 
72    INT. OSBOURNE'S CAR/EXT. STREET - DAY                                72 
He recoils from the impact. 
OSBOURNE Holy fucking----you fucking morons!

The follow car is speeding up again----but it doesn't hit him. It swerves out, screeching, to pass, and Linda angrily flips him the finger as she speeds by. 
73    INT. LINDA'S CAR - DAY                                               73 
LINDA That'll give him something to think about. 
Chad is chuckling.      Suddenly he sobers. 
CHAD Wait, wait! We gotta go back! 
Linda's jaw is set.      The car is ripping through traffic. 
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 59. 
LINDA I knew this would happen. 
CHAD We gotta go back!     My bike! 
LINDA It's on to Plan B. 
CHAD It's just a Kryptonite lock----you can open those fuckers with a Bic pen! 
LINDA Heavens sakes---- 
CHAD Where we going?     My bike! 
LINDA Some people! 
A skidding turn sends his weight against the door, and the car lurches to a halt. 
CHAD ... What is this? 
LINDA Russian Embassy.

The hulking embassy building. 
74    INT. EMBASSY RECEPTION - DAY                                    74 
Linda stands before a reception desk. Chad is just behind her, his shirt front spotted with blood and his head tipped back with one hand pressing a hankie to his nose. His bike helmet is clamped under his other arm. 
LINDA I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping                      * by? 
CHAD Is there a men's room? 
The man looks at her impassively. 
CHAD Name, rank and serial number. 
The Russian's focus shifts to the man with the bloody nose: 
NEW EMBASSY MAN Excuse me? 
CHAD We, um... we know our rights. 
The man stares at him.       A beat. 
LINDA This is just a taste. 
The man's look swings back to the woman for another staring beat. 
At length: 
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 63. 
NEW EMBASSY MAN There is more material? 
LINDA There's a lot more.    But we need to be paid. 
NEW EMBASSY MAN You are not ideological. 
A beat. 
CHAD I don't think so. 
LINDA Look, I have a date. 
NEW EMBASSY MAN Hm? 
Linda holds up her watch and taps at it: 
LINDA Date. 
The man sighs. 
NEW EMBASSY MAN ... We will examine the material.   How do I contact? 
LINDA We work at the Hardbodies in Alexandria. 
CHAD I'm at 1442 Westerly---- 
LINDA Chad, not your home address! 
Beat. 
NEW EMBASSY MAN So... I call Hardbodies, I ask for... Chad? 
LINDA No.    Linda.                                             *

TED TREFFON 
Point-of-view from a car pulling into Hardbodies. Ted Treffon, the soulful manager, stands on the sidewalk in front of the gym, squinting into the approaching car, his arms out to either side, palms up: what the hell is going on? 
80   INT. TED'S CUBICLE - DAY                                        80 
Minutes later. 
TED A line to check in, towels piling up. 
LINDA I'm sorry. 
TED Manolo running around like crazy----what happened to your nose? 
CHAD I just---- 
TED This is not acceptable at Hardbodies. You two know better than that. 
LINDA Yes we do.     I'm sorry, Ted. 
TED This is no way. 
CHAD It was unavoidable.    This won't happen again. 
A considering beat. 
TED But you won't tell me what's going on. 
LINDA We can't. I... I... Ted, I know this is terrible, but----I have to run. I have a date. 
Ted looks at her dolefully. 
TED You're changing, Linda. 
Blue Revision 8/1/07 65. 
He shakes his head. 
TED (CONT'D) ... Very sad. 
81   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - OSBOURNE'S CAR - DAY                       81 * 
It looks like a rowing machine, though with a higher seat. Its function is obscure. 
LINDA ... What is it? 
HARRY (smug) What is it. You siddown, feet in the stirrups, and... 
He pushes the seat with his foot. It slides forward then back, forward and back, rocking. On its forward arc a dildo emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its entrance. 
A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo rhythmically bobbing up and down. 
At length: 
LINDA Omygod! 
Another couple of cycles. 
LINDA (CONT'D) ... It's fantastic! 
HARRY Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks all-in if you don't count my labor. And the, you know----cost of the dildo. Those things are not cheap. 
LINDA Uh-uh. 
HARRY But I lack the, uh, I'm not set up to mold hard rubber. 
Both stare at the rocking love seat: 
Squeak.   Squeak.      Squeak. 
90   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                              90 
CLOSE ON OSBOURNE 
Sitting in a bar booth, staring, incredulous. 
OSBOURNE ... The Russians? 
Across from him, a man of Osbourne's age. 
MAN (HAL) Uh-huh. 
OSBOURNE The Russians? 
HAL Uh-huh.    Russian Embassy, yeah. 
Osbourne stares. 
OSBOURNE ... You're sure? 
HAL Hey, the guy was not hard to follow. As you know. 
OSBOURNE Why the FUCK would they go to the Russians?! 
The man responds only with a shrug and a commiserating head- shake. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... Why the FUCK... 
Osbourne struggles to compose himself. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... I'm sorry. Thank you, Hal. 
HAL Hey.     No problemo. 
He leans in, voice lowered. 
HAL (CONT'D) ... Ozzie, I hate to be the paranoid old spook, but those two guys seem very interested in you. 
Osbourne looks. 
HAL (CONT'D) ...You haven't gone poofy on me, have ya Oz? 
There are two men with drinks at a booth. At Osbourne's look one of them, who has been staring, looks hastily away. 
OSBOURNE (sharply) Can I help you? 
The man meets his look again.   He smiles, rises, ambles over. 
MAN (PROCESS SERVER) Sorry to stare, I just couldn't place the... You're Princeton, aren't you? My year? '73? 
OSBOURNE (softening) Yeah. 
PROCESS SERVER I just didn't remember your... 
Osbourne extends a hand. 
OSBOURNE Osbourne Cox. 
PROCESS SERVER Thought so. 
He smiles as he deposits a large manila envelope in Osbourne's extended hand. 
PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) ... Served... 
He nods toward his companion, watching from the booth. 
PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) ... and witnessed. Have a good evening. 
The man walks off; his friend hastily knocks back the rest of his drink and rises to follow him. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod who are you. You fucker. Omygod. 
He gingerly crouches down. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... You fucker... 
He tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit pockets. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod, my god... Ungh... 
He comes away with a wallet and hastily stands. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod... 
Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards, driver's license; empty. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... What the fuck... 
He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason feeling obliged to return the wallet. 
As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside pocket he notices: 
The suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled fringe. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Oh my fuck... 
He straightens up again. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... I killed a fucking spook.    You fucker... 
He gazes down at the body. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... What are you doing here, you fucker. 
111   INT. CIA HALLWAY - DAY                                          111 
We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway. 
112   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              112 
We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk. 
He looks up. 
PALMER Olson.    What's up. 
The door slams shut. 
113   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              113 
Some time later.    Our camera position is higher. 
At the cut the door swings open and Palmer Smith strides out, grim-faced. 
114   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY                    114 
Tracking behind his shoes down a different piece of hallway. 
115   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DOOR/CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY       115 
Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open. A silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the desktop. 
MAN Palmer.    What's up. 
PALMER Not quite certain, sir, but it's... messy. 
He seats himself facing the desk. A desktop nameplate identifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb. 
Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing. 
PALMER (CONT'D) ... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have computer files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osbourne Cox. 
GARDNER CHUBB Kolyma-2? 
PALMER Our man in the Russian Embassy. 
GARDNER CHUBB Mm. 
PALMER It was brought to them by a woman who---- 
GARDNER CHUBB The Russians? 
PALMER Yeah. It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the folder. With Pfarrer's. 
GARDNER CHUBB The Russians. 
PALMER Yeah. 
GARDNER CHUBB Who's Pfarrer? 
PALMER Treasury agent who's been, um, screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows about it, they all seem to be sleeping with each other. 
GARDNER CHUBB All right.     Spare me. 
PALMER Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's gotten... complicated. He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house. 
GARDNER CHUBB Shot----your analyst? 
LINDA I know, Ted. 
TED Linda, I can't run a gym this way. 
LINDA I know, Ted. 
TED I'm going to have to fire him. 
LINDA No! No no no, Ted!   Just, just. .   . 
TED What? 
LINDA Give me twenty-four hours! 
TED To what? 
LINDA To, um... I don't know, twenty-four hours! 
TED Linda---- 
LINDA Just give me twenty-four hours to solve this thing! 
TED Linda. I have to tell you. A man was here earlier asking about you. 
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 86. 
Linda looks at Ted for a beat, thinking. 
LINDA Foreigner? 
TED Linda, are you in some kind of trouble? Is Chad running from something? 
LINDA Ted, we know what we're doing. Let me ask you this: did he know my name. 
TED Whuh----yes, he was asking about you. Employment history, et cetera. Real jerk. I told him to get lost. 
She takes his hand. 
LINDA Thank you, Ted. 
Ted swallows.   He looks down. 
TED Well, we... 
Linda still has his hand.      He tries to cover his reaction to the physical contact. 
TED (CONT'D) ... we just don't give that out at Hardbodies. 
The phone beeps.    A voice comes through the intercom: 
VOICE Linda, there's a Mr. Krapotkin on line                   * two. 
LINDA Omygod! 
She punches a button on the phone. 
LINDA (CONT'D) ... Hello? Mr. Krapkin?                                  * 
VOICE Linda? 
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 87. 
LINDA Yes? 
VOICE This is Ilan Krapotkin. Russian embassy. Returning your call. 
LINDA Yes, yes!----hang on.    Ted, I'm sorry. This is private. 
Looking at her, Ted sighs. He shakes his head sadly, rises and goes. Linda pushes the door of the cubicle shut with her foot. 
LINDA (CONT'D) ... Hello.     Is this a secure line, Mr. Krapkin?                                               *

LINDA No! I----I'm terribly worried about my associate. My----my----you know... Chad.

LINDA Do you have him? 
KRAPOTKIN Do we have him? 
LINDA Is he----I don't know what the term is, did he, "go over"? 
Blue Revision 8/1/07 88. 
SANDY There are two days left.     There's still Seattle. 
HARRY Yeah. 
Blue Revision 8/1/07 91. 
SANDY I love you, Harry. 
HARRY Okay.   Yeah. Love you too. 
He folds the phone, miserable. 
As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the side-view mirror: 
The car parked across the street.    A man's shape in the driver's seat. 
120   EXT. TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                            120 * 
Harry, jaw set, gets out of the car and starts down the drive. 
The parked car starts. 
HARRY Hey!    Fucker! 
The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars front and back; it will need a couple moves. 
Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the frantically shuttling car. 
He t-bones it. 
VOICE FROM WITHIN CAR Fucker! 
Harry, amped, throws his car into drive, pulls halfway up the driveway. 
HARRY Fucker!   Fucker! 
He again throws the car into reverse. 
The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and scrambles frantically toward the passenger side. 
Harry again smashes into the car. 
Blue Revision 8/1/07 92. 
121   EXT. STREET ACROSS FROM TOWNHOUSE - DAY                         121 * 
The other man emerges from the far side. He flees down the sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change jingling, yelling as he runs: 
MAN Fucker! 
Harry runs after him, calling: 
HARRY Who do you work for?!   Who do you work for?! 
Pounding footsteps. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Tell me! 
The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry closes, leaps, and tackles. 
He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting: 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Who do you work for? CIA?     NSC? 
The other man is panting much harder: 
MAN Tuchman Marsh! 
This stops Harry.   He isn't sure what he's heard. 
HARRY What? 
MAN Tuchman Marsh! 
HARRY ... Tuchman Marsh? 
MAN Yes! 
HARRY Your name is... Tuchman Marsh? 
MAN Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino! 
Harry stares at the man underneath him.     The gasping man explains: 
MAN (CONT'D) ... I work for them! 
HARRY You... work for Tuchman Marsh. 
MAN Yes! 
HARRY Which is a law firm. 
MAN No! A rock band!      Yes, it's a law firm! 
HARRY Well... why are you following me? 
MAN Divorce action, numbnuts! 
124   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - ANOTHER ROOM - DAY                        124 
A waiting room.    A long beat; Linda sits waiting. 
A door opens.    Mr. Krapotkin emerges. 
Linda stands to go to the inner office but Krapotkin motions her back down. 
KRAPOTKIN Yes, madam. Can we help you? 
LINDA What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are you running?! I've been waiting here for fifty-five minutes, and I'm---- 
KRAPOTKIN I am so sorry, madam.   An urgent matter. 
LINDA Well this could be urgent too, since, you know, Chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and---- 
KRAPOTKIN I don't know the whereabouts of Chad, madam. 
LINDA Well he was gathering information for you when he---- 
KRAPOTKIN We're not interested in such "information". It was drivel. 
Linda is dumbfounded. 
A silent beat. 
LINDA ... Dribble! 
Krapotkin fishes something from his pocket. 
KRAPOTKIN Would you like your disk back? 
LINDA ... Dribble! 
Krapotkin stands with the disk extended toward her. 
KRAPOTKIN I'm so sorry I can't help you. 
Linda recovers from her astonishment and is moved to outrage: 
LINDA I'll tell you what's dribble! You listen to me, Mr. Krapkin! I am----

125   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - HALLWAY AGAIN                          125 
Looking the opposite way. 
We hear two pairs of footsteps. They approach for several beats and then Linda and her escort enter frame and recede, footsteps echoing. The staffer's hand is on Linda's elbow. 
As we hold on their backs and they continue to walk, Linda jerks her arm away; the staffer regrabs it. She jerks away again. 
LINDA Cut it out.

An exercise show plays on the TV, unwatched. Osbourne sits at a little table looking at a notice torn from a windowed envelope. 
OSBOURNE ... What? 
He brings the notice close, squints at it. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... What the fuck? 
He quickly shuffles through the rest of the mail, pulls out another envelope, rips it open. 
Blue Revision 8/1/07 99. 
A MINUTE LATER 
Osbourne paces, drink in hand, staring at another piece of mail. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) What the fuck? 
A MINUTE LATER 
Osbourne is back at the table, drink half-consumed, listening at the phone. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... Yes... No... Yes, I want to know why the check for my slip fee was returned for insufficient funds... Slip fee, for docking my boat, the check was returned... No, m'dam, it's not zero, I have about forty thousand dollars in that account... When? ... When?... But she can't do that----no, yes, technically it may be a joint account but she doesn't use it, it's not her money... No! No! What access, it's not possible! Without my permission? What about the, my, the, our savings account? My savings account?... I don't know the fucking number! You think I memorize the fucking numbers on my fucking bank accounts! Moron!... Hello? 
A129   EXT. PFARRERS' CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - DUSK (FORMERLY SCENE 126) A129 * 
We are looking at the exterior of the house in wide shot.         * Peaceful neighborhood. Birds chirp.                               * 
From inside the house, though, we can faintly hear sobs,          * punctuated by sounds of exertion. Each gasp of effort ends        * in a dull clang.                                                  *

The wracking sobs bump up loud at the cut inside.                 * 
Harry is weeping as he demolishes the love seat with a            * sledgehammer.                                                     * 
Blue Revision 8/1/07 99A. 
Linda starts quietly weeping. 
This focuses Harry's attention.    He looks at her as if just now noticing her. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... What?    What's wrong, baby? 
LINDA It can't always come from me, Harry! I'm not that strong! 
Harry moves next to her and puts an arm around her. 
HARRY What's wrong, baby?     Harry's here. 
LINDA You're not here for me! I need a can- do person! You're all... defeated! 
HARRY I'm sorry, baby---- 
LINDA Chad is the only can-do person I know and he's gone, Harry, he's gone. 
HARRY I'll be good. I'll be better.     I just need to exercise. Are there pedestrian paths around here? 
He squeezes her shoulder, takes a gulp of the drink. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Who the fuck is Chad? 
LINDA Could you help me find him?  He's a friend from work. You know law enforcement people, right? You could call, unofficially? 
HARRY Wait a minute, what's his name?   What happened? 
LINDA Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared. He hasn't been at work or at home for two days. 
HARRY Okay. 
LINDA He---- 
HARRY You know his social security number? 
LINDA Huh?     NO!    I---- 
HARRY It's okay. That's okay.     What's the last place you saw him? 
LINDA (snuffling) I don't know! He just disappeared! The last place I saw him was the Jamba Juice on K Street. And he's gone. 
Harry squeezes her shoulder again. 
HARRY Okay baby. We'll find your friend. Missing person. Piece of cake. 
133   INT. PEDIATRIC EXAM ROOM - DAY                                      133 
AN EPIGLOTTIS 
Illuminated by a small light. It quavers.       The tongue starts to rise and the mouth starts to close. 
WOMAN'S VOICE No, stay open... 
Wider: a pediatric examining room decorated with colorful prints of cartoon characters and clowns. 
Katie Cox, in a white smock, has a tongue depressor in a five- year-old's mouth and a light-sight in one hand. She withdraws both as the child finishes closing his mouth. The child's mother stands by. 
Katie grasps the child by the upper arm. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... You have to let the doctor look in your mouth. 
The child keeps his lips pressed together. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... Now you listen to me, young man. You do as I say or I'll ask your mother to leave the doctor's office and the two of us will sort out what's what. 
The child looks at her fearfully. 
The wall phone bleeps. 
Katie rolls to it on her castored chair. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... Yes. 
She listens briefly. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... With a patient. 
She hangs up. 
134   INT. OSBOURNE'S BOAT - DAY                                          134 
Osbourne, in dressing gown and pyjamas, is barking into the phone: 
OSBOURNE Yeah? The same patient she's been with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT! 
FILTERED VOICE Dr. Cox has suggested you call her attorney---- 
OSBOURNE Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new fucking keys! 
He slams down the phone. 
135   EXT. BOAT DECK                                                  135 
The hatch is thrown open and Osbourne emerges from below. There is a large built-in toolbox just by the hatch. He yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet. 
OSBOURNE New keys... 
Linda walks up.    They greet each other with a kiss. 
HARRY Hello there sunshine.    You look great. 
LINDA Well you seem better. 
Harry does indeed seem more like his old self. 
HARRY Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time this morning. And our exercise last night didn't hurt! 
Linda is shocked but secretly pleased: 
LINDA Harry! 
HARRY Boy, I am through banging my head against the wall. I am gonna start doing what's right for me. 
LINDA That's how I believe, also.   You have to do what's right for---- 
HARRY Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a shock recently, and I realized you know, life is not infinite. No one's immortal. 
LINDA No one's immortal. 
HARRY You have to get from each day its full, uh, squeeze the juice from every day because there but for the grace of God---- 
LINDA Exactly. The important thing is to maintain a positive outlook. Always up. Always ebullient. 
HARRY That's right, don't sweat the small stuff... 
Linda chimes in: 
Linda and Harry 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... and it's all small stuff. 
Harry reaches for Linda and she slides closer.     He puts an arm around her. 
HARRY (CONT'D) This is where we first met.   Remember? 
LINDA Of course I do. 
HARRY You never know what the important days are, until... until, um... 
The thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something.    With his look still fixed: 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... I told myself I was gonna stop being paranoid, but... is that guy looking at us? 
Linda follows his look. 
On a bench a short distance away a middle-aged man with aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them. 
LINDA (hastily) No, no. 
A slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk. 
Linda turns to Harry. 
LINDA (CONT'D) ... Have you found out anything about Chad? 
HARRY Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls. I don't think it'll take long. 
LINDA Really? 
HARRY Oh yeah, there are so many data bases now it's a joke... 
Relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged in conversation, Harry warms to his theme. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Back when I was in PP there was still some art to finding people. Not any more. And now with the cell phones? Pretty soon they're gonna know where everyone is. Everyone. At any given moment. I mean it's almost the reality now. You would be amazed. 
LINDA Uh-huh. 
HARRY Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice ----did Chad say anything about where he might be going? 
LINDA Oh, I know where he was going. 
HARRY Oh yeah? 
LINDA A residence in Alexandria.    On Hillsboro Drive. 
Harry has stopped chewing.    He is staring at her. 
Linda feels obliged to fill the silence. 
LINDA (CONT'D) ... 2055 Hillsboro. 
Harry stares.    Linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed stare. 
LINDA (CONT'D) ... It's, um. The residence of a guy named Osbourne Cox. 
Harry is beginning to look sick. 
A long silence. 
Then, quietly: 
HARRY Who are you? 
Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.

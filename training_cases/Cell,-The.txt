The Cell 
FADE IN: 
A SPECK OF DUST 
Grains of sand dance in the wind.  As we glide over a VAST DESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. CATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon.  A curious breeze blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if the wind itself were telling something to her... 
Catherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand.  She pulls the reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into nothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the horse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her shoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. Not surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand sliding beneath her feet... 
She finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed, gnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across her face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source... 
A SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a locket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival. 
CATHERINE Thanks for the horse. 
He's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine. 
EDWARD You liked him? 
CATHERINE He's beautiful... 
Edward smiles, delighted he made her happy. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) But I thought we were going sailing. 
The boy frowns. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) You promised. 
A devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. Catherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) We can't fit into that! 
Edward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her, then snaps the locket shut.  When her vision clears, Catherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes.  A craft weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) That'll do. 
She walks toward it, but Edward doesn't follow. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) (coaxing him) Come on, Mister E. 
She extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) What now? 
EDWARD (nods at the ship) 's broken. 
Undaunted, she... finds herself standing on the DECK. 
CATHERINE (calling to him) Who says? 
EDWARD Mocky-Lock. 
CATHERINE Oh no... No you don't. 
EDWARD "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am." 
CATHERINE I bet we can fix it. 
She opens a rusted iron DOOR.  It makes an HORRIFIC SCREECHING SOUND.  Similar to metal-on-metal, but more piercing, more pained.  As if made by a living thing. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) (familiar with the noise, a warning to him) Ed-ward... 
Catherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body into a waiting wheelchair.  Miriam takes a penlight and examines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly beautiful. 
MIRIAM (thinking aloud) Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the bogeyman... All preparation for the horrors of the real world. 
Making certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam.  Henry types in a command and moves to join them. 
HENRY Anybody hungry?  I'm hungry... 
A BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly fretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them in the corridor. 
COOPERMAN Edward's parents are here. 
We can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news. 
EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY 
Situated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego, California, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini compound.  A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A DIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY 
Although this is a hospital room filled with medical equipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys, posters, photographs, and drawings to make it more "homey." (Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world).  Every comfort has been provided and no expense spared. 
Henry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitting on the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed woman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, but the husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor of a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, but we sense a genuine love for his wife and child.  Ella smiles and caresses Edward's hair. 
ELLA He needs a haircut. 
CATHERINE I'll tell the nurse. (sensing something in Edward) God, he loves when you visit. 
ELLA My husband wonders if that's true. (delivering bad news) He wants to place Edward in a hospital. 
Seeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate himself from Miriam and Catherine... 
HENRY There are other applications for the scanner, Mr. Baines... 
LUCIEN I realize that, Henry... (to Miriam) And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is invaluable to this company... 
CATHERINE You don't know about me, though, do you? 
LUCIEN Catherine, we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress... 
CATHERINE There's been progress. 
LUCIEN Yes, but there is no proof the procedure works.  All I have is a belief that your interaction with my son is not a hallucination. 
Catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must defend herself. 
CATHERINE (to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry) You picked me, remember?  And I took the job.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and I want to be part of it... 
COOPERMAN No one is doubting your ability. 
CATHERINE Then what is it? 
Introspective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then: 
LUCIEN I've invested millions of dollars in this study... And I've convinced others to do the same.  I suppose I should feel responsible to them, but I don't.  I could care less if they see a profit. I'm responsible to my boy, that's all that matters. (looks her in the eye) You tell me... Am I doing the right thing? 
OFF CATHERINE'S FACE... 
INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY 
At first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. It's too bright, the space confining.  As our eyes adjust, we seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall.  We HEAR a WOMAN CRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY.  Dark circles beneath eyes red and puffy from crying.  Hair wet and ratted. Sweater and pants damp and stained.  Barefoot, she shivers from cold and fear... 
PULL BACK to show more of her surroundings.  The white-tiled 10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push button SPIGOT for drinking water.  Two walls are SOLID, the other two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic. 
MIRIAM I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening. 
CATHERINE (frustrated) It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created. 
MIRIAM If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world. 
CATHERINE I do it all the time! 
MIRIAM Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened... 
CATHERINE I'd be there for him. 
MIRIAM And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone. 
CATHERINE (defeated) Okay, okay... 
Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes. 
MIRIAM Besides, I don't know what it might do to you.  You're already exhausted. (concerned) Have you been sleeping? 
Catherine nods. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) I can prescribe something... 
Catherine shakes her head no.  Miriam shuts off the penlight and looks at Catherine with professional and personal concern. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) You're sure?  Any more nightmares? 
CATHERINE (defensively) No. 
MIRIAM Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television. 
CATHERINE Yes mother. 
MIRIAM I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here. 
She taps Catherine's head. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) Don't bring it home in this. 
CATHERINE Okay. 
Miriam gathers her belongings. 
MIRIAM Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come? 
CATHERINE (declining) I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early. 
MIRIAM That's my girl. 
Miriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could happen if things were reversed. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY 
The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.  At the NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a closed-circuit monitor.  Further down the hall, Miriam and Henry exit.  Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a worn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room, watching him sleep. 
CATHERINE Pleasant dreams, Mister E. 
EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY 
A GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch of two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the speed limit.  He signals and exits... 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 
INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
CHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. Admiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings in his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters, a series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous as the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground, pulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher grimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the hoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the table until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's. 
In the flickering weird light of the television screen, Stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of William Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an innocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself, chains clinking and swaying. 
EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY 
A railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek bed.  Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER, CRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.  A SEDAN travels down a service road and stops nearby.  TWO MEN exit, identify themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene. 
Special Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges, introspective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with probing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the world, for that matter - from a unique perspective. 
As Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky. 
RAMSEY Who found her? 
Cole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car. 
COLE Surveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six this morning. 
Novak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by wire.  Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI PATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE "TEDDY" LEE, a polite, dapper southern gentleman. 
NOVAK Thanks for waiting, Teddy. 
Teddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My pleasure."  Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick clear plastic.  As the photographer reacts to a strong smell, Teddy comments. 
TEDDY LEE Bleach. 
As the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.  Sadly, Novak recognizes the face. 
NOVAK Anne Marie Vicksey. 
We recognize her, too. 
COLE She the one from Santa Cruz? 
NOVAK Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter. 
He and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither man surprised.  Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the killer's tell-tale signs. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) (instructing the photographer) The semen on her legs and abdomen. 
FLASH! Photos are taken. 
TEDDY LEE Someone looking after her little girl? 
NOVAK Grandparents.  Live over in Davis. 
Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld.  He moves to the creek and sees only a few inches of water.  His eyes move from the drop site to the highway above. 
TEDDY LEE The poor thing. 
FLASH!  We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft shoulder.  Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene, steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the killer's truck as it disappeared into the night. EXT. OFFICE PLAZA - DAY 
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN, JULIA HICKSON, shares lunch with her fiancee, JOHN TRACY.  They talk, laugh and kiss, not a care in the world. 
INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY 
As TALK RADIO plays, Carl Stargher watches them, specifically Julia, his eyes never off her for too long as his hands work on something banal but unseen. 
TALK RADIO HOST ...complaining about government subsidies for farmers... 
The voice on the radio becomes DISTORTED as we hear it through Stargher's ears... 
TEDDY LEE Now? 
NOVAK Now. 
INT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY 
A MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view. 
TEDDY LEE Complete absence of melanin. 
Novak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder. 
RAMSEY And that means? 
Teddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch (chicken fried steak now carry-out). 
NOVAK The dog's an albino. (pictures it) He'd love an animal like that. 
TEDDY LEE Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed. 
INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Exiting an elevator, Julia heads for her little Toyota. Smart girl that she is, her eyes scan the area and her fingers hold a can of mace. 
INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT 
Julia climbs in, checks her mirror and backs up.  WHAM!  Did she hit something??  She brakes, puts the car in park, and checks her sideview mirror. 
Reflected there is a WOUNDED DOG.  A white German Shepherd. She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing whimpering. 
JULIA Oh no... 
INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Julia exits her car and kneels next to Valentine, who appears to be in terrible pain. 
JULIA God... I didn't see you. 
STARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND!  One grabs her hair and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her until she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the passenger seat and starts the car.  Pulls a dog treat from his pocket and WHISTLES.  The Shepherd instantly perks up. Perfectly healthy.  And jumps into the car. 
STARGHER (feeds him a treat) Good boy. 
INT. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY 
In a BRIEFING ROOM we find Teddy Lee, Ramsey, Cole and local cops.  All in need of caffeine.  They complain, gossip, and shoot the shit.  Resembling a demanding professor, Novak enters and through presence alone, lacking any self consciousness about his dishevelled appearance, takes control of the room by holding up a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman. 
NOVAK Donna Krozin. (a new picture every time) Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki... 
The chatter dies. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) Antoinette Simms, Natalie Pagels, Grace Cassatt... Anne Vicksey. 
Every person is solemn and focused. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) Smart, gentle, attractive young women. Just starting out in life. Embarking on careers, going to school, getting married... 
He's hooked them.  The victims, these women, now mean something to them.  With great effect, he holds up grisly post-mortem photos. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) They were killed.  Kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.  By a white male.  About 30-years old. (significantly) Who owns an albino dog./ 
Everyone knows this is a real clue and awareness is heightened.  Ramsey chimes in. 
RAMSEY A purebred German Shepherd. 
JOHN Eight o'clock.  We were going out for my birthday. 
MR. HICKSON Maybe you made a mistake.  Maybe she... she... 
Novak hides the doll. 
RAMSEY No sir.  I'm sorry. 
Ramsey's cell-phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner of the room, leaving Novak alone to deal with this uncomfortable, sad situation, no one saying a word until an emotionally shattered Mrs. Hickson, fingering a rosary, feels compelled to tell him. 
NOVAK After three years she remembers what the guy drove? 
RAMSEY She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it. 
EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - DAY 
Ramsey and Novak exit a small jet and are met by FBI Agent STOCKWELL. 
STOCKWELL Ramsey, Novak? 
They nod and he directs them to a waiting GMC SUBURBAN. 
STOCKWELL (CONT'D) Agent Stockwell. 
NOVAK Where is he? 
STOCKWELL Edison.  Just east of Loma Park.  SWAT's had the house under surveillance for about twenty minutes. (info memorized) Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher.  No registered weapons, no priors.  Got a license for his dog, though.  Named him Valentine... 
INT. GMC SUBURBAN - DAY 
Stockwell is behind the wheel, racing down the highway. Ramsey's in the passenger seat, Novak in back.  Shotguns and body armor line the cargo area.  Novak's eyes target the FAX, a copy of Stargher's license and registration, and the grainy dot-matrix image of the suspect's face.  And Novak knows he's found him. 
NOVAK You're the bad man, aren't you, Carl? 
EXT. STARGHER HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
A sparsely populated lower-middle class neighborhood.  A half dozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac.  Bare trees. Brown lawns.  Crows in the air. 
The house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250 pick-up in the driveway.  Green trim. 
THE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a PRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait. 
INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY 
Stockwell introduces Ramsey and Novak to BROCK, leader of the FBI Tactical Unit, a calm, confident ex-Marine wearing a black uniform and body armor. 
BROCK Glad you could make it.  We lose the sun in half an hour. 
Novak and Ramsey join him at the shaded window to observe Stargher's house.  Children's drawings fill the wall.  As Brock explains, Novak checks with binoculars. 
BROCK (CONT'D) Perimeter's two-hundred yards around the house.  Three men at the rear, two on each side, four up front.  I've got two marksmen on the roof. 
NOVAK Have they seen him? 
BROCK No.  There's been movement in the kitchen.  But it could be the dog. (important) You think she's in there? 
Novak is careful with his answer. 
NOVAK We proceed assuming she is. 
RAMSEY Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company. 
NOVAK No. (to Brock) Can you get a man close? 
EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY 
FBI AGENTS and local police cordon off the area. 
INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Valentine is muzzled and led away as the PARAMEDICS load Stargher onto a stretcher.  Agent Stockwell turns to a worried Novak. 
STOCKWELL They'll take him to County General. Reid's already there. 
NOVAK Make sure he stays cuffed.  Two men on him at all times.  I don't want anyone treating him but Reid.  Not so much as a thermometer up his ass.  Understand? 
Stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside.  A stoic Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the disappointment in his eyes. 
RAMSEY She's not here. 
Novak would give anything for that not to be true. 
RAMSEY (CONT'D) (it gets worse) You should come downstairs. 
INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY 
Ramsey leads Novak into Stargher's "workroom."  It's all here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach.  An odd, grisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden storage/shelf unit.  Novak's eyes are like a camera, documenting and storing as much information as possible, but it's overwhelming. 
He moves through the basement.  Careful not to touch anything.  He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks situated over the stainless steel table.  (NOTE: ON THE WINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING "CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT" with a logo). 
Ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills with images of Anne dying in the cell. 
Novak is painfully, tragically drawn to this.  Although he's seen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed by the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly dying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia Hickson unless he finds her. 
INT. THE CELL - NIGHT 
CLICK.  WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER.  Caught by surprise, Julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut off valve.  Of course, there is none.  Thirty seconds later, the water stops.  Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's eyes dart around her "cage."  What kind of hell is this? Shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply into it.  Something's odd about the glass.  Is someone watching her?  She bangs on it with her fist. 
JULIA Hey! 
POUND, POUND, POUND! 
JULIA (CONT'D) LET ME OUT!!! 
But there's no response.  Only her reflection. 
INT. KERN COUNTY HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT 
A HUMAN EYE.  No movement, no deviation of the iris.  A fixed stare.  The catatonic Stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists cuffed to the frame.  An IV feeds him fluids and monitors report his vital signs.  As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.  Novak, Ramsey and Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR. MILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an opthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes.  He pulls away and checks the ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox. 
REID Minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  And here, the anterior cingulate cortex. (to Novak and Ramsey) It's what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli. 
RAMSEY What the hell does that mean? 
TEDDY LEE (answering for Reid) He's schizophrenic. 
Novak doesn't like this.  Not one bit. 
RAMSEY What're you doing here, Reid?  Paving the way for his insanity defense? 
REID No need.  There won't be a trial.  This is no act.  The coma is real. 
RAMSEY Whoa.  Wait a minute. 
REID You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction? 
Clearly not. 
John tries to keep his composure, but Novak's making this tough for him.  Novak wants the scientists to see, to understand the boy's pain. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) Each tape is the same.  He provides food, drinking water, a toilet. Periodically, a shower starts.  It's on some kind of timer - he's clever with machines, building things.  I think he wants them to believe this is a simple kidnapping.  That there's a possibility of rescue.  Of survival.  But it's just a form of torture.  At the end of the fortieth hour, the drain shuts.  The water starts and doesn't stop. (gravely) We've already lost more than a day.  If she isn't found tonight.  She dies like the rest. 
COOPERMAN (to Miriam, Henry and Catherine) John and Ella Baines - as well as the Sunerset Board of Directors - have given their approval, but the decision is yours. 
MIRIAM What about the legalities of this...? 
NOVAK Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights. 
HENRY So what you're asking us to do is illegal? 
NOVAK No, not at all. (explains) We're dealing with exigent circumstances.  Somewhere there's a kidnapped woman still alive.  If we weigh the suspect's Constitutional Rights against the public safety. The Law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway.  It's called the Public Safety Exception. 
COOPERMAN So what can you do? 
NOVAK Pretty much anything we want.  There's a chance to save a human life.  Because of that, Stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy. 
Miriam, Henry and Cooperman appear to be onboard.  Novak's made a persuasive, heartfelt argument.  Only one person still remains uncertain. 
CATHERINE What if...? 
All eyes turn to her. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go? 
NOVAK As far as I needed. 
Catherine nods, analyzes Novak's eyes, gestures, body language, and "interrogates" him. 
CATHERINE Do you think he'd tell you what you need to know? 
John's discomfort is increasing and Novak is sensitive to it. 
NOVAK There's always a chance they'll confess. 
CATHERINE Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same? 
NOVAK Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why. (focusing on Catherine) Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but (clarifies) Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that... 
CATHERINE Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am. 
RAMSEY Is it possible? 
CATHERINE If he came to trust me, yes, but it takes months to build that kind of trust.  Someone like Stargher can't distinguish between fantasy and reality. It's all the same.  He might tell me she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one hundred percent believe it to be true, but she's... 
JOHN (O.S.) Julia. 
They turn to John Tracy.  His vulnerable, barely audible voice forcing everyone to listen. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Not "she."  Julia.  Not thing, or it, or her.  Do you know anything about her? Do you know what we've been through? Julia is everything to me.  Can you say that about anyone? 
Catherine hangs her head.  And finds herself looking at photograph of the girl in question.  A smiling Julia Hickson looking right at her. 
WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  POUNDING REVERBERATIONS... 
EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY 
WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  A HELICOPTER descends onto the pad. A stretcher is removed from the side door of the helicopter. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - VARIOUS/TRAVELLING - DAY 
The STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST through the corridors by an FBI escort team. 
NOVAK I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with. 
CATHERINE I realize that... 
NOVAK How hard could it be...? 
Catherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter. 
CATHERINE The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened? 
MIRIAM Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. 
CATHERINE Like a New Year's Day hangover. 
MIRIAM He needs to be turned over. 
Novak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach. 
NOVAK This man is deeply disturbed, he... 
CATHERINE You don't know the procedure. 
NOVAK I know him. 
MIRIAM That may be true, but you don't have Catherine's gift.  She... (distracted by Stargher's back) What happened here? 
We see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES. 
RAMSEY We removed eight metal rings. 
Miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh. 
CATHERINE Then he should like this. 
Catherine connects Stargher to the SUSPENSION APPARATUS and it HOISTS him off the table. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) They're comforted by the feeling of weightlessness.  Like floating in water. 
Henry catches Ramsey poking his nose near a THIRD SUIT AND APPARATUS in the dressing area. 
HENRY Don't touch that, please. 
RAMSEY Sorry. 
Miriam prepares a series of CHEMICAL CARTRIDGES and loads them into a container connected to the IV-like tubes linked to the suspension device. 
MIRIAM (intimate, quiet) This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so. 
CATHERINE I'll be fine. 
MIRIAM She said convincingly. 
Catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary connections.  Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring station.  She "locks down" the procedure room and joins Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console. 
NOVAK (eyes on the chemical/drug monitors) That's the stuff? 
HENRY About twelve years of research, right Miriam? 
MIRIAM Don't remind me. 
RAMSEY What is it - are they - exactly? 
That's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket. 
Catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she moves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or doors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes her way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters. 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM 
A mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the floor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck.  This sweet animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and Catherine approaches with respect. 
CATHERINE Hello? 
The frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over.  Catherine allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) Yeah, you like that, don't you? 
She can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at her from the shadows. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) Is your name Carl? 
The boy - YOUNG STARGHER - is startled and intrigued by the question - How did she know that?! - but says nothing. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) Another little boy I know, he has a horse, too. 
The boy reacts to an unusual SOUND coming from the CEILING. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) His name's Edward.  The boy, not the horse... 
The boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than "connecting" with Catherine.  Very anxiously, he looks at the wall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen TIMER click down. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) What's the matter, Carl? 
Again, a sharp SOUND from the ceiling. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) What's wro---? 
Young Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard!  Catherine FALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the ceiling!  Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse into four clean sections.  They separate and compact the quadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected horse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare barely acknowledged what happened.  Betraying no emotion, the boy runs.  The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect herself, then gives chase. 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE LABYRINTH 
Young Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but Catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She runs, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and disoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she drops to her knees and "cools down."  She hears a NOISE nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM connected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an almost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs of "traps" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls the mechanism and quickly steps back. 
The shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive in the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow, hiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves out of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE. 
Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS! 
Catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT THE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! She brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and SMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor like a rag doll. 
Victim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the core.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of Stargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled with IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing intensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young Stargher silently observing... 
Sitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S OTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in Stargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine Inch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the "harem." INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE CORE 
VICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job done, crawls away. 
Groggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up.  Unbeknownst to her, she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the kind of THRONE.  And someone is there.  In the dim pool of light above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. The wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he descends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL RINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as the man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. Unable to stop herself, she turns.  And sees the terrifying face of STARGHER.  But no the same Stargher. 
This is STARGHER KING. 
STARGHER KING (primitive, guttural) Where you come from priddy thing? 
In a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Apparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated, Novak sits cross-legged on the floor, shoes off, analyzing RECENT PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTS sent to him via courier. Ignoring a snoring Ramsey napping on a nearby cot, Novak looks at blow-ups from the videos, blueprints of Stargher's house, detailed shots of the basement, and a draftsman's conceptual drawing of the cell itself. 
HENRY (V.O.) Gentlemen? 
A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center. He's about to ask the staff for help, but stops when he sees through the window to Edward's room. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM 
Catherine sits next to the boy's bed, holding Edward's hand, softly singing a lullaby (to him, to herself).  Feeling that he must speak to her, Novak intervenes. 
NOVAK Edward Baines, I presume. (to the catatonic child) Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete. 
CATHERINE Do you think that's funny? 
NOVAK No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right? 
Catherine nods.  Novak picks up Edward's fallen teddy bear and rests it in the crook of the child's arm. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that... 
CATHERINE It doesn't have much to do with science. 
NOVAK What then? 
CATHERINE The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it. 
NOVAK Ah, the part of us that can't be explained. 
She appreciates his understanding.  And finds herself comforted by his presence.  Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his intensity, his honesty, his complexity.  And asks: 
CATHERINE Agent Novak? 
NOVAK Peter, okay? 
CATHERINE Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people? 
The question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to answer.  Anything to get her talking. 
NOVAK Absolutely. (realizing it's too personal) I suppose everyone does. 
CATHERINE Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share. 
NOVAK That's what therapists are for, right? 
Catherine laughs.  It helps her relax.  If only slightly. 
CATHERINE During the sessions.  When I'm inside. I see those things.  What a person hides, what they despite, what they want to control.  With Stargher... 
This is difficult for her. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) With Stargher I saw things... 
NOVAK What did you see? 
CATHERINE (professionally) A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing. (uncomfortable; re: Edward) I don't want to talk in here. 
She kisses Edward's forehead and exits. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY 
Catherine and Novak sit on a bench in the center of the courtyard.  John Tracy is visible in the reception area, unable to sleep, desperately trying to fight frustration. 
CATHERINE Why'd you bring him here? 
NOVAK You're the shrink, you tell me. 
CATHERINE (already knows) As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me. 
NOVAK Yes.  I am. 
Catherine realizes that was a confession. 
RAMSEY (O.S.) Where the hell you been? 
They turn to see Ramsey. 
NOVAK Right here. 
RAMSEY Next time, tell me, okay? 
NOVAK But you looked so cute.  All sleepy... 
Ramsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks Catherine. 
RAMSEY Your colleagues want to know what to do with Stargher. 
Novak looks to Catherine for the answer.  Through the window blinds, she watches John Tracy lower his head. 
CATHERINE Tell them to prep him.  And that I'll be right there. 
Ramsey nods and heads back to the lab. 
NOVAK Thank you. 
Briefly, he touches her hand.  Catherine looks away from John to Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall.  Stargher's house, Valentine, the pick-up truck.  Valentine... 
CATHERINE I need something. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CORRIDOR - DAY 
A K-9 UNIT FBI AGENT escorts VALENTINE to the lab. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY 
As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection." Slowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and removes his leash and muzzle.  She strokes him and the dog instantly warms up to her. 
FBI K-9 AGENT Sure wasn't like that with me. 
Novak signs a document and the K-9 Agent exits. 
CATHERINE You're a good boy, aren't you, Valentine? 
The dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves it, Catherine and Novak following. 
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. Now taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc.  Miriam (in surgical mask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS (taken from an FBI EVIDENCE BAG) into the eight straps of flesh on his back.  When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. Catherine comforts him.  Miriam finishes her task and removes her mask. 
MIRIAM I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this. 
HENRY I think that's the whole point. 
Valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at Catherine as if asking for help.  She encourages the animal to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands. 
HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D) That's interesting. 
IN THE CONTROL ROOM, he scrutinizes the monitor showing the detailed "map" of Stargher's brain. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Increased neural activity in the frontal lobes.  Rising dopamine levels in the basal ganglia.  Ever since the dog walked in. 
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine readies herself in the "receive" apparatus.  As Stargher is lifted off the pedestal, the doors HISS shut and Valentine curls up on the floor beneath his master.  As Catherine is lifted, she smiles at the animal, then looks to Stargher. 
NOVAK (comforting and coaching her) Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is. 
MARTIN What did you do know?  You make a mess? I hate a mess. 
Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Don't lie, now, Carl. 
IN THE CLOSET, Catherine pushes, but the door won't budge. She POUNDS.  IN THE KITCHEN, we hear no sound. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Remember what I said about liars?  Liars will be punished. 
INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS 
Catherine hears the child SCREAM.  But the scream comes from behind and she spins around. 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIVING ROOM 
Young Stargher is forced to sit on the lap of an ugly MIDDLE AGED WOMAN barely wearing a man's robe.  On a nearby table are whisky, tumblers, and an ashtray filled with butts. 
WOMAN I got you a present, cutie-pie. 
She gives him a TOY DOLL.  Drunk, she hugs and kisses him. Embarrassed, the boy tries to squirm away. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) Oh no.  You're not going anywhere. 
Martin enters and sneers at the boy. 
MARTIN Go back to bed, worm. 
WOMAN It's okay, we was just. 
MARTIN Shut up, cunt. 
The woman cowers, familiar with his violent moods.  The boy hurries to his room, but Martin grabs him by the collar. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) What is that? 
He pulls the doll from the child's hands, turns to the woman, and SMACKS her across the face with it, gashing her cheek. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) You give him nothing.  Whore.  Are you his mother?  ARE YOU? 
Terrified, she shakes her head "no."  Martin sees Young Stargher quietly crawling away, hoping to escape. Martin lifts the boy off the floor with one hand and holds him in front of the woman. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) You see that?  SEE IT?  You slithered out one of them.  But where is she now, Carl?  As far from you as she could get, that's where. (shoves him at the woman) You want a mommy?  Is that what you want? 
The poor boy trembles with fear.  And Martin notices a puddle of urine on the floor.  He drops the boy and laughs. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Little worm pissed his pants. 
Humiliated, Carl covers himself and hides in a corner. Martin and the woman LAUGH AND LAUGH, delighting in the boy's humiliation. 
INT. CLOSET 
Feeling the boy's shame, Catherine turns and finds a FADED POSTCARD taped to the wall. 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BEDROOM 
Martin has discovered his son's secret hiding place - a camouflaged corner of the attic.  Arranged in deliberate, artistic fashion are scavenged DOLLS.  Heads, limbs and torsos held together with twine, tape and wire.  Some wrapped in filthy plastic.  Faded photographs (including one of his MOTHER), mementos, and most disturbingly, the feathers and bones of dead birds, insect carcasses, and dissected, desiccated mice.  There's something peculiarly beautiful here, but Martin doesn't see it.  Not at all. 
MARTIN Only girls play with dolls... 
He turns and we see Carl is bound to a wooden support beam, a piece of tape covering his mouth.  The boy is stripped to the waste, barely conscious, face streaked with tears and sweat. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) What kind of thing are you? 
Catherine cannot show her fear, not now.  She composes herself and approaches him. 
CATHERINE I want to help you, Carl. 
His grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs. 
STARGHER Help me?  That's good.  That's a good one. (malevolent) Liar.  Whore.  Cunt. 
Catherine stands her ground. 
CATHERINE You sound like your father. 
He gets close to her face and sneers. 
STARGHER I am not like him. 
Stargher retreats into the shadows, but Catherine persists. 
CATHERINE Then help me.  Where is Julia Hickson? 
STARGHER Why? 
CATHERINE Maybe, because you want to. 
STARGHER Is that right?  You think you know me? INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY 
Henry sees a rapid rise in Catherine's warning meter. 
HENRY Miriam... 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM 
A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine. 
STARGHER (O.S.) You wanna know who I am?  You stupid bitch! 
And when he emerges from shadow, Stargher is STARGHER KING. 
STARGHER KING Now shud you mouth, priddy thing, or me god slice you from the kunt to the tits. 
Catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand.  He GRABS, LIFTS and SLAMS her onto the floor, the back of her head HITTING HARD.  Her vision blurs.  Ears are ringing. 
STARGHER KING (CONT'D) Me god want you stay. 
Stargher King straddles Catherine and pins her arms behind her back.  She's unable to touch the sensor.  With the tip of the TOOL he traces a line from her pelvis up the center of her suit. 
STARGHER KING (CONT'D) Me god mek you beaudiful... 
He shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger. A COLLAR CLAMPS SHUT around Catherine's neck and... 
She blacks out. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY 
A SENSOR ALARM SOUNDS on the computer.  Henry and Miriam express shock at the sight of the monitor peaking in the red and move to the "map" of Catherine's mind.  As it becomes "cool," Stargher's becomes "hot." 
MIRIAM Son of a bitch! 
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, VALENTINE BARKS!  Startling everyone. The dog GROWLS and backs away.  As if he senses something horribly wrong within his master. 
IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Novak questions the scientists. 
NOVAK When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out. 
HENRY We should hurry. 
Miriam walks Novak through what's about to happen. 
MIRIAM The first five minutes will be disorienting.  Give yourself time.  Let the drugs do the work.  If you can see, smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're on the right track.  Once you've acclimated, try to get a feeling for Catherine.  Instinct plays a huge role in this.  Trust it. 
She gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and shuts the door.  IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Miriam continues via intercom. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) You can control how you see yourself - clothes, shoes, that kind of thing - but the rest of it is up to him.  Use only what he provides.  Don't try to change anything.  Or introduce something of your own.  It'll only upset him. 
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak flexes his fingers and sees the little bump beneath his flesh. 
HENRY (O.S.) Agent Novak?  Press the sensor. 
Novak does and the red light comes on.  As Novak is LIFTED, he looks at Catherine, then Stargher.  Valentine YIPS and settles beneath Novak.  The suspension device clicks into place and the MASK descends. 
MIRIAM (O.S.) No matter what happens, Peter, remember one thing: It's not real. 
Novak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like cylinder.  A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. Preparing the mixture for injection. 
The viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA MOVES INTO THE MIXTURE.  As blood and chemical swirls take shape, we MOVE FAST.  Deeper into the fluid at a molecular level.  We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid landscape. 
NOVAK HYPERVENTILATES.  He's having difficulty making the 98 transition. 
Flying faster, faster, faster.  Through an entire universe. 
Novak is in the procedure room.  Alone.  His face contorted as if feeling the effects of tremendous G-FORCE. 
ENTRANCE THREE 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD 
CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills.  THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their bodies positioned in a uniform pattern.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL NOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak breathes deeply and rises to his knees.  His hand moves to his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the gravel, the sharpness of it against his face.  Removing the shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes it. 
MOTHER ONE (O.S.) Have you seen him? 
Novak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S MOTHER - addressing him.  She, like the other two, speaks in a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion. 
MOTHER ONE (CONT'D) My boy, my little one.  His father took him from me.  Have you seen him? 
As she continues, almost mantra-like, WOMAN TWO BEGINS: 
MOTHER TWO (similar monotone) My child is an abomination.  He is damned.  He has no soul. 
The women's repetitive "monologues" overlap.  Aurual layers now added by THREE. 
MOTHER THREE Me god me boy.  Me god good son. 
Novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings.  The sights, sounds and feel of the place.  Like being within a dream.  As he backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances across his face.  Shading his eyes.  Novak searches for the source. 
Opposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL.  A massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows."  Like a star, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of MIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall. 
The light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to CLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly infinite passages.  Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a mausoleum.  Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. Fades.  And Novak crawls into darkness. 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN 
Novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. The place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty.  As he moves deeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched atop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror LOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of the room 
The FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the darkness.  It is Catherine.  Altered to an image of Stargher's victims.  Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just like the Victims'.  It's a shocking, strange image, made even more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face.  Novak is staggered by the sight.  His vision and hearing become affected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to clarity as he reminds himself... 
NOVAK Not real... 
Like an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him, narrowing her eyes. 
Catherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from which Novak gained access.  He stops, ready to press the sensor, when a FLICKER OF LIGHT dances across Catherine's face. 
CATHERINE Wait... 
NOVAK Like hell "wait." 
But she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she moves further from the den toward the cliff face.  The FLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL. 
CATHERINE He wants us to follow.  The little boy... 
NOVAK Little boy?!  That's him! 
CATHERINE He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him. 
INT. TUNNEL/CUBBYHOLE 
On her hands and knees, she enters the TUNNEL, not waiting for him to respond.  She knows what he'll do... Catherine and Novak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space, playing with his mirror locket. 
CATHERINE Carl... 
He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) This is Peter. 
Scared, he shakes his head "no." 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) Don't be scared.  You're my friend and I would never hurt you. 
She extends her hand.  Oh-so-hesitantly he takes it. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) Will you take us to her?  To Julia? 
Shyly, hesitantly, he nods.  She smiles gratefully and affectionately touches the boy's face.  Clasping her hand, Young Stargher leads Catherine and Novak into utter darkness. 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE IDEALIZED CELL 
More stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately decorated, with the atmosphere of a church.  Individual IMAGES hang like SHRINES, each showing Julia Hickson from different angles. 
Central to the room is a WINDOW INTO THE CELL ITSELF.  Where we find a beautiful, mermaid-like JULIA HICKSON floating in water.  Peaceful, joyous. 
IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, we find Novak and Catherine, she holding the hand of Young Stargher, he stunned at the sight of Julia.  The child looks at Catherine with beatific, sad eyes, regarding her as one would a saviour. 
NOVAK Where the hell are we? 
CATHERINE Carl, do you know?  Like on a map... 
He shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) It's okay, it's okay.  You helped so much already.  I'm proud of you. 
As a frustrated Novak searches for anything identifying, Catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad, haunted eyes. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) Carl, I think I can help you.  Would you like that?  Even if Peter can't find Julia, I want to help you. 
The boy leans against her and she caresses his face. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) I promise. 
Novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell. Mounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque reading CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, with a logo.  Novak recognizes it from the hoist in Stargher's basement. 
NOVAK Let's go. 
He pulls her to her feet.  Feeling betrayed and rejected, the child breaks away from her.  THE ROAR OF STARGHER KING shakes the cell.  Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide. 
STARGHER KING (still speaking as Martin) Shut up cunt. (to the boy) Give it here, worm... 
the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking to Catherine for guidance. 
STARGHER KING (CONT'D) (as Martin) You want a mommy?  Is that what you want? 
In an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to adult Stargher. 
STARGHER Enough. 
And he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart.  For a brief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher King's.  Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with sad, troubled eyes. 
MARTIN (as Stargher King) Why?  What'd I do?... 
Stargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher King drops dead.   Dead.  Young Stargher smiles and hugs Catherine. 
YOUNG STARGHER Time to go 'way. 
CATHERINE Carl...? 
The boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his arms and holds him close. 
YOUNG STARGHER Bye. 
She looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand.  He descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his shoulder. 
STARGHER KING Thank you, Catherine.  You did help me. More than you'll ever know. 
Man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface.  Catherine stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. And FADE FROM VIEW. 
CATHERINE Goodbye Carl. 
She presses the sensor in her hand. 
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY 
IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Miriam is shocked by what she sees on the monitors and looks at Stargher. 
MIRIAM He's in full arrest. 
Catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is automatically lowered.  She pulls the mask from her face, rises and opens the door.  Miriam races inside and desperately attempts to revive Stargher.  But it's no use. Angry and stunned, she demands of Catherine. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) Help me! 
But Catherine chooses not to.  She knows Carl Stargher will never return to the world of the living. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
The chopper roars across the sky.  As they head northeast, away from the urban and toward the rural, Novak gazes out the window, trying to stay focused, fighting any after-effects of the drugs.  The pilot communicates via headset. 
PILOT Agent Novak?  Go ahead. 
NOVAK Cole? 
EXT. STARGHER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting Suburbans.  (INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER). 
COLE The hoist was manufactured by Carver Industrial Equipment in 1982.  Serial number 117-337J.  Purchased by a boat shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992... 
INT. THE CELL - DAY 
The water is near the ceiling.  Kicking her legs to keep afloat, Julia DIGS with the ring and we see she has created a gap between the light fixture housing and an unused PIPE leading to the surface.  She pushes, but can't get anything to move.  The opening will get no bigger.  Julia sucks the last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell. Searching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out the drinking straw.

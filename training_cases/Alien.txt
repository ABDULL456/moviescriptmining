SYNOPSIS 
En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language, originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet. 
Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers. 
Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries- old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and cannot be removed. 
An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not kill it on the ship. 
Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship, and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose on the ship. 
A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's bizarre life cycle. 
Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

FADE IN: 
EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future. 
Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic machinery chuckles softly to itself. 
Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken. Circuits close, lights blink on. 
CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal: 
INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT 
A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid. 
Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers. 
FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the freezers pop open. 
Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up. 
ROBY Oh... God... am I cold... 
BROUSSARD Is that you, Roby? 
ROBY I feel like shit... 
BROUSSARD Yeah, it's you all right. 
Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering. 
FAUST (groans) Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead. 
BROUSSARD You look dead. 
MELKONIS The vampires rise from their graves. 
This draws a few woozy chuckles. 
BROUSSARD (shakes his fist in the air triumphantly) We made it! 
HUNTER (not fully awake) Is it over? 
STANDARD It's over, Hunter. 
HUNTER (yawning) Boy, that's terrific. 
STANDARD (looking around with a grin) Well, how does it feel to be rich men? 
ROBY (punches buttons) Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message? 
COMPUTER (a mechanical voice) I have interrupted the course of the voyage. 
ROBY What?  Why? 
COMPUTER I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise. 
STANDARD Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about? 
COMPUTER I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin. 
STANDARD A transmission? 
COMPUTER A voice transmission. 
MELKONIS Out here? 
The men exchange glances. 
COMPUTER I have recorded the transmission. 
STANDARD Play it for us, please. 
Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls silent. 
The men all stare at each other in amazement. 
STANDARD Computer, what language was that? 
COMPUTER Unknown. 
ROBY Unknown!  What do you mean? 
COMPUTER It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man. 
There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME. 
STANDARD (silencing them) Just hold it, hold it! (glares around the room) Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission? 
COMPUTER Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate. 
ROBY Oh my God. 
STANDARD Well, it's finally happened. 
MELKONIS First contact... 
STANDARD Sandy, can you home in on that beam? 
MELKONIS What's the frequency? 
STANDARD Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission? 
COMPUTER 65330 dash 99. 
Melkonis punches buttons. 
MELKONIS I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds. 
STANDARD Dell -- show me that on a screen. 
BROUSSARD I'll give it to you on number four. 
Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen. 
BROUSSARD (CONT'D) That's it.  Let me straighten it out. 
He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in the center. 
STANDARD Can you get it a little closer? 
BROUSSARD That's what I'm going to do. 
He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS. 
BROUSSARD (CONT'D) Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers. 
MELKONIS It's tiny! 
STANDARD Any rotation? 
BROUSSARD Yeah.  Two hours. 
STANDARD Gravity? 
BROUSSARD Point eight six.  We can walk on it. 
Standard rises. 
BROUSSARD Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission. 
STANDARD What's the terrain down there? 
BROUSSARD Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain. 
STANDARD Is it solid? 
BROUSSARD It's... basalt.  Rock. 
STANDARD Then take her down. 
BROUSSARD Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams. 
There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders. 
ROBY Locked. 
BROUSSARD Kill drive engines. 
The engines fall silent. 
ROBY Engines off. 
BROUSSARD Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen. 
EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT 
The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly. 
Landing struts unfold like insect legs. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
BROUSSARD And we're... down. 
EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT 
The ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
The whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT. 
BROUSSARD Jesus Christ! 
The lights come back on again. 
STANDARD What the hell happened? 
ROBY (hits a switch) Engine room, what happened? 
FAUST (over, filtered) Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking. 
ROBY Has the hull been breached? 
BROUSSARD Uh... (scans his gauges) No, I don't see anything.  We've still got pressure. 
There is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then: 
FAUST (over, filtered) Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell. 
STANDARD (strikes his panel) Damn it!  How long to fix? 
ROBY (into microphone) How long to fix? 
FAUST (over, filtered) Hard to say. 
ROBY Well, get started. 
FAUST (over, filtered) Right.  Talk to you. 
STANDARD Let's take a look outside.  Turn the screens back on. 
Melkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black. 
BROUSSARD Can't see a blessed thing. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT 
Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute darkness around it. 
THE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING LIGHTS. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT 
STANDARD Kick on the floods. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT 
STANDARD Any microorganisms? 
ROBY Not a one.  It's dead. 
STANDARD Anything else? 
ROBY Yeah, rock particles.  Dust. 
STANDARD Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source? 
MELKONIS No problem. 
BROUSSARD I volunteer for the exploration party. 
STANDARD I heard you.  You want to break out the side arms? 
INTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DAY 
Standard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock.  They all wear gloves, boots, jackets, and pistols. 
Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut, sealing them into the lock. 
They all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks. 
STANDARD (adjusting the radio on his mask) I'm sending.  Do you hear me? 
BROUSSARD Receiving. 
MELKONIS Receiving. 
STANDARD All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me? 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
ROBY Read you, Chaz. 
INTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY 
STANDARD Open the outer door. 
Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE WIND OUTSIDE. 
A mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it hits the ground. 
Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others. 
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY 
The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet. Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock. 
The men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at their clothes.  Nothing can be seen. 
STANDARD Which way, Sandy? 
Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder. 
MELKONIS (pointing) That way. 
STANDARD You lead. 
Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the others. 
STANDARD Okay, Martin.  We're on our way. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a screen. 
ROBY Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board. 
STANDARD (over, filtered) Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open. 
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY 
The three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and shrieking wind.  With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements, they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean. 
Melkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction finder. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Can't see more than three meters in any direction out here.  We're walking blind, on instruments. 
They wade on, following Melkonis.  Abruptly he halts. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) What's wrong? 
MELKONIS My signal's fading. 
He studies the direction finder. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
They all peer up the hole into darkness. 
STANDARD Climbing gear. 
Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it. He aims it up into the hole and fires. 
The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles. 
BROUSSARD I'll go first. 
STANDARD No, you'll follow me. 
Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the hole, using his feet for leverage where he can. 
Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit. 
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP 
This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the hole. 
Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a beam through the hanging dust. 
Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole. 
THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes. 
Broussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it. 
It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings. Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is empty. 
Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON, SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR. 
They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS A GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM. 
MELKONIS Holy Christ... 
Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton is seated.  He moves his light closer and peers at the panel. 
STANDARD Look at this... 
They approach. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Something has been scratched here... into the veneer.  See? 
Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a sharp instrument, is a small triangle: 
Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES. 
Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol. 
MELKONIS LOOK OUT, IT MOVED! 
Standard knocks his hand down. 
STANDARD Keep away from that gun! 
Standard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he begins to move toward the far side of the room. 
They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it. There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Just machinery. 
BROUSSARD But functioning. 
Melkonis looks down at his direction finder. 
MELKONIS That's where the transmission is coming from. 
He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones. 
BROUSSARD A recording.  A damned automatic recording. 
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET 
SINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK.  As we watch, the sunlight turns the color of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its wake.  The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly combatting the darkness and the storm. 
INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM 
The entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching holographic pictures projected onto a screen.  These are photos taken by their "datasticks" (flashlight/cameras). 
Standard is commenting on the changing slides. 
STANDARD ... This is the control room... 
Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) ... Some details of the control room... 
The SKELETON appears on the screen.  The men react with mutters. 
Standard appears in the doorway. 
STANDARD Alas, poor Yorick. 
Roby STARTS, puts down the skull.  Standard sits at the table. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) (nodding at the screen) Find anything we missed? 
ROBY (shrugs) I don't even know what I'm looking for. 
STANDARD Still worried? 
ROBY Oh well... you know me. 
STANDARD I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me. 
Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY DRAWN TRIANGLE ON THE ALIEN CONTROL PANEL. 
ROBY What would you say that was supposed to mean? 
STANDARD Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them... 
ROBY But why draw it on the wall? 
Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily. 
He rises and goes to the coffee machine. 
ROBY (CONT'D) (picking a hair out of the coffeepot) This ship is full of cat hair. 
STANDARD Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed -- 
BEEP!  The communicator interrupts Standard.  He leans across and presses the button. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) This is Chaz. 
BROUSSARD (over, filtered) Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute? 
STANDARD What's up? 
BROUSSARD (over, filtered) Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see. 
STANDARD I'm on my way. 
He and Roby head for the door. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive. 
STANDARD What is it? 
BROUSSARD Take a look. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY 
The dust no longer blows.  The day is crisp, clear, and silent. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
BROUSSARD I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen. 
STANDARD What is it, I can't -- 
BLIP!  Broussard enlarges the image. 
The screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon. 
They all stare at the image for a long moment.  The silhouette of the PYRAMID IS INSTANTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE SCRAWLED TRIANGLE in the alien ship. 
Standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille. 
STANDARD This is Chaz.  All hands topside. Now. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 
ANGLE ON A VIEWSCREEN.  It shows the PYRAMID on the horizon.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the room. 
STANDARD Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there? 
MELKONIS That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it... 
BROUSSARD Maybe they built it. 
FAUST As what? 
BROUSSARD A marker for buried instrumentation? 
HUNTER Or a mass grave. 
Another PAUSE as he listens to the earphone. 
ROBY (CONT'D) Well come on, come on!  What does it say? 
Another PAUSE.  Roby's face changes; he looks CHILLED TO THE BONE.  His mouth works. 
Abruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE. 
HUNTER (looking over at Roby) What?  What was that? 
ROBY The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning. 
EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY 
BROUSSARD Maybe we can get in by the top. 
STANDARD You want to try? 
BROUSSARD Sure. 
Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the top of the pyramid.  It catches.  He clips himself to the wire. 
BROUSSARD (CONT'D) You guys just wait down here till I say it's okay to come up. 
Broussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side of the pyramid. 
OMINOUS ANGLES showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust blowing, the wind shrieking. 
EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY 
The peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair.  Broussard arrives at the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones. 
BROUSSARD There's a hole at the top. 
EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY 
STANDARD Can we come up? 
BROUSSARD (over, filtered) No, it's too small, only room enough for one person. 
STANDARD Can you see anything in the hole? 
EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY 
Broussard leans over and looks into the hole.  He sees only blackness. 
Freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on the "flashlight" function, and shines it down into the hole. 
BROUSSARD I can see... partway down.  It just goes down like a stovepipe.  Smooth walls.  I can't see the bottom -- light won't reach. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
Faust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face. 
FAUST Yes?  What is it? 
ROBY Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability. 
FAUST (quickly) Why, what's wrong? 
ROBY The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming. 
FAUST What do you mean? 
ROBY It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it: (reads from a strip of paper) "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... " (looks up at the others) And that's all it could translate. 
EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY 
Hanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from his belt. 
STANDARD (over, filtered) Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here. 
BROUSSARD No, I want to go in. 
EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY 
Standard and Melkonis exchange a glance. 
STANDARD Okay, Dell, but just for a preliminary look-around.  Don't unhook yourself from your cable.  And be out in less than ten minutes. 
EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY 
BROUSSARD Right. 
Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end of it to his chest unit. 
He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole. 
BROUSSARD (CONT'D) Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down. 
MELKONIS Sun will be down in a minute. 
INTERIOR - TOMB - LATE AFTERNOON 
Face bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is dominated by a large, broad pedestal.  On the pedestal are ROWS OF LEATHERY URNS OR JARS, EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE BROUSSARD STUMBLED ACROSS IN THE ALIEN SHIP -- EXCEPT THESE ARE ALL SEALED. 
He walks around the urns, studying them.  They all have sealed lids.  He shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it. 
He lifts his mask radio to his lips. 
BROUSSARD I don't know if you can hear me, but the place is full of large bottles or jars, just like the one we found on the other ship -- except these are all sealed.  Also they're soft to the touch. 
He peers more closely at the leathery object. 
BROUSSARD (CONT'D) Another funny thing -- I just put my hand on it, and now there are these raised areas appearing where my fingertips were. 
EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY 
THE SUN DROPS BELOW THE HORIZON, throwing the landscape into gloom. Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights. 
STANDARD Let's go. 
He attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up. 
INTERIOR - TOMB - NIGHT 
Broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the wall.  They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters. 
He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he turns back to the "urn" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN THE TOP OF IT. 
He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn."  There lies the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside surface is spongy and irregular. 
Then he turns the light to the now-open "urn." 
He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, AND WITH SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD. 
With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the thing with his hands. 
EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT 
The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top, lights bobbing in the darkness. 
STANDARD (puffing with exertion) Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to. 
MELKONIS It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something. 
STANDARD But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact. 
MELKONIS Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes. 
Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole. 
STANDARD (making up his mind) No, I told him to be out in ten minutes.  It's been much longer. Let's get him out of there. 
Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which Broussard's line dangles. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) The line's slack.  Christ, do you think the idiot unhooked himself? 
He switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the motor slows down, laboring under the added weight. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) There, it caught! 
MELKONIS Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something? 
STANDARD No, it's coming. 
MELKONIS Can you see anything? 
Standard shines his light down into the hole. 
STANDARD No, I can't see far enough.  The line's moving, though. 
For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid, saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls. Then Standard shines his light back down in. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) I can see him!  Here he comes! 
The winch begins to LABOR HEAVILY. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Get ready to grab him! 
Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the wire.  Standard reaches for him -- then RECOILS SHARPLY. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Look out!  There's something on his face! 
Melkonis attempts to come to his aid. 
MELKONIS What is it? 
STANDARD Don't touch him, watch it! 
HUNTER (pointing) It's eating a hole in the floor! 
Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside, coughing their lungs out. 
Standard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They begin to smoke. 
Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves. Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY 
STANDARD That stuff's eating right through the metal!  It's going to eat through the decks and right out through the hull! 
By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP 
Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to the level below. 
STANDARD There!  Look! 
A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and drips to the floor. 
It bubbles on the floor. 
MELKONIS Jesus, what can we put under it? 
Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below. 
INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW 
Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at the ceiling. 
STANDARD (pointing) There.  Should be coming through about there. 
HUNTER Careful, don't get under it! 
INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE 
Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid sizzles. 
MELKONIS Christ, that stinks. 
Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the floor. 
ROBY Seems to have stopped penetrating. 
Hunter comes charging up the steps. 
HUNTER What's happening up here? 
ROBY I think it's fizzled out. 
Hunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by the end. 
MELKONIS I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid. 
HUNTER But this thing uses it for blood. 
MELKONIS Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it. 
Standard comes up the stairs. 
STANDARD It's stopped? 
MELKONIS Yes, thank heaven. 
STANDARD We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken weeks to patch it. 
MELKONIS Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans. 
ROBY My God, what about Broussard? 
They turn and run up the stairs. 
INTERIOR - INFIRMARY 
They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen). Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face. 
ROBY Did it get on him? 
Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head. 
STANDARD No, thank God... just missed him. 
MELKONIS Is it still dripping? 
STANDARD (examining it) It appears to have healed itself. 
HUNTER It makes me sick to see him like that. 
HUNTER Now we're in for it. 
STANDARD The door was closed.  It must still be in here. 
They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the door.  Standard grabs his arm. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping. 
HUNTER (very nervous) Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us -- 
STANDARD Maybe we can catch it. 
Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) As long as we're careful not to damage it... 
Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly around the room.  There are very few places to hide. 
He bends down and peers under the bunk. 
As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD. 
He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO THE FLOOR. 
STANDARD (leaping back) Shit! 
But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey. 
Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not respond. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) I think it's dead. 
With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid. 
INTERIOR - LABORATORY 
Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up. 
Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument. 
STANDARD Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him. 
ROBY Is that its mouth? 
MELKONIS More likely that organ -- the tube- like thing -- fits up in there. 
With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ. 
ROBY Ugh. 
Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS. 
STANDARD Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme something to grab it with! 
It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE. 
Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes the thing in the tongs. 
It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Christ!  Let's get it out of here! 
Carrying the thing, he heads for the door. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP 
The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK 
They come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is already on the intercom: 
ROBY (shouts into intercom) For Chrissake, open the main lock! 
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY 
Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed by the inevitable dust. 
Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all. 
EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY 
The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust, smouldering and fuming. 
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY 
The outer door rolls shut. 
ROBY (slumping against the wall) My God, it's lethal even when it's dead! 
The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Retract landing struts. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY 
The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force. The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
STANDARD Take us up. 
ROBY (into intercom) Up one kilometer, Jay. 
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY 
The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
STANDARD Switch on lifter quads. 
A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES. 
EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - DAY 
The hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking atmosphere. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
STANDARD Engage artificial gravity. 
Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES. 
ROBY Engaged. 
STANDARD Let's take her into an escape orbit. 
The men get busy with switches. 
ROBY I'm altering our vector now; should give us an easy escape velocity -- 
A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP. 
ROBY & MELKONIS (in concert) What was that? 
In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS. 
FAUST (over, filtered) This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again! 
STANDARD Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all! 
The pitch of the engines changes, deepens. 
EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY 
The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds. Visibility is zero. 
INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM 
Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to suck up some of the dust. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim, set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically they mutter technical instructions to each other. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY 
Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE 
They all CHEER. 
ROBY (pounds his panel) We made it!  Damn, we made it! 
STANDARD You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive. 
ROBY With great pleasure. 
Roby begins to punch buttons. 
MELKONIS I feel like an escapee from Hell. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER 
The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the universe all around. 
ROBY Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs. 
STANDARD Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean. 
FAUST I kind of like it. 
ROBY You like this shit? 
FAUST It grows on you. 
ROBY You know what they make this stuff out of? 
FAUST (annoyed) Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  You're eating it. 
ROBY I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all. 
HUNTER Do we have to talk about this kind of crap at the dinner table? 
Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS. 
STANDARD What's wrong? 
BROUSSARD (his voice straining) I don't know... I'm getting these CRAMPS! 
The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips. He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles whitening. 
STANDARD Breathe deeply. 
BROUSSARD (screaming) OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD! 
ROBY What Dell -- what? 
Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is trembling violently from head to foot. 
BROUSSARD (incoherent shriek) OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!! 
A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC. 
THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT. 
Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and bolts. 
The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground. 
When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped. Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest, spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime. 
HUNTER Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
FAUST What was that?  What the Christ was that? 
MELKONIS It was growing in him the whole time and he didn't even know it! 
Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse. 
ROBY That thing used him for an incubator! 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped body tumbles silently out. 
AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into eternity. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge. 
MELKONIS We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose. 
HUNTER We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers. 
ROBY But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space. 
FAUST Shit... 
STANDARD We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship. 
MELKONIS (sighs) Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting. 
STANDARD We've got about a week left, right? 
HUNTER And then we run out of food and oxygen. 
FAUST The water will still recycle. 
ROBY We won't need it then. 
STANDARD All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time. 
ROBY But if we haven't caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway. 
ROBY Now what? 
STANDARD What do you think?  Now we go in. 
Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows out. 
INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM 
The room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in their gasmasks. 
The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered all over the floor. 
FAUST Looks like he helped himself. 
Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised. 
Then Hunter points. 
HUNTER God damn it. 
They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN. 
HUNTER (CONT'D) It escaped. 
They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it. 
ROBY Where does that go? 
FAUST All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure. 
STANDARD Then let's go and do it. 
They head for the door. 
HUNTER Have we got any food at all left in the ship? 
They slam the door shut and seal it. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of ventilator shafts. 
FAUST That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end -- 
HUNTER -- And the cooling unit on the other. 
STANDARD So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out. 
FAUST Poison gas... 
HUNTER We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship! 
STANDARD The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out. 
ROBY Are you crazy? 
STANDARD The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him. 
FAUST How about a flamethrower?  That wouldn't poison the air. 
MELKONIS So one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along -- 
STANDARD While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net. 
HUNTER Sounds like a rough one. 
STANDARD Got a better idea? 
Hunter shrugs. 
ROBY So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft? 
STANDARD Let's be democratic. 
He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a tiny little ball. 
He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table like dice. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Martin, take one. 
Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank. 
Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank. 
Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They are both blank. 
They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Open it up, Cleave. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK 
FAUST (whispering) It's in the main air lock.  Blow the lock. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH. 
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK 
With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK 
The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK- HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR. 
FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST, crushing him to a thickness of about three inches. 
On the wall, a green light goes on: 
"INNER DOOR CLOSED" 
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK 
Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN. IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into the vacuum under pressure. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is sucked out toward the lock. 
A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES: 
"CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION" 
After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control room. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways, as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along by the air current. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance, HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR. 
Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running again. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK 
Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound is a DEAFENING WHISTLE. 
Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT. 
Done in, he collapses to the floor. 
Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD -- THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses bleed. 
They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks. 
Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others follow him. 
INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM 
The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks. 
Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully. 
Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up. 
ROBY How much oxygen did we lose? 
Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges. 
STANDARD We've got six hours left. 
HUNTER (groans) Oh my God. 
STANDARD Does anybody know what happened? 
HUNTER Which explosive should we use? 
STANDARD I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're portable, and they can be radio detonated. 
Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like broomhandles, with tiny printing on them. 
Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches one of them. 
ROBY You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it. 
STANDARD Here, carry these. 
Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles. 
ROBY (grabbing at him) Hey watch it! 
STANDARD (grinning) It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it. 
They begin to carry the explosives up the steps. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR 
The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS. 
HUNTER Hold it! 
They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and points the tracker around. 
HUNTER (CONT'D) (nodding up some steps) Up there. 
They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks up the flamethrower. 
ROBY So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now? 
STANDARD Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space. 
Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps. 
INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL 
Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps. Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes. 
Then he continues up. 
EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE 
The view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again. 
Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass periodically. 
STANDARD (shouts) You can come up!  It's safe! 
The others come up the steps. 
ROBY (spying the corpse) Oh -- Jesus -- 
Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in. 
STANDARD The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back. 
HUNTER (horrified) Should we go outside and bring him in? 
STANDARD No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing. 
Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes. 
INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP 
The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat. 
The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat. 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more. 
STANDARD (pointing) Along the base of the walls there. 
They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly. 
HUNTER This should do it. 
ROBY I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it. 
STANDARD It will be. 
HUNTER (surveys the craft uneasily) What we really need is some red meat in here for bait. 
ROBY Well, if we had some, I'd eat it. I'm starting to get hungry. 
ROBY Hello?  Standard?  Hunter? 
He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his expression that he expects none. 
He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has managed to summon a certain amount of resolve. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP 
Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He picks it up, substituting it for the pistol. 
Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps into the maintenance level. 
INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL 
Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he sees that he is standing on a square metal plate. 
Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate, revealing a black opening with a ladder going down. 
Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder. 
INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM 
Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal ladder to the floor. 
THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH, PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES. 
Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it. 
HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating. 
Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF STANDARD IS INSIDE IT. 
Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps violently. 
STANDARD (a feeble whisper) Kill me... 
ROBY (sickened) What did it do to you? 
STANDARD (moves his head slightly) Look... 
Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE THE SPORES IN THE TOMB. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) (whispering) That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... 
ROBY (looking around for a tool) I'll get you out of there. 
STANDARD No... don't... 
ROBY But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc! 
STANDARD No good... it's eaten too much of me... 
ROBY (in horror) What can I do? 
STANDARD Kill me... 
Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and scrambles back up the ladder. 
INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL 
Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up. At length, he regains control of himself. 
EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED 
The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters rolling past in the infinite distance. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a little oxygen tank on it. 
ROBY Kitty go bye-bye. 
He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in front.  It YOWLS. 
He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge. 
INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY 
Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal cannisters. 
ROBY (reading from labels) What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of it.  This'll buy us an island on some nice planet. 
Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries back up the steps. 
INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM 
Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine room, containing the massive stardrive engines. 
He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one by one. 
He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button. 
EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK." 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship. 
EXTERIOR - SPACE 
The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly circumstances. 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches his head down over it. 
EXTERIOR - SPACE 
The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind, until it is barely a point of light. 
THEN IT BLOWS UP. 
AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS. 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling everything inside.  Then all is quiet. 
Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed in orange light. 
EXTERIOR - SPACE 
What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past. 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of his ship and friends. 
BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG. 
The cat SCREECHES. 
Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm. 
It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby. 
His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit, with the door standing open. 
He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes. 
It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut. 
INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER 
There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity. 
Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it. 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER. 
It picks up the catbox in its tentacles. 
INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER 
Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE GLASS. 
But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the glass, startling the hell out of Roby. 
Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the catbox. 
Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull it on. 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS. 
INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER 
Roby is halfway into the pressure suit. 
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT 
The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it into a crevice in the wall. 
With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.

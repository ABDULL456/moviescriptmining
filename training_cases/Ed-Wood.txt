ED (on phone) Hello, Mr. Weiss?  I heard about your new project and was curious if you signed a director.  Oh -- you haven't?  Well, if we could get together, I could explain why I'm more qualified to direct this than anyone else in town. (beat) Uh, I'd rather not go into it over the phone...  Alright.  Great!  l'll see you then! 
Ed hangs up and YELPS excitedly.  He kisses Dolores.  She pulls away. 
DOLORES Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story? 
ED (nervous, he lies) Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LOW-RENT HALLWAY - DAY 
Ed walks jauntily along, wearing a snappy suit.  He reaches a door that says "SCREEN CLASSICS ó George Weiss, President." Ed fixes his hair, checks his clothes, then enters. 
INT. SCREEN CLASSICS ó SAME TIME 
It's a crowded root, piled with paperwork and files.  Film cans are stacked everywhere, and framed oneósheets for "TEST TUBE BABIES," "BLONDE PICKUP" and "GIRL GANG" litter the cracked walls.  Sitting behind the messy desk is GEORGIE WEISS, 60, a rug merchant turned exploitation film producer.  He juggles a large sandwich and angrily barks into the phone. 
GEORGIE (on phone) Look, when I said you could have the western territories, I didn't mean all eleven states!  I meant California, Oregon, and uh, what's that one above it... Washington.  Oh really?!  Well screw you! 
Georgie slams down the phone.  He smiles warmly at Ed. 
GEORGIE Can I help you? 
ED Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture. 
GEORGIE Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky. 
ED (disappointed) So you're not gonna make the movie? 
GEORGIE No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it. 
Georgie bites into his sandwich.  Ed is dazed. 
ED Is there a script? 
GEORGIE Fuck no!  But there's a poster. 
Georgie pulls out artwork of a hermaphrodite: Man on the left side, woman on the right.  The lettering screams, "I CHANGED MY SEX!" 
GEORGIE It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa. 
ED (mustering up his courage) Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism. 
GEORGIE Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications." 
Ed takes a measured piuse.  This is his big revelation. 
ED Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job. (he gulps) I like to dress in women's clothing. 
GEORGIE Are you a fruit? 
ED No, no, not at all!  I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them. 
GEORGIE So you're not a fruit? 
ED Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2. (beat) 'Course, I was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform. 
GEORGIE You gotta be kiddin' me. 
ED Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret. 
Georgie sits back.  It's a hell of a story. 
GEORGIE And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie? 
ED Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out. 
Georgie shrugs. 
GEORGIE Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but look around you... (he gestures at the posters) I don't hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories. I make movies like "Chained Girls." I need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days that'll make me a profit. (beat) I'm sorry.  That's all that matters. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BAR ó DAY 
Ed sits morosely in a scuzzy bar, three empty shot glasses in front of him.  A BARTENDER ambles over. 
BARTENDER Are you gonna get something else? 
Ed glumly empties his pocket.  All he has is change.  Ed sighs, and staggers out. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY 
Ed shuffles down the street, his head hanging low.  A restaurant door opens, and an EISENHOWER ERA NUCLEAR FAMILY exits.  Whitebread Dad, Mom, Son, and Daughter stride out in their starched clean clothes. 
They march obliviously past Ed.  He watches them go, then continues.  Ed reaches a building, "HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY," and glances in the window.  A pause, then he does a doubletake. 
THROUGH THE WINDOW 
The showroom is filled with sample coffins.  Lying inside one is BELA LUGOSI. 
ANGLE - ED 
He is flabbergasted. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY - SAME TIME 
Lugosi slowly sits up inside the coffin.  Bela is an aged 70- year-old man, once a great star, now a faded memory trying to hang on to his nobility.  Quite frail and tired, he is still a master of the grand gesture. 
An UNCTUOUS SALESMAN steps up.  Bela speaks, in a thick Hungarian ACCENT which gives him an Old World elegance. 
BELA Too constrictive.  This is the most uncomfortable coffin I have ever been in. 
SALESMAN Gee, Mr. Lugosi, I've never had any complaints before. 
BELA The selection is quite shoddy.  You are wasting my time. 
Mildly annoyed, Bela climbs out. He straightens his cloak and walks to the exit -- where be bumps into nervous Ed. 
ED Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi?? 
BELA (irritated) I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins. 
ED No.  I don't work here. 
BELA Huh? 
Bela peers at Ed, then glances confusedly over his shoulder at the salesman.  Oh.  Bela looks back at anxious Ed. 
BELA Who are you?  What do you want? 
ED Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI! 
DOLORES I thought he was dead. 
Ed's eyes pop. 
ED No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice. 
DOLORES Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture. 
ED It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore. 
DOLORES So did you get his autograph? 
Ed calms down.  He smiles beatifically. 
ED No.  It wasn't like that at all.  It was just the two of us, and we were talkin'... and he treated me like -- a friend... 
CUT TO: 
INT. STUDIO WAREHOUSE - DAY 
Ed is back in the plant department, arguing with his boss. 
RUDE BOSS He's a bum. 
ED No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"! 
RUDE BOSS Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work. 
ED That's not true -- 
RUDE BOSS He's so great, you hire him. 
ED (defensive) Well, uh, if I could I would... 
The guy takes a mocking face and struts out.  Ed glares. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BELA'S ROUSE - NIGHT 
It's Halloween night.  CHILDREN in trick-or-treating costumes parade up and down the streets.  Through Bela's window, we see him and Ed watching TELEVISION -- a small fuzzy screen in a huge console. 
INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
ON THE TV, one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays.  Bela's evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture. 
ON ED AND BELA 
They are entranced.  The men drink beers in silence.  Bela's TWO DOGS lie at his feet. 
ON THE TV 
The old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy "Creature Feature" hostess, a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress. 
She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set.  There is a pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "Happy Halloween." 
VAMPIRA (on TV) Ooo!  Those eyes!  He gives me the willies!  The only thing scarier than him is this guy I dated last week: Charlie from Pittsburgh.  Boy, talk about the living dead... 
ON THE MEN 
Ed is disgruntled. 
ED Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect. 
BELA (glued to the TV) I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs. 
Ed LAUGHS.  Bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic hand gesture at the TV. 
BELA Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love. 
ED (fascinated by Bela's hand) Hey Bela, how do you do that? 
BELA You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. (back at the TV) Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes. 
Ed joins Bela in this activity.  The two of them wave their arms spookily at the TV. 
Bela becomes fatigued. 
BELA I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine. 
ED Do you want me to get it for you? 
BELA No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright. 
Bela smiles.  He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps behind a curtain.  Ed is puzzled.  Bela's thin arm appears and draws the curtain tight.  We hear mysterious CLANGING, drawers opening and closing, and then silence. 
Ed sits, waiting. 
Behind the curtain, something DROPS.  We hear a muffled "Shit!" 
Ed is getting worried.  But then the curtain whips open, and Bela bounds out, grinning.  He's a bundle of energy. 
BELA I feel better now. 
AT THE DOOR 
The doorbell RINGS.  Kids SHOUT "Trick or treat!"  Bela jumps up gleefully. 
BELA Children!  I love children. 
Bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and sticks them in his mouth. 
OUTSIDE 
Little kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle expectantly. 
Suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count Dracula!  The real Count Dracula.  YEOWWWW!!!  The kids SCREAM and run. 
Bela chuckles.  Every kid is gone... except one TOUGH BOY. 
BELA Aren't you scared, little boy?  I'm going to drink your blood! 
TOUGH BOY Ehh, you're not a real vampire. You can't turn into a bat, and those teeth don't frighten me. 
Suddenly Ed lurches out, menacingly. 
ED Well how about these teeth?!! 
Ed RIPS HIS TEETH out of his head and thrusts them at the kid.  The boy SCREAMS in terror and races away. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY 
CU on a ROYAL TYPEWRITER.  Ed's hands whirl across the portable typewriter, frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can type.  We PULL OUT. 
Ed sits on the bed, typing.  He's a blur of activity, juggling a cigarette, coffee, and a telephone, while he writes. 
ED (on phone) But Bunny, you're perfect for this job!  You're so good at organizing. 
His adrenalin is pumping.  Ed pours some booze into his coffee. 
ED You know these people.  I need all the transsexuals and transvestites you can get. (he sucks on his cigarette) No, I don't care if they're not actors.  I want realism.  I want this film to tell the truth!  I've waited my whole life for this shot, and I'm not gonna blow it. 
There's a KNOCK at the door.  Ed carries the phone on a long cord and answers it.  Bela hurries in, smiling broadly. 
BELA Eddie, you got a new movie for me?! 
ED Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character! (back into the phone) Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  I need transvestites! 
Ed hangs up and resumes typing.  Bela is puzzled. 
BELA Eddie, what kind of movie is this? 
ED Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside. 
BELA (delighted) Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production. 
Ed stops typing.  He pours Bela a drink. 
ED Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything. 
BELA I don't understand. 
ED Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster. 
BELA (getting it) Ah, so I pull the strings! 
ED Yeah.  You pull the strings -- (he suddenly gets a look) "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good! 
Ed quickly starts typing again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Ed and Dolores sit at a card table, finishing up dinner.  The dogs eat scraps below them. 
ED Wipe off your hands.  I've got a little surprise for you... (he smiles nervously) I finished my script. 
Ed anxiously pulls out a pile of pages.  Dolores looks in awe at the cover: "'GLEN OR GLENDA' By Edward D. Wood, Jr"" 
DOLORES Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home. 
ED (apprehensive) Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait... 
There's an uneasy moment between them.  She senses something funny.  Dolores takes the script and goes into the bedroom. The door closes.  Ed starts pacing... 
DISSOLVE TO: INT. BEDROOM - LATER 
Dolores reads the script.  She finishes the last page, then looks up.  She is very shaken. 
Dolores stands.  She grabs the door and opens it. 
THROUGH THE DOORWAY 
Ed stands somberly in drag.  He's in a pantsuit, heels, and pink angora sweater. 
Dolores is totally rattled.  She struggles for a response. 
DOLORES So that's where my sweater's been. 
Ed silently nods. 
DOLORES How long have you been doing this? 
ED Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit. 
DOLORES Jesus Christ!  And you never told me? 
ED This is my way of telling you -- 
DOLORES (furious) What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that? 
Ed is terribly hurt.  Dolores shakes tht script. 
DOLORES And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is our life! 
ED (quiet) Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part. 
DOLORES Oh!  You got nerve, buddy. 
He calmly points at the script. 
ED It's a damn good role. 
DOLORES That's not the issue!! (she suddenly stops) Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?! 
ED It takes me comfortable. 
DOLORES Oh, just like in the script! 
Ed smiles serenely. 
ED Exactly. (he takes her hand) So what do ya say?  Do you wanna break up... or do you wanna do the movie with me? 
Dolores sighs. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SCREEN CLASSICS - DAY 
The hallway is filled with eager TRANSVESTITES.  It's a very festive atmosphere, and Bunny tries to create some order. 
Inside the busy office, Paul types, and Conrad cranks a mimeograph machine. 
CONRAD It's good to have a job.  Now I can get my phone reconnected. 
In a corner, Georgie angrily waves the script at Ed. 
GEORGIE I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film! 
Ed runs up, bounding with enthusiasm. 
ED Bela! It's so great to see you! (he glances at his watch) And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time! 
BELA I am always on time. 
ED Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment -- 
BELA (he leans in and WHISPERS) Uh, Eddie, do you have my money? 
ED Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course. 
Ed and Bela step over to a corner. 
ACROSS THE ROOM 
From a distance, Ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and peels off a few bills for Bela.  The crew watches, fascinated. 
WIPE TO: 
LATER 
Bela is seated in the ratty armchair on the set.  Harry does his make-up.  Harry glances at Bela's arm, and it is full of TRACK MARKS.  Harry grimaces, but doesn't say anything. 
Conrad eagerly scurries up. 
CONRAD Mr. Lugosi, I know you're very busy, but could I have your autograph? 
BELA (cordial) Of course. 
Conrad hands him a scrap of paper.  Bela signs it. 
CONRAD You know which movie of yours I love, Mr. Lugosi?  "The Invisible Ray." You were great as Karloff's sidekick. 
Bela's face suddenly hardens.  He snaps. 
BELA "Sidekick"??  "KARLOFF"?!! 
Bela insanely RIPS up the autograph. 
BELA Fuck you!!  Karloff doesn't deserve to smell my shit!  That limey cocksucker can rot in hell, for all I care!!! 
WIDE 
Ed panickedly runs up. 
ED What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do? 
CONRAD (upset, close to crying) Nothin'!  I told him he was great. 
BELA How dare that asshole bring up Karloff?!!  You think it takes talent to play Frankenstein?!  NO!  It's just make-up and grunting!  GRRR! GRRR!  GRRR! 
Ed is frozen in fear.  He glances across the stage. 
Georgie is flabbergasted.  He points urgently at his watch. 
Ed nods.  He motions to Conrad: Get out of here.  Conrad runs away.  Ed leans in to Bela. 
ED You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, that's a part that takes acting. 
BELA Of course!  Dracula requires presence.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand -- 
Bela waves his outstretched arm.  Ed tries to calm him. 
ED Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene? 
BELA BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!! 
The crew is baffled.  Ed shrugs at them. 
ED Um, okay... roll camera 
CAMERAMAN BILL (unsure) Rolling. 
ED Sound! 
SOUNDMAN Speed. 
CAMERA ASSISTANT Mark.  Scene Thirty-One. 
The Assistant CLAPS the slate in front of Bela, then runs. 
ED And... action? 
It's dead quiet.  Nobody knows what's about to happen. 
WE MOVE IN TO BELA.  And... he suddenly assumes character. Like the consumate pro he is.  Bela gets a wicked, sinister leer, then starts intoning threateningly: 
BELA (as the SPIRIT) "Beware.  Beware!  Beware, of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep.  He eats little boys! Puppy dog tails!  Big fat snails! Beware.  Take care.  Beware!" 
CLOSEUP - ED 
He is blown away.  He quietly mumbles in amazement. 
ED Brilliant. 
WIPE TO: 
INT. STAGE - NEXT DAY 
Dolores studies her script, as the crew lights a flimsy kitchen set.  Ed strolls past, nonchalantly removing a ladies' wig and earrings.  She stares in disbelief. 
DOLORES How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people? 
ED Hon', nobody's bothered but you. (he gestures) Look around -- they couldn't care less. 
DOLORES Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS! 
ED Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer. 
Dolores quiets down.  She feels bad. 
ED Dolores.  I need your help... 
WIPE TO: 
FILMING IN PROGRESS - LATER 
A scene is being shot, on camera.  Ed (as Glen) and Dolores (as Barbara) stare into each other's eyes.  He's dressed normal, and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater. 
ED (as GLEN) "My mind's in a muddle.  I thought I could stop wearing these things. I tried, honestly I tried..." 
It's a warm moment.  They all CLINK their glasses. 
Dolores kisses Ed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE - DAY 
We're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house.  Ed and Dolores are moving in.  They lug furniture from a rented truck. 
ED From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did. 
DOLORES I don't know.  It's so much money... 
ED Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab. 
DOLORES But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job. 
ED But you do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me! 
She just stares.  Ed shrugs, semi-reassuringly. 
ED Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do? 
DOLORES Toss us out on our ass. 
ED Exactly. 
INT. BUNGALOW - DAY 
The house is moved in.  Ed's unkempt dogs run about.  Pumped-up Ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an angora sweater.  A cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a bottle of booze lays in his lap.  Bela sits quietly nearby. 
ED How 'bout a western?  People love westerns. 
BELA But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one? 
ED Eh, forget it.  What else is big? (his face lights up) Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks -- 
BELA Who do I play? 
ED Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's angry!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way! 
BELA (cautious, not to offend) Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl... 
Ed considers this. 
ED Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another! 
BELA (he smiles) That's good.  I could use the money. 
ED But we need to start off with a bang! Something we know the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit? 
BELA (he thinks) Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula." 
ED Of course! 
Ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word "DRACULA." Bela frowns. 
BELA Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day. 
ED So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"! 
BELA We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights. 
ED They do?  Shoot.  There must be a way to get around that... 
Ed's mind is working.  He holds out the paper and stares at it.  Suddenly, he grins.  He grabs the pen and makes a period after the "DR."  It now says "DR.ACULA" 
ED Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula! 
BELA Dracula? 
ED No!  Doctor Acula!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count. 
BELA Ah!  This is very exciting. 
ED (inspired) I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh! 
Ed rips the paper from his typewriter, puts in a blank page, and starts typing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOVIE STUDIO GATE - DAY 
We're outside the imposing gates of MGM.  The lion logo is overhead.  Ed drives up in his dirty Nash Rambler convertible. He wears his nicest suit.  Ed peers nervously at the GUARD. 
ED Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr. Feldman. 
The Guard stares suspiciously at Ed.  His filthy car is leaking oil. 
GUARD What's your name? 
ED Edward D. Wood, Junior. 
The man frowns.  He looks through his files -- then finds a parking slip with Ed's name.  He is surprised. 
GUARD Oh.  Eh, he's in the Executive Building.  You can park in the reserved section. 
Ed smiles. 
INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM - DAY 
The room is very posh, with fancy paneling and marble floors. Ed sits nervously under posters for "GRAND HOTEL" and "QUO VADIS."  Film cans labled "Glen Or Glenda" rest in his lap. 
SECRETARY Sir, Mr. Feldman will see you now. 
She hits an electric button.  A large oak door swings open. 
INT. OFFICE 
Behind a giant desk is MR. FELDMAN, a glib, thin over- caffeinated man.  He jumps up, smiling. 
MR. FELDMAN Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you. 
ED (shaking his hand) It's Wood.  Ed Wood. 
MR. FELDMAN Wood?  Ward?  Wood. (puzzled, he glances at his appointment book) Hey, what do you know.  It is Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right? 
Ed shrugs.  Feldman grins. 
MR. FELDMAN So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans. 
The crowd suddenly ROARS and jumps up.  A favorite wrestler has entered the ring, massive TOR JOHNSON, 50.  Tor is an incredible sight: A bald, lumbering behemoth. 
RING ANNOUNCER (amplified) Now entering the ring, in the gold trunks, 350 bone-crunching pounds of pure strength, the "Swedish Angel"... Tor Johnson!!! 
The crowd goes apeshit.  The stands are going to collapse from the SHOUTING. 
Ed's eyes are the size of saucers. 
ED My God, look at that guy.  He's a mountain! 
The bell RINGS.  Tor quickly grabs his OPPONENT, a man in a blue mask, and throws him at the ground.  Then Tor jumps onto his stomach, easily picks him up, and heaves him at the ropes. 
People CHEER.  Ed is flabbergasted. 
ED I've never seen anything like him! 
BUNNY And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married -- 
ED (eyes glued to the ring) Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a monster! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie? 
ON TOR 
He screams maniacally in Swedish.  Tor lifts the Opponent over his head and tosses him into the stands.  Three rows of chairs get knocked over. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WRESTLER'S BAR - NIGHT 
A tiny miniature European car pulls up.  Tor Johnson is squeezed inside -- ludicrously oversized for this vehicle.  Tor carefully wedges himself out and enters the bar. 
INT. WRESTLER'S BAR - SAME TIME 
This rowdy bar is packed with burly WRESTLERS.  Tor walks in, and men cheerily yell out: "Hey, Tor!" "Hi, Tor!"  Tor grins. In person, he actually seems a jolly, outgoing fellow. 
Ed waves from the corner 
ED Mr. Johnson, over here! 
Tor smiles and lumbers over 
ED Glad you could fit me in your schedule. 
TOR (in a hoarse SWEDISH ACCENT) Da pleasure be mine. 
They shake hands.  Ed's hands look like a baby's in Tor's giant mitts. 
Tor tries to sit in the booth.  But he can't fit. 
TOR Could we moovf to table? 
ED Oh, of course! 
Ed jumps up.  They move to a large table.  Now Tor is happy. He starts shoveling beer nuts into his mouth. 
ED So, Mr. Johnson -- 
TOR Tor! 
ED Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor? 
TOR (he CHUCKLES) Mm, not good-lookink enough. 
ED I think you're quite handsome. 
TOR No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that. 
Ed smiles. 
ED Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures. 
TOR But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent. 
ED Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium. 
A WAITRESS saunters over. 
WAITRESS Tor, what can I get ya? 
TOR I'll haf eight beers. 
WAITRESS (nonchalant, to Ed) And you? 
ED Uhh, I'll have just one. 
She walks off.  Tor shakes the now-empty nut bowl. 
TOR And more nuts! 
Ed tries to grab Tor's attention. 
ED So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl. 
TOR (he laughs merrily) I like.  When do movie shoot? 
ED Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ED'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Ed and Dolores are asleep.  Suddenly the phone RINGS.  Ed fumbles for it and groggily answers. 
ED Wood Productions... 
We hear Bela's weak VOICE. 
BELA (on phone) Eddie... help me... 
ED Bela? 
BELA (on phone) Eddie... please come over -- 
CLICK.  The phone hangs up.  Ed is very alarmed. 
EXT. BELA'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
The wind is blowing.  Ed's Nash roars up, and he jumps out, a coat over his pajamas.  He runs up and POUNDS on Bela's door. 
ED Bela?! 
Ed tries the door. It's unlocked. 
CRISWELL In 1960, the automobile will have retractable wings, so it can fly. 
HOST Sounds like a heck of a way to beat traffic. 
Audience LAUGHS.  Criswell rubs his temples enigmatically. 
CRISWELL By 1970, Man will have colonized Mars.  Millions of people will live there. 
Ed is mesmerized. 
ED Wow!  Ain't that something. 
INT. STUDIO - LATER 
We're out in the audience.  The curtain rises on a SPOOKY SET: Shadows, cobwebs, and a coffin in the center.  The Host walks onstage, to huge APPLAUSE.  He's playing his "Slick" character, a befuddled moron in a funny hat.  The Host shines a flashlight around, and then the coffin opens.  Bela sits up.  There's more APPLAUSE. 
BELA Greetings.  I am the Count. 
HOST Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure. 
The audience LAUGHS.  Then APPLAUSE. 
HOST Say, that's a funny place to sleep. 
BELA It is my home. 
HOST Oh, tract housing, huh? (he starts AD-LIBBING) I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy shower.  I still don't know where to hang the towels! 
The audience HOWLS with laughter.  Bela is totally lost.  He seems incredibly confused. 
BELA Uh, beg to differ. 
HOST "Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank! 
BELA (terrified, groping) Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count... 
BACKSTAGE 
Ed covers his face in embarrassment. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - LATER 
The Host angrily storms past. 
HOST I told you we should've gotten Karloff. 
He exits.  A door opens, and Ed and Bela quietly step out. 
ED Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap. 
BELA (distraught) I never said I could ad-lib... 
ED Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again. 
They shuffle away... until Criswell and his snazzy ENTOURAGE burst around a corner.  Even in person, Criswell is ethereal and quite self-important.  He is delighted to see Bela. 
CRISWELL Mr. Lugosi!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL! 
BELA (morose) It's a pleasure... 
CRISWELL Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. (he points at his temple) I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success! 
ED Wow. 
CRISWELL And who may you be? 
ED Edward Wood, Sir. 
CRISWELL Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda." 
ED (startled) H-how'd you know?! 
CRISWELL I'm Criswell.  I know all. 
Criswell winks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MOCAMBO ROOM - NIGHT 
Latin horns blast onstage of this hopping '5Os nightclub. Cigarette girls roam about.  Seated at a front table is Ed, Bela, and Criswell's group.  Everyone's plastered and laughing. Criswell shouts above the din at a WAITER. 
CRISWELL Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine? 
BELA No.  I never drink -- wine. 
The whole table CRACKS UP.  Bela cheers up.  Ed turns to Criswell. 
ED Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 
CRISWELL I guessed. 
ED I don't understand. 
CRISWELL I made it up.  It's horseshit! 
Ed's jaw drops. 
CRISWELL There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo. 
ED It's that easy? 
CRISWELL Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything. 
Criswell smiles knowingly.  Ed nods at this profound wisdom. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT 
We're outside the legendary hat-shaped restaurant.  A large Eldorado pulls up, and a CONSERVATIVE MAN and his PLUMP WIFE step out and approach the DOORMAN. 
CONSERVATIVE MAN Excuse me.  We're here for the Wood party. 
DOORMAN Ah, that would be in the Venetian Room, sir. 
The couple raise their eyebrows.  They're impressed. 
INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT 
ED I understand you just moved here? 
LORETTA Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting. 
A WAITER walks over, with a water pitcher. 
WAITER Water, Ma'am? 
LORETTA (suddenly freaking out) No!  No water!  NO LIQUIDS!  I'm terribly allergic to them! 
The waiter is bewildered.  He hurries away.  Ed leans in. 
ED So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture. 
LORETTA Perhaps a small amount of money. (she smiles) How much do one of your motion pictures cost? 
ED For this one, we need $60,000. 
LORETTA That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture. 
Ed perks up.  She's a live one! 
Ed pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her. 
ED Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay. 
LORETTA Oh my, this is very interesting. (she skims the pages) Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts? 
ED (very enthused) Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk! 
LORETTA Hmm.  Those sound kind of small. (stopping at a page) Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her. 
Ed blanches. 
ED J-Janet Lawton??? 
LORETIA Yes, Janet Layton is clearly the part to play.  She's got some real meaty scenes!  Can't you just see me in that part?? 
CU - ED 
He is aghast.  What a stomach-churning decision.  He stares at Loretta, then slowly croaks a response. 
ED Uh... yeah... (beat) You'd be perfect. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ED AND DOLORES'S HOUSE - DAY 
We HEAR dishes being violently thrown.  Dolores SCREAMS inside. 
DOLORES (o.s.) You bastard!  You two-timing, dress-wearing son-of-a-BITCH!! 
INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Dolores is crying and screaming angrily.  Ed ducks the objects she hurls at him. 
ED It was the only way I could get the movie made! 
DOLORES Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?! 
ED I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say? 
DOLORES I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores." 
ED But there's plenty of other parts. 
DOLORES Like what?! 
ED (nervous) The secretary.  Or the file clerk. 
Dolores is stunned. 
DOLORES YOU ASSHOLE! 
She hurls a pot at Ed.  WHACK!  It slams him in the head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY 
The sets are being erected for "Bride Of The Atom"!  The crew hurries about the small stage, as Ed energetically supervises. He has a large band-aid on his head. 
ED This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes! 
BUNNY You mean a Tesla coil? 
ED If you say so. 
Tor lumbers over, in his ripped Lobo outfit.  His face has fake gashed-up scars.  Tor holds the script. 
TOR Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like. 
ED Really?  Was the third act too intense? 
TOR (trying to be polite) No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk. 
ED But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed. 
TOR Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk. 
Ed thinks.  He quickly puts a spin on this. 
ED Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face. 
TOR (still bothered) But Greta say -- 
Loretta walks over, holding two dresses. 
LORETTA Eddie, which dress do you like better? 
ED I don't know. (he yells o.s.) Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one? 
Cameraman Bill is standing at the camera.  He squints. 
CAMERAMAN BILL Which one is the red one? 
ED (confused) What do you mean? 
CAMERAMAN BILL I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind. (beat) But I like the dark gray one. 
WIPE TO: 
SURLY STAGE MANAGER Hey, Wood. Your check bounced. 
ED Okay, I'll get you the money later. 
SURLY STAGE MANAGER No.  I need it NOW. 
Ed nods grimly.  He grabs Loretta and takes her aside. 
ED Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money. 
LORETTA Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you? 
ED (he smiles) Yeah.  Exactly! 
There's a pause.  They stare at each other. 
ED I kinda need it now. 
LORETTA (baffled) What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred. 
ED Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand. 
LORETTA What other sixty-thousand? 
ED The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me. 
LORETTA You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars. 
CLOSEUP - ED 
He looks like he s going to throw up. 
ED Oh my God. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY 
The large stage door SLAMS shut. 
Ed's disoriented cast and crew stand in the street.  Bela, Tor, and Loretta are still in costume. 
Ed looks totally dazed.  He blinks in the bright sunlight. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT 
We're back at the Brown Derby, for another backers party.  The same banner is hanging: "BRIDE OF THE ATOM -- NEXT YEAR'S SMASH HIT!" 
The whole crowd is there, dressed up.  Bela sits in the corner, knocking back a drink. 
BELA Here we go again. 
Paul whispers to Bunny. 
PAUL MARCO So is Dolores coming? 
BUNNY (very catty) I can't imagine why.  I wouldn't put up with a boyfriend who sold me out for three-hundred dollars...! 
ON ED 
Ed stands with a circle of POTENTIAL BACKERS.  He has an edge of desperation we've never seen before. 
ED ...lemme tell you, you can't lose. It's scary!  And if you don't like that, it's romantic!  Bela Lugosi portrays Dr. Vornoff, and lovely ingenue Loretta King is reporter Janet Lawton. 
POTENTIAL BACKER Hmm.  Lugosi looks pretty old. (he squints across the room) Which role is Vampira playing? 
ED Vampira...? (bewildered) Why do you ask?? 
POTENTIAL BACKER Well I see her standing over there. 
The guy points.  Ed turns and looks and Vampira is standing in the next room.  She's at a different party. 
ED Well... she's playing -- (beat) Could you excuse me one moment?? 
Ed dashes from the room. 
NEXT ROOM OVER 
Vampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy-fartsy types.  She's in street clothes, but clearly recognizable.  Ed runs up. 
ED Excuse me, Miss Vampira? 
VAMPIRA Yes? 
ED (sweaty) You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet! 
Vampira stares, totally uncomprehending. 
VAMPIRA I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph? 
ED No.  I think my film is perfect for you. 
VAMPIRA You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven -- 
ED (unyielding) No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be in it!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...? 
Vampire glances at her friends.  They uncomfortably turn away. 
VAMPIRA Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat -- 
ED (begging) Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard... 
VAMPIRA (pissed off) Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it! 
BACK AT THE PARTY 
The backers glance into the next room.  Ed is in front of Vampira, begging on his hands and knees. 
BACKER (to another backer) I'm getting a bad feeling about this. Let's get out of here. 
The backers pick up their coats.  Through the doorway, Ed sees this.  He jumps up and frantically runs back in. 
ED Where are you guys going?!  You can't leave! 
BACKER (running out) Goodbye, Mr. Wood. 
ED (insane) You can't go!  You haven't seen the storyboards! 
The backers run out of the room. They're gone. Ed shouts after them. 
OLD MAN McCOY Son, you're too vague.  I come from the world of business.  I need to know what I get for my investment. 
ED Movies are very popular.  You could make a lot of money. 
OLD MAN McCOY Yeah, but most of 'em flop, don't they?  What am I tangibly guaranteed? 
ED Well... you get "Executive Producer" credit. 
OLD MAN McCOY That don't mean diddley. (he suddenly SHOUTS angrily) BILLY BOB!  You're cutting 'em TOO LEAN. 
McCoy grabs a CLEAVER from a worker and slams it into a chop. 
ED Mr. McCoy, how can I make you happy? 
OLD MAN McCOY Cut to the chase, heh?  That's good! That's very good. 
McCoy SPITS his tobacco. 
OLD MAN McCOY Okay, two things.  Number one: I want the movie to end with a big explosion.  Sky full of smoke. 
ED But the story ends with Dr. Vornoff falling in the pit -- 
OLD MAN McCOY Not anymore.  And number two: I've got a son.  He's a little slow -- but a good boy.  And something tells me he'd make a hell of a leading man... 
Under Ed's cheery frozen smile, his face clearly falls. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SALT LAKE CITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
We're at a ROWDY wrestling match.  Tor Johnson is in the middle of a screaming, four-man tag-team event.  Tor THROWS his opponent to the ground; then tags with his partner and goes to the corner. 
Suddenly a WRESTLING COACH runs up, dragging a telephone on a very long cord. 
WRESTLING COACH Tor, you got a phone call! 
TOR Heh?  NOW? 
WRESTLING COACH They said it was an emergency! 
He hands sweaty Tor the phone.  Tor speaks into it. 
TOR Hallo? 
ED'S VOICE Tor, this is Ed!  Glad I could find you!  I got the money, and we resume shooting tomorrow morning! 
TOR But I'm in Utah. 
ED'S VOICE Then you'll have to drive all night! I'm counting on you, big guy. Breakfast is at seven. 
CLICK.  Ed hangs up.  Tor is flabbergasted. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE - EARLY MORNING 
"Bride Of The Atom" is back in production!  Ed's stock company is reunited.  People drink coffee and gossip. 
PAUL MARCO This is unbelievable!  I woulda bet a million bucks that Ed wouldn't finish this picture. 
CAMERAMAN BILL It ain't finished yet.  Anything could happen. 
The stage door opens and standing there, in silhouette, is Dolores.  Everybody quiets.  People glance nervously at Loretta. 
BUNNY Uh-oh.  Stay out of scratching distance. 
AT DOLORES 
Ed runs over.  Dolores is beautifully made-up, and wearing a furry angora sweater.  Ed speaks, awkwardly. 
ED Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message. 
DOLORES (icy) Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene. 
ED That's right... 
DOLORES I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. (she looks around) Say, who's the lug? 
In a corner, standing by himself, is dumb TONY McCOY, Old Man McCoy's worthless son.  He's a good-looking, moody hunk.  Tony is practicing his lines from a script, but he's terribly stiff. 
TONY "Now Janet, I want you straying away -- oops -- staying away from the old Willows Place." 
Ed shrugs. 
ED That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig. 
DOLORES Oh really?  How much money did he put up? 
ED None. (beat) But his dad gave me fifty grand. 
DOLORES (snide) Wood Productions.  The mark of quality. 
ED Hey, the movie's getting made. That's the main thing. 
Dolores shakes her head contemptuously.  Then she strides off. 
Ed stands alone, feeling bad. 
WIPE TO: 
ON STAGE 
The set is a one-wall "office hallway": A doorway and a water cooler.  Loretta sits in a make-up chair, as Harry works on her. 
DOLORES (O.S.) Hey Harry -- long time no see. 
Harry turns, surprised.  Dolores stands behind him.  There's a thick tension.  He smiles anxiously. 
MAKE-UP MAN HARRY Hi Dolores... 
LORETA Oh, you're Dolores?!  I've heard so much about you!  I'm Loretta King. (she chipperly jumps up) Here, take the chair. 
DOLORES (bitchy) Don't be silly -- let Harry finish. You still need more work. 
LORETTA No, I'm done.  All I needed was a touch-up. 
DOLORES Mm, that mole still shows. 
Loretta frowns.  Ed quickly steps in. 
ED Ladies!  You both look fine.  Why don't we talk about the scene? (beat) Okay.  Janet Lawton has discovered that Dr. Vornoff bought the old Willows estate.  So now she wants to prove that all the monster stories are true. 
They CLINK beers. 
EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME 
Outside, Vampira and two GIRL FRIENDS walk up.  They peer at a tin sign. 
GIRLFRIEND #1 "McCoy Meat Packing"?  Are you sure there's a party here? 
VAMPIRA (holding an INVITATION) Yeah, I got this invitation.  It's a "Bride Of The Atom" party, whatever that means. 
They open the large steel door, and INSIDE is the wild bash. 
INT. PARTY 
Across the room, Paul and Conrad chat. 
PAUL MARCO "Glen Or Glenda," now that was a hell of a picture. 
CONRAD Well, this new one's gonna be a hundred times better. 
PAUL MARCO Is that possible? 
Dolores overhears this.  She stares in disbelief. 
AT THE TURNTABLE 
Someone changes the record.  Brassy STRIPPER MUSIC begins. 
A door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag. 
Everybody turns.  They start WHISTLING and HOLLARING. 
Ed grins, and starts into a wacky bump-and-grind. 
VOICE Go, baby, go! 
Bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits. People LAUGH hysterically. 
Dolores is appalled. 
Ed shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around.  He sees Vampira and waves. 
Vampira's jaw drops in recognition. 
VAMPIRA I don't believe it.  It's him! 
Ed sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him.  The music is building to a climax.  Ed hurries off to center stage -- and as the MUSIC ENDS, he does a final swing of his hips, then suddenly yanks out his teeth! 
This brings down the house.  Everyone STAMPS their feet and CLAPS crazily. 
ANGLE - DOLORES 
Everyone, except Dolores.  Suddenly, she explodes. 
DOLORES You people are INSANE!  Take a look around -- you're all FREAKS! 
The room quiets.  Dolores has snapped. 
DOLORES You're wasting your lives making SHIT!  Nobody cares!  These movies are TERRIBLE! (beat) I can't take it any longer! 
The group is shocked.  Nobody speaks. 
Dolores runs out of the party. 
Ed just stands, dumbstruck.  Then he chases after her, in his high heels and dress. 
EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME 
Dolores runs across the parking lot, in tears.  Ed catches up with her. 
ED Dolores, wait! 
DOLORES Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life. 
ED (hurt) Did you really mean those things you said..? 
Dolores stops. 
DOLORES I'm tired of living on the fringe. 
ED But you used to say -- 
DOLORES Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. (pause) Now that it's done, so am I. 
She turns and walks away.  Ed is crushed.  He stands motionless, in his dress, in the dark. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ED'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY 
Ed's new home is a single apartment, still filled with moving boxes.  Half-eaten plates of food are scattered about.  Ed lies asleep in bed, unshaven, in the middle of the day. 
The phone RINGS.  Ed awakens and woozily answers it. 
ED Yeah... 
TOR (on phone) Ed, dit I wake you?  It's two in avternoon. 
ED No, I was just doin' a little work... 
TOR (on phone) Bullchit!  You been like dis too many days.  I want to cheer you up. 
EXT. TOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ed drives his Nash though a tract Valley neighborhood and reaches Tor's little house.  Ed gets out, still looking groggy. He walks up the tulip-lined path and rings the DOORBELL. Clanging SWEDISH CHIMES bong inside. 
The door flies open, and Tor appears, beaming. 
TOR Edvard, you come! 
Tor gives Ed a back-breaking hug. 
INT. TOR'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Ed steps in.  The house is filled with cuckoo clocks and little Swedish knick-knacks.  Tor gestures proudly. 
TOR I'm so happy you visit.  Meet my family!  Greta, Karl, and Connie! 
THREE COLOSSAL PEOPLE lumber out.  Tor has the largest family we've ever seen.  Not fat -- but big-boned.  GRETA is Tor's gigantic Swedish wife, and KARL and CONNIE are their two elephantine children.  They ADLIB greetings: "Hallo!" "Welcome!" "Is a pleasure!" 
Ed cannot believe what he's seeing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
Ed shuffles down the street, Mr. Lonely Guy, feeling sorry for himself. 
He glances in a coffee shop, and sees a sweet young woman inside.  Her name is NORMA McCARTY.  She wears a bow in her hair, Mary Jane shoes, and a fuzzy white angora sweater. 
Ed's eyes widen. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME TIME 
Innocent Norma sits by herself, eating. 
ED'S VOICE Excuse me.  Is that angora? 
Norma looks up.  Standing over her is Ed, smiling. 
NORMA Why... yes. 
ED Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing? 
NORMA I suppose.  It's very expensive. 
ED It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas. 
NORMA What are you, an angora wholesaler? 
ED No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer. 
NORMA (she laughs) Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that. 
ED Two people do.  Orson Welles and me. 
NORMA Wow. 
ED You know, you're a very attractive girl. 
Norma blushes. 
NORMA My goodness, you're embarrassing me. 
ED You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. (he smoothly sits down) Mind if I order some hotcakes...? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRISWELL'S CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Criswell and Paul drive at night.  They're dressed-up.  SWING MUSIC plays on the radio. 
CRISWELL So who's the surprise for? 
PAUL MARCO I dunno.  Ed was real mysterious. All he'd say was it's a surprise party. 
CRISWELL Isn't that like him! (beat) And isn't that like us -- that we show up anyway. 
They pull up to a GUARD GATE.  They're at a studio. 
CRISWELL Excuse me.  We're here for the Wood party. 
GUARD They've rented Stage 12.  Drive straight back. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT 
There is another rambunctious party in progress.  Crepe paper streamers hang down.  Bela approaches Tor. 
BELA So what are we doing here? 
TOR Nobody knows.  But there's a lotta booze. 
Suddenly Ed steps into the middle of the room.  He's extremely handsome in his tuxedo, and beaming happily. 
ED Excuse me!  Could everyone please quiet down? (the room quiets) First of all, I want to thank you, all my good friends, for being here tonight.  And second, if you're wondering what the big surprise is... well, TONIGHT I'M GETTING MARRIED!! 
The crowd is stunned. 
Many people DROP their glasses. 
Ed proudly pulls out Norma.  She's in a wedding gown. 
ED Everybody, this is Norma! 
ON BELA AND TOR 
They're bewildered.  Bela WHISPERS. 
BELA Who the fuck is she?? 
TOR I never heard of her. 
Ed walks over.  He hugs Bela. 
ED And Bela, I want you to be the best man! 
Bela smiles -- trying to hide his total confusion. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LATER 
The wedding is in progress.  The crowd is seated.  A MINISTER performs the ceremony with Ed and Norma. 
MINISTER ...Norma, do you promise to love, honor, and cherish... 
IN THE CROWD 
Everybody is QUIETLY GOSSIPING. 
BUNNY I didn't even know he had a girlfriend. 
PAUL MARCO (he taps him on the shoulder) I hear she's an actress who gave him money. 
CONRAD Nah, I heard she's his childhood sweetheart from Poughkeepsie. 
CRISWELL I predict it's Dolores in a mask. 
AT THE ALTAR 
The Minister is speaking to Ed. 
MINISTER ...in sickness and in health, till death do you part? 
BELA (near tears) Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent... 
ED Don't you have any savings? 
BELA I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die. (distraught) And you should come with me. 
Frail Bela points the gun at Ed.  Ed is terrified. 
ED Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea. 
BELA It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work. 
ED Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun... (he cautiously steps forward) If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking? 
BELA Formaldehyde. 
Ed stares in anguish. 
ED Straight up or on the rocks? 
Bela drops the gun.  He starts weeping. 
Ed walks over and hugs the shaking old man. 
ED Don't worry. 
BELA I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry. 
ED Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOSPITAL - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT 
Ed's car pulls up at the South Metropolitan State Hospital. It's a grim, unwelcoming edifice. 
Ed helps weak Bela from the car.  They look at each other, then Ed gingerly leads Bela in. 
INT. HOSPITAL - SAME TIME 
The lobby is clammy and dim.  Ed and Bela reach the desk.  A NURSE looks up, startled. 
NURSE My goodness, you gave me the willies. You look like that Dracula guy. 
BELA (very somber) My name is Bela Lugosi.  I wish to commit myself. 
NURSE For what reason? 
BELA I have been a drug addict for twenty years.  I need help... 
The nurse nods.  She takes Bela's arm and leads him away.  Bela glances at Ed, then steps through a wide door.  As it swings shut, we see a DOCTOR walk over and shake Bela's hand. 
Ed stares at the door, dazed by all that's happened.  He sits down in a chair, exhausted. 
Ed's eyes slowly close, and he falls asleep... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING 
Ed is still asleep, but now sunlight beats in. 
Ed stirs and wakes up.  He groggily looks around, and sitting across from him is a woman, knitting.  This is KATHY O'HARA, 26, solid, reflective, with a dry sense of humor.  Ed peers at her. 
ED Hello. 
KATHY Hello. (beat) You're sleeping in a tuxedo. 
ED I got married last night. 
KATHY Oh.  Congratulations. 
ED The marriage already ended. 
KATHY Oh.  My condolences. 
Ed watches her knit. 
ED What are you making? 
KATHY Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital. 
ED How long's he been here? 
KATHY This is my thirteenth pair. 
Ed nods.  He spots the Doctor walk by. 
ED Excuse me. (he runs to the Doctor) Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he? 
DOCTOR Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone. 
ED Will he be okay? 
DOCTOR We'll do our best. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
We are outside Bela's room.  He can be glimpsed inside, strapped to the bed and SCREAMING in pain.  He is going through painful withdrawal and shakes horribly. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - ANOTHER DAY 
Ed strides into the hospital, wearing different clothes, and carrying a box of chocolates.  He waves at the nurse. 
ED Hi, Lillian. 
NURSE (she smiles) Hi, Ed.  Boy, he's got a lot of visitors today. 
ED He does? 
Ed is puzzled.  He hurries back. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
A crowd of NEWSPAPER REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS overflow Bela's room.  Ed is astonished. 
ED What's going on here?!  Excuse me! 
ED No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later. 
BELA Oh.  So what is the scene about? 
ED (improvising) Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event. 
Bela nods.  He mulls this over. 
BELA Okay.  But what if I'm not in too big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower? 
ED (he smiles) That's great.  Let's do a take. 
WIDE 
Bela goes in the front door.  Ed gets behind the camera, then turns it ON. 
ED Okay, roll camera!  Rolling.  Scene One, Take One! (pause) And... ACTION! 
There's a moment.  And then Bela slowly steps outside, calm, dignified, walking with a cane.  He looks about -- and then something catches his eye.  He leans down and picks a flower. 
Bela smells the flower, then abruptly drops it.  He starts crying.  A pause, and then he composes himself.  The old man slowly shuffles out of frame. 
Ed peers emotionally from behind the camera. 
ED And, cut... 
BELA Eddie, how was I? 
ED (quiet) Perfect. 
Bela is pleased. 
BELA Good. (beat) Now what about my close up? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD DUPLEX - DUSK 
Ed's Nash convertible pulls up outside a neat little duplex in a nice neighborhood.  Ed is dressed up for a date.  He checks his hair nervously in the mirror, revealing an anxious boyishness we've never seen before. 
Ed carries a bouquet of flowers to the front door.  He rings the bell.  Kathy opens the door.  She looks very pretty in a full skirt with a crinolin. 
KATHY Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional. 
ED (a little embarrassed) I just picked them up on the way over... 
KATHY They're very nice. (she smiles sweetly) Let me get my coat. 
EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT 
Ed and Kathy are at a tattered traveling carnival.  Rattling steel rides and flashing lights spin about them.  They stroll through the crowds eating cotton candy.  Kathy wears one of Ed's flowers on her dress. 
KATHY So have you always lived in L.A.? 
ED No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office... 
KATHY Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners. 
INT. SPOOK HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ed and Kathy ride through the old mechanical spook house. 
KATHY Did you find it boring? 
ED Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas... 
A wooden WITCH jumps out at them.  They ignore it. 
KATHY Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" -- 
ED (getting excited) Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there. 
A creaky GHOST flies overhead. 
KATHY You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's. 
ED What do you mean? 
KATHY "Dracula." 
Ed freaks out. 
ED That's INCREDIBLE!  That's the first picture I ever saw!! 
WIDE 
Mechanical BATS drop down and flap around them. 
KATHY That is incredible! (beat) You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie. 
ED I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. (he smiles) But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that. 
KATHY A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person. 
CLOSEUP - ED 
He starts at Kathy in wonder.  He is overcome. 
Their car SMASHES through the tin exit doors. 
EXT. SPOOK HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Ed and Kathy's little car comes to a stop.  He gets very serious. 
ED Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know. (beat) I like to wear women's clothes. 
KATHY Huh? 
ED I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road. 
Kathy is amazed.  She contemplates all this. 
KATHY Does this mean you don't like sex with girls? 
ED No! I love sex with girls. 
KATHY Oh.  Okay. 
ED (surprised) Okay? 
Kathy slyly grins. 
A WOMAN'S VOICE cackles. 
WOMAN'S VOICE It's the blind leading the blind! 
Tor staggers to his feet.  All disoriented, he starts walking the wrong direction and falls over a chair.  People HECKLE. 
Criswell quickly helps his up. 
TOR Dis is a nightmare. 
CRISWELL It's show biz. 
Criswell pushes Tor in the right direction.  Some roughnecks knock down Criswell and snatch his wallet. 
A MEAN BOY jumps on his chair, ripping the stuffing out of the seat.  He throws the fibers in the air, and they float over Bela and Vampira. 
BELA What is that? 
VAMPIRA I think they're getting ready to burn this place down. 
A HIGH SCHOOL PUNK runs up and grabs Vampira's breasts. 
HIGH SCHOOL PUNK Hey Vampira, how 'bout a little love? 
VAMPIRA Fuck off! 
She impulsively swings her arm and SLAMS the kid. 
ON STAGE 
The Manager pleads to the mob. 
THEATER MANAGER Children, please!  Be calm! 
Somebody throws a bottle and HITS him in the head.  He goes down. 
WIDE 
The lights suddenly go off.  Some girls SCREAM. 
Ed's panicked.  He grabs Kathy and runs down to his friends. 
ED C'mon!  We're getting the hell out of here! 
Ed rounds up Bela, Tor, Criswell, and Vampira. 
The crowd BOOS louder.  Blind Tor is totally confused. 
TOR What is happening? 
ED We're escaping! 
The group runs up the aisle and leaves.  As the doors close, "Bride Of The Monster" starts unspooling on the screen. 
EXT. THEATER - SAME TIME 
The gang frantically runs out, scared for their lives. 
They look over.  Some JUVENILE DELINQUENTS are stripping the hearse. 
VAMPIRA We're gonna die. 
The theater doors CRASH open.  The angry mob pours out. 
Ed spins wildly around... and sees a cab approaching. 
ED Stop! 
KATHY STOP! 
Kathy runs frenziedly into the street and throws herself at the cab.  It screeches to a halt. 
Everybody sprints over and jumps in.  The cab ROARS away. 
INT. CAB - SAME TIME 
All of them are breathing heavily.  They watch in the rear window as they drive away from the rampage. 
A nervous silence.  Until Bela speaks. 
BELA Now that was a premiere. 
All of them LAUGH. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY 
Bela and Ed stroll down the street, in high spirits.  Bela smokes a big fat cigar. 
BELA Last night was quite a romp. 
ED Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits? 
BELA I envied him. (he chuckles) Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that. 
ED Yeah, she's really somethin'. 
BELA I know none of my wives would've. 
Ed laughs.  Bela puffs his cigar. 
BELA Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time. 
ED I just wish you coulda seen the movie. 
BELA No problem.  I know it by heart... 
Bela stops walking.  And in a BOOMING, THEATRICAL VOICE, he suddenly launches into his impassioned, climactic speech from "Bride Of The Monster." 
BELA "Home.  I have no home.  Hunted... despised... living like an animal -- the jungle is my home!  But I will show the world that I can be its master.  I shall perfect my own race of people... a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world!" 
Ed is touched. 
A few people around them APPLAUD. 
Bela's face lights up, proud.  An awed MIDWESTERN TOURIST hands him a pen and paper. 
TOURIST Mr. Lugosi, could I have your autograph? 
BELA Certainly. 
ED (he sloppily lies) I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one. 
INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME 
Ed motions Reynolds in.  Reynolds peers unsurely at the tornado inside.  Then he notices a framed one-sheet for "BRIDE OF THE MONSTER."  Reynolds admires it. 
REYNOLDS Hmm, so you're in the picture business? 
ED (rummaging for a check) You could say that -- 
REYNOLDS I'm interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money. 
ED (distracted) Raising money is tough. 
REYNOLDS Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve... 
ANGLE - ED 
His eyes suddenly pop. 
The color comes back to his fact.  A plan is quickly boiling over inside Ed's head.  He starts feverishly pacing around. 
ED Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from that, and make the twelve Apostles' movies. 
REYNOLDS Would that work? 
ED Absolutely!  You see this script..? 
Ed randomly grabs a script off the messy floor, then glances down, to see which one he picked up.  It says "Graverobbers From Outer Space." 
ED "Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's money in the bank. 
REYNOLDS Graverobbers from what?? 
ED From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  Very big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films! (beat) And pay my back rent from the profits. 
Reynolds scratches his head. 
REYNOLDS I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb. 
ED It's a guaranteed blockbuster! 
REYNOLDS Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars? 
ED (in a frenzy) Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!! 
REYNOLDS (mystified) Lugosi??!  Didn't be pass on? 
Ed grins maniacally.  He grabs a SMALL REEL of 35mm film. 
ED Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot! 
REYNOLDS Just, it doesn't look like very much. 
ED It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film" 
A beat.  Reynolds stares, intrigued... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ED'S APARTMENT - LATER 
The place is cleaned-up.  Ed shouts excitedly into the phone. 
ED Bunny!  We're making another film! Yeah -- I got the Baptist Church of Beverly Hills to put up the cash! 
Paul sticks his head in. 
PAUL MARCO Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside. 
ED Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run. 
Ed hangs up. 
Paul leads in THREE.  They look nothing like Bela.  One is a HOMELESS BUM, one is a SHORT FAT MAN, and one is CHINESE. 
Ed inspects them. 
ED Too tall... too short... (he glances at the Chinese guy) And this guy doesn't work at all. 
PAUL MARCO Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu." 
ED That was Karloff. (beat) Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality. 
Paul turns to go. 
ED And by the way, keep Sunday free. The producers want all of us to get baptized. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Kathy reads a newspaper while knitting an angora sweater.  Ed is typing deliriously fast -- in one of his artistic fevers. 
ED You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better! 
KATHY Do you want your buttons on the left or the right? 
ED The left.  It's more natural. (he squints at his script) Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of? 
KATHY Uh, atomic energy? 
ED No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's more advanced? 
KATHY Dynamite -- 
ED No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy?? 
KATHY The sun. 
ED (ecstatic) Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific. (he resumes TYPING) This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  No compromises. 
Kathy suddenly jumps up, shocked. 
KATHY Oh my God.  Look at this! 
She runs over and shows Ed the newspaper. 
INSERT - THE NEWSPAPER 
A small headline says "VAMPIRA REVEALED TO BE RED."  Underneath is the story: "Channel 7 has fired popular horror hostess Vampira, after learning of her suspected communist leanings..." 
Reynolds DUNKS Bunny. 
THE REVEREND BAPTIZES TOR 
REVEREND LEMON ...Do you repent for all your sins? 
TOR I do. 
Tor winks slyly at Criswell. 
Reynolds DUNKS Tor.  But Tor slips from Reynolds' grasp and sinks to the bottom of the pool. 
REYNOLDS Oh my God, I dropped him -- 
Tor lies on the bottom, staring lifeinsly. 
CRISWELL (mischievous) I don't think he's coming up! 
REVEREND LEMON Lord no!  The man's drowning! 
REYNOLDS (scared) What do we do?! 
REVEREND LEMON Help!  HELP!!! 
The whole Congregation starts JUMPING IN.  Men and women in their Sunday finest leap into the pool and start tugging on Tor.  But nobody can budge the big whale. 
REVEREND LEMON (near tears) Dear Jesus, please forgive us! 
ON TOR 
He suddenly rises, Poseidon-like, from the pool. 
Tor spits out water, then lets out a hearty BELLY LAVGH. 
TOR Tor make good joke! 
The Baptists aren't amused. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CITY BUS - MORNING 
A bus drives along.  Every PASSENGER stares at something up front -- Vampira, in her slinky black outfit.  She reads a "Grave Robbers From Outer Space" script. 
EXT. SCUMMY NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME TIME 
The bus stops in a scary, run-down neighborhood.  Vampira off and warily looks around. 
VAMPIRA This can't be the right address... 
She nervously walks down a dingy alley.  Vampira gets to an unmarked grimy door, gulps, then slowly opens it... 
INT. WAREHOUSE SOUNDSTAGE - DAY 
And inside is the "Grave Robbers From Outer Space" famous CEMETERY SET!  The film is in production!  Packed into a stinking little studio are a few scrawny twigs, branches, and flimsy cardboard tombstones set against a black drop. 
Tot struts about gregariously, in his "Inspector Clay" suit. He chats up the CREW. 
TOR I am so happy!  Finally I am star wit dialogue!  I memorized every wordt. Eddie will be so proud! 
The Baptists chase Ed around.  They wave the script. 
REYNOLDS Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood, we have a few questions -- 
REVEREND LEMON The script refers on numerous occasions to graverobbing.  Now we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground highly offensive. It's blasphemy. 
ED (very annoyed) What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake! 
REVEREND LEMON (shocked) Mr. Wood! 
REYNOLDS Yes, about that title, it strikes us as very inflammatory.  Why don't we change it to "Plan Nine From Outer Space"? 
Ed shakes his head. 
ED That's ridiculous! 
WIPE TO: 
CEMETERY SET 
They're filming the COPS arriving at the pitch-black cemetery. There's a prop police car, and an assistant blows fog in. 
ED And, ACTION! 
Tor steps onto the set 
TOR (as Inspector Clay) "Medicul eksaminer been aroundt yet?" 
COP "Just left.  The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time." 
TOR "You get statement frumk vitnesses?" 
COP "Yeah, but they're pretty scared." 
TOR "Findink mess like dis oughta make anyone frightened.  Have one of da boyz take dem back to town.  You take jarge." 
ON THE CREW 
Everybody grices, trying to understand Tor.  The SCRIPT GIRL shakes her head. 
The Baptists angrily pull Ed aside. 
REYNOLDS What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible! 
ED Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give somebody the dialogue. 
REVEREND LEMON That's not an answer. 
WIPE TO: 
ANOTHER SCENE BEING SHOT - LATER 
As Inspector Clay, Tor wanders around the "cemtery," waving his flashlight and nervously fingering his gun. 
Ed grins at the Baptists. 
ED See, no talking.  Isn't he good? (he grabs his MEGAPHONE) CUE DR. TOM! 
DR. TOM (o.s.) Now? 
ED YES, NOW!  LURK HIM.  AND BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR FACE COVERED!

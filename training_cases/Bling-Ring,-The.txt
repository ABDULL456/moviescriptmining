1   EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT                             1 
A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills. 
One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat suit stumbles. 
DRUNK GIRL (NICKI) (laughing) Shit. 
GIRL 1 (REBECCA) C'mon. Hurry up. 
They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the bottom of the chain link fence. 
She rolls under, and the others follow. 
A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house. 
They've done this before, they have it down. 
One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back window open. 
A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as she climbs inside into a laundry room. 
She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they slip inside. Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area. She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is totally cool and composed. 
She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye- brow. 
REBECCA Let's go shopping! 
And she pulls open the closet door. 
CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags. 
A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a Louis Vuitton duffle bag.

An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through. 
A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of prescription pills and dumps them in a bag. 
We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags. 
Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a mirror posing, then gets back to it.

The kids exit with their hoods up, carrying out the Louis Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry. 
CUT TO: The kids make their get-away: 
One girl, NICKI leans over and throws-up on their way out. 
They get into the Toyota and peel out.

LAURIE (CONT'D) What time did you get home last night? 
SAM Uh...late. 
LAURIE You know it's a school night. 
NICKI We know... 
Laurie tries to sound cheerful and in control. 
LAURIE Let's have our morning prayer and then we'll meet in the living room at eight to start today's lesson on the laws of attraction, OK? 
They join hands as Laurie enthusiastically leads them in her prayer. 
LAURIE (CONT'D) My chief aim in life is to continually strive to express my greatest potential as a spiritual human being and contributor to the greater good for our planet and all those who live on it. I know that I have the ability to reach my aim in life, by persistent action and that the thoughts of my mind will reproduce themselves in outward physical reality. I will channel my energy towards my aim in life with graciousness and loving kindness to myself and others. 
LAURIE AND GIRLS (IN UNISON) And so it is. 
LAURIE Wahoo!

In a bedroom, Rebecca's older sister SARAH, 19, is selling little baggies of coke.

There's a page of `Tweets of the Week' including a picture of Demi Moore posing in a bikini in her bathroom.

REBECCA Let's go there! Do you think we could find a way in?

They walk in the quiet house and turn on the light, as little spider monkeys in a cage jump toward them and screech. Rebecca and Marc jump back, he yells. Rebecca glares at him to be cool. 
MARC Oh my fucking god. 
REBECCA They're her pet monkeys. Hi guys. 
She leans forward and makes a cute face at the monkey who hisses at her. 
They continue through the house looking around. 
They pass a gilded gold-framed couch with pillows with Paris' photo silk screened on them. 
They pass a wall of photos of Paris Hilton and her many magazine covers, as they go upstairs. Marc is nervous, Rebecca is cool and focused. 
He paces and is on the look out, while she looks for stuff. 
MARC Let's get the fuck out of here. 
REBECCA It's fine, it's fine...let's keep going. 
They go into her dressing area. It's a mess, clothes all over the floor. Rebecca picks up some small purses and finds crumpled fifties and hundred dollar bills that she takes.

The room is filled with Buddha statues and Balinese wood carved furniture and candles. 
The girls are flipping through magazines. LAURIE (CONT'D) Put the phone away...ok you guys, today's lesson is about character development. In "The Secret" we talk about the law of attraction and we want to be careful about the people we surround ourselves with because we become the average of those people. So we're going to make a visual board of people who are demonstrating good character, like Angelina Jolie. So what are some qualities you admire about her?

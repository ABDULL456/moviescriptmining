BEGIN OPENING CREDITS: 
A1   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT                               A1 
CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET BRIDGE." 
ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE. 
It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN THE DISTANCE, police lights approach. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
1    EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                              1 
THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY. 
POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on... 
The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to his body. His left holds a GUN! 
Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND. 
A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the camera... 
KAREN CROSS ... Police on scene are approaching the suspect. They're at the center of the Bridge now. 
The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT! 
FADE TO BLACK. 
SUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING OUT! 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004         2. 
KAREN CROSS (OS) We have shots fired. Shots have been fired... Both the suspect and his hostage are down... Police are moving in... Oh my God. 
FADE IN: 
2    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                 2 
A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS, HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND TONIC, is... 
DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood. The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face. 
IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE: most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.) 
KAREN CROSS (OS) After a two month investigation, Det. Jason York has been relieved of duty for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John Curtis. Key testimony against York came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was on scene that night. The Seattle Police Department is handing this case over to the King County District Attorney's office. Criminal charges are expected. 
3    ON A TELEVISION SCREEN--                                       3 
The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic. 
JENKINS In a civilized society, the men and women entrusted with serving and protecting the community are to be held accountable just like everyone else. Simply put... Just because you are a cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to you. This is no longer the wild, wild west. 
3A   EXT.   KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY (THROUGH TV CAMERA)      3A 
KAREN CROSS stands on the steps, a PHOTO of Conners appears. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004            3. 
KAREN CROSS This same review board last week found Quentin Conners, Det. York's partner, "not responsible" for the same shooting. He remains on suspension without pay. 
3B   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                    3B 
Conners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of Conners and a YOUNG WOMAN (TEDDY) during happy times. He stares at the photo, finishes his drink. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
END OPENING CREDITS. 
4    EXT.   SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING                               4 
A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city... 
5    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               5 
An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC, street and pedestrian, go about their business. 
ACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop. 
Lorenz nods. 
10B   INT.   THE LOBBY--                                           10B 
BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around. 
11    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                       11 
Jenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him... 
HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around her. 
JENKINS Have you seen my watch? 
Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't love, this is a relationship of convenience. 
Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one last check in the mirror... 
JENKINS This was fun. You should get out of bed. You'll be late for work. 
And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to close, then collapses back onto the bed. 
12    INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK             12 
PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies the detonation device and... 
BLACK CLAD #2 (into his headset) Fire in the hole. 
He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE VAULT! 
13    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                            13 
A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected. 
BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS-- 
An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON! 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004         7. 
BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS profusely from his neck, not dead yet. 
Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4. 
LORENZ What do you think you're doing? 
BLACK CLAD #4 Fucker pushed the alarm. 
Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice. 
LORENZ It would've made more sense to shoot him before he pushes the fucking alarm. Not after. (looks at the Eager Teller) Jesus. 
Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's head and... 
LORENZ And... If you're going to do something. (FIRES his weapon!) Do it right. 
The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks his watch... 9:26 a.m. 
LORENZ (into microphone) Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock. (to Black Clad #4) Get these people out of the way. 
A14   EXT.   MOTEL - DAY - ESTABLISHING                              A14 
The Four Seasons it ain't. 
14    INT.   SHOWER/ MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY                             14 
There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off screen, chimes! 
15    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                      15 
Teddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager.   The number: 911. She picks up the TELEPHONE, dials. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004             8. 
TEDDY (beat, then) This is Detective Galloway. 
16    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                                16 
SIRENS BLARE... POLICE CARS brake hard, blocking traffic. OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out! 
HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things... 
DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow him. 
CALLO (into his radio) I want all points of entry identified and covered. We need SWAT here now. Have emergency crews standing by! 
OFFICER AT BANK (re: the Media) Didn't take them long. 
CALLO Set a perimeter.    Move'em back. 
DEKKER Because people's lives are at stake. That takes priority over your ego. 
CONNERS (to Jenkins; re: Dekker) You may want to put a leash on him. (beat; thinks) Saying I did want to help... I'm still suspended or did that slip your mind? 
JENKINS The commissioner's office has ordered me to reinstate you. As of now, you're back on the force. 
CONNERS Just like that? 
JENKINS Just like that. (beat) I won't, however, unleash you alone. 
CONNERS Always a catch. 
JENKINS Shane, here, is your new partner. Consider him a younger version of me, looking over your shoulder, watching every move you make. 
The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners. 
JENKINS Don't think I endorse this. If it were my call, you'd be with your partner... 
CONNERS You mean ex-partner. 
JENKINS ... On the unemployment line with him. 
CONNERS For a moment there, I thought you cared. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004          12. 
JENKINS I care about those innocent people down there. I hope to God someone hasn't made a monumental mistake letting you back in. 
CONNERS I appreciate the words of encouragement and the confidence you have in me. I look forward to the continuing, positive relationship we've shared in the past.

26   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 10:27 AM - DAY                   26 
POLICE CORRAL the ever-growing group of SPECTATORS. 
A SWAT TRUCK pulls up, the BACK DOORS FLY OPEN!     SWAT exit in a flurry, race into position. 
Amidst the commotion... JENKINS' CAR navigates the scene, stops next to... KAREN CROSS immediately recognizes Conners, orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him. 
Conners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head towards the crime scene, when... 
KAREN CROSS Detective Conners? Detective, can we have a few words? 
Conners turns, recognizes Karen.    Relishing the moment... 
CONNERS I'll give you two... (pauses for effect) Blow me. If you need a follow-up comment let me know? (to Dekker) Cunt made her career off me. 
AT THE POLICE TECH VAN-- 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004         13. 
Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop. 
Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him. 
CONNERS Teddy, Vincent... (completely ignores Callo) ... Nice to see you both. 
JENKINS Conners has been reinstated to full active duty. It's his scene. 
This info comes as a surprise.   Especially to Callo. 
CALLO The last hostage situation this guy headed, an innocent civilian died. 
CONNERS I was not responsible... 
CALLO You never are. That girl would be alive today if it weren't for your cowboy antics. You destroy lives. 
CONNERS Fuck you. Look who's talking about destroying lives. 
JENKINS Decision's been made, Bernie. 
CALLO I was first on scene and I have seniority. (pleads) Don't do this, Martin. 
JENKINS We'll talk about it later.   Take a hike. 
CALLO (beat) Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from home. 
Callo exits. 
CONNERS (sarcastic) I'm going to miss him. 
CONNERS What else will I be looking for? 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          17. 
LORENZ Demands... Probably too much to ask for you and your colleagues to pack up and go home? 
CONNERS Safe to say. 
LORENZ Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you shortly. 
CONNERS Lorenz... 
LORENZ Don't worry, I have no plans until sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's going to be a long one. 
CONNERS Wait, we're talking here... 
LORENZ Patience, Detective. We don't want another Pearl Street Bridge, do we? 
Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge. Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP. 
DAX He's off. 
30   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                             30 
THE CROWDS GROW. The MEDIA BUILD UP INTENSIFIES.    THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... Karen Cross reports: 
KAREN CROSS This standoff is approaching two hours now. We've been told Detectives have made contact with the perpetrators inside the bank. Whether any specific demands have been made, we cannot confirm. As soon as we know something, we'll pass it on to you. Reporting live, Karen Cross, channel two news. 
CAMERAMAN (OS) We're clear. 
KAREN CROSS Who the hell writes this shit?

30A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                       30A 
Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys, an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun. 
#1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear, repeats. 
31    POLICE TECH VAN--                                               31 
The Detectives huddle.   Impatience level high. 
CONNERS (to Dax) Try again. 
DAX He's not picking up. 
CONNERS (stern) Try again. 
Dax, humbled, does as ordered. 
CONNERS (glances about) Where's our fearless Captain? 
DEKKER Went uptown to brief the Commissioner. 
CONNERS So you're here in his place. 
Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices. 
CONNERS Nicotine gum. 
TEDDY (shock) You quit smoking? 
CONNERS Caffeine, too, if you must know. (Another shock) What? A man's capable of change. 
TEDDY A man, yes. You...     I'm not so sure. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004           19. 
CONNERS Don't worry, I still have a vice or two. 
DAX Fifteen rings.    No answer. 
CONNERS Try again in five. 
TEDDY What are they doing in there? 
VINCENT Wasting our time. 
Time. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it together. 
CONNERS Precisely. He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct. He's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before. He's heavily armed and well-connected. He knows he's surrounded. He hasn't asked for a damned thing. He drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait. He's buying time. Why? 
VINCENT (brainstorming) To figure out his next move.    He wasn't expecting us. 
DEKKER No, he wasn't expecting you. He said, he thought you were still suspended. 
CONNERS Probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me. Giving him the time he needs. 
LORENZ They're comin'. 
34 A   IN THE LOBBY--                                                 34 A 
Black Clad #1 and #4 drag the TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, KICKING AND SCREAMING, towards the anchor/pulley! 
RANDOM HOSTAGE #1 What are you doing?! Let me go! 
#1 & #4 fasten the Hostages to ropes connected to the pulleys!

35   EXT.   FRONT ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY            35 
Behind a barricade, Conners crouches down beside Dekker and his SWAT Team. 
CONNERS (into radio) Let's go around the horn. 
36   ON THE WEST SIDE--                                              36 
Teddy, Vincent and a SWAT Team... 
TEDDY One, check. 
37   OMIT                                                            37 
38   ON THE EAST SIDE--                                              38 
The SWAT Commander and his team... 
SWAT COMMANDER Two, check. 
39   ROOFTOP #1--                                                    39 
A SNIPER holds his eye to the scope. 
SNIPER #1 Three, check. 
40   ROOFTOP #2--                                                    40 
SNIPER #2 Four, check. 
41   AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE--                                          41 
Conners glances at his watch... 
CONNERS Here we go... Cut the power. 
42   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                   42 
Instantly...   EVERYTHING BLACKS OUT!   LIGHTS, COMPUTERS, etc. 
THE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY.   PANIC evident.   Lorenz and the Black Clad calmly react. 
43   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                   43 
Conners makes the call... 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004          24. 
CONNERS Doors! 
Each Team makes their move, when... 
44    INT.   PRIVATE OFFICE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                   44 
LORENZ (into his headset) Now! 
44A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                           44A 
Black Clad #1 PULLS A CORD, instantly...     ALL THE CURTAINS DROP! 
45    EXT.   MAIN ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                    45 
Conners freezes... 
CONNERS (into radio) Hold it. What just happened? 
45A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                           45A 
Black Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached to the pulleys race up the ropes! The HOSTAGES have their feet yanked out from under them, then shoot INTO THE AIR! 
They SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR, then... 
45B   EXT.   MAIN ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY             45B 
SHOOT to the TOP OF THE WALL-LENGTH WINDOWS! They hang, dangle helplessly! On FULL DISPLAY for the outside to see! 
DEKKER (looking up at the windows) Holy shit...?! 
55    A BANK CORRIDOR--                                              55 
Dekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly... 
A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH, carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker. 
55A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                        55A 
Conners strides out from behind the counters... 
CONNERS (to Vincent) See anyone come your way? 
VINCENT No.   No one went by me. 
The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR. 
SWAT COMMANDER Detectives... We found these. 
Conners takes one of the masks in his hands. 
CONNERS We let them walk right past us. 
Dekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED. Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally... 
CONNERS SHIT! 
TIME CUT TO: 
56    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:48 AM - DAY                 56 
An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under control. 
Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body into their truck. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004        28. 
57   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         57 
Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners. 
VINCENT We got the one Teller dead, the two that were strung up are alive, but in critical condition. A few SWAT incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's the worst of it. Now, depending on who you talk to... there was anywhere from five to nine perps. And nobody got a good look at any of'em, wore their masks the whole time. Dax is rounding up the security tapes now. That should give us a firm number. 
CONNERS I want background checks on every hostage. They're all suspects until they're not. 
VINCENT You don't think one of them's still here? 
CONNERS After this, nothing would surprise me. 
58   EXT.   TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                58 
Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside with them. Dekker approaches. 
DEKKER Excuse me... I need to listen to the conversation between Lorenz and Conners again? 
DAX It'll have to wait. 
DEKKER How long? 
DAX Hour.   Maybe more. 
DEKKER (too long) Show me how to play it myself? 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004        29. 
DAX Look, this isn't how it works. I don't take orders from you. I don't know you and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're going to have to wait. 
Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds into the van. Dax turns, notices. 
59   INT.   TECH VAN                                              59 
Dekker inspects the equipment, when... 
DAX What the hell are you doing? 
DEKKER Along with whatever they stole and this war zone they left behind... A man's dead, and the killers are running free. I don't have time to wait. (looks at the equipment) I'll figure it out. Thanks for your help. 
DAX (relents, demonstrates) Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop, rewind... It's just like using a tape player. Headphones are jacked in. Tape's already inside. 
DEKKER Thank you. 
60   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                          60 
A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt. 
61   INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                61 
A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank. The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the monitors. Conners stands nearby. 
CONNERS (re: the eighth monitor) What's with this one? 
BAM!   ANOTHER BLAST!    This one FROM THE BEDROOM! 
Conners DROPS TO THE FLOOR, falls back into the kitchen! 
TEDDY QUENTIN! 
Dekker enters the apartment. 
70A   IN THE HALLWAY--                                                 70A

70B   APARTMENT HALLWAY/ KITCHEN--                                     70B 
Dekker passes the kitchen door, looks in on Conners. 
DEKKER You hit? 
CONNERS (in pain) I'm fine. 
OFF SCREEN: A Window BREAKS...      from the bedroom.   Dekker heads that way. 
71    IN THE BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM                                          71 
DAMON RICHARDS crawls onto the FIRE ESCAPE! 
DEKKER (in the doorway) FREEZE! 
But Richards doesn't.     He FIRES another shotgun BLAST! 
Dekker DUCKS BACK into the living room. He aims his gun into the bedroom without looking... RAPID FIRES! 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004           39. 
A bullet HITS Richards IN THE SHOULDER!     HE YELPS IN PAIN, but manages to...

Richards scrambles out. 
71B   INT.    BEDROOM/ LIVING ROOM - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT            71B 
Dekker looks inside the bedroom, doesn't see Richards.     He takes one step inside when... 
GINA, 20's, Latino, wearing only a pair of red panties with NO BRA, runs up behind Dekker and JUMPS ON HIS BACK, FISTS FLYING! 
Dekker pushes her down, aims his gun at her. 
DEKKER Stay down! 
Vincent enters, grabs Gina. 
DEKKER Control her! 
He does.    Dekker runs to the bedroom window, peeks out over...

76    I/E    FIRE ESCAPE/ LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                  76 
Richards... floors below. Clutches his shoulder in pain, yet fearlessly charges downward. 
DEKKER (into radio) Suspect fleeing on foot. North on Curson. He's armed and dangerous.      I'm in pursuit. 
DISPATCH OFFICER (VO) (a beat; over radio) And who are you? 
But he's already gone. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004               40. 
DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs. 
Richards... drops to the pavement.      Heads for the street. 
DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD, WIPES OUT! 
Jumps up, shaking it off.    STAYS IN PURSUIT! 
77    EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                       77 
Dekker races around the corner...    A FORD F-350 SPINS the corner. Targeting DEKKER! 
Dekker jerks out his Glock.    FIRES! 
Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed. 
CONNERS You sure that's what you want? 
GINA Yeah. 
CONNERS Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll make. The first will be to the public defender's office. The second to children's services. 
GINA What? 
Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and lonely girl. 
CONNERS It's simple... if you insist on a lawyer, I take your kids. 
GINA No. 
CONNERS Not like you cared about them anyway. You were ready to fly the coop with "Shit-for-brains." 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004      49. 
GINA No.   You can't do that. 
CONNERS I can and I will. 
GINA Don't. 
CONNERS Tell me what I want to know! 
Dekker stares incredulously at Conners. 
GINA (broken) I don't know anything.     Please don't take my kids. Please. 
Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth. Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders. 
CONNERS Get her some coffee...     Something hot. 
84   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY             84 
Dekker and Conners... 
DEKKER You believe her? 
CONNERS I think for the first time in that girl's life she's telling the truth. 
DEKKER You had to know, once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us would have been inadmissable. 
CONNERS Who would've known? It would've been my word against hers. Who do you think the jury would've believed? 
DEKKER Justice by any means.    Even if you cross the line. 
CONNERS The only line around here is the `blue line', you cross that one, then you got (MORE)

CONNERS (cont'd) problems. Ask Callo, he knows what I'm talking about. 
Teddy enters, hands Conners a sheet of paper with: "EVIDENCE: ITEM #4958378" scribbled on it. 
TEDDY Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me... According to our computers, that money should be downstairs. 
85   INT.   EVIDENCE ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT                85 
Occupies almost the entire basement of the police station.      A STEEL CAGE protects the contents. 
AT THE FRONT COUNTER-- 
Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present. Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone. 
Dekker RINGS the service bell. 
Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners. 
CONNERS (cold) Buzz us in. 
HARRY (colder) You gotta sign first. 
Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down. 
HARRY I heard you were back. Kinda liked not having you around, Conners. 
Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then reluctantly BUZZES them in. 
CONNERS Have another donut, Frankie. 
Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number. 
CONNERS That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the city's biggest source of contraband. Drugs. Weapons. Cash. (MORE)

SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER... 
OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE Wife came home approximately forty-five minutes ago. Found him here. None of the neighbors heard anything. There's no forced entry and no one saw anyone fleeing the scene. 
Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX. 
VINCENT Blueprints from the bank, schematics, pictures... Also, about a dozen internet articles on the Saudi Prince. Found it behind the furnace. 
Conners nods. 
DEKKER Well, that's it, right? 
Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS UP... 
CALLO (VO) You've reached the Callo residence.   No one can get to the phone right now. Please leave a message. 
Then...   After the TONE... 
LORENZ (VO) (from the machine) Detective Conners... Are you there? 
Conners and everyone turns, listens. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
89   INT.   DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    89 
Lorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something. 
LORENZ Are you connecting the dots? Are you putting it together? Is the pattern emerging? They wouldn't punish you, but I will. 
Conners GRABS the phone... 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004         55. 
LORENZ Vengeance will be mine, Detective. 
CONNERS Then come and get me you piece of shit. 
Lorenz smiles, hangs up.   He resumes staring at the wall in front of him. 
REVEAL: HUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS - ALL OF CONNERS - DECORATE THE WALL! 
90   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - DAY                                 90 
Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches... 
CONNERS What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with. 
DEKKER You'd think a cop would be smarter. 
CONNERS As cops we come across every temptation in the book. Money, drugs, power. We'd all like to think we can resist any urge, but... We're not saints. 
DEKKER So, Callo was involved and now they're dragging you into it. Why? 
CONNERS Man said he wanted vengeance. 
DEKKER Piss anyone off lately? 
CONNERS Me? 
Both can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up. 
JENKINS I just got off the phone with Agent Doyle. After the Charlotte break in, the Prince withdrew all his possessions from every safe deposit box in this country. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004       56. 
DEKKER Let me get this straight, they didn't touch the cash or the safe deposit boxes. So, they... break into a bank, blow it up, and steal nothing? (to Conners) Still make sense to you? 
CONNERS Nothing about today makes sense. 
Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home. 
Dekker's mind works overtime, then... 
DEKKER "Return to the earth now if your mind is troubled and your heart is uncertain. For it is by returning to the beginning that we can clearly see the path." 
Conners and Jenkins share a confused look. 
CONNERS (to Jenkins) Don't look at me, he's your find. 
JENKINS Say that again, Detective? 
DEKKER We go back to where this all started. We go to the bank. 
91     EXT.   SEATTLE - 6:08 PM - NIGHT                              91 
The sun SINKS below the horizon. 
ITALIAN HOST (confused) He's your brother? 
CONNERS No. 
ITALIAN HOST No matter, no matter...     I bring you bottle of house wine! 
DEKKER We're still on duty.     No wine. 
ITALIAN HOST (insulted) No wine? 
CONNERS A little wine. 
ITALIAN HOST That's better. 
They get to the table, Conners looks at it. 
CONNERS Last time I was here, you said that table in the corner was the "best in the house." 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004        60. 
ITALIAN HOST It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best table in house. Now relax, I bring you food. 
95   LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--                               95 
A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry. 
AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE-- 
Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day. 
Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the Detectives, admires in their closeness. 
CONNERS Shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about "returning to the beginning path" or something? 
DEKKER It's a Buddhist story. 
CONNERS We're all ears. 
DEKKER One day the Buddha found his heart in turmoil. So he retreats to the forest, to the earth, to the base of a great tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this elephant comes up and tells Buddha he doesn't like seeing him discouraged. 
TEDDY He can talk to an elephant? 
DEKKER He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th level of consciousness. He's capable of communicating with plants, trees... even rocks. 
VINCENT Rocks? 
DEKKER You asked. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004         61. 
CONNERS Continue. 
DEKKER The Buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from, the beginning, to find the path, the answer. So when you hit a dead end, go back to the beginning to find your way. Or something like that. 
CONNERS We have a genuine philosopher in our midst. 
VINCENT You're a Buddhist? 
DEKKER No. Just something I picked up along the way. 
TEDDY But you're religious? 
DEKKER Not particularly. 
Conners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses himself to go to the men's room. 
DEKKER You're all pretty tight. 
TEDDY We've been through a lot together. 
DEKKER I guess I just thought... I don't know. With all the trouble he's been in lately, coming back from suspension, everyone would treat him differently. 
VINCENT You can't believe what you read or see on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners is stronger. He's one of the best. Even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked, he was in control. That doesn't just happen. He's just that good. 
TEDDY Excuse me. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004          62. 
Teddy heads for the ladies room. 
VINCENT What was the Buddha looking for? 
DEKKER The divine in himself. 
Art's confused.    Dekker's cellphone rings. 
DEKKER How long does it usually take to for fingerprints to be ID'd? 
VINCENT Hours, maybe days.    We could be waiting a while. 
104   INT.   FRONT HALL - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                     104 
THE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No indications that these two just met today. 
The House is almost PITCH BLACK. 
Conners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to take the back of the house. 
105   INT.   KITCHEN - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                        105 
Dekker proceeds inside.   After a scan, the kitchen's clean.

Conners emerges from the stairway. 
107   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    107 
Dekker steps from the back hallway into the DARKENED living room. Eyes straight ahead and sharp. What he doesn't see... 
LORENZ STEPS FROM THE DARKNESS. 
108   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                  108 
Conners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he notices... 
ON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND Dekker! 
109   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    109 
Dekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads for the front hallway. 
Lorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker. 
Simultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the living room wall -- LORENZ OPENS FIRE, UNLOADS A FULL CLIP! 
A BULLET GRAZES DEKKER'S SHOULDER!    THE REST LITTER THE WALLS, BLOW APART A MIRROR! 
Conners and Dekker, behind the wall, regroup. Conners RETALIATES. FIRES FOUR ROUNDS AT LORENZ, but...

DEKKER Yeah. 
114    EXT.   BACKYARD - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                      114 
Dekker and Conners emerge from the house...     LORENZ, on the other end of the yard, OPENS FIRE! 
The Detectives DIVE FOR COVER! 
Lorenz exits through the fence's door...

Jenkins stands before Conners, Dekker, Teddy, Vincent and two new Detectives - DET. TOMMY BRANCH, 40's and DET. JEROME KNIGHT, 50's. 
JENKINS He's also the brother of John Curtis, the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street Bridge. (Moving on) Richards testifies that he was hired by Curtis to pull the bank job with a dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo. Curtis hoped that Conners would take the fall for American National turning ugly, disgracing him even further. We also have the names of two more accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander Harrington. Everyone was set to meet tonight at ten and we have that address. (beat) After finding Callo and Lei dead today, (MORE)

DEKKER (cont'd) that means to a twelve year old? (beat) Because he died on the job, he's a hero? Never made sense to me. 
CONNERS So why become a cop? 
DEKKER Finish what he started. Every day he went out, trying to do some good. Help the people who couldn't help themselves, just give'em a chance is what he always said. Didn't always work out right, but he tried. You tried to help save that girl on the bridge. If you weren't there, the girl still would've died. She had a chance because you were there. That's all we can do.

Dekker stands outside the closet. He opens it quickly, but it's empty. Except for... On the far wall -- HUNDREDS OF PICTURES of Conners. The same shrine we saw Lorenz in front of earlier. 
135A   DINING ROOM--                                                135A 
Vincent swings in from one entrance, Teddy the other.   She takes a cautious step out, when... 
BAM! A BULLET ZINGS PAST TEDDY - HITS THE WALL BESIDE HER HEAD! 
HARRINGTON, from the corner, takes aim again! 
VINCENT drops to the floor, aims through the dining room table legs and FIRES! 
THE BULLET TEARS INTO HARRINGTON'S SHIN!   He SCREAMS IN PAIN, DROPS TO THE FLOOR! 
135B   FIRST BEDROOM--                                              135B 
Conners HEARS THE SHOTS, runs out of the room. 
136    SECOND BEDROOM--                                              136 
So does Dekker.

Teddy moves in on Harrington. 
TEDDY Drop the gun! 
Harrington holds his gun UP AND OUT towards Teddy.   Is he aiming or surrendering? 
TEDDY Drop it now. Last warning. 
But he doesn't. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004              76. 
BAM! TEDDY PUTS A HOLE IN HARRINGTON'S CHEST!       He slumps down, dead. 
137    UPSTAIRS HALLWAY--                                               137 
Conners and Dekker meet by the top of the stairs. 
CONNERS Teddy!?     What's happening? 
Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs. 
VINCENT We got one down. He's dead. 
138    UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ STAIRCASE--                                    138 
Dekker and Conners share a look, disappointed.      But then something catches Conners's eye. 
BEHIND DEKKER...     a door OPENS...   LAMAR GALT AIMS HIS WEAPON! 
CONNERS GUN! 
GALT FIRES! 
Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of time! 
DEKKER Lorenz...    Curtis...   Called me. 
JENKINS He called you? 
DEKKER He said he didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it. He said Callo was insignificant. But without Callo he wouldn't have had the knowledge of our department and... (grabs a clipboard) ... He wouldn't have had the front money to hire the crew. 
JENKINS He was screwing with your head. Go home, Shane. You did good today. Your Dad would be proud. Get some sleep. There will be more bad guys tomorrow. 
Jenkins exits. 
Dekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers... Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The signatures. 
154   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE P. D. - 1:43 AM        154 
Harry Hume, the evidence room cop, out of uniform, walks inside, sits across from... Dekker, already here, with two DIFFERENT FILES available to him. 
HARRY I was in bed already.     This couldn't wait til morning. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004          85. 
DEKKER (cold) How did he come at you, Harry? It's the only thing that doesn't make sense. 
HARRY What are you talking about? 
DEKKER All day long we thought Callo was the dirty cop. All day long we were wrong. 
Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry. 
DEKKER That's the sign-out sheet from the evidence room. Here's one of Callo's reports. Here's another one... and another -- 
The SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine them. He knows. 
DEKKER They're not the same signature, Harry. They're not even close. 
HARRY (shrugs it off) Maybe he had a cramp in his hand.    I don't know. 
DEKKER (re: file #1) This is your file... You were reprimanded, a month ago after you confronted Callo at the courthouse. You punched him. That ring a bell? 
HARRY And I'd do it again. Cops who testify against cops shouldn't be breathing the same air I do. There's a line you don't cross! 
DEKKER So you set him up! You forged Callo's signature, you gave him the money and you helped him with his plan because you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry cause I know. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004           86. 
HARRY OF COURSE HE GOT A RAW DEAL AT PEARL STREET BRIDGE! EVERYBODY GOT A RAW DEAL!

157   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK                157 
Images FLASH before our eyes... 
The RAIN POURS DOWN!   An SUV CRASHES into a STALLED-OUT VEHICLE. 
JOHN CURTIS (THE KIDNAPPER) crawls out of the SUV! He sees cop's lights approaching. He drags LISA REANN (THE VICTIM) out of the truck. A BRIGHT LIGHT (from a helicopter) strikes John in the eyes! 
LIGHTS!   EVERYWHERE BRIGHT!   It's all very BLINDING! 
COPS block both sides of the bridge!   TV REPORTERS AT EITHER END OF THE BRIDGE! 
John holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S SHOULDER... CONNERS APPROACHES, GUN DRAWN! 
Lisa struggles, tears streaming down her face. 
A FLASH OF LIGHT ENVELOPS CONNERS! 
CLOSE ON... A GUN FIRES! 
John DROPS lifeless to the pavement.

Harry pounds the table... 
DEKKER You're helping a cop killer, Harry. You're a year from pension. This is how you want to go out? 
HARRY My conscience is clean. 
DEKKER This has been a very long, trying day. And I'm tired. We're chasing a (MORE) 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004          87. 
DEKKER (cont'd) phantom. Just when we have him... he disappears. He's been two steps ahead of Conners and me all day. 
HARRY Of course he has.   Who knows Conners better than him? 
DEKKER Detective Galloway... 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004           90.

165   EXT.   HARBOR NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                       165 
A BEAUTIFUL, BRIGHT FULL MOON hangs in the dark sky. Dozens of COMMERCIAL LINERS, CARGO SHIPS and SEAPLANES line the piers.

167   INT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        167 
A scattering of PATRONS, some at the counter, some in booths. A PRETTY WAITRESS, 20's, rings up a bill. 
PRETTY WAITRESS That'll be $8.48, please. 
YORK AKA LORENZ/CURTIS hands the Cashier a twenty. 
YORK Keep the change. 
PRETTY WAITRESS Thanks, mister. 
A BUS BOY, 19, carries some garbage out the back. 
York heads for the exits, opens the door and... STEPS OUTSIDE! 
168   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        168 
York hoofs two steps outside when... 
A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT STRIKES YORK'S FACE!   He shields his eyes... 
BEHIND THE LIGHTS... Dekker and Teddy aim their pistols. 
DEKKER Jason York... this is the police. Put your hands in the air and slowly get on your knees. Do it. Now! 
YORK Don't shoot. You win. 
York RAISES HIS HANDS HIGH, takes a small step backwards. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004          91. 
DEKKER Get down on the pavement! 
YORK I'm cooperating.   You win. 
York takes another tiny back-step. 
DEKKER GET DOWN NOW! FINAL WARNING! 
YORK I SAID... I... GIVE... UP! 
York bends down to ONE KNEE, DRAWS A 9 MM... FIRES! 
DEKKER AND TEDDY DUCK FOR COVER! 
YORK RUSHES BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT! 
DEKKER AND TEDDY RETURN FIRE! 
THE GLASS WINDOW DOORS EXPLODE! 
DEKKER (to Teddy) Take the back! 
169   INT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                         169 
CUSTOMERS SCREAM AS... 
Dekker enters, surveys the restaurant. 
A LOUD BANGING FROM THE KITCHEN! 
Dekker approaches the kitchen door, pushes it open and... 
BAM!   BAM!    BAM!   BULLETS RIP APART THE KITCHEN DOOR! 
Dekker spins out of the way. As gunfire stops, Dekker KICKS through the door! Leans in gun first... 
170   THE KITCHEN --                                                170 
In the center of the room... York neck-holds the Pretty Waitress, gun to her head. 
Dekker moves in... 
YORK Was it Harry? It was Harry, right? That fat fuck! 
Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles. Until... 
BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!         He dive-rolls for cover as... 
ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!        Out of ammo. 
Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE! 
York leaps off the backside of the container! 
Dekker gives chase. As he circles the container... no York. Instead, he finds a DOCK. 
174   EXT.   DOCK - NIGHT                                             174 
A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT and at the end... A SEAPLANE. 
Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate. EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane. 
As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM. From on top of the TUG BOAT! 
Dekker turns just as... 
York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.    As Dekker struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES! 
York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down! 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004              95. 
Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water. 
York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab, when... 
At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground beneath the water. 
Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He falls to the planks. 
York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM. 
Dekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder. 
YORK I have come this far...      I will not be denied. 
Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two! 
Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily. 
York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking. 
Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG! 
York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE! He twists, spinning around, falling down onto... 
... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his chest... POPS out his back! 
York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker. Then go dead. 
Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at York's body. 
DISSOLVE TO:

TEDDY We used to spend all day   Sunday just reading in bed. I would    read the paper and he would read one of   his billion books. I didn't deserve    him. I knew that. But I still loved    him. 
Teddy stares out the window... 
POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross. 
TEDDY He's the only man I ever loved. (beat) Did we all get shot today? 
They can't help but laugh. 
DEKKER They said in the city I'd be busy. Every day like this? 
TEDDY Pretty much. 
DEKKER Great.    I wonder what's next? 
TEDDY For me...    a long vacation. 
Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.      Dekker goes to pay the check. 
Dekker scans the line up of people.      Nothing. 
BY THE MEN'S ROOM-- 
A MAN, 40's, in DISGUISE (Brown Wig), SPIES Dekker.          He picks up a CELLPHONE, DIALS... DEKKER'S CELLPHONE RINGS.           He quickly picks it up. 
CONNERS (VO) There's a passage in the Surangama Sutra which, roughly translated means: "Things are not what they appear to be: nor are they otherwise." 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004                99. 
DEKKER Conners? 
Dekker again scans the line -- he's not there.         He scans all the faces AGAIN, but still nothing. 
CONNERS (VO) Think about that a minute... Doesn't that blow your mind? (beat) What gave me away? 
DEKKER Ten bucks. 
CONNERS (VO) At the diner. That's right...       Well, to err is human. 
Dekker SPOTS A MAN ON A CELLPHONE, he runs up to him, SPINS HIM AROUND, BUT... It's not Conners. 
CONNERS (VO) Was it Harry that gave him up? 
DEKKER Harry and the phone call. He called me, said Callo was insignificant. Threw up a red flag. 
CONNERS (VO) That wasn't him. That was my mistake. I called you.

BACK TO: 
188   INT.   WESTERN AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY - THE PRESENT            188 
CONNERS (VO) York always thought "the plan" was flawless. He was cocky. I told him you have to leave room for error. You can't always predict how it's all going to play out. A random camera catches an image of Richards, the scent on the money... you. You were the biggest wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory... When you got that... I was impressed. 
DEKKER All day long, we were trying to find out who the inside source was... it was you. 
CONNERS The more information you gather, from as many sources as possible, no matter how unpleasant the methods are, the better. And while I'd like to take sole credit it was a team effort. 
DEKKER (beat) Teddy's pretty devastated about your death. 
CONNERS (VO) She'll get over it.

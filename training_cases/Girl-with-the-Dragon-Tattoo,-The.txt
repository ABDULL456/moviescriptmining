1    EXT. SWEDEN - DAY                                               1 
A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -

2    INT. CABIN - LAKE SILJAN - DAY                                  2 An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin - a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver. 
MORELL What kind is it? 
VANGER O/S I don't know.    White. 
MORELL And the frame? 
VANGER O/S Dark. 
MORELL Postmark? 
VANGER O/S Same as last time. 
MORELL No note. 
VANGER O/S No. 
He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette. Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain. Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life. 
TV NEWSCASTER V/O Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more. 
He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it, finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.

He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly- young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man- walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the editor's office. 
ERIKA Where you been? 
Erika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a mini-skirt. 
BLOMKVIST Walking.    Thinking. 
ERIKA Smoking? 
BLOMKVIST Just one. He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair. ERIKA TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety. 
BLOMKVIST I have.    Who else? ERIKA Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated. BLOMKVIST You've been on the phone all day then. 
ERIKA I'm as much to blame for this as you. 
BLOMKVIST You are?    You wrote it? ERIKA I read it.    I ran it. 
BLOMKVIST Not the same. ERIKA Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael. 
BLOMKVIST Mine is. They regard each other in another silence.      Then - 
ARMANSKY In every way. 13   INT. MILTON SECURITY - STOCKHOLM - SAME TIME - DAY          13 
The black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past coworkers who look away. 
14   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED              14 SECRETARY/INTERCOM Ms. Salander's here. 
Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom button twice to say `okay, let her in.' 
Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic- looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair - pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket - black t- shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots. 
Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me. 
ARMANSKY Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode. FRODE How do you do? 
She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him: 
SALANDER Something wrong with the report? FRODE No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it. 
SALANDER There's nothing not in it. 
FRODE Your opinion of him isn't. 
SALANDER I'm not paid to give my opinion. 
FRODE So you don't have one? 
Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually - SALANDER He's clean.   In my opinion. 
FRODE He's - excuse me? 
DOCTOR V/O He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging. Either from the fall itself, or a stroke that led to the fall. His blood pressure is still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured. And it's possible, if he does, there will be neurological damage.

23   INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT              23 
They're around the dinner table now, passing platters around. Blomkvist notices his daughter's head is bowed in silent prayer. 
BLOMKVIST Nilla?    What are you doing? PERNILLA Nothing. 
BLOMKVIST (pause) You're not serious. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ 
PERNILLA I don't want to talk about it since I know you won't approve. 
BLOMKVIST Of - (she doesn't say) Nilla. PERNILLA Light of Life. 
BLOMKVIST Light of - what? (she doesn't repeat it) What is that? 
PERNILLA You think it's all senseless but it isn't. It's more natural to believe in something than not to. 
She begins eating. Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a little sick. A cell phone rings. No one can tell - as you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out. It's Blomkvist's. BLOMKVIST Excuse me. Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps away to take the call. 
BLOMKVIST Hello. FRODE O/S Mr. Blomkvist? 
BLOMKVIST Yes. 
FRODE O/S Forgive me for intruding on your Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode. I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of (him) - 
BLOMKVIST Of course. FRODE O/S He'd like to speak to you about a private matter. 
BLOMKVIST And last, I'm sure. FRODE It's lovely in the spring. 
BLOMKVIST You said it was lovely in winter. 
FRODE This is unseasonable. 
BLOMKVIST I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm. 
FRODE Unless we get snowed in ... I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish. 
27    INT/EXT. MERCEDES - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                   27 The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any attention; just someone hunting. 
VANGER Welcome.   Come inside.    It's warm. 
28   INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY                                     28 
It is warm inside. There are fires in the fireplaces. And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly as they come through the house - VANGER Thank you for coming way out here. Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's insufficient coat. Would you like to freshen up? We'll be having dinner later. For now, hot tea is waiting. Unless you'd like a drink instead. What would you like? 
FRODE Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm. 
VANGER What? 
BLOMKVIST I can't stay for dinner. 
Vanger looks thoroughly disappointed.      Or hurt. 
VANGER Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way. 29   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                   29 
Tea service and pastries on a coffee table separate Blomkvist from Vanger, whose elderly frame is in danger of being swallowed up by a wing-back chair. 
VANGER V/O It was chaos as everyone dropped what they were doing. 
41   EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY - 1966                              41 People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge. 
VANGER V/O Police, an ambulance, fire brigade, reporter, photographer and onlookers quickly arrived from town, as those of us on the island - the family - hurried to the bridge from our side. 
The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but the other motorist is trapped. 
VANGER V/O The driver of the car - a Mr. Aronsson - was pinned and severely injured. All we could do was try to pry him out with our hands - since metal tools could spark. 
A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues - 
VANGER V/O About twenty minutes after the crash, Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. 42    INT. KITCHEN - VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966                  42 
Anna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out the window to the bridge. Harriet passes a clock that reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ... 
43    EXT. THE BRIDGE - DUSK - 1966                             43 As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help. VANGER V/O We finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital, and those of us on our side drifted back to the house. 
44    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                          44 
The family has assembled at a long dining table. 
VANGER V/O The sun was down, the excitement over, we sat down to dinner. That's when I noticed Harriet wasn't there. 
Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else, including the young man from the bridge, his jacket draped on his chair, passes platters of food around. 
VANGER V/O And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next forty years. 
44A   OMIT:   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT                        44A 
Opulent foyer. Security camera. Antique elevator cage whose cables pull the woman upstairs. Salander comes to an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement machine room. Examines tangles of phone lines, meters, Wi-Fi routers. Photographs them with a digital camera. She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer. The front door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass. 
The man is a driver/bodyguard. He continues to hold the door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an idling car and crosses to it in the rain ... Wennerstrom. 
48   EXT. VANGER'S MANOR - NIGHT                               48 
The rain here is icier and more punishing. 
VANGER V/O When the police investigation petered out, I kept at it - 
49   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT                                49 
They're eating dinner now in the dining room. 
VANGER - studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day. And for all that, he's no closer to the truth. 
BLOMKVIST I understand your frustration. But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money. VANGER We haven't discussed your fee. BLOMKVIST We don't need to. I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years. 
VANGER You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind. 
Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as Vanger refills his wine glass. VANGER Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed - or you don't. 
BLOMKVIST You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time. 
VANGER Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now. (nothing from Blomkvist) As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery. 
BLOMKVIST Mr. (Vanger) - 
VANGER I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. 
BLOMKVIST Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him. 
ERIKA There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone. 
He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue - and steps outside. BLOMKVIST It's four hours by train.   It's not the North Pole. 52   EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY                      52 The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him. He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi stand. 53   INT. TAXI - MOVING - DAY                                 53 
As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him in the rear view mirror. BLOMKVIST Think this snow's going to let up anytime soon? 
HUSSEIN This is the North Pole. 
54   EXT. COTTAGE - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                       54 
The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The taxi drives off and disappears into the snow. 55   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                       55 Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold. 
Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and a small printer. 
He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him. BLOMKVIST What.   Milk? 
He opens the old fridge.    No milk.    Nothing. 56   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                          56 
He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water. Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't. 57   INT. MARKET - HEDESTAD - DUSK                               57 
He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food. 58   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        58 
He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow, cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again. Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever - there are no cell towers anywhere around here. 
59   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        59 
Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail. 
Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. Nilsson dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made. 
NILSSON There. 66   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY                                  66 
Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old man, is inadequately dressed. 
VANGER The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse. 
BLOMKVIST He was there that day? 
VANGER Indeed he was. 
Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds - VANGER That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak. 
BLOMKVIST Does anyone speak to anyone on this island? 
VANGER Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - (points) - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. (points) Cecilia's brother Birger lives there. BLOMKVIST Who doesn't he speak to? VANGER You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald. 
BLOMKVIST I'm quickly losing track who's who. 
VANGER Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies. (points) Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother. 
It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point. 
BLOMKVIST Who speaks to him? VANGER I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you. 
They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger. 
VANGER Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker. BLOMKVIST I just met him. VANGER He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. 
MORELL I thought this was your house. 
VANGER It is.    She lives with me. MORELL Are her parents alive? VANGER Her mother is. 
Vanger points Isabella out. Slender, overdressed and smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a woman as venomous as she is beautiful. VANGER This way. Morell follows Vanger down a hall - 
INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Approx. 12:05, inspected missing girl's bedroom. Found - " 71   INT. HARRIET'S ROOM - VANGER MANOR - DAWN - 1966           71 
A purse on the desk in Harriet's room. Morell carefully removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief, wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address book. He leafs through this. DET. MORELL I want to speak to everyone here. That'll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on. 
YOUNGER VANGER What about the search? 
MORELL First thing in the morning. YOUNGER VANGER No. We should do it now. She could be hurt out there. 
Vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide. VANGER Please.   I beg you. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "authorized our patrol boat and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m. - G. Morell." 
71A   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966                        71A 
The police patrol boat and two Peterssons motor around the island, spotlighting the shore and rocky cliffs. 71B   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                         71B 
The weird tableaux of characters, awaiting their interviews with Morell. At the moment, he's across the room with Harald Vanger, taking notes, drinking coffee. 
INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Patrol 014 and Orienteering Club volunteers assembled, 6:40 a.m." 
72    OMIT:   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                  72 
73    OMIT:   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966                 73 74    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAWN - 1966                          74 
Search parties crisscross the island, wade through ditches, check old barns, shine flashlights up chimneys. Woodsmen with blood hounds comb through woods. 
MORELL She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. BLOMKVIST It's the last page I'm curious about. MORELL As was I. 
BLOMKVIST The only names not alphabetized. Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting: Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018 
MORELL They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find. He hands the address book back. It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still. 
BLOMKVIST I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry. 
MORELL I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka Case. 
Blomkvist isn't sure what that means. 
MORELL Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh. BLOMKVIST Was this also a missing girl case? 
MORELL No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go. And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case. 78   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                      78 
An unexciting social welfare building. 
79   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - DAY                               79 
As a man behind a desk reviews   a thick file, Salander reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking that might disguise his public   servant status; no wedding ring; typical creep, as far as   she's concerned. 
BJURMAN How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was told he had a stroke of some kind. (nothing from Salander) Terrible. 
It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less.     He leafs through her file - BJURMAN What exactly do you do at this security company? 
SALANDER Make coffee and sort mail. 
BJURMAN But not full-time. Not even part- time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August? 
LIV I found him at death's door halfway up the hill. 
BLOMKVIST I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape. 
MARTIN No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in. 
Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand. 82   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                               82 
The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern. Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere. LIV I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg. When it was sold, I went with it. MARTIN A dark day. 
LIV I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin. MARTIN She comes for the moose steak. 
BLOMKVIST Is that what this is? 
They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange, wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine in Blomkvist's glass and gets up. MARTIN Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something else? 
BLOMKVIST That one's good. 
Martin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv, left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about. LIV I saw you on Sky News a while ago. 
BLOMKVIST That was a dark day. 
LIV Sorry to remind you of it. BLOMKVIST It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business. 
LIV You're writing a book now, Martin said. BLOMKVIST Henrik's biography. LIV I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New. 
BLOMKVIST They are. LIV You know about Harriet, right? 
Blomkvist doesn't say.    The sound of the wind stops. LIV You don't? 
MARTIN This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book. 
Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will. 83   INT. STOCKHOLM METRO - DAY                                 83 
As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of her messenger bag from her shoulder - She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down, but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now. 
She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator and disappears into the underground station. 84   INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                     84 
Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks, a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ... 
A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch. CECILIA Hi. I thought I'd come over and say hello. I'm Cecilia. 
85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                         85 Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post- It next to it that reads: Recent Photo? INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager, and a Post-It with her name on it. 
CECILIA We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family. 
BLOMKVIST It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company. 
CECILIA Like I said. 
BLOMKVIST It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone. 
CECILIA Unlike the one that landed you in court. BLOMKVIST Unlike that one. Correct. CECILIA So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet. 
Silence.   Then - 
BLOMKVIST I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus. CECILIA So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation. (Blomkvist can't think fast enough to respond) I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. INSERT of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall. 
BLOMKVIST Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like? 
87   EXT. MACJESUS - DAY                                         87 
Salander against the store window, cell phone to her ear. SECRETARY V/O I'm sorry, he's booked all day. 
SALANDER It'll take five minutes.      It's important. 
SECRETARY V/O Hold, please. Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they always do. The secretary comes back on. 
SECRETARY V/O Seven o'clock. 
88   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                    88 
Salander comes past a janitor waxing a long, otherwise empty corridor. At the far end, she opens her new guardian's office door. 
89   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                               89 As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits. The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops. 
BJURMAN Have you ever had an STD? (nothing from her) When's the last time you were tested for HIV? (MORE) Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ BJURMAN (CONT'D) (nothing) How many partners have you had in the last month? (nothing) How many were men? That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her. BJURMAN I'm required to ask you these things. It's a matter of health. 
SALANDER Write down anything you want. Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the McJesus invoice again. BJURMAN Why do you need such an expensive computer? 
SALANDER For work. 
BJURMAN Making coffee and sorting mail. 
SALANDER I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like before. 
BJURMAN And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that? (nothing from her) Shall we start with me? (pause) Shall we start now? 
As he comes around the desk, she eyes a sharp letter opener sticking out above some pens in a coffee mug a child has painted with the word, `daddy.' BJURMAN If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. That's how normal people are. 
ANITA You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael? BLOMKVIST I would if had any money to invest. 
ANITA Excuse me? 
BLOMKVIST I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia predicted, but it doesn't come. 95   EXT. CAFE - LONDON - DAY                                    95 
They sit together at a little table on the sidewalk. ANITA How is Henrik? BLOMKVIST Good.   Engaging. I like him. 
She does, too. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ 
ANITA I haven't seen him in over 30 years. Or my sister. Or anyone else in my family. BLOMKVIST Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid. 
ANITA I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question. 
BLOMKVIST I can narrow it. I've gotten up to the 1960s. To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life. ANITA Harriet. (he nods) Everything I knew about that I told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened. BLOMKVIST Morell. 
ANITA My recollections then were a lot better than they are now. 
BLOMKVIST I'm not speaking of the crime itself. I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. Particularly, toward the end. 
ANITA She was messed up. Like all us Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine. 
BLOMKVIST Was he abusive? 
ANITA Mine? BLOMKVIST Hers. 
ANITA I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy. 
BLOMKVIST She never confided in you what about, specifically? ANITA There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it. 
As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going, using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk. BLOMKVIST What have I missed besides you? ERIKA The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers. 
BLOMKVIST Seriously? 
ERIKA Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat? 
BLOMKVIST I'm not.   I'm working. 
ERIKA I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top. 
BLOMKVIST Would you like to meet him? 
ERIKA Maybe in about an hour.      If you're interested. 
He is. 108   INT. VANGER MANOR - EVENING                                108 
Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her. 
VANGER I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence. ERIKA We'll work through them. VANGER Are you sure? 
Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them about this. 
MARTIN How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so? ERIKA That sounds about right. 
VANGER (cheerfully) You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's. MARTIN We still own one. The Courier, here in town. 
VANGER I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. 
Erika nods politely. MARTIN So what do you say to taking on a partner? 
BLOMKVIST Why didn't you tell me? ERIKA Why would I.   You live in the woods. BLOMKVIST So I deserve to be treated like an idiot? 
ERIKA I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could. BLOMKVIST I'm saying it now. It's not a good idea. 
ERIKA You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three. BLOMKVIST You don't know this family.   They're crazy. 
ERIKA We're not marrying into it. 
BLOMKVIST We are if we do this. It's exactly what we're doing. 
ERIKA You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing. 
The logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up, comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears into the bedroom. He stares at the fire. ERIKA O/S Mikael? 
BLOMKVIST What. 
ERIKA O/S I'm leaving this God-forsaken island in the morning. BLOMKVIST So? 
ERIKA So are you coming to bed or not. 
110   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY                                110 
Salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers. TATTOO ARTIST You thinking one arm or both? SALANDER Wrists and ankles. But none of these. Just a plain band, like handcuffs. 
TATTOO ARTIST It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt. 
That doesn't bother her in the least. She rolls up her sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun. 
SALANDER How much do one of those cost?

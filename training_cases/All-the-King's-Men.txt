SHOOTING DRAFT 
Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day 
Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The Chronicle." He reads the society page. A man enters and leans across his desk. 
MAN Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants to see you. 
He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into Madison's office. 
Interior: Madison's Office, Day 
Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk. 
MADISON Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called Willie Stark? 
JACK No. Who'd he shoot? 
MADISON Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or something like that. 
JACK What's so special about him? 
MADISON They say he's an honest man. What I want you to do is to hop into your car... 
JACK Why, you promised me a vacation. 
MADISON Well, that can wait. 
JACK Yeah... but there's a... a girl I know. 
He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison a photograph of Anne Stanton. 
MADISON Oh... Well, she can wait too. 
Jack takes the paper back and looks at it. 
JACK The question is... can I? 
MADISON The answer is... get up there. 
JACK Right. (starts to go) Oh... uh... what did you say his name was? 
MADISON Who? 
JACK The fellow's name. 
MADISON Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie Stark. 
Madison goes on with his work. 
JACK (as he leaves) Willie Stark... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Kanoma City, Day 
As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town. 
JACK (voice over) I found him in Kanoma City. A typical, hot, dusty, backwoods county seat. 
He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking. 
WILLIE ...to lie to them in order to line their own dirty pockets with the taxpayers' money. When have the citizens of Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this? Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure I'm not elected county treasurer? Well, I'll tell you why... 
A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break up the gathering. 
Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills. 
WILLIE ...Because they're afraid of the truth... and the truth is this. They're trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said steal. The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. They're interested in welfare, sure. But it's their own. Let's look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures. That brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners. That same brick factory uses convict labor. 
The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd. 
SHERIFF Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move on. 
WILLIE Why? 
SHERIFF City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: more than five people congregating is disturbing the peace. 
WILLIE I'm going to be on that same street corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy. 
DUFFY You go right ahead, Willie. We all believe in free speech. We got to... it's in the Constitution. 
WILLIE My boy is out distributing those handbills now. 
DUFFY It's a free country, Willie. If you can convince the people to vote for you... you go right ahead. 
WILLIE What did you want to see me about, Mr. Duffy? 
DUFFY I wanted you to meet a fella came all the way up from the state capital to meet you. A reporter. Wants to write you up... maybe put your picture in the paper. 
WILLIE (turns to Jack) I'm happy to know you, sir. 
JACK Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can we go somewhere where we can talk? 
DUFFY Now that ain't polite. Don't you want to hear both sides of the story? 
Jack examines the camera that has just been returned to him. 
JACK I know your side. (finds the plate missing) What happened to the plate your men took from my camera? 
DUFFY Must have dropped out. Oh, come on, fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day... Hey, Sugar Boy... 
SUGAR BOY Yeah? 
DUFFY Bring some cold beer for the boys. 
WILLIE None for me, thank you kindly. 
PILLSBURY Now you know Willie don't drink, Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking. And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't you, Willie? 
WILLIE I'll have some orange pop if you don't mind. 
Duffy roars with laughter. 
DUFFY Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy. Bring him some orange pop. 
SUGAR BOY (stutters) Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out. 
DUFFY Did you hear that, boys? The p-p- pop's s-s-sold out. 
They all laugh. 
PILLSBURY Now ain't he a card? 
WILLIE (his face hard) He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you... you don't say anything. (to Jack) Let's go, mister. 
They turn and go out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Dirt Road, Day 
Jack is driving Willie home to his farmhouse. They pass a farmer and his family walking by the side of the road. Willie smiles and waves to them. 
Exterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day 
As the car pulls into the drive we see Pa Stark in his rocking chair on the porch, and Lucy, who stands at the top of the steps, waiting to welcome Willie. 
WILLIE (as they go up the steps) This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden. 
JACK AND LUCY How do you do? 
WILLIE That's my pa. 
Jack reaches out to shake his hand. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night 
Willie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a napkin, and pushes his plate back. 
WILLIE Now we'll talk. 
Camera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated around the dinner table. 
JACK You've been talking for a long time, Mr. Stark. 
PAPPY Willie's got a lot to say. 
LUCY You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have a nap? 
PAPPY No, I want to hear it. 
Lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen. 
Jack's fingers type out a story, the last line of which reads "an honest man with courage." He pulls the sheet out and hands it to Madison. 
JACK Here you are... the last of the Willie Stark articles. Now can I go? 
MADISON Yes. You've earned your vacation. You've been writing these like you really mean them. 
Jack rises and walks toward the door. 
JACK I do. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Ferry To Burden's Landing, Day 
Jack's car is ferried across the bay to the slip of Burden's Landing. 
JACK (voice over) I hadn't been home in a long time. Only a hundred and thirty miles from Kanoma City. It was separated from the mainland by a body of water. For the first time I wondered if it wasn't separated by more than that. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Mrs. Burden's Home, Day 
As Jack arrives, Mrs. Burden and her husband, McEvoy, are seated at a lawn table near the boat landing. 
JACK Hello, Mother. 
She runs forward to meet him. 
MRS. BURDEN Floyd, Jack's home. Oh, he looks fine... doesn't he look fine? (to Jack, coquettishly) How do I look, Jackie boy? 
JACK You look beautiful, Mother. 
MRS. BURDEN I've got so many things planned for you... parties and... it'll be just like old times. But first, let's have a drink. 
MCEVOY Can't that wait until this evening? 
She goes ahead and pours the drinks. 
MRS. BURDEN Floyd... honey... my son's home. 
MCEVOY How long do you plan on staying? 
JACK (coldly) Two or three weeks. If that's all right with you. 
MRS. BURDEN I'm sure your father would be -- 
JACK Stepfather, Mother. 
MRS. BURDEN (reproachfully) Now, Jackie... here we all are. Floyd, Jackie, myself. (raises her glass for a toast) To the best time we've ever had together. 
JACK Yes, Mother. 
They drink. Mrs. Burden gulps hers down avidly. Jack looks at her and then at McEvoy. 
JACK Excuse me... I... 
He turns and walks back toward the shore. He boards a small motorboat and heads toward a house that can be seen across the water. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Stanton Home (Burden's Landing), Day 
As the boat approaches the shore. Adam Stanton reaches down and pulls the boat up on land. He throws his arm around Jack, and the two climb the hill toward Judge Stanton, who stands waiting to greet him. 
JACK Dr. Stanton, I presume. 
STANTON (laughing) Is my shingle showing? 
JUDGE Good to see you, boy. Very good. 
JACK Good to see you, Judge. How have you been? What have you been doing? 
They walk back together to the patio tables. 
JUDGE Oh, just sitting here... waiting for all of you to come home. You know, when a man starts to get old his eyes stray and play funny tricks on him. As I watched you in that boat I thought sure I saw a boy of twelve with a fishing rod in his hands. And I was sure the first thing he'd say would be... 
Jack catches sight of Anne Stanton walking down the path. He runs to meet her. As they embrace, he looks back at the Judge. 
JACK Do you mind if I kiss your niece, sir? 
He kisses her, and they turn and walk away. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Tennis Court (Burden's Landing), Day 
Anne gracefully returns a ball to Jack, then runs to embrace him at the net. Adam, seated near the court, smiles approvingly. 
MRS. BURDEN I've got to live with him. 
JACK Well, I don't. Neither do you. You don't love him, Mother. You never did. 
MRS. BURDEN Son, don't spoil anything now... He can help you. 
JACK I can get along without him. You need this house. And the parties. And the cars and the clothes and the lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother, face it. For once in your life, face it. 
Mrs. Burden appeals to Anne. 
MRS. BURDEN Anne, please... please make him understand. 
Anne says nothing. Mrs. Burden goes back into the house. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Stanton Living Room, Night 
Anne and Jack sit alone in the room, beneath the portrait of the old Governor Stanton. 
JACK Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on the moon. It isn't real. It doesn't exist. It's me pretending I live on what I earn. It's my mother trying to keep herself young, and drinking herself old doing it. It's you and Adam living in this house as though your father were still alive. It's an old man like the Judge dreaming of the past... Anne, come away with me. 
ANNE And do what? 
JACK (rises impatiently) And live in a shack and eat red beans. Anne, what do you want me to do? 
ANNE Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven't been sure. You've gone from one thing to the other... a year at law school, and now this job as a reporter... 
JACK Are you afraid I can't make a living? 
ANNE Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that. I don't care about the money. It... it's just that I... I want you to be something. 
JACK What is it you want me to be? 
ANNE I don't know. It's just that I want you to be... to do... something important. 
Jack looks up at the portrait of Governor Stanton. 
JACK Like your father. All right. I'll run for governor. (pause) Anne, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said that. 
ANNE All right, Jack. I'll go away with you. I'll do anything you want me to do. 
They kiss. 
JACK Anne, I've wanted you to say that more than anything in the world, and now that you've said it... Anne, I guess you were right. I'm not sure of anything, including myself. I'm not sure I could live up to the... (looks again at the portrait) Anne, wait for me. Please wait for me. 
ANNE I'll wait for you. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Madison's Office, Day 
Madison is at his desk as Jack enters. 
MADISON Hello, Jack. Cut your vacation short, didn't you? 
JACK Yeah. 
MADISON By the way, Jack, the fellow you wrote the articles about... uh... Stark. 
JACK Yeah? 
MADISON He lost. 
JACK Well, I guess that's the end of Willie Stark. 
He turns around and walks off toward his desk. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN: 
Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night 
Lucy and Willie are seated together at the table. Willie has his law books open before him. 
WILLIE ...Measure of the damages is caused by... 
LUCY (prompting) A breach... 
WILLIE A breach... 
LUCY Of an agreement... 
WILLIE Of an agreement... 
LUCY To sell personal property... 
An article is pasted in a scrapbook. It reads: "VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS. Recent school tragedy is a potent reminder that a man named Willie Stark..." A hand draws a pencil underneath the name. 
WILLIE'S VOICE A voice in the wilderness. A man named Willie Stark... 
Camera pulls back to show Willie at the table busy with his scrapbook. He looks up at Lucy. 
WILLIE How about that, Lucy, that's me. 
She looks at him, unsmiling, and sits down to help him clip various articles from other papers. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night 
A series of clippings are being pasted in the scrapbook. They read: 
A. SCHOOL VICTIMS SUE COUNTY: STARK FILES DAMAGE SUIT 
"Will prove graft cause of tragedy," says Attorney Stark. 
B. CITIZENS COMMITTEE FORMED 
Draft Stark to lead fight to rid state of graft. 
C. CITIZENS COMMITTEE DEMANDS STATE-WIDE INVESTIGATION 
D. Large photograph of Willie. Under it, the caption: RURAL AREAS IN REVOLT 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Madison's Office, The Chronicle, Day 
The clippings are spread out on Madison's desk. He looks up at Jack. 
MADISON Get up there. Get up there fast. Your friend, Willie, is hotter than a firecracker. 
Jack starts toward the door. 
MADISON Stay there with him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Harrison's Political Headquarters (State Capital), Day 
A politician points to a map on the wall. 
POLITICIAN Look, before this Kanoma City business we had this whole area tied up. Now we're losing to Hickville. 
Camera pulls back, revealing the candidate, Harrison, Tiny Duffy, and a woman, Sadie Burke. 
POLITICIAN We must find a way to split that vote. 
HARRISON Well, all I know is, the way it is now it looks like I'm not going to win. 
POLITICIAN I know a way... find a dummy. 
SADIE Find a dummy. (looks at Harrison) That's what we've got. 
POLITICIAN A guy from the sticks... strong enough to grab some votes and dumb enough not to ask questions. 
DUFFY If you want to listen to a boy from the sticks, I know just the guy. 
They crowd around to listen. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Day 
Jack sits at the dinner table, with Willie and Lucy. Tom stands next to Willie. Pappy dozes in his chair. 
JACK No more politics, eh, Willie? 
WILLIE No, I worked too hard in my time to get there. I think I'll just go on practicing law and make a little more money. 
JACK The question I'd like to know is, why all the speeches you're making around the countryside? 
Willie is about to answer when he hears the sound of approaching cars. 
WILLIE Wonder who that is? 
He goes to the window, and we see a big black limousine turning into his drive. He opens the door and waits as Sadie, Duffy, Dolph Pillsbury, and other politicians climb the steps to meet him. 
DUFFY Brought some people all the way up from the state capital just to meet you. (turns to others) Folks, I want you to meet Willie Stark, the next governor of our state. 
Willie, Lucy, and Tom beam happily. Jack looks skeptically at Sadie, whose only reaction is to smile, politely. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Willie takes a seat on the children's swing as Jack goes off to get some coffee. Two little girls stare curiously at him. Willie waves them off. Jack returns with the coffee and pours some whisky in it. Willie tips his hand, forcing him to pour more, then gulps his drink down. 
Exterior: Bandstand (Upton), Day 
Duffy, Pillsbury, and the other politicians stand on the platform, waiting for Willie. A band plays march music. Duffy goes over to Sadie, who is standing on the steps of the platform. 
DUFFY Where is he? 
SADIE (pointing) There he is. 
Escorted by Jack, Willie approaches the platform and stumbles up the steps past Sadie. 
SADIE Whoops! 
DUFFY (to Jack) Is he drunk? 
JACK Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn't favor drinkin'. 
Duffy follows Willie up on the platform. 
SADIE (to Jack) How'd you get him here? He was out stiff. 
JACK Hair of the dog that bit him. 
SADIE Hair? He must have swallowed the dog. 
On the platform, Duffy looks uneasily at the bleary-eyed Willie. The band suddenly plays a fanfare, and the chairman steps up to the microphone. 
CHAIRMAN Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce to you that true man of the people, the next governor of the state... Willie Stark. 
There is scattered applause as Willie steps forward to speak. 
WILLIE My friends... 
He turns his face from side to side, and fumbles in the right side of his coat pocket to fish out his speech. 
WILLIE My friends... I... 
He tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before his eyes with both hands. Then he lifts his head, and looks directly at the people who have come to hear him. As he speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience, Willie's people. 
WILLIE I have a speech here. It's a speech about what this state needs. There's no need in my telling you what this state needs. You are the state and you know what you need... You over there... look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger?... And you, what about your crops? Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market?... And you. What about your kids? Are they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause there's no school for them?... No, I'm not going to read you any speech. 
He throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed. 
WILLIE But I am going to tell you a story. It's a funny story... 
SADIE (from the steps) Hey! 
WILLIE'S VOICE ...So get ready to laugh. 
SADIE What's he up to? 
JACK Shut up! 
WILLIE Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's about a hick... a hick like you, if you please. Yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and gully washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast... and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some... for himself, and for folks like him. 
Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's speech. 
WILLIE No, I'm not going to lie to you. He didn't start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them. No. No, he started off thinking of number one. But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people. That's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics... rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that... So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor... 
Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm. 
JACK Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful... 
Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his face filled with conviction, and with fury. 
WILLIE ...So they told the hick... and he swallowed it. He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he'd like to try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped pants... they saw the hick and they took him in. 
He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak to him. 
DUFFY (low voice) Willie, what are you trying to do? 
Willie turns on him, roaring. 
WILLIE There he is! There's your Judas Iscariot. (he pushes Duffy across the platform) Look at him... lickspittle... nose- wiper. 
Duffy gestures frantically to the band. 
DUFFY Play! Play! 
WILLIE (pushing him again) Look at him! 
DUFFY Play anything. 
The band starts to play, adding to the pandemonium. Willie shouts above it. 
WILLIE Look at him! Joe Harrison's dummy! Look at him! 
HARRISON WINS CLOSE RACE STARK SWEEPS RURAL AREAS CITY VOTE DECIDES ELECTION 
Superimposed over newspaper is a crowd cheering at Harrison's victory parade. Willie, raincoat thrown over his shoulders, looking grim, and Sadie and Sugar Boy are part of that crowd. They turn away and walk toward a bar. 
Interior: Bar, Day 
Jack is already at the bar. Willie, Sadie, and Sugar Boy join him there. 
JACK We didn't do so good. 
WILLIE Double bourbon. 
SADIE (sitting next to Jack) Same for me. 
WILLIE And a beer. (to Jack) I hear you got fired from the paper. 
JACK You heard wrong, Willie. I quit. 
WILLIE (passing the beer back to Sugar Boy) You're smart. 'Cause before I'm through with that mob they're not going to have enough money left to pay the boy that cleans the spittoons. 
JACK How do you feel, Willie? 
WILLIE I feel fine, fine. You see, Jack, I learned something. 
Willie and Sadie exchange looks. 
JACK Yeah... what? 
Close shot of Willie. 
WILLIE How to win.

JACK (voice over) I drifted from job to job...

Interior: Bar, Night 
Jack, at the bar, looking haggard and disheveled, picks up a newspaper and turns to find a photograph of Anne. The caption reads STANTONS ARRIVE HOME. 
JACK (voice over) But always further and further away from Anne, and the life at Burden's Landing. 
Exterior: Street, Day 
Camera pans with Jack as he trudges along the street. 
JACK (voice over) But Willie wasn't drifting. He knew where he was going. 
We see an insert of a newspaper. It has a caricature of Willie, swinging a sledge hammer. The caption reads 
STARK ATTACKS ADMINISTRATION CHARGES OLD MACHINE STILL CORRUPT 
JACK (voice over) He had his foot in the door and he kept right on pushing to get in. He had lost the election but he had won the state... and he knew it... and the people knew it. 
MONTAGE: WILLIE'S LIFE 
Writing on a fence: THE PEOPLE'S WILL SHOULD BE THE LAW OF THE STATE... WILLIE STARK Painted on a rock: KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE... WILLIE STARK

WILLIE That's the object. Not like when they beat up my boy Tom.

Willie's expression changes. He starts up the stairs. 
WILLIE Fine... fine. 
Interior: Willie's Campaign Office In Hotel, Day 
The place is a beehive of activity, with typists and messengers scurrying about, all supervised by Sadie. 
SADIE Hey, I need a boy... Where's a boy? (boy runs up) Take that downstairs; they're waiting for it. Right away, on the double. (to typist) Listen, baby, you've got to double- space all of this... he can't read, see. 
The door opens and Willie, Jack, and Sugar Boy come in. 
JACK Sadie! 
SADIE (to typist) And they need four copies. (looks up) Hi, Jack. How are you? 
WILLIE Sadie is my secretary now. (to messenger, trying to squeeze by) Oh, pardon me. 
As Willie and Jack walk toward adjoining room, Sadie calls out: 
SADIE Fix your tie, Willie. 
Interior: Bedroom Hotel Suite, Day 
Willie and Jack enter from the office. 
WILLIE Hey, Sugar. 
Sugar Boy appears in the doorway. Sadie slips by into the room. 
WILLIE Keep everybody out of here. I want to talk to Jack and Sadie alone. 
He walks over to Jack, who leans back on the bed. 
WILLIE From now on you're working for me. 
JACK Doing what? 
WILLIE I don't know. Something will turn up, won't it, Sadie? 
SADIE Yeah. We need a college man around... for research. 
WILLIE How much did they pay you on that newspaper? 
JACK Three hundred dollars a month. 
WILLIE (laughs) I could buy you cheap, couldn't I? 
JACK For a bag of salt. 
WILLIE No. No, I don't play that way. I like you, boy. I always have. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you four hundred dollars a month and traveling expenses. 
JACK You throw money around like it was money. 
Willie gets up and walks to the window. 
WILLIE Money?... I don't need money. People give me things. 
JACK Why? 
WILLIE Because they believe in me.

Willie's car is on the ferry crossing the bay to Burden's Landing. Sugar Boy drives the car off the ferry and up the road toward the house.

Close shot of Willie standing in front of the fireplace, beneath the portrait of Governor Stanton.

DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Stark's Hotel Suite, Night 
Close shot of Willie, seated, with his feet propped up on a table. Pillsbury stands before him. Jack, Sadie, Duffy, and Sugar Boy are also in the room. 
WILLIE Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. If the Almighty had intended for you to be rich he'd have taken care of that a long time ago. The idea of you being rich... that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a fact? 
Pillsbury doesn't answer. 
WILLIE Answer me! 
PILLSBURY Yes. 
WILLIE Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up. Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact. 
PILLSBURY It's a fact, a blasphemous fact. 
Sugar Boy laughs loudly. The phone rings and Sadie picks it up. 
SADIE Yeah?... Oh, I see. (hangs up) Dumond can't come. He says his wife is sick. 
WILLIE I don't care if she's dying. Sugar, get the car. Get him and bring him over here. 
Sugar Boy exists. Willie turns back to Pillsbury. 
WILLIE Now, you know what you're supposed to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're supposed to stay poor and take orders. Oh, there'll be some sweetening for you from time to time... but Duffy'll take care of that. Don't you go setting yourself up on your own again, do you understand that? 
PILLSBURY Yes. 
WILLIE Louder, man. And say, I understand that. 
PILLSBURY I understand that. 
WILLIE Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie. 
There is a knock on the door. 
WILLIE See who that is, Duffy. 
Judge Stanton enters. 
WILLIE Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be with you in just a couple of seconds. (back to Pillsbury) Now write what I tell you to write... Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign as auditor due to ill health, to take effect as soon as you can relieve me. Respectfully yours. (after a pause) Did you sign it? 
PILLSBURY No. 
WILLIE (roaring) Well, sign it! Don't put any date on it. I can fill that in when I need it. 
Pillsbury signs the paper. 
WILLIE Now bring it to me. 
Pillsbury moves slowly, so Sadie yanks the paper out of his hand and passes it to Willie. 
WILLIE Now get out. 
Pillsbury slinks out of the room. 
JUDGE The papers have the story. 
WILLIE Yeah, I know. 
JUDGE They're talking about impeachment proceedings. 
WILLIE (rising) Against who?

JUDGE How true is it? 
WILLIE It's too true.

SADIE Yes? (hands phone to Willie) This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on the wire. 
Willie takes the phone, but puts his hand over the mouthpiece so that he can speak to Jack. 
WILLIE What have we got on Hopkins, Jack? (as Jack riffles through the black book) Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury business... (reads from black book Jack holds out for him) Here's what I want you to do when it comes up in the legislature. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You listen to me. (still reading from book) You got a mortgage coming due on that place of yours in about five weeks, haven't you? You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you?

JACK You're crazy. There's nothing on the Judge. 
SADIE Why? Because his name is Stanton? 
WILLIE Ssshhh, easy. 
JACK What if I won't do it? 
WILLIE You know, some of this has rubbed off on you. 
JACK What are you going to do? Have me shot? 
WILLIE No... no... but I'll have to get myself a new boy. 
JACK I tell you there's nothing on the Judge. 
WILLIE Jack, there's something on everybody. Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption.

Jack and Anne stand together in the living room. 
JACK At any price. 
STANTON Do you really believe that, Jack? 
JACK I really believe that Stark wants to do good. You do too. It's a matter of method. Many times out of evil comes good. Well, pain is an evil. As a doctor you should know that. 
STANTON Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It is not evil in itself. Stark is evil. 
JACK The people of the state don't think so. 
STANTON How would they know? The first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. Why be so afraid of criticism? If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth. I don't see how you can separate the two. No, Stark is not for me. 
ANNE (upset) No, Stark is not for you. Well, what is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all it is... foolish, stupid pride. All you've ever talked about is what you could do if... if somebody would tear down and build. All right, all right, somebody has, and he's given it to you. But he's not for you. No, he's not for you.

Jack enters and speaks to a clerk, who then directs him to one of the files. He starts to look through the files marked MORTGAGES DEFAULTED. 
JACK (voice over) Will I find anything, Judge? Will I? I didn't find it all at once. It takes a long time to go through old courthouse records and musty deeds... a very long time. But it wasn't too hard for me. I was well trained in research, especially this kind. 
He pulls out a file.

SADIE Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot of whisky. You sober? 
JACK Stone. 
SADIE I'll have one with you. (starts tidying up the room) What are you hiding out for? 
JACK I'm not. I've been sleeping. 
SADIE For four days? You've been back in town for four days. 
JACK Willie knows everything. 
SADIE Willie's worried about his boy. 
JACK Willie's boy is worried about Willie's boy. 
SADIE Well, why don't you put something on the phonograph -- a low-down, mean blues. Play it over and over again until you're sick of it. Then crack it and go back to work. (sits down) I do it all the time. 
JACK That's not my problem. 
SADIE No, it isn't your problem. (gets up again) I'll wait for you if you want to powder your nose. 
Jack goes into the bathroom. 
JACK I'll be with you in a minute. 
Sadie wanders around. She goes to the dresser, upon which is a photograph of Anne Stanton. She picks up the picture and places it so she can see it in the mirror and compare it with her own reflection. 
SADIE Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got to look in the mirror to be able to see it. Soft, white skin... not like mine. (runs her hand across her cheeks) I had smallpox when I was a kid. Where I lived it seemed nearly all the kids had smallpox... 
Jack watches her through the open bathroom door. 
WILLIE Why? What difference does it make? 
JACK I just wanted to know. 
WILLIE I heard it around. 
JACK (insistent) How did you hear he turned it down, Willie? 
Out on the field the boys have stopped playing and are huddled around the coach. 
WILLIE I'll be right back, Jack. I want to see what's happening here. 
He goes over to the group on the field. The coach is talking to Tom. 
COACH You going to practice the way I tell you. 
TOM I'm going to do it the way I want to do it. 
Willie comes up to them. 
WILLIE Tom, come here. What's going on here? 
COACH I don't care if he is your son, Governor... No special rules for him. 
TOM It doesn't make any difference to me either way... whether I play or not. 
WILLIE Well, it does to me. (to coach) What do you want him to do? 
COACH To behave himself. Like the rest of the boys. Four times this season he's broken training. He comes on the practice field half potted. 
WILLIE Tom, you're going to have to obey the rules. Do you hear me? You're going to obey the rules. 
TOM I put 'em across, don't I? Every Saturday I put 'em across and I can still do it, drunk or sober. That's all you want, isn't it... for me to put 'em across so you can big-shot it around? Isn't that all you want? 
He walks away.

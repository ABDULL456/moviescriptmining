A FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips the HOLLYWOOD PICTURES LOGO away, and we find ourselves in the middle of... 
1     STORMY SEA - NIGHT                                       1 
SUPERIMPOSED: SOUTH CHINA SEA 
The dark blue waters roil and boil and foam. THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTING FLASHES.

2     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                       2 
An enormous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the water. An autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost futuristic in its design. The nose cone is an amazing ultra high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING along the side tells us this is the "SHINKAI 90000." 
COMPUTER PRINTED across the SCREEN are the WORDS: ASSIGNMENT:		GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION. SUB-OCEANIC SEISMIC RESEARCH. TECTONIC PLATE SURVEILLANCE. ADDENDUM:		ABOUT TO BREAK THE WORLD'S RECORD FOR THE DEEPEST DIVE... 
3     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     3 
The JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches a DLD laser tracking system and barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks. 
4     ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...4 
The excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS, HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.

As it continues its descent, it passes corroding metal drums leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths, away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty thousand feet of water. 
But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon. 
Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm. 
The dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON. The Bathysaphe is now mobile. It glides down the side of an enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below.

6     DEEP SEA - NIGHT                                         6 
THE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its "hand" is a high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies, then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern. 
Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
7     MINDINAO DEEP - NIGHT                                    7 
A desolate, barren, spooky place. Nothing breathes. Nothing lives. Or so it would appear. The creepy, foreboding MUSICAL SCORE tells us otherwise. The Shinkai ENTERS a huge ROCK FISSURE. 
CUT TO: 
8     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     8 
The Captain and the Science Officers stare through the plexi dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the PALAWAN TROUGH. The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve. Then, dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked by a rock-encrusted embankment. 
The MUSIC builds. 
The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror. 
As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. 
The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them. 
CUT TO: 
9     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     9 
The vessel cruises through the valley of death. Everyone is nervously taking readings, making calculations and adjusting equipment. 
Gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking. 
PANTUCCI (singing) " -- if not for the courage of the fearless crew -- " 
He tugs at the wires. 
PANTUCCI (CONT'D) " -- the Minnow would be lost, the Minowwww would be lost." 
Finnegan's voice explodes through his headset... 
FINNEGAN (V.O.) (radio filtered) PANTUCCI!! 
Unperturbed, Pantucci works at the wires. 
PANTUCCI (into radio) Can we use our indoor voice please... 
FINNEGAN (V.O.) (radio filtered) I'm flying blind here God damn it! 
Pantucci pulls two wires from the tangle. 
PANTUCCI You trying to make me feel guilty? 
He begins to strip the wires with his teeth.

17     PILOT HOUSE - SUNSET                                    17 
Finnegan peers out of the windscreen, trying to see ahead of himself. 
FINNEGAN Guilty will be the least of what you feel when I run my rig into one of these god damn no name islands! Get me well here! 
CUT TO: 
18     ENGINE ROOM                                             18 
Pantucci twists one wire around another. 
PANTUCCI All better... 
19     PILOT HOUSE - SUNSET                                    19 
The console lights up. The screens come back on line. 
Finnegan is pleased. 
PANTUCCI (V.O.) Now tell me again... 
CUT TO: 
20     ENGINE ROOM                                             20 
Pantucci works his wrench around an engine mount. And his nervous eyes around six men, big, bad men, standing on the far side of the engines out in a narrow passage. 
A Maori(VIVO). Two Aussies(MASON and MULLIGAN). A Samoan(MAMOOLI). A Chinese(CHIN). And an Aborigine (BILLY). Tattooed, armed to the teeth, packed in Kevlar body armor. Mercenaries. Who would as soon wring your neck as shake your hand. And a sixth man. HANOVER. The obvious leader. Smoother than the rest, but still showing the edge of a man risen from their ranks. He consults his watch with a growing concern. 
PANTUCCI ...why we took this job? 
CUT TO: 
21     PILOT HOUSE - SUNSET                                    21 
Finnegan hits a button on his console. The Stones are replaced by the first chords of LAYLA. 
FINNEGAN If I told you once...I told you a thousand times... 
CUT TO: 
22     ENGINE ROOM                                             22 
PANTUCCI (rote) I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care... (nervous) Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried... 
Pantucci notices Hanover impatiently looking at his watch again, and nods for a mass of Aussie mean and muscle named MASON to follow him up a ladder. 
PANTUCCI (CONT'D) ...and some of it's coming your way. 
He quickly pulls out a wrench, slaps it over a bolt and tightens it down. The leak stops. He blows on the WRENCH like it's a six-shooter, then spins it at the speed of light and holsters it into his toolbelt. 
CUT TO: 
MASON I'll take a go and the I vote we throw the little weasel overboard... 
MULLIGAN I vote we slit his throat THEN throw him overboard... 
Mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm back, taking dead aim at Pantucci's face. He never gets the punch off. His arm is caught from behind. He looks over his shoulder to Finnegan. Gripping his wrist. Right in his face. 
FINNEGAN ...this is not a democracy. You don't get a vote. 
Mason, enraged, swings with his free hand. Finnegan twists his arm sharply, sending Mason's head into the steel wall, knocking the big man senseless. The other mercenaries go to draw their weapons. Before the guns are out of holsters, Finnegan swings a spear gun into Hanover's face, an inch from his eye. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) I'll say it again for the hearing impaired... 
Finnegan cocks the spear. CLICK! Hanover does not blink. Everyone freezes. With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised. Finnegan backs out of the room. 
HANOVER This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract. 
FINNEGAN (RECITING) 20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime. 
HANOVER And no questions asked. 
FINNEGAN Who asked any? 
HANOVER He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract. 
FINNEGAN I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indiscretion. 
With that Finnegan leads Pantucci out of the hold, slamming the door behind him. 
PANTUCCI Thanks... 
Finnegan turns his gaze to Pantucci. It makes the smaller man quiver. 
FINNEGAN You put me in that position again I'll throw you overboard myself. 
Finnegan stalks off. Pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means it.

A man strides down the hall of an executive passageway, his face obscured in shadows. He has a CANISTER in his hands. Walks through a door MARKED: 
"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY" 
CUT TO: 
33     COMPUTER/CONTROL MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT                   33 
The brain center for the whole ship. Rows of computer mainframes, laser-guided imagers and D.T. processors. No humans needed. And none are present. Except one -- 
The Man strides purposefully down a row of computers, makes a left, then a right. He knows exactly where he's going. He arrives at an ultra-high-tech CONSOLE. The cerebellum. Three similar canisters are plugged into the console. The Man unscrews the middle canister. Screws his canister into its place. Sets the TIMER to 0:300 hours. Pushes a button. The TIMER starts to COUNT DOWN. 
CUT TO: 
34     THE FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                   34 
All LIT UP and looking beautiful. The wind is stronger. The party is wilder. The BAND louder. The people drunker. Rain begins to fall. Everybody moans and heads for cover. 
The deck's huge hydralic canopy begins to close, reviving the party spirit. 
CUT TO: 
35     VAULT ROOM - NIGHT                                      35 
A gold card with a black stripe slides into the security lock of a high tech vault. Lights blink. Tumblers roll. One after another the electronic locks unlock. 
Trillian stands back as the massive vault door swings open. With a quick look over her shoulder, she enters the vault. 
CUT TO: 
36     VAULT - NIGHT                                           36 
Trillian consults a list, looking for one very specific vault box. Finding it, she pulls a lock pick from her fabulous coiffure, and picks the lock in nothing flat. A pro. Flipping open the box, Trillian removes the only thing she came for. A dazzling diamond ring with the center stone the size of an egg. With a twist, she pops the stone from the setting, holds it up to admire it in the light... 
CANTON (V.O.) It is an amazing stone... 
Trillian grits her teeth, and turns to...Canton, the Captain, and two burly Chinese security men. 
CUT TO: 
43     CRYSTAL FOREDECK - NIGHT                                43

CUT TO: 
44     THE BRIDGE - NIGHT                                      44 
The entire ROOM seems to be FRITZING OUT. The lights crackle on and off. The Captain stands behind the bank of failing IMAGING SYSTEMS, growing edgier by the moment. 
MATE The entire bridge electrical system is shutting down sir! 
CAPTAIN Switch over to auxiliary power, and run a circuit check. 
MATE Yes sir... 
The COM. OFFICER is busy fiddling with the communications and imaging gear. DISTORTED LIGHTS from the scrambled systems plays off their faces. 
COM. OFFICER We're losing radar and sonar! 
FIRST MATE Communications systems are out sir! 
The Captain is confounded, on the edge of panic. Canton hurries onto the bridge. 
CANTON What the hell is going on? 
CAPTAIN Communication systems have failed! Radar...sonar...radios...I don't understand it. 
MATE Maybe it's the storm! 
CANTON Nonsense! We're impervious to weather! 
FIST MATE We have a main frame meltdown!! 
CANTON Well unmelt it!! 
Canton storms out. Every piece of electrical equipment on the bridge starts to shut down.

Where the waves meet the hull, A BALLAST HOLE excretes water. Suddenly, near the ballast hole, a WAVE EXPLODES, thrashed from below. Accompanied by the scary foreboding MUSIC again. 
CUT TO: 
46     VEGETABLE STORAGE - NIGHT                               46 
Trillian, making the best of a bad situation, is just putting the finishing touches on a wonderful salad culled from the stores. As she sits down, spreading a makeshift napkin on her lap just so, a violent SUCKING SOUND comes from above her. Trillian's eyes shoot upward. A VICIOUS GURGLING SOUND RACES through a large PIPE along the ceiling. Trillian leaps to her feet. Backs away. A little spooked. 
CUT TO: 
47     STATEROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT                              47 
An elegant woman sits on the toilet, her gown hiked up inelegantly, reading "Vogue." As she turns the page the same strange sound, a violent sucking, comes from inside the walls, startling her. She looks around the room. Can't see anything. Shrugs it off. Goes back to her magazine. Turns another page. 
A LONG SCARY BEAT. 
And then suddenly -- She SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY and gives a sharp CRY. Her eyes filled panic. She tries to stand, but she's JERKED BACK DOWN! Her ARMS FLAIL WILDLY. Scattering stuff off the counter. She tries to SCREAM, but it comes out more like a GURGLE. Below her, in the TOILET, there is a hideous SLURPING SOUND. She manages a final, desperate scream, a high-pitched WAIL. 
Which nobody hears because...

48     POOL DECK - NIGHT                                       48 
...the Band has kicked into another ROCK SONG. The drunken revelers whoop and holler, dancing with reckless abandon ignoring the THUNDER and LIGHTNING. And then...with a loud BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG, the CRUISE LINER JERKS TO A STOP. EVERYTHING goes CRASH. PEOPLE TUMBLE. TABLES TOPPLE. The MUSIC STOPS as the entire Band falls into the pool. 
CUT TO: 
49     VEGETABLE STORAGE - NIGHT                               49 
Trillian goes ass-over-teacups, rolling over just in time to see a wall of BOXES CRASHING straight down on her. SMASH! She's knocked out cold.

59     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     59 
Mayhem... Fire spews out of the engines. Pantucci sprays a fire extinguisher frantically. Where the shrapnel entered the hull water now spurts with every wave. Smoke and water, oil and fire. 
PANTUCCI Jezebel's dead...Hercules is right behind her! We got a gusher in the hull! 
CUT TO: 
60     PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                                     60 
As the Saipan comes to a halt, Finnegan loses play in his remaining stick. 
FINNEGAN Shit!! 
Finnegan locks the sticks down, and runs out. 
CUT TO: 
61     HOLD - NIGHT                                            61 
TRACK WITH Finnegan running through the smoke filled hold, past Hanover and the merc's who are pulling themselves off the floor, right into the... 
ENGINE ROOM. Where Pantucci is beside himself in smoke and sputtering flame. 
PANTUCCI What did you do to my kids!! 
FINNEGAN Me?? 
PANTUCCI No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing? 
Finnegan notices something on the floor. He picks up a shard of the speedboat propeller. Strange. Hanover steps into the room. 
HANOVER What happened? 
Finnegan looks at the piece of speedboat in his hand. 
FINNEGAN We ran into a speedboat... 
He shows the piece of speed boat to Hanover. Who stares at it. Finnegan sees the hint of recognition in his eyes. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Speedboat in the middle of the ocean... 
HANOVER How soon can we get up and running? 
FINNEGAN We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly. 
HANOVER I have a schedule... 
PANTUCCI I spent two years building these things...screw your schedule! 
Mason grabs Pantucci by the throat, lifting him off the ground. 
MASON You little weasel! 
Finnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of Mason's knees buckling him to the floor. In the blink of an eye there is the barrel of a .45 pressed hard against his head, Hanover at the trigger end. 
HANOVER We were talking about my schedule... 
FINNEGAN You're going to have to get a new one. 
HANOVER Not an option. 
FINNEGAN Then you better start swimming. 
Hanover cracks Finnegan across the face with the barrel of the gun. Finnegan's head spins. He touches the corner of his mouth, and comes away with blood, and a look of murder in his eyes. Hanover slams a round in the chamber. 
HANOVER One more joke and your comedy career is over. Now fix this. 
PANTUCCI With what? Look at them...they need gears...cylinder heads...oil pans... we're in the middle of the goddamn ocean... 
FINNEGAN I think he knows that Joey. 
PANTUCCI Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need... 
Mulligan comes running in. 
A thick black hose weaves it's way across the flooded floor, sucking water. Leila up to her knees in water, wearing a blast visor, stripped down to her skivvies, wields a welder against the gaping hole in the hull. As the boat dips in the waves water sloshes in. Billy sits on the stairs trying to stay dry. He goes to light a cigarette. 
LEILA (angry) Kwan bat! Kwam bat! Booom!! 
She points the acetalyne tank she works with. 
BILLY (bothered) Yeah...yeah...yeah... 
Billy heads for the deck. Leila looks after him in disgust. 
LEILA Asshole... 
She ignites her torch, is about to flick her visor down again when a loud gurgling, a sucking sound, stops her. She cuts the torch. Looks around nervously...and then she spots the suction hose sucking away. 
She smiles to herself. Flips the visor, fires the torch, and goes back to work. 
CUT TO: 
66     FUJI MARU DECK PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                       66 
An alert Mulligan leads Finnegan and Pantucci around a corner. Vivo brings up the rear. 
PANTUCCI You'd think they'd set a deck watch... 
FLASH TO: The deck full of people partying, carousing. The railing is lined with 15 lifeboats suspended in their harnesses. 
FLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Finnegan, Pantucci and Vivo staring at a completely deserted deck. The lifeboat harnesses swing in the breeze, eerily empty. Mulligan looks back to Vivo. 
MULLIGAN I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through. 
VIVO Maybe plans changed... 
MULLIGAN Plans don't change... 
PANTUCCI Maybe it's the wrong ship. 
MULLIGAN Shut up! 
And then a strange yowl echoes from somewhere deep in the bowels of the ship. Finnegan and Pantucci trade a look. 
FINNEGAN Let's just keep going. 
MULLIGAN (nervous) You ain't giving the orders here! 
And again the yowl. Everyone freezes. 
MULLIGAN (CONT'D) Let's keep going! 
CUT TO: 
67     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                               67 
Hanover, Mason, and Chin set foot on the deserted pool deck. 
FLASH TO: The pool deck is jammed with people partying. The band playing. Two kids toss a beach ball back and forth. The ball flies over one boy's head... 
FLASH BACK TO: The ball falls into the empty pool...Where the band's instruments litter the bottom along a big jagged crack. 
MASON What the... 
Uneasy, Hanover and his men look around at the over turned chairs. The smashed aquarium. Chin bends down and picks up a small squid from the bottom of the smashed aquarium. The squid wraps its tentacles around Chin's hand almost immediately. Chin regards it with curiosity. 
HANOVER Focus on the task Mr. Chin... 
...and then the yowl freezes them. C.U. on Hanover's face. His eyes flicker with uncertainty...and a tinge of fear. 
CUT TO: 
68     GRAND ATRIUM LOBBY - NIGHT                              68 
DING! FLASH TO: A glass elevator descending through the spectacular atrium, full of elegant well-dressed people laughing, chatting. 
DING! FLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Vivo, Pantucci, and Finnegan, standing amidst the shattered glass and broken furniture, whirling to the elevator door opening. Mulligan, nerves ajangle, and Vivo, swing their pulse rifles up hard as the door opens to reveal...and empty elevator! DING! The door closes. The car starts to ascend in the eerie silence. The mercs watch it go with growing uneasiness. 
CUT TO: 
69     FUJI MARU BRIDGE - DAWN                                 69 
Still silence. Cautious, she taps on the wall. For a moment nothing. And then... 
WHAMM!! 
Something slams against the wall from the other side in response. Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in her throat. 
CUT TO: 
75     ENGINE CHAMBERS - DAY                                   75 
A MAZE of pipes, hoses, gears, engines and catwalks. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING, RUMBLING and CLANKING. A spooky place. Dark. Damp. Eerie. Ominous. Mulligan and Vivo, looking more nervous by the moment, lead the way. Finnegan and Pantucci follow. 
PANTUCCI (rattling, nervous) You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life... 
FINNEGAN (calm) Joey... 
PANTUCCI ...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games... 
Finnegan turns to Pantucci, his voice even, calm, almost kind. 
FINNEGAN Joey...it's okay... 
PANTUCCI What? You don't think I can have a normal life? 
FINNEGAN Joey...look at me... 
He forces Pantucci to look him in the eyes. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) We're gonna get what we gotta get... do what we gotta do...and get the hell outta here...okay? 
Pantucci draws his strength from Finnegan. He forces himself to take a deep breath. 
PANTUCCI Okay... 
Suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the wall. 
MULLIGAN What the...??? 
He and Vivo spin their guns at the pipes. The red dots of their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal. Nothing. 
MULLIGAN (CONT'D) Come on...the sooner we get outta here the better I'll feel. Mulligan and Vivo move forward. 
PANTUCCI (quiet) Finnegan... 
Finnegan turns to Pantucci, who has not moved from where he hit the wall. 
FINNEGAN It's okay...come on... 
PANTUCCI (scared) I'm stuck... 
Pantucci tries to pull away from the wall. He is stuck. 
MULLIGAN (jumpy) Hey! What are you trying to pull! 
PANTUCCI (pleading) John... 
Finnegan takes Pantucci by the front of his shirt, ignoring Mulligan. 
FINNEGAN Relax your arms...slowly...that's it... 
As Finnegan pulls, Pantucci does as he is told. He slips away from the wall. The jacket doesn't. 
MULLIGAN What the... 
He reaches out to touch the wall. Finnegan grabs his wrist, grabs a flashlight from Vivo's utility belt and shines it on the wall. Their POV -- the entire wall is covered in a strange, yellow, secreted GELATIN. Laid on in some sort of weird, inhuman, geometric pattern. Like a spider web. 
CUT TO: 
76     THE SAIPAN'S HOLD - DAY                                 76 
Leila has welded half the hole shut. A GUSH OF WATER suddenly pours through the other half. Leila cuts the torch. 
LEILA Gebop!! 
The KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK of the PUMP is like a loud scary HEARTBEAT. Leila removes her blast visor. Wipes her brow. 
-- A MANGLED CORPSE GUSHES IN through the gaping hole! 
FINNEGAN Grab the parts!! 
Pantucci grabs the knapsack, cramming as many parts as he can into it as Finnegan keeps firing into the steaming, creaking, sparking machinery. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) I'll cover! Move! Move! 
Pantucci doesn't have to be told twice. He runs like hell, with Finnegan firing a final burst, and following. 
CUT TO: 
82     VAULT - NIGHT                                           82 
Everyone hears the MASSIVE GUNFIRE. Hanover looks around for the source of the sound. He finds it in his discarded headset. 
HANOVER This is Red one! Come in Red two! 
The gunfire stops, replaced by an ominous, horrifying, sucking sound. 
CANTON (panicked) It's them! We've got to get off! 
He runs out of the vault. The Captain follows close behind. Hanover listens to the sucking sound getting louder and louder. 
HANOVER Let's find them! 
CHIN What about the vault? 
HANOVER It's not going anywhere... 
Hanover rushes out with Chin right behind. 
Only Trillian remains, breathing deeply, scared...but not scared enough to forget the reason she came cruising in the first place. She goes right to the vault, opens one of the boxes, removes the giant diamond, drops it down her decolletage, pulls her high heels off, and runs out. 
CUT TO: 
83     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     83 
Finnegan and Pantucci run to the end of a long section of metal grating, right below a staircase, to catch their breath. Everything has gone dead quiet, except for the billowing and clanging of the engines. Smoke and sparks obscure their vision. 
PANTUCCI Finnegan, what the hell was that? 
FINNEGAN I don't know...you got what we need? 
PANTUCCI If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe? 
Both of them listen to the silence. And then, at the far end of the grating, one grate rises...and falls. Finnegan and Pantucci watch, transfixed. Then, like a locomotive gathering speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two of them. 
LOUDERFASTERLOUDERFASTER!!! 
FINNEGAN Come on!! 
Finnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and falls. Silence returns. Except for the steaming, creaking machinery...and an ominous sucking sound. 
CUT TO: 
84     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                      84 
Trillian comes running down the passageway to a freight elevator. Looking over her shoulder, she hits the button. The elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to hold a dozen people. Trillian rushes in and hits the up button. She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors close...until the elevator starts going down. 
TRILLIAN Up!! I want to go up! 
She panics. And starts pushing the up button frantically, her heart pounding in her chest. There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator descending...until something drops on the roof with a THUMP! Trillian screams. The elevator comes to a bumps stop. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) No...No... 
Trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator...and then the car starts to move again. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) Go up...please go up! 
Trillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail. The car continues its inexorable descent. Finally, in desperation, she hits the emergency stop button. The elevator stops. The emergency SIREN WHINES. A LONG BEAT. Nothing moves...and then... 
WHAM! Something beats on the roof, trying to break in. And again -- WHAM! The ELEVATOR SHUDDERS and continues its descent. Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the ceiling, scared. The ELEVATOR DINGS! 
Startled, TRILLIAN SCREAMS. The DOORS start to OPEN. Panicked, Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal...a high heel. The DOORS OPEN. -- SOMETHING LUNGES IN! Trillian swings her high heel...right into Pantucci's face! 
Finnegan plows in right behind him. 
PANTUCCI OWWW!! OOWWW!!! 
HANOVER (CONT'D) Where are you going? 
TRILLIAN (freezing) Nowhere... 
FINNEGAN Hanover, listen... 
HANOVER Shut up! 
Hanover hit the elevator button. The elevator starts to rise. 
HANOVER (CONT'D) Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo? 
FINNEGAN I told you... 
PANTUCCI Man, there's something here! On the boat! 
CANTON You see? You see? 
HANOVER Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job... 
FINNEGAN Did you clear this? 
HANOVER With who? 
All of a sudden, the car is jerked to a halt, as if some giant hand was yanking on the cable. 
FINNEGAN With that... 
And then, the elevator jerks down again. And up. Everyone is thrown about like straw. Everyone is shouting, panicked. And then the jerking stops...and the sound of sucking surrounds the car. The cable starts twisting, creaking sickeningly above their heads. 
PANTUCCI It's gonna snap the cable! 
Trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically. 
TRILLIAN Open! Open! God damn it!! 
Finnegan is at the doors, pulling them with all his might. 
FINNEGAN Help me!! 
Pantucci, then Mamooli, then Hanover and Chin pull at the doors as Trillian keeps hitting the buttons. The doors part a bit. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) They're coming! They're coming! 
The doors fly open to...a solid wall. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Oh shit... 
And silence...until the doors slam shut...the cable snaps...and the car plummets! Screaming and shouting mixes with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame against the shaft. Finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator. 
An AUTOMATED VOICE rapidly CALLS OUT right along with it -- 
VOICE 4th floor. 3rd floor. 2nd floor. 1st floor... 
Down, down, down it goes. Faster and faster. But the elevator doesn't stop at the first floor. It keeps dropping. The FLOOR INDICATOR BLINKS: "SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL." 
CANTON It's taking us to the bottom of the ship! 
FINNEGAN HANG ON! 
CABLES SNAP. METAL SCREAMS. The ELEVATOR starts to BUCKLE. Which is actually good, because it's getting jammed sideways in the shaft which slows it down. The it HITS bottom with a resounding crash. 
CUT TO: 
85     SUBLEVEL LOBBY - DAY                                    85 
The DOORS BLOW OUT into the darkened hallway. For a long moment nothing moves, then Finnegan tumbles out of the elevator. Rising painfully. One after another the others exit into the dark lobby. 
HANOVER Where are we? 
CANTON The sublevel lobby. 
Finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles. 
HANOVER Don't touch it! 
Finnegan looks up to Hanover standing a bit shakily, his own rifle trained on Finnegan. 
CAPTAIN He's the owner... 
FINNEGAN Why don't you want a message sent? 
CANTON I just think that... 
FINNEGAN Because you know a message can't be sent... 
There is a moment of silence. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) You're the inside guy aren't you? The guy who knocked out the communications. 
Hanover sets Mason's pulse-rifle down and claps his hands. 
HANOVER Bravo. 
Canton flashes Hanover a look. The Captain is confused. Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON, spins him around and SLAMS him against the hull. 
TRILLIAN How the hell do we fix it?! 
A tense moment as Canton debates his situation, then relents. 
CANTON You can't... All the systems were melted at their core by nitric acid... 
CAPTAIN (confused) This was your life's work...your dreams... 
CANTON My dreams cost more than they would make...I miscalculated the market... there was no way I could recoup... 
FINNEGAN Unless you collected on the insurance... 
TRILLIAN What are you people talking about? 
FINNEGAN He's with them. 
He motions to the mercenaries. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) They rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom. He collects the insurance, and sails off into the sunset clean as a whistle. 
Finnegan fixes Hanover with a look of certainty. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Right? 
The Captain blows. He leaps on Canton. His hands find the older man's throat. 
CAPTAIN All these people dead!! Because you screwed up on the math?? 
Finnegan pulls the Captain off. 
FINNEGAN It's not going to help us! 
CAPTAIN We're going to die here! We're going to die! 
Finnegan holds the Captain with both hands, calming him. 
FINNEGAN I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up? 
TRILLIAN (alarmed) You hear that? 
Unseen by anyone, there is MOVEMENT within the MACHINERY. The walls start to come alive with dark, SHADOWY IMPRESSIONS. HIDDEN within the maze of machinery, OBSCURED by the bad lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes. The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror. 
CAPTAIN They are...they are everywhere. 
FINNEGAN All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves. 
Everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch. Then a loud GURGLING is HEARD. Everybody looks up at the ceiling. 
Hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling. Inside it are strange, disgusting biological workings. The GURGLING suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER. And then we SEE BILLY and LEILA, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty intestine. Still alive. And squirming wildly. EVERYBODY freaks out and HAULS ASS for the hatch. Finnegan and Hanover OPEN FIRE. Covering their asses. 
CUT TO: 
89     ENGINE CHAMBERS - NIGHT                                 89 
Everybody pours out of the machine shop and fans out into this mechanical MAZE. The engine chambers are a labyrinth of pipe-lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and pillars of steel. The LIGHTING is very poor, very dark. 
Hanover, Pantucci, Chin and Mamooli OPEN UP. FIRING blindly and wildly at anything and everything that seems to move in the darkness. The MUZZLE FLASHES and TRACER FIRE light up the chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau. We catch more ABSTRACT GLIMPSES of the translucent TENTACLE-SACS, strange FEELERS, groping SUCKERS, SLIME and VEINS. 
CUT TO: 
TRILLIAN Takes one to know one. 
SNAP!! A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian. Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall. 
Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed. Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt. Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- 
The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach. Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place. Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to Finnegan. 
Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her. Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall. FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND. 
A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle, turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap onto his arm. HE YELLS. 
The Creature starts reeling him in. 
ANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn. 
ANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle. When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running back. Panting hard, she aims the gun. 
FINNEGAN Shoot it! Shoot it! 
Spurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the tentacle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) The safety! The safety! 
Trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to find it. 
TRILLIAN I don't know where it is! 
FINNEGAN On the side!! 
Desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. SMACKS the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink blood, releases Finnegan and recoils. 
Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again. Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Let's get the hell out of here! 
Finnegan staggers to his feet. He and Trillian run off. 
CUT TO: 
91     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     91 
Trillian and Finnegan come running around a corner, and stop to catch their breath. 
FINNEGAN (annoyed) The safety...the safety... He flicks the safety on and off. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Got it? 
TRILLIAN (pissed) Hey! I didn't have to come back. 
FINNEGAN Yeah you did... 
TRILLIAN (defensive) Right... You have a boat. 
FINNEGAN Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal. 
TRILLIAN Oh yeah? What kind is that? 
FINNEGAN The "come back" kind. 
TRILLIAN How do you know that? 
FINNEGAN Takes one to know one. 
Finnegan's small smile makes Trillian acutely uncomfortable. 
V.O. HEELLPP!! 
CUT TO: 
92     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     92 
The Captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web. Struggling, frantic. But the more he struggles, the more enmeshed he gets. He holds his hands out beseechingly to Canton, who stands looking at him in terror. 
CAPTAIN Help me! 
But Canton does not move. All of a sudden Canton sees something deep in the web, behind the Captain, which makes his blood freeze. 
HANOVER (CONT'D) (whispered) ...he's a bloody taxi driver! 
Chin breaks for the catwalk, hurrying after Finnegan. Hanover stands with a very antsy Mamooli, steaming. After a long moment, he strides off after Finnegan as well. 
CUT TO: 
93     BALLAST PASSAGEWAY - DAY                                93 
In SLOW-MO, Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened, pipe-lined passageway. Guns out front. Sight beams sweeping the path ahead. Eyes wide open. Sweat sliding down their faces. Breath coming in short nervous bursts. Hearts pounding out of chests. 
The ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension. 
Then the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON. A creepy-looking reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship. Finnegan continues on. Followed by the others. All sweating hard. Eyes nervously shifting. Fear thick in the air. 
LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE, we SEE Finnegan, Trillian and the others passing below. Then suddenly, in the dark foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate. They come to a door. Finnegan tries the handle. No go. Finnegan turns to Canton, and mimes for keys. Canton shakes his head. He has none. 
HANOVER (whispered) Very good Finnegan...very good. 
Trillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times, and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan looks at her curiously, but with respect. 
CUT TO: 
94     BALLAST SECTION - DAY                                   94 
They ENTER the rear ballast section, where the walls are indeed far apart, half of which is now a small POND. Obviously flooded. The only way out of this room is down some STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater, or through a single violently twisted HATCH DOOR. 
Finnegan tries to push the hatch. It will not give. 
Mamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle to the task. The hatch holds tight. Finnegan turns to Canton, who stands slumped against a railing. He does not look well at all. 
FINNEGAN What's on the far side? 
CANTON I don't know. 
PANTUCCI (nerves) It's your damn ship! What the hell do you mean you don't know? 
Finnegan touches Pantucci's shoulder. 
FINNEGAN Joey, what difference does it make... 
Finnegan enters the water. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) If you hear one shot, you know I made it...start coming... 
Pantucci follows Finnegan to the water. 
HANOVER How do we know you're going to signal...how do we know you're not going to just take off? 
Finnegan stops. 
FINNEGAN I'll wait here... You go check it out. 
Hanover does not move. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) (contemptuous) I didn't think so. 
Finnegan wades into the water. Just before he sinks beneath the surface... 
TRILLIAN Finnegan... 
He looks back. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) Be careful. 
With a smile, Finnegan dives under. Pantucci right behind him. The others stand looking around, nervous. 
CUT TO: 
95     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                      95 
Finnegan SWIMS down to the floor of the ballast. Then into a passageway lined with black pipes. Pantucci right behind him. STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters. 
CREAKS and MOANS. Spooky shit. Both men are wide-eyed as they swim. Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts. The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere. Bubbles drift up from the darkness below. 
The MUSIC IS TENSE...VERY VERY TENSE. Pantucci falls behind. He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM! AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS. The fingers on the dead hand seem to reach out for him. He fights his way past and swims off in a panic. 
CUT TO: 
PANTUCCI I ain't goin' up no more elevators. 
CANTON There's stairways... 
Mamooli SLAMS the HATCH SHUT. Eyes bugging out of his head. 
MAMOOLI I say we stay right here! 
PANTUCCI Are you crazy? 
MAMOOLI (desperate) There's plenty of food here. We can hold out...someone'll rescue us... 
FINNEGAN Who? 
MAMOOLI Someone...maybe they sent an SOS! 
PANTUCCI On what? This son of a bitch (to Canton) zapped the communications. 
HANOVER Mamooli stand down! 
MAMOOLI We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy! 
FINNEGAN Boat or no boat...I'm going... 
Finnegan steps forward. Mamooli aims his rifle right at Finnegan's head. 
MAMOOLI They're wipin' us out one at a time. I say we make a stand. Right here! Right now! Maximum firepower! 
PANTUCCI Somebody shoot this jerk! 
FINNEGAN (calm) Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch! 
MAMOOLI I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here! 
Finnegan freezes. CLOSE ON: The hatch. As a BLACK LIQUID starts to OOZE through a tiny latch-hole. No one sees it. 
FINNEGAN I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish. 
MAMOOLI What the hell are you talking about? 
FINNEGAN Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish. 
The LIQUID SHADOW OOZES down and hits the floor, starts to EXPAND, filling like a water balloon. It's not a liquid. It's a Tentacle. VEINS, FEELERS and SUCKERS begin to form. 
MAMOOLI And what? These things are octopuses 
FINNEGAN I don't know what these things are ...all I know is... 
The TENTACLE slowly RISES UP right behind Mamooli. Inches behind his head. Finnegan and Hanover see it. Eyes widening. 
MAMOOLI What...? What?? 
Mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to strike. 
MAMOOLI (CONT'D) EEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH!!!! 
He opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. The tentacle retreats into the pipes. Mamooli looks around. The room is empty. He runs out. 
CUT TO: 
101     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     101 
Mamooli rushes into the empty passageway, looks left. Then right. His POV. Down the hall another TENTACLE comes racing at him. Mamooli panics, drops his rifle. 
TRACK WITH Mamooli racing down the hallway, looking over his shoulder in fear, as the tentacle comes racing after him...gaining...gaining... almost on him... Mamooli leaps through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift motion. The tentacle slams into the glass portal. Stopped. Mamooli keeps his eye on the portal, and backs up two steps. He lets out a long deep breath of relief, turns... WHAM!!! Another tentacle envelops his face! 
MAMOOLI EEEYYYAAAHHHH!!!!! 
CUT TO: 
102     MECHANICAL CHAMBER - NIGHT                             102 
Dante's Inferno: STEAM, SMOKE, FIRE, STRANGE NOISES, DARK AREAS, and lots of MOVING ENGINE PARTS. 
Finnegan leads, followed by Trillian, Hanover, Pantucci, and Canton. We can HEAR their HEARTS BEATING. Scary shit. Finnegan heads for a open HATCH. It suddenly SLAMS SHUT. He instantly VEERS down another passageway. 
PANTUCCI What the hell is going on!! 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) Finnegan...do something!! Please!! 
Finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling where most of the Tentacles are coming from. Their long TAILS WIGGLE down from a massive clutter of pipes. A bas-relief of horror. Finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades off Hanover's utility belt. 
HANOVER Finnegan, No!!! 
...bites the pins and spits them out. 
FINNEGAN Eat this. 
He chucks the grenades up into the strange WRITHING FRESCO, safely clear of the passengers. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) FIRE IN THE HOLE! 
Pantucci and Hanover throw themselves to the floor. Finnegan pulls Trillian down, covering her. 
BA-WOOM! GELATIN SPRAYS EVERYWHERE. 
CUT TO: 
105     FUJI MARU - SAME TIME                                  105 
A loud, creepy, suction-like SOUND is HEARD, that strange pitter- patter of little feet running across the hull. Then the HULL begins to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE. 
CUT TO: 
106     MID HULL - NIGHT                                       106 
All the MOVEMENT STOPS. The remaining TENTACLES VANISH into the machinery. Pantucci, and Hanover look up from the floor, covered in slime. Finnegan and Trillian also look up...and then look at each other face to face...inches apart. Dripping with slime. 
FINNEGAN Looking good... 
TRILLIAN You should talk... 
Then the machinery shuts down. The engines go dead. ALL SOUND CUTS OUT. An expectant hush. Somewhere, WATER DRIPS... 
WE GO EXTREMELY CLOSE ON Trillian's EYES. Pantucci's EYES. Hanover's EYES. Finnegan's EYES. The air is riddled with ominous expectation. And that's when the HULL BEGINS TO TORQUE. RIVETS POP and SNAP. WATER SPRAYS. METAL BUCKLES. 
107     SHOT:                                                  107 
At the far end of the ship, part of the LOWER BOW RIPS OPEN! AND A WALL OF WATER RUSHES IN. FLOOD CITY! Finnegan's eyes widen as he sees (MODEL SHOT) the massive WAVE OF WATER CRASHING TOWARDS THEM. RIPPING OUT PIPES, DUCTS, WALLS, EQUIPMENT and EVERYTHING in front of it. 
FINNEGAN GO! GO! GO! 
They all hightail it for hatches. Finnegan and Trillian make it into one hatch. Hanover and Pantucci make it into another. WATER CRASHES and SPRAYS behind them. 
CUT TO: 
108     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      108 
Massive AIR BUBBLES EXPLODE out from under the bow. 
CUT TO: 
109     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      109 
RED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH up and down every passageway. And a CLAXTON RINGS, in accelerating tones, giving a frenetic urgency to ALL OF THE 
FOLLOWING SCENES: 
110     A PASSAGEWAY:                                          110 
WATER BLASTS through a hatch and CHASES Finnegan and Trillian down a passageway. They jag left at an intersection -- WATER BLASTS through the hatch directly in front of them. 
FINNEGAN We're going to sink! We've got to get on deck! 
They backtrack. Trillian's now in the lead. They HAUL ASS down a hallway. WATER ROARING IN from everywhere behind them. All of the watertight HATCHES begin to hydraulically CLOSE. Trillian and Finnegan JAG into a hatch. It's a small room. The hatch in front of them closes. WATER BLASTS in behind them. SWEEPS them off their feet. The ROOM quickly starts to FILL UP. Trillian pulls frantically at the hatch. 
CUT TO: 
111     NARROW PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                              111 
Hanover and Pantucci quickly slog their way through knee-high water. Pantucci stumbles into the water, frantically scrambles up. He looks back -- UNDER THE WATER, INKY FORMS hurl themselves down the passageway right towards him. Pantucci YELPS, and splashes away. 
CUT TO: 
112     SUBMERGING ROOM - NIGHT                                112 
117     FUJI MARU REAR DECK - DAY                              117 
The Saipan is still bobbing behind the Fuji Maru. But the HARPOON HOOK, which holds the tow-line and is embedded into the rear deck of the ship, is starting to PRY LOOSE. It JERKS and BUCKS against the metal wall. Canton doesn't notice this as he slips and slides his way up to the railing. He sees the Saipan and smiles. Then he looks off at -- 
118     ISLAND                                                 118 
rising out of the ocean. About a mile away. Canton starts to climb over the railing. And that's when the HARPOON HOOK RIPS FREE. WHIZZES FORWARD. And IMPALES Canton's LEG. He SCREAMS. Tries to spin free. The hook hangs onto his leg for a long, agonizing BEAT as Canton continues to SCREAM. Then the HOOK RIPS FREE, grabs the METAL RAILING and starts TEARING IT off the deck. Canton drops to the deck, holding his leg and whimpering in pain. And then he sees it -- 
119     SPEEDBOAT                                              119 
dangling from its harness down on the watersports platform. 
120     TO SCENE                                               120 
Canton starts to crawl for it. Moaning and bleeding. 
CUT TO: 
121     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                              121 
Finnegan and Trillian race up onto the pool deck. Passing beneath a colorful NEON SIGN which READS: 
"THE FUJI MARU - YOUR FUN SHIP" 
In the dark, Trillian trips. She falls to the slippery, waterlogged deck, and SCREAMS... 
TRILLIAN EEEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH! 
...clawing at her face... Finnegan pulls her hands from her face...and the thing that attached itself there...a small squid from the shattered aquarium. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) (freaked) Ah...ah...ah... 
Tries to catch her breath. 
FINNEGAN It's OK...it's not one of them... it's from the aquarium...it's... 
And then it dawns on Finnegan. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) It's not them...it's it... 
TRILLIAN What? 
FINNEGAN You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this... 
He holds up the squid. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) ...can't exert that kind of pressure... And the way it tracked us? A million little things don't carry portable phones to coordinate positions... What's chasing us... it's one...thing...one giant... thing. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
122     ARIAL POV - MATTE FX SHOT - NIGHT                      122 
...looking down on the Fuji Maru from high up in the air. Beneath the ENTIRE SHIP is an enormous, undulating BLACK SHADOW. A massive monster from the deep. 
CUT TO: 
123     CASINO - NIGHT                                         123 
RED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH. The CLAXTON RINGS. Off to one side of a wall, behind the bar, the dumbwaiter door opens, and Pantucci tumbles out, looks around, and then hears... 
HANOVER (V.O.) Help!! Help!! 
Pantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed bandits... rounds a corner, comes face-to-face with Hanover. 
Hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair. His face is badly constricted. His body paralyzed. He clings to a black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg. It's already to his hip. He grasps desperately for his pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor. This guy ain't gonna survive. 
PANTUCCI YELPS and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally tense. He looks around, sees that there's only one Tentacle, and it's completely occupied with devouring Hanover. Pantucci is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover. Then he looks at the Sac, filled with regurgitated flesh. 
PANTUCCI ...even you don't deserve this. 
Pantucci picks up Hanover's pistol. Then slowly, cautiously, he creeps forward, and sticks the gun into Hanover's TWITCHING HAND. 
PANTUCCI (CONT'D) I'm sorry man... 
He turns and quickly limps off. Hanover's EYES look down at the gun in his hand. Then, with all the strength he has left, he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his head. 
CLOSE ON: Hanover's trembling FINGER. As it slowly squeezes the trigger. He want to kill himself. Needs to hill himself. He squeezes harder. The TRIGGER DEPRESSES! -- CLICK! The gun is empty. Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream. 
PANTUCCI (CONT'D) Man, don't go up there... 
FINNEGAN One whistle... Start the engine... 
Finnegan slams shells into the shotgun. 
PANTUCCI She's gone... 
FINNEGAN Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump... 
PANTUCCI All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick? 
FINNEGAN You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey? 
Finnegan hefts a pulse rifle, and runs out of the pilothouse. 
CUT TO: 
136     FUJI MARU DECK - NIGHT                                 136 
Finnegan drops onto the deck from the tow line. Pulse-rifle leveled. Adrenaline rushing through his veins. A man on a mission. The SHIP is in its final death throes. MOANING and CREAKING. Trillian's scream pierces the night, followed by several shots. Finnegan takes off in it's direction. 
CUT TO: 
137     FUJI MARU PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                           137 
Finnegan ENTERS. Ready to be jumped. The scary MUSIC builds. TENSION CITY. Again shots fired. This time closer. Finnegan throws caution to the winds, and runs for all he is worth. 
CUT TO: 
138     HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        138 
Trillian is being dragged down the dark hallway by a tentacle wrapped around her legs. She struggles frantically, trying to get a clear shot off. But her shot goes wild as she is pulled this way and that, slammed against the walls on either side. She loses her rifle. 
CUT TO: 
139     GRAND ATRIUM - NIGHT                                   139 
Finnegan ENTERS the glass-domed atrium. Sloshes through the water. Stops in the middle and looks around. Sees a Tentacle, writhing up a glass wall of the atrium. Finnegan hears TRILLIAN SCREAM. He quickly plants his feet and FIRES from the hip. GLASS SHATTERS EVERYWHERE. He arcs around. WINDOWS BLOW TO PIECES. Finnegan lets out a low, angry, guttural YELL. The TENTACLE SHREDS from the GUNFIRE. 
CUT TO: 
140     HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        140 
The tentacle dragging Trillian retracts. Freed, Trillian gets up, grabs her rifle, and RUNS LIKE HELL. 
CUT TO: 
141     FRISCO BAR - NIGHT                                     141 
Trillian runs in and is immediately hit by COLORFUL SWIRLING LIGHTS and a PULSATING STROBE. FLASHING RED WARNING LIGHTS, the SOUND of the CLAXTON, the SPRAYING WATER and thick MIST...major psychedelia. Disoriented, Trillian runs towards a dark exit door -- and into a geometric gelatinous SPIDER WEB. Sticks. 
TRILLIAN NOOO!! NOOOO!! HELPP!! HELPP!! 
CUT TO: 
142     ATRIUM - NIGHT                                         142 
Finnegan is slamming another clip into his pulse rifle when he hears TRILLIAN, YELLING for help. He takes off running through a hatch. 
CUT TO: 
143     FRISCO BAR - NIGHT                                     143 
Trillian struggles in the web, but she's only getting herself more stuck. Behind her, deep in the web, Tentacles slowly start squirming their way towards her. Trillian feels the GELATIN start to MOVE. She struggles wildly. 
Panicked. Finnegan ENTERS the room. Spots Trillian. Starts sloshing his way through the water. Trillian sees him coming. 
TRILLIAN Finnegan! 
Trillian looks back. Sees the Tentacles coming out of the darkness of the web. Twenty feet back and closing. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) Hurry!! Hurry!! 
Finnegan runs up and grabs her. Tries to pull her free. But she's stuck good. He looks behind her to the tentacles quickly closing in on her. Now fifteen feet away. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) Get me out of here!! 
148     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            148 
Trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into the dark water. She frantically whispers to herself: 
TRILLIAN Oh my God, oh my God. 
Suddenly, twenty feet from the jet ski, SOMETHING SWIRLS through the water. Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it. Eyes wide. Knuckles white. Breathing hard. WHAMM!! Something drops onto the ski behind her. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) EEEEYYYYAAAHHH!!!! 
She turns, ghost white...to Finnegan. 
FINNEGAN I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready... 
TRILLIAN Soon as I get over the heart attack... 
Finnegan whistles. Waits. No engine goes on. He whistles again. Still no response. Removes his watch, gives it to Trillian. 
FINNEGAN Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go... 
TRILLIAN No... 
FINNEGAN You don't take orders very well, do you? 
TRILLIAN I don't take orders at all. 
FINNEGAN This time, make an exception. 
He grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, and leaps up on the side of the Saipan, and scales up to the deck. Trillian watches him, and then looks at the watch. 
CUT TO: 
149     SAIPAN PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                             149 
Finnegan bursts in. 
FINNEGAN Pantucci!... JOEY! 
Then he spots something on the floor. He reaches down and picks it up. It's Pantucci's leather tool belt. It's been RIPPED TO SHREDS. Finnegan stares at it. His grip tightening. Tears rising in his eyes. His jaw clenching. Then he flings the belt aside. Filled with rage. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Time to die, motherfucker. 
Finnegan hits the ignition button. A desperate moment of dry cranking ...and then the one remaining engine catches, sputters, and fires to life. 
CUT TO: 
150     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      150 
Trillian hears the Saipan's engine come to life. She hits the ignition on the jet ski. Right next to her something drops from the deck of the Saipan into the water. Finnegan clambers up in front of her. His pulse rifle still in hand. 
TRILLIAN Where's you friend? 
FINNEGAN He's not coming... 
The Saipan strains on its leashes. ENGINES GUNNING. Finnegan swings his rifle around. OPENS UP on the tie-lines. All the TIE-LINES SHRED. The Saipan starts to break free. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Hold on! 
He GUNS the ski...and it stalls. The jet ski stalls. Goes dead in the water. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Oh shit!! 
Nearby, the WATER SWIRLS violently. He hammers the starter button. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Come on!! 
The ENGINE STUTTERS. He tries again. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Come on!! 
Another STUTTER. More WATER SWIRLS, getting closer now. But the third time's a charm. The jet ski comes to life and shoots off along the side of the ship. Just as a tentacle comes shooting out of the water. Finnegan fires at it, blowing it to pieces. The last TIE-LINE SNAPS. The SAIPAN LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru. The jammed steering-sticks force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle. 
151     FAST:                                                  151 
Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski. Pedal to the metal. Looking straight ahead. Trillian holds on for dead life. Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski. Finnegan cranks the handlebars. The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS. The Saipan starts to arc around. The WARHEAD gleams in the MOONLIGHT. Dripping water. Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the Fuji Maru. ENGINE ROARING. Throwing water. Another WAVE EXPLODES. A tentacle rears up. Right in front of the jet ski. Finnegan and Trillian lean hard. The JET SKI SKIDS sideways across the water. 
BOUNCING HARD.

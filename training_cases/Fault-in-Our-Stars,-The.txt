FIRST DRAFT 
HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear: 
HAZEL (V.O.) You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories. 
CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES: - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS" WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place. [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.] 
HAZEL (V.O.) On the one hand, you can sugar coat - the way they do in movies and romance novels. 
- "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country. She rests her head on his shoulder. 
HAZEL (V.O.) Where villains are vanquished and... heroes are born and... - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room. 
HAZEL (V.O.) ... beautiful people learn beautiful lessons... 
- "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together. They look deep into one another's eyes. 
HAZEL (V.O.) ... and nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song. 
BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear. 
HAZEL (V.O.) I like that way as much as the next girl, believe me. It's just not the truth. 
Hazel closes her eyes. 
HAZEL (V.O.) This is the truth. And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR: 
HAZEL (V.O.) Sorry. 
FADE IN ON: 
INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw. 
HAZEL (V.O.) Late in the Winter of my 17th year... 
There are, however, some key and obvious differences. First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which help her to breathe. 
Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few years before. 
HAZEL (V.O.) ... my mother decided I was depressed. 
HAZEL I'm not depressed. 
Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains to the DOCTOR: 
FRANNIE ... she eats like a bird. She barely leaves the house, 
HAZEL I'm not depressed. 
FRANNIE ... she reads the same book over and over... 
DOCTOR She's depressed. 
HAZEL I'm not depressed! 
Off her look, CUT TO: QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over: 
SPEAKER #2 Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma. 
PATRICK Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started a few years ago, when I was... As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear: 
HAZEL (V.O.) I'll spare you the gory details of Patrick's ball cancer. Basically, they found it in his nuts, cut most of it out, he almost died, but he didn't die, and now here he is - divorced, friendless, addicted to video games, exploiting his cancertastic past in the heart of Jesus - "literally" - to show us that one day - if we're lucky - we could be just like him. They all say: 
ALL IN UNISON "We're here for you Patrick." Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head. 
PATRICK Who else would like to share? 
(NO RESPONSE) Hazel? Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she stands, sighs... 
HAZEL I'm, uh, Hazel. 16. 
(BEAT) Thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs. Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down. 
PATRICK And how are you doing Hazel? Hazel has no idea how to answer that. 
HAZEL (V.O.) You mean besides the terminal cancer? 
But that's not what she says. She says: 
HAZEL Alright? I guess...? Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down. 
ALL IN UNISON "We're here for you Hazel." Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats. 
PATRICK Maybe now I'll play a song... 
EXT CHURCH - LATER Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks at her like "well, was it great?" Hazel just exhales and gets in the car. CUT TO: 
INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY "America's Next Top Model" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel. Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats: 
FRANNIE It's Friday night. 
HAZEL Hmm? 
FRANNIE I was just thinking... you should call your friends, see what they're up to. 
HAZEL 
(DISINTERESTED) That's ok. Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything. 
MICHAEL Wanna see a movie? Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea. 
HAZEL Why don't you guys go to a movie? (off their look) 
(MORE) 
HAZEL (CONT'D) You haven't been out in a while. Go. Have fun. Take the night off. Frannie and Michael look at one another again. 
MICHAEL This is a really good show. Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what they were doing. CUT TO: QUICK SEQUENCE, which plays over: 
HAZEL (V.O.) And that was my life. - Hazel watching TV, book in hand. - Hazel in another doctor's office. - Hazel popping pills. 
HAZEL (V.O.) Reality shows. Doctor's appointments. Eight prescription drugs, three times a day. 
INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY Hazel and her parents in the kitchen. 
HAZEL (V.O.) And worse worse worst of all... support group. 
HAZEL Ugh. You can't make me. 
MICHAEL Of course we can, we're your parents. Hazel frowns. 
MICHAEL Hazel, you need to get out of the house. Make friends. Be a teenager. 
HAZEL If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot. 
MICHAEL You don't take pot. 
GUS So what happened to you? Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but somehow this seems different. 
HAZEL I was 13 when they found it. And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO: 
INT HOSPITAL BED - FLASHBACK 13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy. 
HAZEL (V.O.) Stage IV thyroid cancer. 
INT OPERATING ROOM - FLASHBACK 13-YEAR OLD HAZEL on the operating table. It's a nightmare. 
HAZEL (V.O.) I had surgery first. 
INT SEVERAL MORE HOSPITAL ROOMS - FLASHBACK This poor little girl is taking a beating. And it's just getting started. - Radiation treatment. 
HAZEL (V.O.) Then Radiation... - Having her head shaved by Frannie. 
HAZEL (V.O.) Then Chemo... - With a PICC line in a chemo chair. 
HAZEL (V.O.) All of which worked for a while. - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased. 
HAZEL (V.O.) And then stopped working. - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe. Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1. 
HAZEL (V.O.) And then my lungs started filling up with water. - In the ICU, her parents standing over her. 
HAZEL (V.O.) That should have been the end. 
FRANNIE (through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie? 14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any longer. He completely breaks down. 
HAZEL (V.O.) But it wasn't. 
INT ICU - THE NEXT MORNING The sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips, the color has returned to her cheeks. 
HAZEL (V.O.) The antibiotics kicked in. They drained the fluid from my lungs. And in time I got better. Stronger. 
INT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication. It's never ending. 
HAZEL (V.O.) I even found myself in an experimental trial. You know the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working. - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray. 
HAZEL (V.O.) It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't work in over 70 percent of patients but, for some reason... The Radiologist looks surprised. 
HAZEL (V.O.) ...it worked in me. They called it "The Miracle." And finally, BACK TO: 
INT GUS'S CAR - SAME Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now. 
HAZEL Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly grown since... 
(MORE) 
HAZEL (CONT'D) Of course my lungs still suck but, theoretically, they could continue to suck in just this way for, I dunno, a while maybe. 
GUS Wow. 
HAZEL Yeah. 
GUS So are you back in school or...? 
HAZEL Can't. 
GUS Why not? 
HAZEL Got my GED. 
GUS A college girl! Well that explains the aura of sophistication... He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm playfully. They're easing into each other. Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway. 
GUS We're here. He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO: 
EXT/INT GUS'S HOUSE - SAME Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "Home is Where the Heart Is" and "True Love is Born from Hard Times." Hazel looks at Gus quizzically. 
GUS My parents call them "encouragements." (rolling his eyes) Don't ask. Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner. 
HAZEL It's not, it's... kind of my bible actually. 
GUS Interesting. What's it about? 
HAZEL Cancer. (off his look) But not in that way, trust me. The guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten, he's... well, the only person I've ever come across who seems to a) understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died. 
GUS 
(INTRIGUED) In that case... I am going to read this horrible book with the boring title that does not contain zombies or stormtroopers. And in exchange... Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf. 
GUS ... all I ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game. Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs. She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a brief, charged moment. 
GUS Your hands are cold. 
HAZEL Not so much cold as under- oxygenated. 
GUS Ooh Hazel Grace... 
(BEAT) I love it when you talk medical to me. Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO: 
INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT Hazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella. Frannie stands in the doorway, notices the new book. 
FRANNIE That's different. Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued. 
FRANNIE Did he give it to you? 
HAZEL By "it" do you mean herpes? Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices. 
FRANNIE I'm sure he'll call, don't worry. 
HAZEL I'm not worried. Please. It's not like I'm waiting for him to call or anything. I just... we hung out. No big deal. Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel rolls her eyes. CUT TO: 
QUICK SERIES OF SCENES: Hazel continues "not to wait" for Gus's call. We see her: - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone. - Watching TV. And checking her phone. - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone. - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone. And checking the phone. Where is he?! Did he forget about her? 
INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little sullen, barely touching her food. Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her eyes bug out. We see: 
"Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something." Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text. "Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!" Hazel smiles again. And then a third text: 
"A BOOK CAN"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'S 
NAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!" Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel looks up. 
MICHAEL Would you like to be excused? 
EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus answers on the first ring. 
GUS (O.S.) Hazel Grace. 
HAZEL Welcome to the sweet torture of reading "An Imperial --" At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other end of the phone. 
HAZEL What the -- are you ok? 
GUS (O.S.) Me? Yeah. I'm excellent. INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and: 
INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME Isaac's head is buried in Gus's couch. He's wailing like a banshee, having some kind of nervous breakdown. 
GUS 
(INTO PHONE) I am, however, with Isaac. Hazel hears more wailing. Has no idea what to make of it. 
GUS (O.S.) 
(TO ISAAC) Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse? Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on. 
GUS Isaac! Focus. On. Me. Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally: 
GUS (O.S.) 
(TO HAZEL) How fast can you get here? Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO: 
(BEAT) Hang on. (turns to Isaac) Isaac! Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand. 
GUS Pillows don't break. Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES. 
GUS You need to break something. Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission. Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands him another. 
GUS Go to town, my friend. And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus. 
GUS I've been looking for a way to tell my Dad that I kinda hate basketball. Think maybe we've found it. Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces. Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage. 
GUS Feel better? Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm around him but looks at Hazel. 
GUS That's the thing about pain... it demands to be felt. Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO: 
INT LANCASTER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT Where Hazel is having dinner with her parents. 
FRANNIE Dr. Maria called today. The PET Scan is set for the eighth. Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice. Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased. 
FRANNIE I told you Support Group was a good idea. Hazel's phone buzzes. "Augustus." She looks to her parents. 
MICHAEL By all means. 
EXT HAZEL'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER Hazel lays on the grass in her backyard staring up at the stars. She rings him back and as she does SPLITSCREEN w/ Hazel in the grass and: 
INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME Gus (upside down) in bed, a laptop on his chest. 
GUS Hazel Grace. 
HAZEL Hello Augustus. 
GUS So I read it again. And I just kept feeling like... like it was a gift. Like you'd given me something important. 
HAZEL 
(TOUCHED) You're welcome. 
GUS On the other hand... we need closure, don't we? 
HAZEL What we need is a sequel. 
GUS Yes. We need to know what happens to Anna's family after she dies. 
HAZEL That's what I kept asking Van Houten for in my letters. 
GUS But he never wrote back. 
HAZEL That's correct. 
GUS Because he's a recluse. 
HAZEL Yeee-up. 
GUS Utterly unreachable. 
HAZEL Unfortunately so. Gus clears his throat, smiles. Hazel waits. 
GUS "Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this 6th of April. Hazel sits up. Could it be...? 
GUS "I am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time to read my book..." 
HAZEL Augustus!? 
GUS I found his assistant. I emailed her. She must have forwarded it to him. (Hazel is stunned) Shall I continue? 
HAZEL Keep reading, keep reading! 
GUS "I am particularly indebted to you, sir, both for your kind words about `An Imperial Affliction' and for taking the time to tell me that the book, and here I quote you directly, `meant a great deal' to you." Hazel pays attention to every word. 
GUS "To answer your question: No, I have not written anything else, nor will I. I do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me. However thank you again for your generous email. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten. 
MICHAEL That's fantastic. 
GUS I'm very lucky. ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to like what she sees a lot more than before. BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs: 
MICHAEL Son, you have to understand... Hazel's still pretty sick. She will be the rest of her life. ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what she's doing and listens. 
MICHAEL She'll want to keep up with you - she's that kind of girl - but the truth is, her lungs -- 
HAZEL You ready Gus? Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO: 
EXT PARK - LATER Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together. 
HAZEL Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests? 
GUS Every last one. 
(BEAT) Probably why I'm still a virgin. Hazel laughs, elbows him. 
HAZEL You're not a virgin. (off his look) Are you really? Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it. 
GUS See this? This circle is virgins... Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle. 
GUS And this... is 17 year old dudes with one leg. Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play. 
GUS 
(EXPLAINING) "Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout. 
HAZEL He sounds Dutch. 
GUS And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And tulips. Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches and orange juice out of a basket. 
GUS Sandwich? 
HAZEL Let me guess -- 
GUS 
(NODS) Dutch cheese. And tomato. (she takes one) The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry. They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play on the bones. 
GUS How cool is that? A skeleton being used as a playground. 
HAZEL You do love your symbols. 
GUS Speaking of which... Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He clears his throat. 
GUS You're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey. 
HAZEL It has crossed my mind. 
GUS Hazel Grace, like so many before you - and I say this with great affection - you spent your Wish... moronically. 
HAZEL I was thir-- 
GUS Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here. 
HAZEL Sorry. Please, continue... 
GUS You were young. Impressionable. The Grim Reaper staring you in the face. And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little Hazel Grace, having never read "An Imperial Affliction" ever know that her one TRUE wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile. Hazel nods in agreement. 
GUS If you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self. 
Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused. 
HAZEL But I... didn't save it. Gus smiles. 
GUS Good thing I saved mine. Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about? 
GUS Got it in exchange for the leg. 
HAZEL (V.O.) I'd been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years and still I trod on. 
INT EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room. They're practically running. There's still no sound. 
HAZEL (V.O.) But make no mistake... The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child. She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We stay with her and WE HEAR: 
HAZEL (V.O.) In that moment I would have been very, very happy to die. 
END SEQUENCE. 
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING The sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart. Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there. 
HAZEL'S NURSE Hello. 
HAZEL Hi. 
HAZEL'S NURSE You're ok, Hazel. Even Hazel seems surprised by that. 
HAZEL'S NURSE Would you like to see your parents? Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much relief. CUT TO: LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her parents "comfortably." 
FRANNIE They thought it was a brain tumor. 
MICHAEL It wasn't - thank god -- 
HAZEL So what happened? 
FRANNIE The usual. Fluid in the lungs, preventing oxygenation. They put that in... There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic bladder that hangs off her bed. 
FRANNIE Drained a liter and a half last night. (That's a lot of fluid.) 
MICHAEL The good news is... no tumor growth. No new tumors in your body. Hazel nods. That is a relief. 
MICHAEL We're all so relieved. Frannie embraces her daughter. 
FRANNIE This is just a thing Hazel. It's a thing we can live with. Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile: 
INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael walk down the hall. Races after him. 
GUS Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing? 
MICHAEL Better, thank you. Much better. Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them. 
GUS They won't let me in. Family only. 
MICHAEL I'm sorry -- 
GUS No I get it. Will you just... will you tell her I was here? 
MICHAEL Of course I will. Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won't get to see her, he still wants to stay. 
MICHAEL Gus. Michael really likes this kid. 
MICHAEL Why don't you go home, get some rest? Gus looks up. That might be for the best. CUT TO: 
INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole "Cancer Team." 
ONCOLOGIST #1 The great news is... Phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth. 
(BEAT) The not so great news is we're still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation. 
(BEAT) So how should we proceed? Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to answer. No one does. 
HAZEL Um, I feel like I'm not the most qualified person to answer that. 
ONCOLOGIST #1 I was talking to Dr. Simmons. DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next. 
DR. SIMMONS It's a strange case. Normally the tumors start resisting the treatment. But that hasn't happened here - yet. Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest. 
DR. SIMMONS Unfortunately, the drug may be worsening the edema. 
FRANNIE We'll be right outside. Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from Gus that reads: "ok?" Hazel looks at it. And she doesn't write back. CUT TO: 
INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT Hazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers: 
MICHAEL Gus again. Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael says into the phone. 
MICHAEL I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep. Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed. 
INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER Hazel reads from "An Imperial Affliction." Her phone buzzes again. "Augustus." It just says "hello?" Again she ignores it. And then a second text. She looks at it. "The silence is deafening." She puts the phone back down. Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks the phone back up. She texts the following: "I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you anymore. I mean I want to. I just..." She thinks about the rest. She writes: "I'm a grenade." She sends the text. Waits. And then there's more to say. She sends a second text. "When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry." She sends that text. Waits. He writes back. "Ok." Hazel reads it. Writes back: "Ok." A beat. Gus responds: "oh my god, stop flirting with me!" Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO: 
EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING An ugly day in Indianapolis. 
INT HAZEL'S HOUSE - SAME Inside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather. The sky - and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day. 
EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD Hazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass, on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET that's been in her backyard for years. 
And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets herself cry. Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a decision. Hazel dials her phone. We hear: 
GUS (O.S.) Hazel Grace! 
HAZEL Hi Augustus. 
GUS (O.S.) Are you crying, Hazel Grace? 
HAZEL Kind of. 
GUS (O.S.) What's the matter? 
HAZEL I don't know. I want to go to Amsterdam. And I want him to tell us what happens after the book and I don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when I was a kid. It's just... everything. Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of silence pass by. 
GUS (O.S.) I demand to see this swing set of tears. Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO: LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus. Which makes everything better. They both look at the swing set. 
GUS I see your point. 
(BEAT) That is one sad swing set. Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder. 
HAZEL Thanks for coming over. 
GUS You do realize... trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you. Hazel says nothing. 
GUS All efforts to save me from you will fail. Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy. 
GUS Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we 
DON'T -- 
HAZEL It's not about Amsterdam. It's about me. It's about... 
GUS Grenades. Hazel nods. 
GUS I get it. One day you're going to explode in a huge ball of fire and everyone close to you will die in your wake. 
HAZEL Exactly. 
GUS There's already two people in your life you're going to destroy. Why add a third to that list. Am I right? 
HAZEL 
(NODS) That's why I don't have a hamster. Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few more beats, looking out at the swing set. Until: 
GUS We have got to do something about this frigging swing set. 
INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER Hazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post. Gus stands next to her. 
HAZEL 
(TYPING) "Swing Set Needs Home." 
GUS "Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home." 
FRANNIE Amsterdam! And a moment later Michael joins them. 
MICHAEL Amsterdam! They're all going crazy with excitement! CUT TO: 
EXT HOUSE - LATER Michael finishes loading up the car. Kisses his wife goodbye. He embraces Hazel. She hugs him back and of course he starts to cry. 
MICHAEL 
(WHISPERING) I love you. I'm so proud of you. 
HAZEL For what? Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another hug. Hazel lets him, laughing. 
INT / EXT CAR - LATER The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes, another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc. Frannie pulls up to Gus's house. They get out of the car and head to the front door, buzzing with excitement. As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by: 
GUS (O.S.) 
BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT 
BELONGS TO ME! Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly spins her back to the car. 
HAZEL Mom? 
FRANNIE We can't eavesdrop, Hazel. Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn. A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips. 
GUS 
(TO FRANNIE) Always a pleasure to see you ma'am. 
(BEAT) Hello, Hazel Grace. 
HAZEL Ok...? 
GUS Ok. 
HAZEL Ok. Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just says, when they stop and look at her: 
FRANNIE Amsterdam! 
EXT AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING A SKYCAP helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and equipment. 
INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose. Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt. Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector. She seems determined to get through this without any help. But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these few steps without oxygen were a struggle. Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her, nervously. 
HAZEL (with some difficulty) Amsterdam! 
INT AIRPORT GATE - LATER Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment. A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit. 
HAZEL Oh that's not necessary. But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them. We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears. 
LITTLE GIRL What's in your nose? 
HAZEL It's called a Cannula. These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe. The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic. 
GIRL'S MOTHER Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry. 
HAZEL 
(SINCERE) No, no. It's alright. 
LITTLE GIRL Would they help me breathe too? 
HAZEL I dunno. Wanna try? Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it. 
LITTLE GIRL Tickles. 
HAZEL Right? 
LITTLE GIRL I think I'm breathing better. 
HAZEL Well... I'd love to give you my cannula but... I kinda really need the help. The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly reattaches it. 
HAZEL Mom! 
FRANNIE What? I like watching you sleep. Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom still can't enjoy herself. 
FRANNIE I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff tonight while you and Gus are at dinner. 
HAZEL What do you mean? 
FRANNIE You have reservations at a place called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set it up. Very fancy according to the Book. And romantic. 
HAZEL Mom... 
FRANNIE I'm just saying... 
HAZEL A 16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery... is totally cool with you. Is that what you're saying? 
FRANNIE (beat, excited) Let's get you dressed! Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO: 
INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth. 
FRANNIE (calling to the bathroom) Hazel! Gus is here. 
(TO GUS) Looking sharp. 
GUS Thank you ma'am. A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks... 
GUS Wow. 
HAZEL 
I... 
(BEAT) Am I under-dressed? 
GUS You look gorgeous. Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go. 
INT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the wind like a spring snowstorm. An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto the city. Excited. The night just beginning. 
EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water. 
HOSTESS Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters. Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit. 
HOSTESS The champagne is our gift. Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass. 
GUS Ok. Hazel raises hers. 
HAZEL Ok. They clink glasses and sip. 
HAZEL Wow that's good. 
WAITER Do you know what Dom Perignon said after he invented champagne? 
(BEAT) `Come quickly,' he said. `I am tasting the stars!' Hazel and Gus smile. 
WAITER Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like a menu or will you have the chef's choice? Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs. 
GUS The chef's choice sounds lovely. (the Waiter nods) And can we get more of this? 
WAITER We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends. The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other. 
GUS Thank you for coming to Amsterdam. 
HAZEL Thank you for letting me hijack your wish. 
GUS Thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa. Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to. The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate: 
WAITER Belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion. Hazel takes a bite. 
HAZEL Oh my god. 
GUS I'm in love with you. 
That gets her attention. 
GUS You heard me. 
HAZEL 
AUGUSTUS -- 
GUS I'm in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you. (shrugs, matter-of-fact) Sorry. At which point, the Waiter reappears. 
WAITER More stars? Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them. 
GUS Just the check, please. 
WAITER No, sir. 
(BEAT) Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten. Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is something else. 
EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the reflections of the city ripple in the water below them. Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO: 
EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air outside is equalled by the buzz in: 
INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room. 
FRANNIE I really don't get that shirt. Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe." (A painting of a pipe with words below that mean "This is not a pipe.") 
HAZEL Van Houten will get it. Trust me. There are like fifty Magritte references in "Imperial Affliction." 
FRANNIE 
(READING) "This is not a pipe." 
HAZEL Exactly. 
FRANNIE But it is a pipe. 
HAZEL No it's not. It's a drawing of a pipe. See? 
(SHE DOESN'T) All representations of a thing are inherently abstract. A drawing of a thing is not the thing itself. Nor is a t-shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself. Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed. 
FRANNIE When did you get so grown up? I feel like it was yesterday I was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue. You thought I was a genius back then. 
HAZEL Why is the sky blue? 
FRANNIE 
(BEAT) Because I say so. A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in. 
GUS Who's ready for some answers! 
EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER 
Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house. 
HAZEL I'm so excited I can barely breathe. 
GUS As opposed to other days...? She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen tank, and up they go towards his front door. As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud. Like, obnoxiously loud. Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's no response. 
GUS Maybe he can't hear over the music? Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait. Still excited. A moment later the door swings open. It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is: 
MAN IN PAJAMAS What?! Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be? 
GUS Mr. Van Houten? At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces. Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed door, they hear this: 
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.) 
(SHOUTING) 
HAZEL We have some questions -- 
VAN HOUTEN Uh-huh... 
HAZEL About what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind. Like her Mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy -- 
VAN HOUTEN 
(INTERRUPTING) How familiar are you with Swedish hip-hop? Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding? 
HAZEL I would say... limited? 
VAN HOUTEN But presumably you know Afasi Och Filthy's seminal album "Flacken." 
GUS Um... 
VAN HOUTEN Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla' immediately. 
Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers. Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled. 
HAZEL (yelling over the music) I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak Swedish. 
VAN HOUTEN 
(YELLING) Who the hell speaks Swedish? The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling. The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music. 
GUS Are you messing with us? 
VAN HOUTEN Pardon? 
GUS Is this some kind of performance? 
VAN HOUTEN Rudolf Otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you. And I say to you, my friends, if you cannot hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic response to fearfulness, then my work is not for you. Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all this way for this? 
HAZEL So anyway... when the book ends, Anna's mom -- 
VAN HOUTEN (raising a hand to silence 
HER) Let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise. Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues. 
VAN HOUTEN The tortoise has a ten yard head start. In the time it takes you to run ten yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one yard. And so on, forever. 
(MORE) 
VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D) You are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him, you see, you can only decrease his lead. Now certainly you can run past the tortoise as long as you don't contemplate the mechanics involved but the question of how turns out to be so complicated that no one really solved it until Cantor's proof that some infinities are bigger than other infinities. Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond. 
VAN HOUTEN I assume that answers your questions. 
GUS 
(TO HAZEL) I don't know what's going on. 
VAN HOUTEN And yet you seemed so intelligent in print, Mr. Waters. (under his breath) Must be all that cancer in your brain. 
LIDEWIJ Peter! Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the situation. 
HAZEL Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for a sec? I mean, I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue -- 
VAN HOUTEN I'm not interested in talking about that book. 
HAZEL - but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right? 
VAN HOUTEN I said I'm not interested -- 
HAZEL 
(GETTING UPSET) But you promised! 
(CALMS HERSELF) 
GUS You did not spend it on him. You spent it on us. They embrace once more. 
HAZEL I wanted... 
GUS I know... I know. Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory. This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes outside. Clearly she's been crying too. 
LIDEWIJ I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made him cruel. I thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but... I'm very sorry. 
Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way. 
LIDEWIJ Perhaps we can do some sightseeing. Have you seen the Anne Frank House? 
GUS I'm not going anywhere with that monster. 
LIDEWIJ He is not invited. 
EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news. 
LIDEWIJ I'm afraid there's no elevator. 
HAZEL Oh, um, that's alright. 
LIDEWIJ No, there are many stairs. Steep stairs. 
HAZEL I can do it. 
GUS 
HAZEL -- 
HAZEL I can do it! Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments today. They are going inside. CUT TO: 
INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs. 
LIDEWIJ Shall we? Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So far so good. They find themselves in an office space. 
LIDEWIJ This is the bookcase that hid the Frank family and four others. The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time. 
Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen tank. Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored breathing the entire time. ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting. Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages. Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow. 
GUS You're a champion. Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this he looks at Hazel: 
GUS That's enough -- 
HAZEL 
(RESOLUTE) I'm ok. Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult. Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull herself through. Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her. 
GUS We're at the top. That's it. Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern. She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here. And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway. This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing their story. 
LIDEWIJ The only member of the whole family to survive was Otto, Anne's father. Gus takes Hazel's hand. 
LIDEWIJ I don't know how you go on, without your family. 
Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary. The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the same. The room is dark. 
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) "At such moment's, I don't think about the misery..." Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it. 
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) "...but about the beauty that still remains." Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him. Their eyes meet. The emotions build... 
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) "Try to recapture the happiness within yourself. Think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy." And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me- against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a small eternity. Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second, they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do... When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes, Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO: 
INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss: 
GUS It's above my knee. She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt. 
GUS It tapers a little and then it's just skin -- 
HAZEL What? 
SORRY -- 
GUS I'm sorry too -- 
HAZEL It's so unfair -- 
GUS I should have told you -- 
HAZEL It's so fucking unfair! A beat. Gus still trying not to cry. 
GUS Apparently the world is... not a wish-granting factory. And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be sad and feel awful. But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears. 
GUS Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time. She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces. 
HAZEL Does it hurt? 
GUS It's ok. 
(BEAT) I'm ok. 
HAZEL Ok. 
GUS Ok. But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile. Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek. 
GUS What? 
HAZEL I'm just... I'm very fond of you. He grabs her hand and holds it. 
GUS I don't suppose you can forget about it, treat me like I'm not dying. 
HAZEL I don't think you're dying, Augustus. You've just got a touch of cancer. Gus nods. Squeezes her hand. 
GUS Would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now? 
Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the two of them, so in love, we CUT TO: 
INT AIRPLANE - LATER Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window, leaving Amsterdam behind. 
INT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says - instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and Gus)." Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO: 
INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT Hazel sits with her father on the couch. 
HAZEL Gus had a recurrence. 
MICHAEL 
(NODS) Mrs. Waters told us the night before you left. 
(BEAT) I'm sorry Hazel. They sit for a beat. Tears form in Michael's eyes. 
HAZEL You're not gonna say it? 
MICHAEL What's that? 
HAZEL The usual. "Everything happens for a reason..." Michael shakes his head. 
MICHAEL I don't know, Haze. 
(BEAT) I always thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe... 
(BEAT) ... that has not been my experience. Hazel understands exactly. CUT TO: 
INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work. Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company. 
HAZEL How are your eyes? 
ISAAC Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're not in my head is the only problem. 
GUS I hate to one-up you but... seems my entire body is made out of cancer now, so... Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh. 
ISAAC My throw was to the left or I should aim to the left? 
GUS Aim left. Isaac turns his shoulders. 
GUS Lefter. Isaac turns some more. 
GUS Yes! Excellent! And throw hard. Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it - missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE. 
GUS Bullseye! 
ISAAC Really? 
GUS No you missed it by like 20 feet. (hands him a THIRD) Try one more time. Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight. Isaac's face lights up. 
HAZEL Woo hoo! Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses. 
GUS Keep throwing, keep throwing! Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment. Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out. 
MONICA'S MOM What in God's name -- Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks. 
GUS Are you Monica's mom? 
MONICA'S MOM 
(CONFUSED) I am. 
GUS Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge. We may not look like much. Between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes, and two and a half working lungs. 
(MORE) 
GUS (CONT'D) But we also have two dozen eggs. So If I was you, I would go back inside. Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word, she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate. As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus on the cheek. And over we hear: 
HAZEL (V.O.) A few days later, Gus landed in the hospital with chest pains. 
INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY Hazel bounds in to find Mrs. Waters in the waiting room. She stands to hug Hazel. They both sit down. 
HAZEL How's he doing? 
MRS. WATERS He's had a tough night, Hazel. His blood pressure's low. His heart -- Mrs. Waters starts to cry. 
HAZEL What about the chemo? 
MRS. WATERS (shakes her head) They're gonna stop the chemo. They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself. 
HAZEL Can I see him? 
MRS. WATERS 
(BEAT) We have to be a family now. Hazel nods. She understands. 
MRS. WATERS We'll tell him you were here. 
HAZEL If you don't mind, I'll just hang for a while. Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places. 
EXT INDIANAPOLIS MUSEUM OF ART - DAY Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a WHEELCHAIR, to their spot on the hill overlooking "Funky Bones." A second picnic, this time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones. 
HAZEL What are you thinking about? 
GUS Oblivion. 
HAZEL Augustus... 
GUS I know it's kid's stuff but... I always thought I'd have a grand story to tell, you know? Something that would run in all the papers. I always thought I was special. 
HAZEL You are. 
GUS Yeah but... you know what I mean. Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus can tell he's said something wrong. 
GUS What? 
HAZEL I know Mom. And I will. I promise. But right now... I really gotta go. 
INT CHURCH - LATER Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy. 
GUS Hazel Grace, you look ravishing. 
HAZEL I know, right? 
(BEAT) So, um, what's going on guys? 
ISAAC You're late. 
HAZEL Late for what exactly? 
Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does. 
GUS I wanted to attend my funeral. By the way, will you speak at my funeral? Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses him on the mouth. 
GUS Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, I thought I'd - well, not to put you on the spot, but I thought I'd arrange a pre-funeral. 
HAZEL Why now? 
GUS No time like the present. 
HAZEL (looks around the room) How did you even get in here? 
GUS Would you believe they leave the door open at night? 
HAZEL Um, no. 
GUS As well you shouldn't. He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs. Isaac clears his throat. 
ISAAC "Augustus Waters was a self- aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him... not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked, or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more." 
GUS 
ISAAC I'm assuming you've got some time, you interrupting bastard! I mean seriously... (back to the speech) "Augustus Waters talked so much that he'd interrupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious. 
(MORE) 
ISAAC (CONT'D) Sweet Jesus that kid never took a piss without pondering the resonances of human waste production. And he was vain. But that comes with superhuman handsomeness." Gus nods - that part is true. 
ISAAC "But I will say this: when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to piss off, because I don't even want to see a world without Augustus Waters." Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate emotional waterfall. 
ISAAC "And then, of course, having made my rhetorical point, I will put my robot eyes on because, I mean... robot eyes!" Gus has a big smile on his face. 
ISAAC "So anyway, Augustus, my friend... Godspeed." Gus nods a couple times. 
GUS Thank you Isaac. This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern. 
ISAAC Goddamn it, Gus. 
GUS Hey don't swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus. 
ISAAC Shit! Ass! Balls! Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes. 
ISAAC Can I get a hand here, Hazel? Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get him, walks him back to her seat. 
GUS Hazel Grace, it's down to you. 
Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes a beat to ready herself. 
HAZEL "Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. 
(BEAT) Like all real love stories - ours will die with us, as it should. I'd hoped that he'd be eulogizing me, because there's no one I'd rather have..." And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together. 
HAZEL (beat, composing herself) "I can't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I love you." Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO: 
BLACK. Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE. 
VAN HOUTEN Omnis Cellula e cellula. Hazel ignores him. 
VAN HOUTEN Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last -- 
HAZEL You read your fan mail now? 
VAN HOUTEN I would hardly call him a fan. He despised me. But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral and tell you what became of Anna and her mother. So here I am and that's your answer: omnis cellula e cellula. 
HAZEL I'm so not in the mood -- 
VAN HOUTEN "Life comes from life." 
HAZEL Goodbye Mr. Van Houten. 
VAN HOUTEN You don't want an explanation? 
HAZEL Nope. Thanks though. Have a great life. 
VAN HOUTEN You remind me of her. 
HAZEL 
(BEAT) I remind a lot of people of a lot of people. 
VAN HOUTEN She was eight, my daughter. She suffered... beautifully. For so long. Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens. 
HAZEL She had leukemia? Like Anna? 
VAN HOUTEN Just like her, yes. 
HAZEL Were you married then? 
VAN HOUTEN Not when she died, no. I was insufferable long before Anna, my dear. Grief doesn't change you, Hazel, it reveals you. Hazel takes that in. 
HAZEL Well I'm sorry for your loss. 
VAN HOUTEN And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry for everything, for being so rude to you two, for ruining your trip -- 
HAZEL You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. We had an awesome trip. 
VAN HOUTEN Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You asked me to tell you what happens and I wish I could do that. I wish that I could. But I can't. No one can. No one knows, Hazel. They don't talk to us. Unless... Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball. 
HAZEL You think I care about that? I don't give a shit, Van Houten. Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten. 
HAZEL You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. And I'd like you to get out of my car right now so I can go home and grieve. 
VAN HOUTEN 
(STUNNED) 
BUT -- 
HAZEL Get out of the car! Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands there as Hazel peels out. In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO: 
INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY Hazel lies in front of the TV. "Top Model" is playing but she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up. 
INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon there's a knock. 
HAZEL 
(THROUGH TEARS) Occupada. 
MICHAEL (O.S.) Can I come in? Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down next to her, putting her head on his shoulder. Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more. Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry. 
MICHAEL I'm so so sorry. 
(BEAT) It was a privilege to love him, though, wasn't it? Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad. 
MICHAEL Gives you an idea how we feel about you. Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws strength from him.

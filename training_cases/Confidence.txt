First Draft March 2000 
BLACK: JAKE (V.O.) So I'm dead... FADE IN: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT) Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids. We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run for Congress some day.  At first glance. Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling in a strawberry field. JAKE (V.O.) And I think it's because of this redhead... BUTCH (O.S.) Know who I am, Jake? JAKE The Anti-Christ? BUTCH (O.S.) No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers. There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull. The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a "Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch". BUTCH (cont' d) Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake. JAKE Gee... What makes you say that? BUTCH Your life flashing before your eyes? JAKE Just the last three weeks. 
EXT.- THE EUCLID/CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT. Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder. The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner-- OFFICER (O.S.) Everybody FREEZE! As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a full sprint down the street. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a middle aged cop with a couple of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun drawn, in a dramatic stance. SOBOZINSKI (yelling) I said, freeze you motherfucking, cocksucking, scumbags! The second middle aged cop, OFFICER RICHARD ROTTOVICH comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski. ROTTOVICH We're clear. Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him. SOBOZINSKI (still yelling) Or I'll blow off every one of your fucking heads! Sobozinski lets out a bellowing LAUGH. We PAN OVER TO REVEAL Jake, Miles and BIG AL (the Patron) sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy. JAKE Stop waving that thing around. MILES You sure we're clear? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROTTOVICH Guy looked like he was trying not to shit himself. (re: the Dead Guy) Nice. DEAD GUY What took so fucking long? The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO, late 20's, dressed in a blood soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face. DEAD GUY/GORDO I've been lying in this shit like half the night. MILES You guys were late.   We had to go to a Mexican stand-off. JAKE And you know I hate guns. Jake tosses the revolver on the bar. SOBOZINSKI We were fighting crime. MILES Keeping the city streets safe for drug dealers and pedophiles everywhere. Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases. Gordo strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE VEST. A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody, explosive squib. Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot where the squib was. GORDO Shit. JAKE I told you, use less powder. GORDO But you won't get that splatter effect. Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the pile. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE Then these go into your cut. Big Al moves over to the bar. BIG AL Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside? JAKE Gordo plays the inside.   You're the Shill. BIG AL Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted. JAKE What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do. (off Al's smile) We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you? BIG AL I' m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls? Al slaps Jake on the back and exits. Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder. JAKE What?   I can feel you looking at me. GORDO That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick. JAKE Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back. GORDO I guess. I gotta drop a dime.    Did anybody mess up the hoop? MILES It's clean. Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jake's smile fades as he watches her saunter into the bar, but not before she throws him another glance over her shoulder. Jake continues on into... CUT TO: INT.- NEIGHBORHOOD BAR- CONTINUOUS A semi-crowded bar.    Not hip and trendy like "Wax." Jake finds an empty stool at the end of the bar and orders a drink. He takes a second to look around at the cliques of people talking, laughing, having a good time before he pulls a newspaper out his coat pocket. Jake takes a pen from the bar and opens to the crossword section. JAKE (V.O.) And if you believe that money can do all that for you, you're the perfect mark. Jack Kerouac said that if you own a rug, you own too much. I don't necessarily like Kerouac and driving cross country isn't exactly my idea of a good time, but the guy's got a point... Jake sits alone with his crossword puzzle. CUT TO: INT.- JAKE'S APARTMENT- LATER Jake enters a sparsely furnished loft. The skyline of Brooklyn twinkles through dirty, picturesque windows. Jake drops his keys on a table and hits a button on an answering machine. ANSWERING MACHINE You have no new messages. JAKE (V.O.) If you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose. And when it comes to money, finding it and losing it, you always gotta remember how much of it's just luck... Jake stands his sparse little world, addressing the quiet before he fishes for his wallet, which he can't find. LILY (V. O. ) Oops. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The realization makes Jake smile. Then a FLAPPING SOUND spins him around to see a PIGEON, flapping up against the inside of a partially opened window. Visibly upset by the bird, Jake moves towards the window and pushes it wide, allowing the bird to escape. JAKE Dumb fucking luck. Jake stares out the window after the bird. CUT T0: INT.- DOLBY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT A nicer apartment than Jake's. Lionel Dolby, the Mark from the Euclid rushes around, haphazardly throwing things into a suitcase. There's a KNOCK on the door that stops Lionel dead in his tracks. Another KNOCK.       Lionel still frozen. The door flies open with a      BOOM. In the doorway, we see HARLIN, an older mountain      of a man dressed in a plain black suit. Behind him is       LUPUS (late-20's), dressed in a sweatsuit a pilot could      spot from 20,000ft. LUPUS Mr. Dolby.    King would like a word with you. LIONEL R-r-right now? LUPUS Please. We have a car waiting.     I apologize for the door. CUT T0: INT . - JAKE'S APARTMENT- MORNING A RINGING PHONE... Jake stirs on the futon oddly placed on the floor in the middle of the room and picks up the phone. JAKE Yeah. MILES (O.S.) You better get over to Al's.    Now. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE (cont'd) It's bad luck. MILES Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere... JAKE He'll find us. We go talk to him. GORDO Whoa.   What? MILES We're going to give him the money back? JAKE You know what we're doing with the money. GORDO And what about Big Al? JAKE Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too. A WAITRESS approaches. WAITRESS What can I get you guys? MILES Coffee.   And a valium. Jake turns his attention out the window. CUT TO: EXT. - THE EUCLID-- DAY A basement bar in a crummy neighborhood. There's no sign, but everything about it says, "Condemned." JAKE (V.O.) The Euclid was our place. CUT TO: 
INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY Jake, Miles and Gordo sit at the bar of the run down watering hole. Jake stands placing neat stacks of money into a Fed-Ex box. JAKE (V.O.) Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot in a card game. We used it every now and then for a rag, but mostly it was our office. Our Power Point. Gordo and Miles start unloading the same neat stacks of money from their pockets. It's not as much as Jake put in. JAKE That's it? 
MILES/GORDO Bills.../Had that thing... Shaking his head, Jake seals the Fed--Ex box, then hands the form to Miles and. Picks up the phone. MILES (cont'd) Do we want insurance? (off their looks) I'm just asking... JAKE Just mail it to the hospital. (dialing) Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you. Jake hangs up the phone. GORDO When? JAKE Tonight.   Just me. MILES Fuck that.    We're going too. GORDO Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do? Jake levels a stare at Gordo for a second. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE Meet me at my place later. MILES How do you know the King's going to let you walk? JAKE I'm getting a ride. Jake picks up the phone and dials another number. CUT TO: EXT.- THE BULLDOG GYM- NIGHT A neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what kind of gym it is. A police car comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and Sobozinski in the front seats. Jake gets out of the back. SOBOZINSKI The King, huh? Nice going. JAKE I try. ROTTOVICH Don't dick around too long. And if he stabs you or shoots you or causes any other form of profuse bleeding, call a cab because you are not getting back in this car! Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus stand vigil. Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit. HARLIN We appreciate your punctuality.   Mr. King is expecting you. Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake down. HARLIN Lupus! LUPUS What? You said pat him down, I'm pattin' him down. Harlin shakes his head and pushes Lupus out of the way. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE No.   Just confidence. The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake. KING PIN I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once. JAKE We got caught. So you know it won't happen again. With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the neck. KING PIN I know it won't happen because you're going to feel like a Prom Queen who just got gang fucked by the wrestling team! A few pained CHOKES from Jake as his knees buckle. HARLIN Mr. Vig arrived with an escort.   NYPD. The King loosens his grip and let's Jake fall. KING PIN Grifters... Always working  an angle. Alright. I can see you got   some vision. But I give you the Mark. I   tell you the who and you give me the  how. Lupus go with him. Lupus snaps to attention. LUPUS What? KING PIN Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me. Jake begins to speak, but is silenced with a look. KING PIN He goes.   Now let me see your hands. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The King picks up the nail file again. JAKE Why? KING PIN You ask a lot of questions.   Come on. (motioning with nail file) Let me see `em. Jake turns to find Lupus and Harlin on either side of him. They take him by the wrists and hold his hands up for the King. KING PIN (cont' d) I don't like to ask things more than once, Junior. I want you to know how much that irks me. The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers with the nail file. Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his fingers. Jake shuts his eyes... Then opens them to find the King now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress. KING PIN You have incredibly soft hands. Good cuticles . They' re like a baby's hands. Grifters with rough hands... You know that they're probably not that good. Means they've had to do some hard labor to make ends meet. But you... Smooth... Supple. The King continues to stroke Jake's hands with his own meaty paws. BUTCH (V.O.) Are you insinuating that the King Pin is of an alternative lifestyle? CUT TO: EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT) Jake shakes his head slowly. JAKE I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE You never know when you can use a crooked cop. BUTCH Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby. JAKE So you want to know how to play the Big Con. BUTCH In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con. Butch shoves the gun a little harder into Jake's head. CUT TO: INT.- BAR- NIGHT A trendy bar, dimly lit and packed. We PAN along the hip crowd and STOP on Jake speaking with a SLICK GUY dressed in black Armani. JAKE (V.O.) First thing about being on the grift.... You're only as good as your Mark. The Roper's the guy who finds them. Jake buys another round to the indifferent Slick. JAKE (V.O.) They all have money one way or another. Some of them come from money. THE SCENE DOESN'T CHANGE--- Slick MORPHS into a FAT TEXAS BUSINESS MAN wearing a ten-gallon hat. He doesn't smile. JAKE (V.O.) There's that saying-- Show me an honest man and I'll show you a natural born liar. There's always that little bit of bad no matter how much good. It's that little itch on the back of you neck. You may not even know it's there, but it is. The Fat Texan MORPHS into a WALL STREET-type suit, who remains stoic as Jake reaches over for another round of drinks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE (V.O.) A good Roper knows how to scratch it-- You the outdoorsy-type? "I was just fly fishing out in Montana". You play the market? "I just got a tip on a tech start-up IPO." You saw "the 'Riverdance" twice? "I had a roommate in college who was gay." Whatever... Wall Street MORPHS into a THIN EURO-TRASH man who takes a drink from Jake without even a "thanks." JAKE (V.O.) It means that in fifteen minutes we're on good terms. Thirty, I'm your buddy. Euro-Trash MORPHS into an distinguished looking OLDER MAN as he takes a sip. JAKE (V.O.) In an hour, I'm your best friend. Jake punctuates some unheard point with a slap on his knee. JAKE (V.O.) Give me a day and you'll let me do your wife and daughter at the same time. It's too late for you... Jake looks up as the OLDER MAN MORPHS into LIONEL DOLBY, the nervous mark from the earlier con. JAKE (V.O.) I have your confidence. CLOSE-UP: Dolby's lips loosen in a wide SMILE. Jake smiles back. He puts his drink down, then takes the drink from Dolby. They remain talking as THE BACKGROUND-- MORPHS INTO: EXT. - SIDEWALK-NIGHT Under the light of a streetlamp, the two continue to talk. JAKE (V.O.) I tell you the "Tale"-- It's the story of how we're going to make easy money. No one gets hurt. And here's the guy who's going to help. That's when you meet the Insideman. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and looking slightly anxious. Introductions are made. JAKE (V.O.) The Insideman's the one with the know- How, the scoop, the angle. But maybe 'you' re the suspicious type . So I give you the "Convincer." We both put up a little and we get a little back. Just a taste. Gordo pulls an envelope out of his coat and gives it to Dolby. JAKE (V.O.) Just enough that when I tell you we can make more off of it, you agree. Jake speaks quickly to Dolby who nods emphatically.    He hands the envelope back to Gordo. JAKE (V.O. ) That`s when I put you on the "Send." You put in -a little, you got a little. Put in a lot... I "send" you out for mare.  As much as you can get. CUT TO: INT. - JAKE'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Jake stands TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA, loading a big, black revolver with bullets. JAKE Doesn't matter what the con is. Insider trading, a line we got on   a bookie club, insurance scam, whatever... You saw the money and you want it. More of it. Who cares   if you have to bend the rules a little?  As long as no one gets hurt. Jake spins the gun cylinder then SLAPS it closed, pointing it straight at the CAMERA. JAKE (cont'd) Then someone does... BLAM!!! CUT TO: 
CONTINUED: JAKE (not so innocently) Oops. Jake takes her by the arm out to... CUT TO: EXT.- ALLEY/OUTSIDE BAR- NIGHT Jake pushes Lily through the back door where she finds Gordo, Miles and Lupus waiting. Her once flirtatious demeanor is replaced by something harder. LILY What is this? You guys cops or something? JAKE We're not cops. GORDO You gotta be kidding me.       Her? JAKE Yes, her.    Where's my wallet? LILY Your what? Jake takes her bag and dumps the contents on the floor-- A few wallets, a watch, even a wedding ring. Jake picks up one of the wallets filled with cash. LILY (cont'd) That's not-- JAKE (pocketing the wallet) You interested in a little work? Lily scoops up her bag and finds a cigarette, eyeing them all suspiciously. LILY Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a waxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy. (lighting the cigarette) Jake. 
JAKE Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right? LILY Says who? JAKE You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me. Lily takes a second to look the guys over. Miles gives her a wink. Lily slowly raises her middle finger at him. JAKE We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up. LILY Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going? Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin. Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing. She puts her hands on Jake's chest and leans in a half inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his. She whispers... LILY (cont' d) Keep the wallet. We're even. Take a deep breath... Count to ten... And go fuck yourself. Lily pushes past Jake and heads out of the alley. MILES Is it just me or is there something really hot about a girl telling you to go fuck yourself? Gordo gives Jake a nod of approval and Jake takes off after Lily. CUT TO: 
EXT.- CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT Lily down the street, Jake giving chase. JAKE Alright!   Hold up.    You win.   You got the job. LILY Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off. Jake catches up and blocks Lily's way. JAKE We had to see what your deal was.      I'm just a little superstitious. LILY Here's my deal-- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me. JAKE I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before? Lily studies Jake's face for any hint of sarcasm.      None. LILY No. (beat) What's my cut? JAKE You get an equal cut. LILY What do I have to do? JAKE Just play a part.     A little acting. Lily steps back and hails a cab. LILY Make a wish. She points to a large digital clock hanging in a store window reading "11:11p". LILY Eleven-eleven. If you're superstitious, make a wish. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CONTINUED: An envelope stuffed with cash MATERIALIZES on the desk next to Ashby. CUT TO: EXT . -- CAYMEN ISLANDS--DAY Crystal clear water gently rolls onto a white beach. JAKE (V.O.) Our guy gets us approved for the start up capital. But, the money can't be transferred to any one person. On the given day, the money's wired into a corporate account in an off-shore bank. CUT TO: INT.- GRAND CAYMEN'S BANK- DAY Another empty bank... A lone TELLER MATERIALIZES behind the counter. JAKE (V.O.) That same day, I show up in the Caymens with the proper I.D. and corporate papers to make a withdrawal. Jake MATERIALIZES on the empty bank floor, walking confidently up to the Teller with a SILVER BRIEFCASE in hand. MILE5 (V.O.) Uh... JAKE (V.O.) What? MILE5 (V.O.) I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase? JAKE (V.O.) Good point. Jake approaches the Teller, now wheeling a BLACK SUITCASE behind him by the handle. Jake presents the Teller with a series of papers and a photo I.D. JAKE (V.O.) It's bank policy not to release this money in cash because it's under a corporate account. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Teller turns to a computer printer and removes a check. Jake signs a few documents and places the check into his pocket. CUT TO: EXT.- CAYMEN ISLANDS/STREET--DAY Lined with shops and stores, but it's as empty as the bank. Not even a car: Jake strides out of the Grand Caymen's Bank and walks across the street to another building with a sign reading "BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS." CUT TO: INT.- BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS- DAY Again, empty... Jake strides in and approaches the deserted teller counter. ANOTHER TELLER MATERIALIZES and greets him with a smile. JAKE (V.O.) So we cash the check at another bank. Jake slides the suitcase and the check over to the Teller. CUT TO: INT.- JFK AIRPORT/TERMINAL HALLWAY- DAY Like the banks, empty. Jake walks with the suitcase down the flourescent lit hall towards a series of tables under a sign marked "Customs." JAKE (V.O.) Now, this is the most important part-- You can't just walk into the United States with a suitcase full of cash without evoking the words "cavity search". As we get closer to the Custom's Desk, a CUSTOMS OFFICER wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a badge MATERIALIZES behind it. JAKE (V.O.) That's why you need someone on the inside at Customs. Jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him. The Officer slides it back to Jake, revealing another envelope stuffed with cash under it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Officer literally looks the other way as he pockets the envelope and waves Jake through the gate. CUT TO: EXT.- JFK AIRPORT- DAY Jake exits the terminal. Outside, the street is empty, not a traveler, an airlines rep, a luggage handler or a cab. Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the "walk" signal is given. JAKE (V.O.) Then we disappear. As he walks away, WE SEE some PEOPLE MATERIALIZE carrying luggage... Then a FEW CARS... Then an AIRLINE REP... Gradually more and more people and cars, each MATERIALIZING into a normal scene at the airport until we lose Jake in the crowd. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID- RESUMING Jake stops and gauges the crew for their reactions, which are the same all the way around-- Slack jawed disbelief. MILES (breaking the silence) This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard. GORDO People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A. JAKE It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs. MILES Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea... JAKE Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run? 
CONTINUED: Moonan holds up crime scene photos of Big Al's body. MOONAN (cont'd) Preliminary forensics suggests he was. Sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him. ROTTOVICH Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about. Moonan takes out a microcassette recorder and hits PLAY. ROTTOVICH (V.O. from tape) Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand. CLICK.   Moonan kills the recorder. MOONAN Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The two serious looking gentlemen outside? Internal Affairs. The Officers look out the window to see TWO SERIOUS LOOKING MEN in suits. MOONAN Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card. (off their silence) Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix." SOBOZINSKI What do you want? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MOONAN You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross-departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it. SOBOZINSKI What do you get out of it? MOONAN Peace of mind. SOBOZINSKI That's it? MOONAN Not everyone's on the take, Walter. ROTTOVICH If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now? MOONAN I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act. SOBOZINSKI This guy must have been a real pain in your dick. MOONAN Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice? Rottovich and Sobozinski remain silent. MOONAN Good. One more thing... You gotta give up the booty. I can't have you guys running around with heroin. FREEZE FRAME ON MOONAN'S SMILING FACE. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE (V.O.) Let me tell you something about Moonan... CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT) A serious look comes across Jake's face-- Hate.       Butch eases back with the gun for a second. JAKE He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars. BUTCH Cue the fucking violins.   Come on... It's getting cold. CUT TO: INT. - THE KIEV DINER- DAY Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lily next to him, all crammed into a booth. MILES Am I the only one who feels like we can't make a move with this guy on us? LILY We should ditch him. JAKE Just watch every thing you say around him. Every word, every move... It all goes back to the King Pin. Lupus exits the restroom, heading back towards the booth. GORDO How's the hoop, superstar?   Clean? LUPUS What is it with you and bathrooms? MILES He doesn't like using a bathroom unless he knows it's clean. LILY Manly. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: LILY You guys are freaking me out. KING PIN Shut up. Feel that? That's solid muscle. Not an ounce of fat. Go ahead. Punch it. JAKE I am not going-- The King starts to get that look again. Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach.           He shakes his fist in pain. KING PIN Come on.    Harder. JAKE I think I just broke my hand. KING PIN Harder.    Remember, I killed your buddy. Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King as hard as he can. The King just smiles. KING PIN (cont'd) All muscle. The King then hits Jake back in the gut with surprising speed. Jake falls to his knees, but the King's right there. With one arm he pulls Jake up and starts to pummel him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness. Jake spits up blood as the King hurls him face first into the ring. KING PIN Maybe it's true. Maybe you can't cheat an honest man. Me? I'm about as dishonest as they come and that's the truth. But if you even think about trying to con me they'll find fucking pieces of you in each of the five boroughs. Pieces of you, pieces of her, pieces of your whole crew. Can't be any mare honest than that. I'll stake you, but that's three hundred fifty you're in the hole and consider the juice running. Now go make me proud. Harlin and Lupus lift Jake up.        Lily looks at Jake with a pained expression. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE You get all that? Everyone in the gym goes back to their workouts. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY (PRESENT) Butch lets out an easy laugh. BUTCH Nice. JAKE We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank. CUT TO: EXT. - CITY BANK OF NEW YORK DAY A flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day. Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building. Miles reads off a piece of paper. JAKE (V.O.) What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit. MILES Michelle Strigo. Loan officer. Miles points out a woman crisply dressed in a suit, MICHELLE STRIGO. They follow her down the street. JAKE (V.O.) Guy like me, with people like that... I'll tell you what you're looking for without even meeting you. It's like a personal ad you wear over your head. Jake watches as she hails a cab. A MAN, also hailing a cab goes for the same one.

But before she delivers the final blow, Harlin steps on the egg, causing his leg to shoot out from under him. He lands flat on his back, out cold. The wood floor CREAKS with his weight.

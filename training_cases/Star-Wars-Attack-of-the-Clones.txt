EXT. SPACE A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity. 
There is unrest in the Galactic Senate Several hundred solar systems under the leadership of the rebel leader, Count Dooku, have decalred their intentions to secede from the Republic. 
This separatist movement has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Kights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. 
Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to Coruscant to vote on the critical issue of creating an army to assist the overwhelmed Jedi. 
PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters. 
EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet. 
EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform. 
A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden. 
One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT. 
CAPTAIN TYPHO We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all. 
The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation. 
The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed. 
Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA. 
PADMÉ Cordé... 
She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her. 
CORDÉ ... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 
CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her. 
AMIDALA No!... No!... No!... 
PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes. 
AMIDALA I should not have come back. 
CAPTAIN TYPHO M'Lady, you are still in danger. 
Amidala says nothing. 
CAPTAIN TYPHO This vote is very important. You did your duty and Cordé did hers. Now come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady, please! 
She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them. 
EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off. 
INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter. 
MAS AMEDDA Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time. 
Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium. 
PALPATINE ...My esteemed colleagues, excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... Has been assassinated! 
There is a shock silence in the vast arena. 
PALPATINE (continued) This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend. 
There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena. 
SENATOR ASK AAK How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it. 
A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM. 
AMBASSADOR DARSANA Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe, under their protection. 
Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod. 
MACE WINDU Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator? 
YODA Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force. 
MACE WINDU The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing. 
YODA And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see. 
MACE WINDU It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this? 
YODA ...Out there, they are. A certainty that is. 
MACE WINDU Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force? 
YODA Only if he chooses to follow his destiny. 
There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard. 
INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off. 
INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt. 
The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters. 
OBI-WAN Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here? 
ANAKIN Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her. 
OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed. 
OBI-WAN What's going on? 
ANAKIN shrugs. 
ANAKIN She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her. 
OBI-WAN What is she thinking? 
ANAKIN She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder. 
OBI-WAN It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator. 
ANAKIN I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master? 
OBI-WAN You're using her as bait?? 
ANAKIN It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. 
OBI-WAN It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice. 
ANAKIN And yours are? 
OBI-WAN Possibly. 
INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window. 
ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME. 
INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment. 
OBI-WAN You look tired. 
ANAKIN I don't sleep well, anymore. 
OBI-WAN Because of your mother? 
ANAKIN I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little. 
OBI-WAN Dreams pass in time. 
ANAKIN I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating. 
OBI-WAN (continuing) You know I don't like it when you do that! 
ANAKIN Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now! 
ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN. 
OBI-WAN What are you doing? He's gonna blast me! 
ANAKIN Right - this isn't working. 
ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops. 
OBI-WAN That was too close! 
ANAKIN Clear that! 
OBI-WAN What?? 
ANAKIN Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry! 
OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power. 
OBI-WAN Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't  like it when you do that! 
ANAKIN So sorry, Master. 
They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery. 
OBI-WAN It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there! 
Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass. 
OBI-WAN (continuing) Yiiii, what are you doing? 
ANAKIN Sorry, Master! 
OBI-WAN (sarcastically) Oh, that was good... 
ANAKIN That was crazy!!! 
ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches. 
ANAKIN (continuing) Ahh, damn. 
OBI-WAN Stop!! 
ANAKIN No, we can make it. 
ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder. 
OBI-WAN I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy. 
ANAKIN But it worked... we made it. 
OBI-WAN (angrily) It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed! 
ANAKIN I think we're still alive. 
ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life. 
OBI-WAN (very angrily) It was stupid! 
ANAKIN (sheepishly) I could have made it... 
OBI-WAN (furious) But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him. 
Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off. 
ANAKIN No we didnt... 
Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right 
ANAKIN I try, Master. 
INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them 
OBI-WAN Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?! 
ANAKIN Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain. 
OBI-WAN Then why don't you listen to me?! 
ANAKIN I will. I'll do better, I promise. 
OBI-WAN Do you see him him? 
ANAKIN I think he's a she... 
OBI-WAN Then be extra careful... (nods to a room) Check it out. 
OBI-WAN goes away. 
ANAKIN Where are you going, Master? 
OBI-WAN To get a drink. 
OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN. 
CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass. 
ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO Wanna buy some death sticks? 
OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly. 
OBI-WAN You don't want to sell me death- sticks. 
ELAN I don't want to sell you death- sticks. 
OBI-WAN moves his fingers. 
OBI-WAN You want to go home and rethink your life. 
ELAN I want to go home and rethink my life. 
He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back. 
CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar. 
ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back. 
The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads. 
The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing. 
ANAKIN Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks. 
Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out. 
EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods. 
OBI-WAN Do you know who it was you were trying to kill? 
ZAM WESSEL The Senator from Naboo. 
OBI-WAN Who hired you? 
ZAM glares at OBI-WAN. 
ZAM WESSEL It was just a job. 
ANAKIN Tell us! 
ZAM WESSEL That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake I did... 
PADMÉ I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way. 
ANAKIN I'm not whining! I'm not. 
PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background. 
PADMÉ I didn't say it to hurt you. 
ANAKIN I know... 
There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN. 
PADME Anakin... 
They look into each other's eyes for the first time. 
PADMÉ (continuing) Don't try to grow up too fast. 
ANAKIN I am grown up. You said it yourself. 
ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes. 
PADMÉ Please don't look at me like that. 
ANAKIN Why not? 
PADMÉ Because I can see what you're thinking. 
ANAKIN (laughing) Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too? 
DORME is watching with concern. 
PADMÉ It makes me feel uncomfortable. 
ANAKIN Sorry, M'lady. 
ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing. 
EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang. 
INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala. 
CAPTAIN TYPHO Be safe, m'lady. 
PADMÉ Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now. 
DORME He'll be safe with me. 
They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep. 
PADMÉ You'll be fine. 
DORME It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you? 
PADMÉ (looks to Anakin) Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is. 
DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside. 
OBI-WAN Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council. 
ANAKIN Yes, Master. 
OBI-WAN (to Padme) I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time. 
PADMÉ I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi. 
ANAKIN Time to go. 
PADMÉ I know. 
PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them. 
PADMÉ We went into lightspeed a while ago. 
ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes. 
ANAKIN I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen... 
PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. 
PADMÉ You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception. 
ANAKIN I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception. 
PADMÉ It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like... 
ANAKIN Or be with the people I love. 
PADMÉ Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi. 
ANAKIN Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love. 
PADMÉ You have changed so much 
ANAKIN You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either. 
PADMÉ It hasn't... 
ANAKIN I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see. 
ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this. 
ANAKIN (continuing) I love Naboo. 
There is an awkward moment. 
PADMÉ (changing the subject) Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you? 
ANAKIN Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her. 
PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look. 
EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through. 
OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside. 
INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in. 
HERMIONE Can I help ya? 
OBI-WAN I'm looking for Dexter. 
HERMIONE'S eyes narrow. 
HERMIONE BAGWA Waddya want him for? 
OBI-WAN He's not in trouble. It's personal. 
HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter. 
HERMIONE BAGWA Someone to see ya, honey (lowering her voice) A Jedi, by the looks of him. 
Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through. 
DEXTER JETTSTER Obi-Wan! 
OBI-WAN Hey, Dex. 
DEXTER JETTSTER Take a seat! Be right with ya! 
OBI-WAN sits in a booth. 
HERMIONE BAGWA You want a cup of ardees? 
PADMÉ I think so too. 
ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow. 
INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors. 
QUEEN JAMILLIA We've been worried about you. (takes her hand) I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé. 
PADMÉ Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote. 
SIO BIBBLE Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made. 
QUEEN JAMILLIA How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists? 
PADMÉ About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war. 
SIO BIBBLE It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic! 
QUEEN JAMILLIA Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic? 
PADMÉ Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help. 
QUEEN JAMILLIA The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them? 
PADMÉ I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds. 
SIO BIBBLE It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything? 
QUEEN JAMILLIA Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction. 
PADMÉ There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered. 
ANAKIN The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told. 
QUEEN JAMILLIA We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it. 
PADMÉ Let's pray that day never comes. 
QUEEN JAMILLIA In the meantime, we must consider your own safety. 
SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room. 
SIO BIBBLE (to Anakin) What is your suggestion, Master Jedi? 
PADMÉ Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking... 
ANAKIN (nettled) Hey, hold on a minute! 
PADMÉ Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. 
ANAKIN Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady. 
SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here. 
PADMÉ Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance. 
ANAKIN (takes a deep breath) Sorry, M'Lady. 
SIO BIBBLE (to Anakin, amused) She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. 
QUEEN JAMILLIA Perfect. It's settled then. 
ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave. 
QUEEN JAMILLIA (continued) Padmé, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you. 
PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase. 
EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going. 
INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face. 
PADME (continuing) What? Don't say you're shy! 
ANAKIN (untruthfully) No, but I... 
Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME. 
RYOO & POOJA Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!! 
PADME Ryoo!! Pooja!! 
PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them. 
PADME (continuing) I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja. 
ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then: 
RYOO & POOJA Artoo!!! 
As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO. 
INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food. 
SOLA (over her shoulder) They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine. 
SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room. 
PADME Anakin, this is my sister, Sola. 
SOLA Hello, Anakin. 
ANAKIN Hello. 
SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food. 
JOBAL You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin. 
ANAKIN A little. 
PADME He's being polite, Mom. We're starving. 
RUWEE (grinning) You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son. 
EVERYONE sits and starts passing food. 
JOBAL (to Padme) Honey, it's so good to see you safe. We were so worried. 
PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches. 
RUWEE Dear... 
JOBAL I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it's done. 
SOLA Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home? 
PADME (rolls her eyes) Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me. 
JOVAL A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious! 
PADME It's not, Mom, I promise. (glances at Jobal) Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis? 
They nod. 
PADME (continuing) He grew up. 
JOBAL Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have! 
PADME Mom, I'm not in any danger. 
RUWEE (to Anakin) Is she? 
ANAKIN ...Yes... I'm afraid she is. 
INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area. 
INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them. 
YODA Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. (he sees Obi-Wan) Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him. 
The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers. 
YODA (continuing) Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan. 
CHILDREN Welcome, Master Obi-Wan! 
OBI-WAN I am sorry to disturb you, Master. 
YODA What help to you, can I be? 
OBI-WAN Im looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesnt show up on the archive maps. 
YODA An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try... 
The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display. 
OBI-WAN This is where it ought to be... but it isnt. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isnt. 
YODA Most interesting. Gravitys silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be? 
There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods. 
JEDI CHILD JACK Because someone erased it from the archive memory. 
CHILDREN Thats right! Yes! Thats what happened! Someone erased it! 
JEDI CHILD MAY If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away. 
OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles. 
YODA Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. 
OBI-WAN But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? Thats impossible, isnt it? 
YODA (frowning) Much harder to answer, that question is. 
EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake. 
EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge. 
ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently. 
PADMÉ When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. 
ANAKIN I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet. 
PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her. 
PADMÉ ...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing. 
ANAKIN I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everythings soft... and smooth... 
He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous. 
PADMÉ There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical. 
ANAKIN (looks into her eyes) Everything here is magical. 
PADMÉ You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasnt. 
ANAKIN Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway... 
They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin. 
PADMÉ I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself. 
She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause. 
ANAKIN May I tell you something? 
PADME I don't know. 
ANAKIN Then how can I tell you? 
PADME Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition. 
ANAKIN It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you. 
PADME Anakin, don't... 
ANAKIN From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... 
Silence. The logs flame in the hearth. 
ANAKIN (continuing) If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me. 
PADME ...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible. 
ANAKIN Anything's possible. Padme, please listen... 
PADME You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other. 
ANAKIN Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that. 
PADME Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me. 
ANAKIN I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't. 
PADME I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love. 
There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking. 
ANAKIN It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret. 
PADME Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that? 
Silence for a moment. 
ANAKIN ...No, you're right. It would destroy us. 
EXT. SPACE It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet. 
EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world. 
The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face. 
TAUN WE Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi. 
OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes. 
TAUN WE Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you. 
OBI-WAN (warily) I'm expected? 
TAUN WE Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way! 
OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor. 
Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light. 
TAUN WE May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi... 
OBI-WAN Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
ANAKIN Well, if it works... 
PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile. 
PADMÉ You're making fun of me. 
ANAKIN (sarcastic) On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator. 
PADMÉ You're so bad! 
PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them. 
ANAKIN You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders. 
ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh. 
ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK. 
The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away. 
ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away. 
EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred. 
LAMA SU (beaming) Magnificent, aren't they? 
OBI-WAN nods slowly. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating. 
LAMA SU We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. 
OBI-WAM Who was the original host? 
LAMA SU A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself. 
OBI-WAN Where is this bounty hunter now? 
LAMA SU Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep. 
LAMA SU Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it? 
OBI-WAN Unaltered? 
LAMA SU Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration... 
OBI-WAN I would like to meet this Jango Fett. 
TAUN WE I would be most happy to arrange it, for you. 
TAUN WE bows, and leaves. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES. 
OBI-WAN You mentioned growth acceleration... 
LAMA SU Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature... 
OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES. 
OBI-WAN And these? 
LAMA SU About five years ago. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended. 
LAMA SU They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action. 
OBI-WAN Very impressive. 
ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her. 
ANAKIN I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! (getting up) I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice. 
PADME Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate. 
ANAKIN What about Master Obi-wan? 
PADME smiles and takes his hand. 
PADME I guess we won't tell him, will we? 
EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts. 
PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off. 
EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS. 
As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom. 
TAUN WE Boba, is your father here? 
There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods. 
TAUN WE (continuing) May we see him? 
BOBA FETT Sure. 
Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through. 
INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room. 
BOBA FETT Dad! Taun We's here! 
JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion. 
TAUN WE Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive? 
JANGO FETT Fairly. 
OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them. 
TAUN WE This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress. 
JANGO FETT That right? 
JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly. 
OBI-WAN Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. 
JANGO FETT I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi. 
OBI-WAN Aren't we all? 
OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view. 
OBI-WAN (continuing) Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant? 
JANGO Once or twice. 
OBI-WAN Recently? 
JANGO (eyes Obi-Wan carefully) Possibly... 
OBI-WAN Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas? 
JANGO Boba, close the door. 
BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN. 
ANAKIN To find my mother. 
PADME No, Annie! 
CLIEGG She's daed, son. Accept it. 
ANAKIN I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive. 
ANAKIN turns abruptly. 
EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME. 
ANAKIN You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe. 
OWEN Take my speeder bike. 
PADME Anakin... 
PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by. 
ANAKIN I trust you'll watch over her, Owen. 
OWEN Don't worry. 
ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires. 
ANAKIN I won't be long. 
ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go. 
EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it. 
INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT. 
JANGO FETT Nearly there, son. 
JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly: 
BOBA FETT Dad, look!! 
On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN. 
JANGO FETT Hang on! 
The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT. 
EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through. 
Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids. 
In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by. 
BOBA FETT Dad! Watch out! 
JANGO FETT Stay calm, son. We'll be fine. That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this. 
But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them. 
IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid. 
IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid. 
BOBA FETT Got him! Yeahhhhh! 
JANGO FETT We won't see him again. 
BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis. 
EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed. 
EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance. 
EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it. 
EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall. 
INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere. 
A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut. 
He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly. 
ANAKIN Mom... Mom... Mom... 
SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood. 
SHMI Annie...? Is it you? 
SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp. 
ANAKIN Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang on. Im going to get you out of here... 
SHMI Im so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete... 
ANAKIN Just stay with me, Mom. Im going to make you well again. Everythings going to be fine. 
SHMI You look so handsome. My son... my grown-up son. Im so proud of you, Annie... so proud... I missed you so much... I love... 
SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms. 
EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly. 
OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below. 
SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships. 
EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground. 
As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakins lightsaber switches on. 
EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink. 
OBI-WAN "Guiding light" to "old folks home." 
EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building. 
INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern. 
OBI-WAN ...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis. 
BAIL ORGANA That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?! 
OBI-WAN The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation. 
PALPATINE Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions. 
OBI-WAN One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be? 
YODA With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be. 
MACE WINDU Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last. 
OBI-WAN Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army? 
YODA Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are. 
MACE WINDU Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help? 
OBI-WAN Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first. 
The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief. 
BAIL ORGANA The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.

PAGE 88 
INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image. 
OBI-WAN ...Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don't... make it... aaaggghhh! 
The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated. 
ANAKIN I'm going after him! 
PADME I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant. 
ANAKIN Yeah, you're right, you're right. 
EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert. 
INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU. 
MACE WINDU We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority. 
ANAKIN Understood, Master. 
The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel. 
PADME They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away. 
PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him. 
ANAKIN If he's still alive. 
PADME Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor... 
ANAKIN ...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here. 
PADME He gave you strict orders to protect me... 
PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire. 
PADME (continuing) ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along. 
ANAKIN grins and takes the controls. 
EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away. 
EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order. 
INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea. 
MACE WINDU The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now. 
All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval. 
YODA Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let's hope they are. 
INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell furiously at one another. 
MAS AMEDDA Order! Order!! 
Finally, the uproar dies. 
PALPATINE In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognises Senior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks. 
Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat. 
JAR JAR Senators, dellow felagates... 
The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously. 
COUNT DOOKU Senator Amidala, I've heard so much about you. 
PADMÉ Count Dooku, I assume. 
COUNT DOOKU I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control. 
PADMÉ Don't worry he's housebroken. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him. 
PADMÉ You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now. 
DOOKU He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe. 
COUNT DOOKU smiles. 
PADMÉ He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that. 
DOOKU We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency. 
ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on. 
PADMÉ And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die? 
DOOKU I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest, Senator. 
PADMÉ The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing. 
DOOKU You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent. 
PADMÉ If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right. 
DOOKU The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom. 
PADMÉ I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government! 
DOOKU Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution. 
PADMÉ What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also? 
DOOKU I wouldn't think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I'm afraid. It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you. 
JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN. 
JANGO FETT I'll take that weapon. 
ANAKIN hesitates. 
DOOKU You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape. 
PADMÉ Anakin... 
ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT. 
INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict. 
SUN RIT You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage. 
POGGLE Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out? 
PADMÉ You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences. 
POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles. 
POGGLE We build weapons, Senator... that is our business! Of course we're prepared! 
NUTE GUNRAY Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer. 
POGGLE Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the arena! 
ANAKIN (continuing; to pilot) Put the ship down! Down! 
OBI-WAN No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku. 
ANAKIN No we're not!! Land this ship! 
OBI-WAN Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do. 
Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU. 
ANAKIN I don't care!.. Go back. 
OBI-WAN Anakin! She's all right! Look. 
ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS. 
OBI-WAN (continuing) Follow that speeder! 
On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows. 
Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower. 
INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open. 
DROID CAPTAIN Your Excellency! 
COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons. 
COUNT DOOKU That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me. 
The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement. 
OBI-WAN (to Anakin) We move in together - you slowly on the... 
ANAKIN I'm taking him now! 
OBI-WAN Anakin, no! 
ANAKIN You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku. 
ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN 
COUNT DOOKU Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down. 
OBI-WAN I don't think so. 
OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles. 
COUNT DOOKU Ah, but if I must. 
COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other. 
COUNT DOOKU (continuing) I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power. 
OBI-WAN You will have to prove it. 
OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style. 
COUNT DOOKU Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. 
COUNT DOOKU parried another cut. 
COUNT DOOKU (continuing) Surely you can do better...? (parries) No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? (cuts) Which is it? 
COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath. 
COUNT DOOKU (continuing) come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. 
OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat. 
COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

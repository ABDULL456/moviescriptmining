MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her husband and children and expertly begins to serve breakfast. 
DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by trade, divides the morning paper up between himself and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly overweight college student, frantically prices the junk she plans on selling at the flea market after classes while gulping down a light breakfast. 
MOM Who wants fruit salad? 
MISTY I do, please. 
MOM (Hesitating) That's not gum in your mouth, is it? 
MISTY (Removing it) It's sugarless. 
MOM (Gently) You know how I hate gum, Misty.  All that chomping and cheesing... (Begins serving her) 
MISTY Sorry, Mom.  Thanks. (To her brother, as she prices a record album) Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice. 
CHIP I wouldn't give ya a nickle. 
MISTY (Dreamily) Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets. 
MOM (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly) And who may I ask is Carl? 
MISTY Just a boy.  He's picking me up this morning. 
CHIP Here we go again. 
MISTY He's really cute! 
MOM (Watching the cute little birds nibbling seed from the bird-feeder in kitchen window) Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that. 
CHIP She sure can pick 'em! 
MISTY (Exasperated) He goes to college with me! 
DAD Leave her alone, Chip. (To MOM) I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly. 
MOM smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each hand and turns to the family. 
MOM Cereal anybody? 
Title "SERIAL MOM" appears on the screen. 
DAD Just a little, please.  Bad for the teeth. 
CHIP Always the dentist. 
CHIP (Seeing MISTY flirting) Jeeezzz! 
MOM Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. (Hands him a paper napkin) 
DET. BRADFORD (Spitting his gum into paper napkin) Sorry, ma'am. (To MOM and DAD, taking out an envelope) We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle. 
MOM I know Dottie! 
DAD She lives right down the street. 
DET. BRADFORD Could you take a look at this... 
DET. MOORE ...And tell us of anybody who might be responsible? 
DET. BRADFORD (As he hands note to MOM and DAD) I should warn you...this note contains LANGUAGE. 
MOM and DAD open note.  In cut-out letters from a magazine it reads:  "I'LL GET YOU PUSSY FACE!" 
MOM (Recoiling) Oh God, really! (Hands it back to cop) This is the limit! 
CHIP Let me see! 
DAD Sorry, son. (In disgust) This is a matter for adults. 
MOM Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down! 
DAD No woman would! 
MOM (Seeing cute little bird land on window feeder) Look officers!  Life doesn't have to be ugly. (In baby-talk) See the little birdie?  Listen to his call. (Imitating bird call) Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan! 
CHIP and MISTY roll their eyes in embarrassment as bird calls back to MOM. 
BIRD Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan! 
DAD smiles proudly as detectives look at MOM in amazement.

BIRDIE (Leaping out of convertible) Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin. 
DAD (To cops, getting into his car) That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut just like my son. 
MOM (Fondly) Good morning, Birdie.  This is Detectives Moore and Bradford. 
BIRDIE (Overdramatic, feigning horror) I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector! (Kisses CHIP) (Good-naturedly to COPS) Hi ya, boys! 
MOM (Sarcastically to a sullen SCOTTY in car) Good morning Scotty! 
SCOTTY guiltily looks up from vintage Betty Page pin-up mag he's reading and toots horn defiantly in response as MOM grits her teeth. 
BIRDIE Hey Misty, look what I got! (Pulling it out of bag) A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you sell it for me at the flea market? 
MOM (Disguising her voice in prim manner) I beg your pardon? 
DOTTIE (Horrified but suspicious) Who is this? 
MOM Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company.  I understand you're having problems with obscene calls. 
DOTTIE (Mortified) Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson.. It's driving me crazy...I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!

MRS. ACKERMAN Beverly, are you alright? 
MOM Rosemary, honey.  Good morning. I'm fine. (Taking the sewing basket) Thanks for remembering. 
MRS. ACKERMAN It's the least I could do. (Suspicious) I heard shouting. 
MOM opens sewing box to reveal a pair of gleaming sewing scissors. 
MOM (Slamming it shut) Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle? 
MRS. ACKERMAN Yes, I did.  It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.

SCOTTY comes back in room feeling better. 
SCOTTY Man, that one made me puke! 
MOM (Picking up SCOTTY's nudist camp magazine and handing it back to him like it's poison) You forgot something... 
SCOTTY (Looking around confused) Are we leaving? 
MOM Yes you are. 
SCOTTY guiltily takes back magazine as BIRDIE drags him out. 
BIRDIE Bye, Mrs, Sutphin. 
CHIP (Affectionately) Bye, bird-brain,  See ya, Scotty. 
MOM Bye, Birdie. (Sitting down next to CHIP on his bed) Chip, honey...I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand.. I'm your mother and I love you.

CHIP Looks good, Mom! 
DAD Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey. 
MOM Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... (Passes it to her) 
MISTY Yummy.  Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer. 
MOM (Appalled) Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know. 
CHIP Carl's a jerk! 
DAD He certainly drives like a jerk. 
MISTY (Getting upset) Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it? 
DAD Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy. 
MOM I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.

MOM (Picking up and leafing through "The Encyclopedia of Birds") I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore. 
We see that underneath the cover of the bird book, MOM is reading "Helter Skelter".  She lightly caresses a picture of Manson and closes the book and turns out her light. 
DAD Goodnight, honey. 
MOM Don't I get a kiss? 
DAD (Moving closer) I just thought with all the sadness...you wouldn't want... 
MOM (Snuggling up) We have to concentrate on life, Eugene. 
DAD (Kissing her) It's fine with me, Beverly. (Kisses her again more passionately) You want to, honey?  You think the kids are asleep? 
MOM We can be real quiet... 
DAD (Getting on top of her) I love that you're my wife. 
MOM (Getting turned on) You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird... 
DAD (Gently making love to her) You bring me such peace...

DET. BRADFORD Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin. 
MISTY (Subtly unbuttoning her blouse one button) Hi, Detective Moore. 
DET. MOORE (Embarrassed) Morning, Misty. (All business) Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard of the death of Mr. Stubbins. 
MOM A fine man.  A good teacher... 
DET. BRADFORD (Reading from notes) Contrusions...fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs... 
MOM (In sympathy) What a mess. 
MOM sees SCOTTY pull up in driveway with BIRDIE in his convertible. 
MOM (Seeing MISTY's eyes light up at hearing a car) No, honey, it's just Scotty. (To COPS) Scotty, who doesn't wear his seatbelts! 
DAD and CHIP enter kitchen as BIRDIE and SCOTTY barge in back door. 
DAD Good morning, Detectives. 
BIRDIE (Dramatically) Nightmare on Calverton Court! 
SCOTTY The Maryland Teacher Massacre! 
DET. MOORE That's not funny, son. 
DET. BRADFORD Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin? 
MOM (Buttering toast) Yes, I did. 
DAD (To cops, getting angry) Detectives, what is this about? 
DET. MOORE I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils. 
DAD Surely you don't think Beverly was involved! 
SCOTTY (Hamming it up, pointing to MOM) SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down! 
MOM (Quickly staring daggers at SCOTTY before patiently addressing COPS) From what I understand, the eye-witness is a drug user. 
MISTY I got somebody you could run over, Mother! 
DAD Misty, that's a terrible thing to say! (Putting his arm protectively around MOM) Detectives, it's time for you to leave.  My wife knows nothing about this terrible ...accident. 
MOM (Correcting him) Murder, honey. 
SCOTTY (Picking up a "People" magazine with Ivana Trump on the cover) Now, here's a babe! 
COPS see magazine cover with the "P" in "People" cut out as in threatening note sent to Mrs. Ackerman. 
DET. MOORE (Suspiciously) Let's see that, young man. 
MISTY (Whispering to BIRDIE as she ogles him from behind) Nice buns! 
DET. BRADFORD "P" as in... 
MOM (Glaring at SCOTTY) ...People who don't mind their own business. 
DAD looks at MOM suddenly, for the first time showing slight suspicion. 
MOM (To DAD) It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine, honey. (To COPS) Look at the subscription label if you don't believe me. (Proudly) I recycle my magazines.

MRS. ACKERMAN (Looking up) Oh, it's just Beverly. 
DOTTIE She scared me. 
MRS. ACKERMAN (Going to door) Come in, Beverly.  Have some coffee 
MOM (Entering, back to normal, being so-o-o-o nice) Just a half-a-cup. (To DOTTIE) Hello, Dottie.  I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles... 
DOTTIE It's not fair!! 
MOM (To MRS. ACKERMAN, noticing her flower arrangement) Are those pussy-willows? 
MRS. ACKERMAN (Fixing the coffee) Dried ones.  Aren't they pretty? 
DOTTIE freezes in horror when she recognizes the P-word in MOM's voice. 
DOTTIE (Alarmed) What did you just say? 
MOM (Evily baiting DOTTIE under her breath) PUSSY-willows, Dottie! 
MOM purposely knocks MRS. ACKERMAN's Franklin Mint Faberge Egg off table and sends it crashing to the floor. 
MOM Dottie!  Watch what you're doing! 
DOTTIE (Horrified to see MOM is blaming her) I didn't do it! 
ROSEMARY (Crying out, rushing to pick up pieces) My Franklin Mint Faberge Egg! 
MOM (Helping MRS. ACKERMAN) Dottie didn't mean to be a clumsy ox.  She's sorry, Aren't you, Dottie? 
DOTTIE (Pleading) Rosemary, I didn't break your egg - she did! 
MRS. ACKERMAN You could at least apologize, Dottie.  I collect Franklin Mint! 
MOM And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up. (Evily) I'll take care of poor Rosemary! 
DOTTIE (Stammering in fear to MRS. ACKERMAN) But...but...she...Rosemary, I heard her voice!  It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER! 
46.    INTERIOR DAD'S DENTAL EXAMINATION ROOM. 
DAD attempts to do dental work on RALPH STERNER, the "emergency" patient who lets out a blood curdling scream every time DAD gets the drill anywhere near his mouth.

MR. STERNER (Whimpering) Alright...go ahead...but be careful, it really hurts! (Opens mouth)

Suddenly MOM runs from her booth with fire poker drawn and skewers CARL in the back at the urinal. 
CARL screams in horror as MOM pulls out fire poker with his liver skewered on the end. 
CARL collapses to his knees, his head landing in urinal. 
MOM looks horrified at the liver and tries to shake it off poker, panicked that someone will come into men's room. 
Closing her eyes in revulsion, she pulls off liver with her fingertips and throws it on floor.

MISTY (Seeing cop cars and ambulance enter flea market as customers start running towards concession stand) Watch the booth!  I'll be back! (Runs off to join the crowd) 
MRS. ACKERMAN (Spotting a small hunk of gore stuck to bottom of MOM's shoe) Beverly, honey, you've got some... (Wrinkles up her nose) ...do-do on your shoe.

MRS. ACKERMAN notices stain with odd unease. 
MISTY No!  Stop it!  It's not funny. Mom might do it! (Sobbing) Someone else might die.

DOTTIE "Are those..." (Giving up) I can't say the word out loud. 
DET. BRADFORD (Trying to comfort her) Could you tell a policewoman the exact words she used? 
DOTTIE (Being pitiful) Maybe... 
A huge galute of a POLICEWOMAN sits next to DOTTIE and pats her hand. 
POLICEWOMAN It's ok...nobody's gonna hurt you. (Whispering) Come on, let it out...

Reverse angle shows not Scotty, but the dental emergency couple, THE STERNERS, as they sit in their dining room eating a dinner of cornish game hens. 
MOM zeros in on the game hens and flashes back to "Dede" and the other cute birds in her bird-feeder at home. 
As the couple viciously slice apart the game hens and stuff the meat in their mouths, MOM breaks a small pane of glass in back door to gain entry. 
MRS. STERNER What was that? 
MR. STERNER I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert? 
MRS. STERNER Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.

MOM is rocking air conditioner in window back and forth until she gets it loose.  Seeing him right below, MOM shoves it out window with all her might. 
96.    STERNER LAWN. 
MR. STERNER looks up at air conditioner falling from above and screams the second before he is crushed like an insect. 
97.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM. 
SCOTTY is moaning in orgasm as he watches ludicrous Chesty Morgan "Secret Agent" breast footage on video screen.

99.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM. 
SCOTTY stares in complete mortification as the Sutphin family catch him in the middle of an orgasm. 
When DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and their ridiculously overprepared SWAT TEAM flood the bedroom, screaming "FREEZE" and "HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD", SCOTTY fumes in anger as MISTY and CHIP giggle in relief and DAD turns red in embarrassment. 
100.   Wipe to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE. 
DAD's car pulls up and the relieved Sutphin family hops out and runs to house.  Subtitle appears "9:02pm" and fades out. 
DAD Home Sweet Home!  Everything's fine, kids! 
MISTY (Laughing) I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess! 
CHIP I'm disappointed she isn't! (In wonder) For a while there, it was like being in a movie! 
101.   SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

103.   EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE. 
MOM, DAD, CHIP and MISTY walk out front door dressed in their Sunday finest.  Suddenly their wholesome smiles freeze on their faces. 
Cop cars are everywhere watching MOM's every move. DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD smile hatefully at MOM, pressuring her with their high-visibility surveillance. 
The family nervously gets in their car and DAD turns the ignition. 
Cop after cop after cop start up their engines. 
As DAD pulls out of the driveway in his car the cops file into a procession of intimidation behind him. 
104.   INTERIOR DET. MOORE AND DET. BRADFORDS' CAR. 
DET. BRADFORD (Talking into police radio) ...Sutphin family proceeding west on Seminary Avenue.  Beverly ain't goin' nowhere this time. 
105.   INTERIOR SUTPHIN CAR. 
MISTY (Scared) Dad, I thought it was ok. Make them go away.  This is embarrassing. 
DAD Just ignore the police. It's all a terrible mistake. 
FATHER STONE (On altar) Blessed be God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit... 
ALL And blessed be His kingdom, now and forever.  Amen... 
The SUTPHINS take their place in a half filled pew next to appalled young MARRIED COUPLE as a still mortified SCOTTY glares in hatred and vengeance from a pew in the back of the church. 
BIRDIE's face is covered in tears as she sits with her parents helplessly. 
MISTY turns in her seat and searches the hostile crowd for the face of the cute REPORTER.  When she spots him secretly snapping her photo, she subtly gives him a sexy pose. 
110.   EXTERIOR CHURCH. 
DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD wait with other COPS outside their cars as voice comes over police radio. 
CAPTAIN JOHNSON This is Captain Johnson from Homicide.  Lab reports confirm Sutphin latent print of index finger on true-crime book matches those latent prints lifted from murder weapons.  Bingo, boys! Bust the bitch! 
COPS smile in silent victory as they immediately spread out and approach the church. 
111.   INTERIOR CHURCH. 
FATHER STONE is giving the sermon in a kindly tone. 
FATHER STONE ...Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did He?! 
MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE nod in pious agreement. 
FATHER STONE ...If ever there was a time to go on record against the death penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!... 
DAD gulps and lovingly takes MOM's hand as MISTY and CHIP look at one another appalled while MOM continues her defiant smile. 
FATHER STONE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the LAW in the State of Maryland!... 
DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and all the COPS begin infiltrating the church, taking places in pews and then moving forward to other pews closer to MOM. 
SCOTTY beams at police presence and eagerly scoots over to let DET. BRADFORD and DET. MOORE sit with him on their way to nail MOM. 
GUS and SLOPPY, the garbagemen, scowl at the police and look with loyalty to poor MOM. 
FATHER STONE ...SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR, FELLOW CHRISTIANS?!  LET'S JUST DO IT!! 
ALL AMEN! 
FATHER STONE Now, let us pray and humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God. 
As CONGREGATION prays along with FATHER STONE, COPS flood the church and move towards MOM. 
CONGREGATION ...Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against thee... 
CHIP and MISTY ...by what we have done... 
BIRDIE & PARENTS ...and by what we have left undone... 
DAD ...we are truly sorry and we humbly repent... 
MOM (Praying piously, but beginning to sniffle a sneeze) ...so that we may delight in thy will... 
A BABY in the arms of a MOTHER in pew in front of MOM stares back at MOM. 
MOM ...And walk in the ways to the glory... (Starts to sneeze and catches herself) ...of Thy name... 
ALL Amen! 
MOM sneezes and a hunk of phlegm flies out and hits BABY square in face. 
BABY'S MOTHER screams in horror at seeing her BABY's face and the entire congregation1 thinking she's been attacked by MOM, dives to the floor in terror. 
COPS draw guns and leap over pews as complete pandemonium breaks out in church. 
Just as DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD are about to grab MOM, GUS and SLOPPY punch the COPS in the mouth and MOM runs off. 
MRS. JENSON (Scowling at video screen where "Leatherface" chases a girl to house where he "chainsaws" his way through door as the victim screams in terror) Haven't you had enough violence, Chip Sutphin? Turn that filth off! 
CHIP (Turning it off) Sorry, ma'am. 
MRS. JENSON Do you have the musical, "Annie"? 
CHIP (Rolling his eyes and getting the cassette) Sure do.  Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"? 
MRS. JENSON (Rooting in her purse and handing CHIP the casette) There you go.  I love Bill Cosby pictures. 
CHIP (Looking at cassette in frustration) Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them! 
MRS. JENSON (Belligerently) Why? 
CHIP Because it's the rules! 
MRS. JENSON (Defiantly) I don't feel like rewinding it! 
MOM's face turns to stone in closet. 
CHIP (Exasperated) You see the sign!  It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99! 
MRS. JENSON (Slamming money down and grabbing video) Keep the change, you son of a psycho! 
MRS. JENSON stomps to door and slams it behind her as MOM's face twists in rage as she listens. 
BIRDIE What a bitch! 
CHIP It's the influence of all those family films. (Turning to closet) Right, Mom? (No answer) Hey, Mom??... (Still no answer) 
BIRDIE (Nervously) Mrs. Sutphin? 
CHIP Mother? (Opens door to reveal empty closet) 
BIRDIE 0h, shit! 
CHIP You don't think.... 
BIRDIE She wouldn't... 
BIRDIE runs to back of shop and sees opened door to street. 
CHIP (Panicked) What's Mrs. Jenson's address? 
BIRDIE runs to files and starts going through them. 
BIRDIE ...Jenner...Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson.  3511 Clark Avenue! 
CHIP That's right up the street! Come on!  Just in case! 
117.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP. 
CHIP and BIRDIE exit in a panic and run up the street. 
Hidden behind his "borrowed" car across the street is SCOTTY who has been watching them all along.  He takes off on foot after them. 
118.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S KITCHEN. 
A carving knife slices through leg-of-lamb on kitchen table.  Camera pans up to MRS. JENSON's happy face as she fixes herself a leg-of-lamb sandwich and exits to living room. 
119.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM. 
MRS. JENSON kicks off her shoes, excitedly pops videocassette into her VCR and climbs into her recliner for a relaxing afternoon of video pleasures.  She takes a big bite out of her sandwich, twangs the remote to start the video and smiles excitedly at hearing the overture to "Tomorrow" begin over the credit sequence to "Annie", her favorite musical.  Subtitle appears "12:09pm" and fades out.

153.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS. 
On stage, "CAMEL LIPS", an all-female grunge-punk-metal band, dressed in their trademark skin tight slacks that gave the group their name, perform their hit song "Gas Chamber".  The monstrous but beautiful LEAD SINGER bellows and snarls the lyrics as the DRUMMER, a brain dead drug idiot, hits herself on head with drumstick in between beats as criminal looking biker-chick GUITARIST plays her instrument and mock-humps it with sexual abandon. 
The audience of on-the-edge kids goes bezerk, guzzling beer and slam dancing with frightening intensity 
154.   EXTERIOR HAMMERJACKS. 
MOM speeds into parking lot. 
SCOTTY is looking over his shoulder in fear as he nears the entrance waiting in line with grunge-metal kids. 
DOORMAN (To SCOTTY) I.D.? 
SCOTTY (Panicked) Can I give it to you inside? 
DOORMAN Hey, buddy.  NOBODY gets inside without I.D. 
SCOTTY fumbles for his wallet. 
MOM is hurrying across parking lot staring at SCOTTY with a vengeance. 
DAD and the kids speed into parking lot and jump out of car. 
DOORMAN (Looking at Scotty's I.D.) Birthdate? 
SCOTTY (Straining to remember information on his fake I.D.) Uh...December 14th, 1975. (Pleading) Please! 
DOORHAN Ok, go ahead, 
SCOTTY snatches back I.D. and rushes inside. 
As horde of cop cars with lights blinking and sirens blaring screech into parking lot, MOM pushes her way up in line and greets startled kids who recognize her. 
MOM Hi! I know your mom... 
KID A It's her! 
KID B Who? 
MOM Excuse me. (Pushing her way up in line) Age before beauty... 
KID C The murder lady!  The one on TV! 
KID B Cool!  Is she in a band? 
MOM (Butting ahead) Sorry...the police are after me... 
DOORMAN (Recognizing her) Hey, you're Serial Mom! 
MOM (Modestly) I guess I am. 
DOORMAN (Looks up and sees her family and COPS rushing towards her) Come on in lady.  Quick! (Hands her a badge) Here, take this.  A backstage VIP pass. (Proudly) Welcome to Hammerjacks, "Serial Mom"! 
MOM Thank you so much, you kind, kind creature. 
155.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS. 
A parents' nightmare.  Grunge-punk hell.  "CAMEL LIPS" is undulating suggestively on stage screeching out the chorus of "Gas Chamber" as they mock gasp for breath, dodge beer bottles thrown from audience and punch out male groupies who rush the stage past brutish bouncers. 
SCOTTY pushes his way through slam dancing crowd as he is picked up and bodily tossed through the air by frenzied mob of "body-surfing" dancers. 
MOM is racing to catch up with SCOTTY. 
Female criminals are handcuffed and seated around MOM on their way to court as MOM leads them in a joyous and Disney-esoue rendition of "100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall".  MOM sings out with insane happiness and glee. 
158.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM. 
A "COURT TV" reporter is interviewing trial groupies as they wait in line to go through metal detectors to attend MOM's trial. 
COURT TV ...And you, ma'am, how long have you been waiting to get in? 
LADY A (Beaming at the attention) Since 5:00am.  But it's gonna be worth it!  I know she's guilty! 
HUSBAND A (Leaning into the shot) We've been to famous trials all over the country! 
WIFE A (Getting into the act) ..Manson.. .Watergate... (To Lady A) Didn't I see you at Hinkley? 
LADY A (Proudly) I was there!  My husband thought I was crazy but... (Seeing Sutphin family getting off elevator) LOOK!  HERE THEY COME!! That awful family! 
The hostile crowd starts craning their necks and screaming in recognition as if rock stars are making their entrance.  DAD is blinded by the press's flashbulbs as HERBIE HEBDEN tries to stop CHIP from signing autographs as BIRDIE hands out "Stop the Violence" handbills.  REPORTER BOYFRIEND gives MISTY the signal and she starts crying for his exclusive news shots. 
159.   INTERIOR COURTROOM. 
Packed with spectators, press and security officers. The middle-class jury of seven woman and five men take their place in the jury box as Sutphin family take their seats in front row behind HERBIE HEBDEN at his defense table.

MOM (Happily waving to DAD) Hi, honey! 
DAD smiles back pitifully. 
MOM (To CHIP, BIRDIE & MISTY) Kids, did you do your homework? 
They give her a weak smile and nod "Yes". 
JUDGE Quiet in the courtroom! Court is now in session! 
MOM (To JURY) Hello, jury people. My name's Beverly Sutphin. (To startled woman juror) I like your jacket! 
JUDGE (Losing patience) Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET! You are accused of mass murder! This is a court of law, not a coffee klatch! (Bangs gavel) Mr. Nazlerod, your opening statement. 
MR. NAZLEROD Thank you, your honor. (Approaches JURY) Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, my name is Timothy Nazlerod... (Smarmily) ...and I hope we can be friends! (JURY stares back impartially) ...I warn you, this is not a pretty case...Beverly Sutphin is a woman evil to the core... (JURY POV shot of innocent- looking MOM staring back at them) ...a rotten apple, if you will... (DAD gulps in sorrow) ...who beyond a reasonable doubt killed five innocent people!! 
SPECTATORS scowl hatefully at MOM. 
CHIP (Whispering to BIRDIE, making excuses) Well...they sort of deserved it... 
BIRDIE pales over the mere thought of violence. 
DAD (To CHIP) Shhhhh! 
He looks over and sees MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND are holding hands and glares at them to stop. 
MR. NAZLEROD ...THAT'S RIGHT!  SHE MURDERED THEM!...WITH A SPEEDING CAR... A FIRE POKER... 
MOM subtly motions to MALE JUROR that he has something in his nose. 
MR. NAZLEROD ...A PAIR OF SCISSORS... 
JUROR self-consciously feels around his nostrils in embarrassment. 
MR. NAZLEROD ...A TOPPLED AIR CONDITIONER! 
MOM signals to JUROR that the problem is still there. 
MR. NAZLEROD ...THE LETHAL FLAMES FROM AN AEROSOL CAN...EVEN A LEG OF LAMB!! 
JUROR blows his nose.  MOM smiles happily to him that the problem is solved. 
MR. NAZLEROD ...Beverly Sutphin is not a woman!... 
MISTY and REPORTER are watching and move even closer together to snuggle. 
MR. NAZLEROD Did you recognize the voice of the caller? 
DOTTIE Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together. 
MR. NAZLEROD Who's voice was it, Dottie? 
DOTTIE (Pointing to MOM) It was her!  Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there! (Dramatically to JURY) I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!! 
Wipe to MOM approaching DOTTIE HINKLE for cross-examination. 
MOM Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink? 
DOTTIE (Haughtily) No, I don't. 
MOM So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls? 
DOTTIE I certainly was not! 
MOM You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's...the day you claim you recognized my voice...you weren't drinking? 
DOTTIE (Flustered) One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking". 
MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE smile at MOM's legal skills. 
MOM So you do drink? 
DOTTIE Socially...I'll have a beer. 
MOM So you admit you just lied? 
MR. NAZLEROD Objection!  Argumentative! 
DOTTIE (Rising to the bait) NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH! 
JUDGE Sustained. (To DOTTIE) Watch your mouth, Mrs. Hinkle. 
Press scribbles frantically, beginning to doubt witness's credibility. 
MOM quickly and sneakily mouths "FUCK YOU" to DOTTIE without the JUDGE or anyone else in the courtroom besides DOTTIE seeing. 
DOTTIE (Shocked, to JUDGE) Did you see her?!  She just said "Fuck you" to me! 
MOM (Innocently, to JUDGE) Let the record show I'm just standing here. 
DOTTIE FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE! 
JUDGE I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle. One more obscenity and I'll charge you with contempt of court. 
DAD watches, amazed at his wife's cunning. 
MOM (Dramatically) Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane? 
DOTTIE NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER! 
Police matrons lunge at DOTTIE as she leaps from witness box to attack MOM. 
JUDGE (Bangs gavel) Mrs. Hinkle, I find you guilty of contempt of court and sentence you to a thousand dollar fine and five days in jail! (To MATRONS) Lock 'er up! 
DOTTIE (To MOM, being dragged out) YOU COCK-SUCKER!  YOU LOUSY PIG-FUCKER! 
MOM smiles at JURY and turns to wink at her amazed family as spectators watch, willing to give MOM, for the first time, the benefit of the doubt.

CHIP (On phone) ...Well, you tell "Geraldo" to go to hell!  I don't care what Jeffrey MacDonald's people got - he's old news!  We fly first class or we don't do the show! 
MOM suddenly realizes MARVIN is looking up her skirt.  In a brilliant legal maneuver she begins inching her skirt up a little higher under the table out of view of the rest of the courtroom, giving MARVIN a better view and hoping to change his damning testimony. 
MARVIN (Eyes popping out of head) There was nobody next to me: 
Housewife trial groupies start buzzing wildly in newfound support of MOM. 
MR. NAZLEROD (Losing it) Mr. Pickles, you testified before the Grand Jury that you looked down and "saw a pair of lady's shoes" in the stall next to you. 
MOM smiles like the perfect saint as she begins flapping her leqe back and forth under the table, flashing MARVIN her very prim nun-like undergarments out of view of the rest of the courtroom. 
MARVIN (Lost in his own perverted glory) Ohhhh!  I just said what you told me to! 
DAD looks over at MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND who have rejoined the family in court and is horrified to see them with their arms wrapped around each other, cuddling. 
MR. NAZLEROD PERJURY IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE, MR. PICKLES!! 
MOM is flapping her legs back and forth double time as MARVIN goes into his own private orgasm. 
MARVZN Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life! 
MR. NAZLEROD (Absolutely furious) You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles! (Returning to seat) I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!! (Sitting down) The prosecution rests, your honor. 
MOM (Giving MARVIN her version of a sexy smile as he leaves stand) The prosecution has proven nothing, your honor. (To the JURY) The defense also rests! 
The spectators burst into spontaneous applause as DAD looks at the kids in fear at the upcoming verdict. 
168.   Wipe to HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

170.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

MOM (Addressing the jury with calm believability) Look at me!  I'm a normal person just like you are! 
DAD wipes away a tear as CHIP looks at a preliminary design for mini-series showing FARRAH FAWCETT done up as MOM. 
MOM ...But I've been framed by the police... 
MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND are now openly making out in courtroom. 
MOM ...and perjured against by the very people I thought were my friends...

PRODUCTION DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
Abrupt CLOSE UP on MAX, a plain wall behind him. 
1 INT. LIMBO RADIO 1 
He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish, or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment of un-self-consciousness. 
MAX There's an old joke. It comes from "The Iliad," but I think it was popularized by Oscar Wilde. It goes like this: ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the woods one day. And he sees this rabbit, also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm, cuz he's been eating Mexican. The wiping's taking forever, and his shit keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The rabbit says no, shit just slides right off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up and wipes his ass with him. (pause, as if for applause) Well, I never said it was a good joke. And see, that makes it perfect, because it's pretty much the story of my life. 
We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t- shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks. 
MAX (CONT'D) Growing up, my parents were huge Woody Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a part of my background that I must have been about 16 by the time I realized how useless it was to rebel by ignoring the Beatles or any other cultural artifact of their generation. Even if I did spend my childhood hearing my father go on and on about how, like, Nirvana would never mean anything because they're not the Beatles, blah-blah. I don't know, this is all starting to sound a little bit too angsty, you know, and that's about the last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I really got off track there, didn't I? 
As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view. It has the call letters of a college radio station on it. 
High on the wall behind him, a glowing "ON AIR" light is revealed. The perspective is skewed, the studio appears cavernous and completely barren. 
2 INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME ­ FLASHBACK ­ DAY 2 
YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar. 
MAX (O.S.) Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this is the point of that whole long-winded example­ I was force-fed Woody Allen from a young age. I remember watching Bananas when I was about five. Of course, I hated it. 
Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen. 
Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his father. The radio mike hangs in front of him. 
MAX (CONT'D) This is my old house. We lived here, in a dull suburb of New York, until I was ten, when we moved to a different house in a different dull suburb of New York. 
On TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased by a group of soldiers. 
YOUNG MAX Daddy, why are they running after her? 
FATHER (KINDLY) Someday, you'll understand. Pay attention, you'll learn something. 
Young Max turns back to the screen, wide-eyed. 
3 INT. MAX'S SECOND HOME ­ FLASHBACK 3 
In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing. 
MAX (V.O.) Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw Annie Hall, but it was the first time I actually appreciated it. I was flipping channels on a Saturday afternoon, and there it was, and I was stunned to find I loved it, more stunned to find that my parents may have had a point all along. [MORE] 
MAX (V.O.) (cont'd) Although, they were definitely wrong about Bananas. 
CLOSE ON: Adolescent Max, totally engrossed in the film. 
4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY ­ FLASHBACK 4 
Adolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by in groups. He looks a little lost. 
MAX (V.O.) Oh God, high school. I hated this place. I was a Junior when I gave up trying to fit in. Fortunately, being a social outcast is a lot easier when your school is filled with idiots. 
A pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He walks into a water fountain, drops his books. 
5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM ­ FLASHBACK 5 
Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball. Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH. 
Max stands to the side and winces. 
MAX There was something in Annie Hall I identified with. Maybe it was the style of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I don't know. All I know is, I kept going back. Different people are inspired by different things, and my source of inspiration became a 20-year-old movie about a failed relationship. 
The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up. 
6 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6 
From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small, dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear. 
He now holds a volleyball. 
MAX The pizza, of course. The paramedics took 35 minutes to arrive. 
STACY I can't believe you! Did you get in trouble? 
MAX The Station Manager said I couldn't go on the air ever again. 
STACY So what'd you do?! 
MAX I gave him the pizza! 
They collapse on the bed, laughing. Stacy rolls over and kisses Max on the lips. His eyes go wide and he frantically crawls backwards. 
STACY What? Don't you like me? 
MAX It would never work. 
STACY How would you know? 
MAX I know. I have a sixth sense. 
STACY You see dead people? 
MAX I see dead relationships. 
Stacy sits up, frustrated, the mood ruined. 
MAX (CONT'D) (TO CAMERA) That was all true, but there was something else, though. I mean, there I was, drunk, in a girl's bedroom, and the only thought running through my mind was... 
12 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD ­ DAY ­ FLASHBACK 12 
Max speaks to someone O.S. 
MAX ..."What about Beth?" 
Max is talking to Beth. It's a beautiful Spring day. 
MAX (CONT'D) I mean, I know we're just friends, but you really mean a lot to me and we've been spending a lot of time together lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm saying is, maybe we could try going out on a date or something? 
BETH Max... 
MAX I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh... 
BETH Sure. 
MAX We wouldn't have to... What? 
BETH I'd love to. How's tomorrow night? 
MAX Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow night's fine. 
BETH Great. I know the perfect thing. 
She splits, leaving Max befuddled at his change of fortune. 
13 EXT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT 13 
Max and Beth are walking through the night in overcoats. 
BETH Never? 
MAX Not until Sam and Jen. 
BETH A perfect record. Wow. 
MAX I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week as soon as I saw you together. 
BETH But you can tell with everybody? I don't know if that's sad or incredible. 
MAX Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the only one who can tell. Take any couple. If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's conflicting priorities. If it's not that, it's usually clashing levels of self- esteem. It's always something. 
BETH Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd be afraid to bring any boyfriends home. Oh, uh, sorry. 
Awkward pause. 
MAX Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean I talk about it. I don't say a word to my suitemates. 
BETH You guys never talk about anything important anyway. 
MAX Oh, come on, we have philosophical discussions all the time. 
BETH Like whether Voltron could kill the Transformers? 
SCOTT Can't go. Graphic design work. 
AMANDA Oh really? I have work, too, but it's okay, I got a lot done today. What do you have to do? 
SCOTT Graphic design work. 
TOMMY enters. He's preppier than anyone else, conservative clothes capped off by a goofy smile and thick glasses. 
TOMMY What's up, all? 
MAX Tommy, at last. Save me from this lounge lizard. 
CHARLES Yeah, what are you doing tonight? 
TOMMY Physics lab. Fortunately, the semester's just begun, so before the work piles up, I can party. That's why the beginning of the semester rules. 
CHARLES Great, so come party with me. 
TOMMY I can't, I have physics work. 
He disappears into his room. Charles takes Max's hat from a hook, jams it on his head, and shoves him towards the door. 
23 INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT ­ LATER 23 
A typically lame college party, still early in the night. The furniture is "student budget modern" type. A jazz record plays quietly, while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip wine and eat cheese and crackers. 
Max and Charles survey the room, drinks in hand. 
MAX Cheers to a new semester, full of potential that will surely go to waste. 
They toast. 
CHARLES This is it, I'm telling you. This is the semester I pass all my classes and meet the dame of my dreams. 
MAX Good luck, and may she have a sister. 
CHARLES More importantly, may she grant us our occasional freedom. 
MAX Ah, forget about Sam. I don't like it any more than you. 
CHARLES He's become a total non-entity. Freshman year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now it's like Frank and freakin' Peter Lawford. 
MAX Hey, he was one of my best friends. Now we share a room and he's like a stranger. 
CHARLES Hottie at 3 o'clock. Keep an eye on her for me so it doesn't look like I'm interested. 
MAX Yeah, right, then if you fail to sodomize her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall. 
CHARLES Look, all I said was, it would explain our lives. 
MAX The problem is, every crazy theory explains something. I took a class last semester with a professor who claimed that the planet is being destroyed by white, male, meat-eating capitalists. 
CHARLES So? Everybody knows that. 
MAX But she had a theory that explained how: apparently racism, sexism, socialism, environmentalism, and vegetarianism are all inherently linked. I brought a Big Mac to the first class, and I thought I was going to be the victim of a vegan- socialist uprising. 
Sam walks in and makes a beeline for the guys. Excitement. 
SAM Hey! I made it! 
CHARLES I can't believe it. 
MAX Wow, the laws of nature have stopped working. Maybe I should try to meet some chicks after all. 
CHARLES How'd you get away? 
SAM I told her I was going to the lab. She doesn't mind if I'm working while she is. How's the party? 
MAX Sucks. Who are they trying to be, with this wine and cheese? What kind of party doesn't even have beer? 
CHARLES I can get into this. It's better than those frat parties. Check out the fox in the beret. 
SAM Man, it's so good to be out. Between Jen, homework, and labs, I hardly have time for anything. 
CHARLES You could always change your major. You'd have a lot more free time. 
SAM I feel the same way about science that I do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it. [MORE] 
SAM (CONT'D) I have doubts about both, actually. But still, what could be dumber than changing your major for a girl? 
MAX Changing your girl for a major. 
CHARLES Charles. I'm an actor. 
JULIE (TO MAX) You okay? You look like you're in pain. 
MAX You don't get it, I can't do my show if I even suspect someone is listening. Now I have to change time slots. Again. 
JULIE I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't supposed to listen. 
MAX (INCONSOLABLE) No, it's no good, the whole episode is ruined. This is a disaster. 
CHARLES I work in theater a lot. 
JULIE Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show actually kind of sucked. 
MAX What?! 
JULIE Just kidding! It was awesome. 
CHARLES I also direct. 
MAX Uh, when did you tune in? I need to know which episode you ruined. 
JULIE At one point you dialed a phone sex line. It was hilarious. It's not every day someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss politics. 
Sam quickly pulls Charles away as he starts to comment. 
MAX And she hung up. "This isn't the place for that kind of talk..." 
JULIE Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a minute, you should talk about whatever you want. You know the country's in trouble when a phone sex operator thinks talking politics is beneath her. 
MAX Perhaps she'd been screwed by politicians. Phone sex is just pretend but politics... I know my ass is still sore. 
He catches himself and falters. Julie notices something. 
JULIE Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over- protective friends. It was nice meeting you, though. 
MAX Wait, wait. How did you know about my show? 
JULIE Someone mentioned you. 
MAX Anybody I know? Oh, duh, I guess it would have to be someone I know. 
JULIE It was from a good source. I was told I'd like you, but to really know you, I should hear your show. 
MAX What, really? 
She appraises him for a beat. 
JULIE It was Beth. 
And with that, she leaves. Max watches her, loses her in the crowd. Something catches his eye across the room. 
MAX'S POV: Sam is in a corner, trapped by an upset Jen. From his gestures, he is on the defensive. 
Charles moseys over. 
CHARLES Check it. Jen traded shifts and got out of work, so she went to the lab to surprise Sam. He wasn't there, and then Tommy gave away that he was here. 
MAX Busted. 
CHARLES And how. Let's bail before the beheadings begin. Plus, The Rat Pack's on HBO later. 
They put on their coats. 
MAX How can you stand that show? 
CHARLES I told you, it's research. It's why I got three phone numbers, Max, while you were talking to that cutie. 
24 INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT STAIRWELL 24 
MAX "Cutie"? 
CHARLES That's right. You get her name? 
MAX We just met. I was working up to it. 
CHARLES Man, you're worse at picking up chicks than me. We are one sad couple of bozos. 
Max looks at him like he's insane. 
25 INT. MAX AND SAM'S ROOM ­ LATER 25 
He doesn't look excited at the prospect, but Charles does. 
CHARLES Beth? Wow. She hasn't been around in ages. Say hi for me. 
27 EXT. FRANNIE'S ­ DAY 27 
Max walks with Beth down the city street. She carries an umbrella and scans the skies. 
BETH Wasn't it supposed to rain? 
MAX I dunno. 
BETH Max, it's been ten minutes and we're still discussing the weather. 
MAX So? Think of all the people who've died in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a worthy issue. 
BETH I just feel like there are other things we could be talking about. You're the one person I could rely on to say something original. 
MAX Okay, okay. (BEAT) So, what classes are you taking? 
BETH This was a mistake, wasn't it? 
MAX What? No. 
They stop in front of Frannie's, a small greasy spoon. 
BETH Look, let's just call it a day. I was excited to hear from you, but I can't take you like this. 
A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They hesitate. Suddenly, from inside: 
CHARLES (O.S.) Max! Beth! Come sit with us! 
MAX No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To be honest, it's nice being with someone besides my suitemates for a change. 
They look in and see... 
28 INT. FRANNIE'S ­ CONTINUOUS 28 
...Charles, Scott, Amanda, Sam and Jen, seated around a huge table. They are waving them in. Beth enters, Max reluctantly follows. 
JEN Oh my, God, Beth! It's great to see you! 
AMANDA It's been so long! 
Everyone scoots over to make room. Max is still stunned but has no choice. He sits. 
JEN How did we ever fall out of touch? We shouldn't let that happen again. 
BETH I know! I even miss this place. I live on the wrong side of campus now. You guys still come here? It's so dark and the menu is tiny. 
CHARLES It never changes, that's why. 
SAM (TO JEN) What are you gonna get? 
JEN Maybe an omelet. 
MAX Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic. 
JEN So don't get the eggs. 
MAX It's just that, it's the smell. It's the smell that bothers me. 
JEN Are you serious? How can you be allergic to the smell of my eggs? 
BETH Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just incredibly picky about food. 
CHARLES Even other people's. 
MAX Look, if you're going to have eggs, let me at least switch seats with Sam, so I'll be farther away from it. 
SAM Max, what's up with you today? Join a support group. 
CHARLES If it really bothers you, why don't you and Beth switch? 
This would put Beth next to Charles. She looks at him and he smiles. Unable to help herself, she smiles back. 
SAM What about people at other tables? Should we ask the management to stop serving egg- products to people upwind of you? 
JEN Why can't you just get along with everyone for once? 
MAX Alright, alright, you win, we'll switch. Come on, Beth, get up. 
Charles takes two mugs off the floor, throws their contents into a plant, and pours. 
Tommy is on one end of a couch, sneaking looks at Amanda, in the middle, who is sneaking looks at Scott, on the other end. 
AMANDA (TO SCOTT) How was your day? 
TOMMY (ANSWERING HER) My day sucked. I spent six hours in the lab and four hours in class. And tonight, I have to study for two tests. 
CHARLES Ouch. 
TOMMY It better be worth it when I get into grad school. 
AMANDA Scott, how's the design project coming? 
SCOTT Slowly. There are a couple problems. 
AMANDA Huh. 
Scott gets up and leaves the room. 
TOMMY Listen, I have an extra ticket to this concert tomorrow night. 
Charles, Sam, and Max look on with alarm: is he really going through with this, here, now? Amanda takes the bait. 
AMANDA The Ani DiFranco show? Awesome! That's been sold out for weeks! 
TOMMY It's not Ani DiFranco, it's better-- two, front row seats at the Campus Choir charity show. 
AMANDA Oh. 
TOMMY So do ya wanna go? 
AMANDA I dunno. Why don't you call me tomorrow during the day. 
TOMMY Okay, great. 
AMANDA It's getting late. See you guys later. 
SAM - MAX - CHARLES Bye. 
TOMMY See you tomorrow. 
Amanda exits. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) Wow, that went pretty good. 
CHARLES Using Ani DiFranco to get laid. I've gotta try that. 
SAM She'll never give up on Scott. 
TOMMY It's not like I expect anything, I just like to spend time with her. 
Scott wanders back in with a copy of Wired magazine. Tommy stands. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) Scott, do you mind if I take Amanda to a concert tomorrow night? 
SCOTT Why would I? 
TOMMY I didn't think so, but not asking would be wrong. 
SCOTT No, it wouldn't. 
TOMMY But... 
SAM It's not even a date. 
TOMMY It's nothing serious, but it is a date. 
CHARLES But they're going as friends. 
SAM They are friends. 
MAX She probably won't even go. 
Scott sits and reads his magazine. Tommy drops heavily into a chair. 
TOMMY Whenever you're done, someone please give me an update on my sex life. 
CHARLES How does "sex life" enter, if she might not be going, and if she does, it's just as friends? 
SAM Wait, can you be on a date with someone you're not dating? 
MAX No, you're thinking of Chasing Amy. 
SAM Which one had all the comic book stuff? 
MAX They both did. 
SAM What about the Star Wars stuff? 
MAX Mallrats, Clerks, and Dogma. 
SAM What about the last one? 
MAX Doesn't count, it was just an ad for all his other films. 
SAM You gotta admit, it's fucking cheap for a movie to refer to other movies. 
MAX Why? We do it real life. We're doing it right now. What you're saying is, if this was a movie, it wouldn't be any good. 
SAM Yeah. Our lives would make an awful movie. 
MAX But if our lives were a movie, you'd never be able to say that. You'd be giving the critics the perfect quote to pan it with. 
SAM So fucking what? It's a shitty movie! 
Sam drops his controller and gets up. 
MAX Are you okay? 
SAM How come you only play this one video game? 
MAX Video hockey is my game. Like a swan, I mate for life. 
SAM More like the loon. 
Max looks him over. 
MAX Holy shit, you and Jen broke up. 
SAM Yeah. Your prediction finally came true. Come on, let's hit the bar. I need a drink. 
33 INT. COFFEE BAR ­ DAY 33 
A crummy collegiate dive. Sam and Max drink coffees. 
MAX Okay, so what happened? 
SAM We were just hanging out, and she told me she loves me. Completely out of the blue. She says things like that sometimes, things like "I love that you're my boyfriend," ya know? But usually when we're in bed or something. But this time it was different, all we were doing was watching TV. 
MAX Porn? 
SAM Almost. It was "our" show, the one we like to get romantic to... 
34 INT. JEN'S DORM ROOM ­ SAM'S FLASHBACK 34 
Sam and Jen watch "The X-Files." Max stands, observing. Jen can't see him. 
SAM (TO MAX) I was just tired of trying to tell her what she wanted to hear all the time, so I tried to be honest. (TO JEN) We've been together a long time and I really care about you, but I don't know if I love you. This is tough to say, but I think something might be missing from our relationship. 
JEN Something's missing? 
SAM Well, not completely... I don't know if I can explain it. See... (FUMBLING) There are three things I look for in a girl: heart, body, and mind. And well, you've got the body. 
Max is stunned and laughs. Jen is stunned, too, and runs out. 
MAX (TO CAMERA) Jesus. You think you know someone pretty well and then they do something like this. 
SAM When she comes back, she slaps me in the face and makes me leave. Then she calls, crying, and asks me to come over. When I go back, she kicks me out and says she never wants to see me again. 
MAX Fifty bucks says there's a message on the machine when we get back. 
Max sits, and the background DISSOLVES back TO: 
35 INT. COFFEE BAR ­ PRESENT 35 
SAM Is it really so bad? I couldn't lie to her. 
MAX Don't you know that no matter how often girls tell you they want honesty, they never really mean it? Nobody does! 
SAM Look, I fucked up, alright? I didn't know what to say. 
MAX It's too bad it ended like this. I'm really sorry. 
CHARLES You have no choice. If you back away now, she'll never get to see the rest of your annoying personality traits. 
MAX You're right. I can't deprive her of that. 
37 INT. THE PUB -- JULIE'S TABLE 37 
Julie is with ANDY and MARK. Andy is your basic hippie, resplendent in a ridiculous green shag jacket. Mark has a cap and is wearing a J Crew long-sleeve shirt over a Dave Matthews Band t-shirt. 
Max approaches. 
JULIE Max! What's going on? 
MAX Hey. 
JULIE Do you guys know Max? This is Mark... 
MARK Wassup. 
JULIE ...And Andy. 
ANDY Hey Max, how's it hanging, bud? 
MAX Fine. I, uh, really like your jacket. Is that real carpet? 
ANDY Yeah, man. I couldn't believe my luck when I saw it. This shade of shag is, like, so rare. I was like, woah... 
MARK Hey, are we gonna burn this or what? 
ANDY Yeah, man. Hey, you guys are like all invited, if you can handle some kind bud... "Maui wowey," you know? 
MAX Aloha? 
38 INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT ­ A LITTLE LATER 38 
Mark, Julie, and Max sit around a wooden table in a small apartment's kitchen. Andy puts on a CD. 
ANDY Hey man, you like Zappa? 
MAX Dweezil or Moon Unit? 
ANDY Frank. (then gets it, laughs) Man, that isn't even funny. You should check out "Apostrophe" some time. 
MAX "Apostrophe"? 
MARK It's an album. 
MAX I thought he was correcting my grammar. 
MARK Can I get anyone beers? Julie? 
JULIE Sure. 
ANDY You know it. 
MAX Okay. 
Mark distributes beers to everyone but Max. 
MARK Sorry, Max, we don't have enough. 
MAX Uh, yeah, sure. 
JULIE You want mine? 
MAX No thanks. I'm kinda picky about beer. I'm more into stuff like Guinness, Bass, Killians. 
MARK (DISDAINFUL) That's so... British. 
MAX It's a coincidence, I swear. 
Julie has trouble opening her beer. Mark rushes over with his keychain. 
MARK I thought Guinness was going to be cool, but it sucks. Made me nauseous. 
ANDY Dude, puking blows. That's why I smoke weed. You get high right away and no hangover! 
Andy pulls out a baggie of marijuana, and rummages through the closet. 
MAX Yeah, I don't know. Giving me pot is like letting Richard Simmons smoke crack. I'm paranoid enough as it is. 
MARK Yeah, well, some people just can't handle their bud. 
JULIE No, well, a little, sure. But there are always men around. During fire drills, more guys come out than girls. Never the same ones either. They come and go. 
MAX I bet they do. 
Julie catches herself and laughs. Max shares a smile with her in the doorway. 
JULIE I had a good time tonight, but next time, let's have some real fun. 
MAX Oh, fine, uh, next time I'll bring Jack Nicholson and a case of Schnapps. 
JULIE Good night, Max. 
Julie enters the dorm. Max watches her through the glass. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: white on black: "WEDNESDAY" 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE UP of a schedule's column heading: "Wednesday" 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
40 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE RADIO STATION ­ DAY 40 
Max reads the schedule on the door. His watch says 11am; he finds Wednesday 11am: "Julio's Death Metal Jamboree." He peeks behind the door-- the station is empty. 
He starts to slip inside when... 
BETH (O.S.) Max! 
He whirls, closing the door guiltily. Beth comes down the hall, laden with books. 
MAX Uh, hi... 
BETH It was great running into your friends, but... you know... I feel bad about what I said. Do you want to get together later? 
MAX I don't know, I'm sure I have something to do that I've forgotten. 
BETH Come on, it's bad enough we fell out of touch, but we can't even have lunch? 
MAX We had breakfast. 
BETH Every time we try to do anything, you have an excuse, or forget to show up, or you cancel. 
MAX You cancel on me, too. 
BETH I'm sorry. Things have been a little, you know, awkward. 
MAX Look, the whole thing was my fault. Let's drop it, okay? 
Beth throws up her hands, turns away. 
MAX (CONT'D) Okay, lunch, you win. 
BETH Now you're only going because I gave you a hard time. 
MAX Guilt is a powerful force. Just be glad it's on our side for once. 
BETH Okay, how is the Kidney Bean at noon? 
MAX Awful, just like every other time of day. Their food is just birdseed prepared fancy. 
BETH The Fabulous Diner, then. Friday at noon? 
MAX Fine. 
She leaves. Max finds his old slot on the schedule and crosses it out. Then he slips into the station. 
41 EXT. CVS 41 
A shitbox pulls up. Sam drives, Max rides shotgun. Scott and Amanda are in back. 
AMANDA And then I got to thinking, you know, I really think I like vanilla. 
Sam turns off the car. 
SAM I'll be right back. 
MAX Me too. 
SAM I'll be right back. 
MAX Me too. 
They leave. 
Amanda and Scott are alone in the back. Amanda looks tense. 
AMANDA Scott, can I ask you something? 
SCOTT Okay. 
AMANDA It's just that, sometimes, you're really cool and other times you act like I'm not even here. Or like you don't want me around. 
SCOTT Yeah. 
AMANDA Well, I was wondering if... never mind. 
SCOTT Okay. 
A moment passes. 
AMANDA All right, look, I'm just going to come right out with it. I think I like you. I think I, I really like you. 
SCOTT I know. 
As she opens her mouth, Scott opens the car door and exits. 
44 INT. CVS ­ PRESENT 44 
SCOTT So where are the socks? 
45 INT. PUB ­ THAT NIGHT 45 
An absurd metal band plays on-stage. The room is packed, and the crowd is mostly one big mosh pit. 
Max wades through the slamdancers, freaked. He makes it to the coffee bar. Julie soon appears, sweaty. She's been here awhile. 
JULIE Hey! 
MAX Oh, hey! It's good to see you. 
The surging crowd shoves Max into Julie. They fall against each other. Max is near panic but Julie's laughing, getting off on the energy of the room. 
The SINGER smashes the mic against the wall, then brandishes the stand menacingly at the crowd, who step back in alarm. 
MAX (CONT'D) Who are these guys? 
JULIE They're Anhedonia. They're "sludge-core." 
SINGER You're all a part of the conspiracy! You're all human! Every one of you wore diapers! You're all full of shit! 
The singer storms off. The band follows. The crowd applauds with some confusion. Julie whistles loudly and claps. 
JULIE That's their trademark. They insult the crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he breaks the mike two songs in. We were lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes. 
MAX Luck had nothing to do with it. 
JULIE Look, the mike's not even broken. They were just tired of playing, but they wanted to give us something to remember. Now that's showmanship. 
MAX You have to wonder about any band whose highlight is their exit. 
JULIE It worked for The Who. 
MAX I'm sorry, the who? 
JULIE Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a joke a celebrity DJ would make? 
MAX I still can't believe you tuned in. It's like an invasion of privacy. 
JULIE You're a riot. Let's get out of here. 
She pulls him away. 
46 INT. STUDY LOUNGE ­ UNIVERSITY CENTER ­ MINUTES LATER 46 
The lounge is empty. Julie sits on a couch. Max sits next to her, but seems uptight about getting too close. 
MAX So, uh, I'm sorry about that thing with, uh, Chip was it? 
JULIE Oh, Mark. He's been following me around for years. He's easily threatened. 
JULIE Sounds perfect. 
They walk out. 
MAX Say, did that guy look like...? 
JULIE Ernest Borgnine? Yeah, I noticed that too. 
47 INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT 47 
Max is relaxed and chatting while Julie drives. 
MAX I've been able to do it since high school. 
JULIE That's a scary gift. I mean, even if people are destined to break up, the will to stay together is very powerful. 
MAX That's the real tragedy. Look at all the unhappy couples in the world. 
JULIE I don't know if your gift is really that special, Max. I mean, we break up with everyone we ever date... Until the one we stay with forever. 
MAX See how ridiculous dating is? 
JULIE How did you get this attitude if you love Annie Hall? 
MAX What do you mean? That's what Annie's all about. 
Julie looks dubious. Max flicks on the radio. 
DJ ..."college radio for the masses," and that's it for me. (sound of CDs falling) Whoops! Anyway, next up is Verbal Diarrhea, with Todd Duke. 
MAX Why is your radio set to the campus station? 
JULIE Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I first heard your show. 
MAX I thought Beth told you about me. 
JULIE It doesn't matter, Max. Now that I've met you, your show's not important. 
48 INT. PRETENTIOUS CAFE ­ A LITTLE LATER 48 
The kind of place that's perfect for Parents Weekend. At this late hour, it is filled with young professionals. There's a dance floor, where couples dance to the standards. Max and Julie are at a table in the corner, looking out of place. 
JULIE (SMIRKING) This is a nice place. Ritzy. Interesting mix of people here, you've got these men with their suits, taking their waitress girlfriends out to impress them into bed, because they can't get them any other way. Really, as if a fast car can ever make up for a small dick. 
MAX If it did, do you think I'd be here? I'd be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski mask and an Uzi. 
JULIE Guys, always obsessed with dick size. 
MAX Well, sure, there's that, but it would also be nice to have a car with a heater. 
JULIE Let's guess which couples are destined to break up. How about them? 
Indicates a COUPLE dancing. 
MAX No, I can't tell just by looking. I need some info. 
Their waitress, DONNA, arrives. 
JULIE Hi! Do you have a boyfriend? 
Max is aghast. Donna stares a beat. 
DONNA Yeah. 
JULIE (TO MAX) What do you need to know? 
MAX Uh, just a description. 
JULIE Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a psyche major. 
DONNA Well, he's tall... ish. Brown hair. Funny. Very friendly. Fixes cars. Close with his brother. Uh, what else? Believes in God. Has a sweet tooth. Uh... 
MAX That's plenty. 
DONNA So can I take your order? 
JULIE We're not ready, thanks. 
Donna puts her pad away. 
DONNA So what was that all about then? 
61 INT. DORM HALLWAY ­ SHELLY HALL 61 
Max knocks on the door to Julie's suite. Nothing. He paces, frustrated. Suddenly, JUDY comes out of a stairwell. 
JUDY Hello? Can I help you? 
MAX Yeah, do you know where Julie is? 
JUDY Hey! Are you Max? 
MAX Yeah... 
JUDY Oh wow! You're just like she described. Hi, I'm Judy. I'm sure she mentions me all the time. 
MAX Oh, yeah, Judy. Right. 
Judy unlocks the door and holds it open. 
JUDY Come in, come in. Make yourself at home. 
MAX Uh, thanks. 
62 INT. JULIE'S SUITE 62 
Max enters cautiously. The common room couldn't be more different than his own, clean and tasteful. 
Judy hangs her coat up. 
JUDY This may be completely inappropriate, but can I ask you something? The tattoo­ did it hurt? 
MAX (THINKING FAST) Uhhhh... No! I mean, not much. 
JUDY Why didn't you use your frat's logo? 
MAX Well, uh, the guy said it's too hard to draw two grown men kissing. Say, which one is Julie's room? 
JUDY On the left. She's got the single. 
Max pushes Julie's door open with one hand while keeping an eye on the front door. 
MAX So...! Uh, do I come here often, would you say? 
JUDY (O.S.) What? 
The front door opens and Julie enters. 
JULIE Max! What are you doing here? 
MAX Judy let me in! 
Judy comes out of her room. 
JUDY You know, I think I'm going to get a tattoo, too. 
JULIE Judy, Mark has the tattoo. This is Max. 
JUDY What? You're Max? 
JULIE Yeah, isn't he great? 
JUDY Sure. 
Glaring at him, she goes into her room and closes the door. 
JULIE What a surprise! What brings you here? 
MAX I was, uh, in the area and thought I'd pop in. Find out how your day went. 
JULIE It was excellent, how was yours? 
MAX Great. I had lunch with a dear, dear friend. 
JULIE Yeah? Anyone I know? 
MAX Probably not. She's a foreign exchange student. Spends a lot of time modeling. 
JULIE Really? 
MAX Yeah, the agencies won't leave her alone. We had, uh, quite a lunch. Lots of shellfish, and wine. And, uh, rhino's horn. 
JULIE For lunch? 
CHARLES Not if you count this huge purse she had. She was rummaging through it and finally had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out of that thing. Anyway, it made me think of Annie Hall. 
MAX Oh, great. 
CHARLES Although Julie dresses better. 
Max slowly lowers his controller. 
MAX What are you saying, I like her because she's like Annie Hall? 
CHARLES I didn't say that. 
MAX Oh my God, I think you're right. 
CHARLES I didn't say that. 
MAX I don't want to like someone because she reminds me of someone in a movie. Now I'm wondering why I like her. Maybe I don't. 
CHARLES Good Lord, Max. Take some harder classes. 
Sam returns, sees what they are playing. 
SAM Look at you two. Wouldn't something else be fun for a change? How about Goldeneye? 
CHARLES Great game. 
MAX No. I don't know how to play it. 
SAM Lucky for you, I actually have time to teach you. Normally I would be having lunch with Jen. 
MAX Oh, shit, I forgot about lunch! 
Max gets up and runs out. Charles and Sam exchange a look. 
SAM Man, he'll do anything to avoid change, won't he? 
70 INT. THE FABULOUS DINER ­ DAY 70 
Beth is alone, working on a salad. Max runs up and jumps into the booth. 
BETH (not looking up) So glad you could make it. 
MAX Hey, I'm here, right? 
BETH Thank God for small favors. 
MAX I'm sorry. Are you still upset about the thing with Steve? 
BETH Yeah, a little. This semester isn't shaping up too well. It's tough getting back into the groove of things and, you know, being on campus. Yourself? 
MAX Well, you know. Nothing even worth mentioning. 
BETH But there's something? Really? 
MAX It's nothing. 
BETH Who is it? Do I know her? 
MAX Actually, um, yeah, it's Julie. 
BETH Julie! She's great. Why aren't you thrilled? 
MAX Well, I'm not sure I'm that into her. 
BETH This I gotta hear. 
MAX She reminds everyone of Annie Hall. 
BETH Well, of course, why do you think I sent her to you? 
MAX God, I'm such an idiot! That film is finding more and more ways to ruin my life. 
Max pounds his head against the table but Beth is amused. 
BETH What're you talking about? 
MAX Look at my life. Look at this thing with Julie. 
BETH Jeez, she's not like Annie when the film starts, she's like Annie at the end. Or maybe, the Millennium Edition. 
MAX The worst part is, maybe I knew this all along. 
MAX Ummm, no. 
JULIE Isn't that it on the end there? 
MAX No. 
JULIE Sure it is. 
MAX Um, no, it's just the box. The tape inside is wrestling. 
JULIE No, it isn't. 
MAX Um, it's been recorded over... 
JULIE You don't believe your friend's theory, right? 
MAX No, of course not. 
JULIE Because it's insulting. A cop-out. 
MAX I, I know, it's just, I watched it last week. How about Airplane? 
JULIE Oh, good idea. But next time, Annie Hall. 
Max puts in Airplane. Julie and Max sit on a couch together. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
73 INT. COMMON ROOM -- NIGHT -- LATER 73 
Airplane plays. Julie and Max share a blanket. Max turns toward Julie just as she turns toward him, and their lips end up in the same place. Julie pulls back. 
JULIE What are you­? 
MAX Huh? 
JULIE Why did you back away? 
MAX Why did you? 
JULIE It wasn't me, I wouldn't have backed away. 
MAX Really? I'll, I'll have to remember that later. 
Max turns back to the movie. A beat passes. Julie looks at him, amused. 
MAX (CONT'D) Actually, my memory's not what it used to be. If I don't act on this information now... 
They kiss. Max pulls the blanket up over them. The sound of KISSING. Then: 
JULIE Ow. 
MAX Sorry. 
JULIE No, it's okay. 
More KISSING. 
MAX Are you comfortable, I mean, is this okay? 
JULIE It's okay. Shut up already. 
Suddenly, the sound of a LOCK TURNING. Max and Julie quickly get out from under the covers. Sam and Tommy enter, oblivious to the quick recovery of innocence on the couch. 
TOMMY You're crazy! You know how important your sense of smell is? 
SAM Come on! What about touch? Missing the smell of rotting milk is hardly equal to not being able to enjoy sex. (SEEING THEM) Oh, hey, Max. 
MAX Hey. Guys, um, this is Julie. Julie, this is my roommate Sam, and that's Tommy, who also lives here. 
JULIE Nice to meet you guys, but I was just leaving. 
MAX What? 
JULIE I have work to do before class tomorrow. 
MAX But the movie is... Okay. Do you want me to walk you home? 
JULIE Sure, all right. Boys, nice to meet you. 
Max leaves with Julie. 
But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him Not to intervene When it came to you 
77 EXT. STREET -- SUNRISE 77 
A boy and a girl hold hands as they cross an icy street. 
78 EXT. QUAD -- SUNRISE 78 
Squirrels play in the light. 
79 EXT. UNIVERSITY CENTER -- SUNRISE 79 
The sun reflects off the University Center windows and back onto the snow. 
Not to touch a hair on your head To leave you as you are But if He felt He had to direct you Direct you into my arms... 
80 INT. RADIO STATION 80 
The lights are low. Max is at the console, staring into space. Nick Cave is playing softly on the monitors. 
Into my arms... oh Lord... Into my arms... oh Lord... 
The phone RINGS. Max snaps out of his reverie and stares at it in horror. After several rings, he answers it. 
MAX Hello. Nobody is here right now. Please leave a message. BEEEEEEEP. 
SPLIT SCREEN between Max and 
81 INT. JULIE'S ROOM 81 
Julie, in bed, smoking. 
JULIE Nice try, Max. I thought you had homework and stuff, you liar. Great song, by the way. 
MAX You're listening? I told you not to listen! 
JULIE Come on, you're funny, you have good taste in music... 
MAX Hey, where'd the music go? 
82 INT. DORM ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 82 
Two STUDENTS, lying in bed together, listen to the radio. 
JULIE (O.S.) (on the radio) I don't know. 
MAX (O.S.) (on the radio) I don't get it, it stopped when I picked up the phone. 
83 INT. RADIO STATION -- CONTINUOUS 83 
Max pushes up a slider and hears the following coming out over the monitors: 
JULIE (O.S.) I'm just calling to say that you left your underpants and took mine. 
Max reacts, then SCREECHING FEEDBACK rips over the airwaves. 
MAX Woah! 
Continue SPLIT SCREEN with 
84 INT. JULIE'S ROOM 84 
Where Julie is frantically pulling the chord out of the back of her radio. 
Max fades the phone out, the music up. 
MAX Don't be too proud of your five seconds of fame. More people would hear us if we shouted out the window. 
JULIE My radio days are over, I'm now deaf. 
MAX Didn't I tell you not to listen to my show? 
JULIE You were only playing music. 
MAX Well, all these songs are about you. 
JULIE Wow... You're a real piece of work, you know that, Max? 
85 INT. MAX AND SAM'S ROOM ­ MORNING 85 
Max enters and takes off his coat. Sam sits up, annoyed. 
Sam comes in, totally morose. Silently, he joins them in three-player mode, then quickly kills himself with a rocket launcher. 
MAX You just came from Jen's, huh? 
SAM Yeah, we just broke up for good. 
CHARLES Oh, man, I'm sorry. Was it you or her? 
SAM Me. Us. Both. It was just time, I guess. (puts down the joystick) I have to go, uh, mail a letter or something. 
He puts on his coat and leaves. Charles, Tommy, and Max exchange looks. Max turns off the game. 
MAX Well, that took the wind out of my sails. 
CHARLES (NOTICING TOMMY) What's up with you? Got another date with Amanda? 
TOMMY It wasn't a date. 
CHARLES A no-show, huh? 
TOMMY Yeah, but it's okay. Today's her birthday, and she invited me out for dinner at a nice restaurant. 
CHARLES She invited all of us. 
TOMMY Oh? Well, that's cool, too. 
MAX It's barely lunch, why are you dressed up? 
TOMMY I don't want to wait til the last minute to pick out my clothes. 
CHARLES Are you really wearing that tie? 
TOMMY Damn, I knew this was the wrong one! 
He runs into his room. Charles laughs at him. 
MAX I don't wanna go to a birthday party. I'm broke, and I wanna hang out with Julie. 
CHARLES So take her. And pray Sara's not there. 
87 EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT ­ EVENING 87 
Max and Julie walk through the snow together, toward a parking lot. She's taking deep drags off a cigarette. 
JULIE This has been some crazy week. I still have a six page paper due Monday. 
MAX Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced, in 14 point type, that's only like 500 words. If a picture's worth a thousand words, that's like a bad photocopy. 
JULIE Don't worry about it, I needed a break. Good to get out and enjoy the weather. 
MAX What are you, from Maine? 
JULIE No. 
MAX Phew, because I don't know if I'd be able to handle something like that. That's a hard thing to drop on a person. 
JULIE I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far from Canada. 
MAX Shit, I'm sorry. 
JULIE It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had a few close friends. That's all you need. It's quiet up there, dull but nice. 
MAX It sounds it. 
They get to her car, and he surprises her by kissing her. She responds, after a hesitation. 
88 INT. JULIE'S CAR ­ EVENING 88 
Max sits tensely in the passenger seat. 
MAX Look out for that truck! 
The truck's about two blocks away. 
JULIE Will you relax? I know how to drive. 
MAX Watch the driveway! 
JULIE (ANNOYED) I've got it under control, Max! 
MAX Anyway, everyone's dying to meet you. 
MAX Was? Is. Wait... Oh, shit! 
Max covers his face, breathes deep. 
JULIE Are you okay? Will you please calm down? I like you very much, but I told you, I just got out of a serious relationship, and it ended really badly. We saw each other almost every day at the beginning, but by the end of the semester, I hadn't seen him in a month. He stopped returning my calls and stuff, and I mean, he basically avoided me, then I heard he was seeing one of my friends. 
MAX But that was him, not me. 
JULIE It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've been trying but it's hard. Relationships are very difficult to maintain. There are so few successful couples. 
MAX What's successful? Like, my parents have been married thirty years, but-- 
JULIE My parents are divorced. 
MAX Okay, bad example. But why think ahead? We're here, now. Can't we just enjoy our time together? 
JULIE Max, I did, believe me. 
MAX What was all this, I mean, was any of it­ 
JULIE I don't know what I was doing. I didn't think about where this might lead until it was too late. 
MAX But it might lead to... happiness. 
Tommy walks in, half asleep, in his pajamas. He turns on the TV and sits down. Max stares at him. Tommy suddenly realizes he isn't alone. 
TOMMY Uh, re-run. 
He turns it off and quickly exits. Max tries to pull himself together. 
JULIE Say something. Are you okay? 
MAX I knew that damn film was cursed! Why did I listen to Charles instead of Annie? 
JULIE Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship movie. 
MAX What are you talking about? It's a fucking textbook. 
She stands. 
JULIE You're not listening to me, Max. Just like you're not listening to Annie. No matter what you think right now, this was worth it. Because I got to meet you, and got to be close to you. 
MAX I know. I don't know. I mean... Good-bye. 
Julie leaves. The VCR whirs to a stop and Annie Hall ejects. Max stares at it, upset and thoughtful. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: white on black: "SUNDAY" 
93 INT. COMMON ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 93 
PAN left to right across people's chests: an X-Files shirt, a lounge shirt with a wide collar, a Stephen Hawking shirt, an Ani DiFranco shirt... 
PULL BACK to reveal, l to r, Sam, Charles, Tommy and Amanda, sprawled on the couches, from Max's POV in the doorway. 
They're drinking vodka out of coffee mugs. The TV is on but the sound is off. Everyone looks tired and sad. 
Max sits. Sam thumbs a copy of Scientific American. 
SAM Why are humans smarter than chimps if we have 99% of the same genetic material? 
MAX Who says we're smarter? 
SAM Look who I'm asking. You think a red blood cell is a prison for a gang member. 
MAX Very funny, Mr. Wizard. If I learned anything useful in my classes, I'd be rubbing it in your face. 
In Scott's usual spot is Amanda and Tommy. 
TOMMY So Amanda. Have a good weekend? 
AMANDA Yeah. 
TOMMY Mine was good too. Get any good birthday presents? 
AMANDA Yeah. 
She gets up and leaves the room. 
SAM By the way, Max, what ever happened with that girl you were seeing?

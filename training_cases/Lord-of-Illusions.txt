"Lord of Illusions" -- by Clive Barker 
TITLE SEQUENCE 
As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences: 
EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY 
A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed, surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws, broken glass teeth. 
EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY 
Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of sand and heat. 
END CREDITS. 
CUT WIDE TO; 
EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY 
A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago" 
EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY 
We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding, almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black, the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield narrows his eyes. 
BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V. 
The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the house. 
BUTTERFIELD (softly) Swann...? 
He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY 
The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse a little of what life here is like. 
The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and oppressive. 
The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the floor, light these claustrophobic corridors. 
BUTTERFIELD Master? 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY 
A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 
All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives - wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. They watch Nix in adoration. 
As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to hand with casual ease... 
NIX And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix, you're my instrument. From now on, you'll be called the Puritan... 
CULTISTS (murmuring) Puritan... 
NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together, together you will cleanse the world. 
CULTISTS Yes... 
Butterfield enters. 
BUTTERFIELD Master? 
Nix looks up. 
BUTTERFIELD Swann's here. 
Nix rises, smiling. 
NIX (to Cultists) We'll come back to this. Get about your business. 
As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY 
A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying, creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony. 
From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft SOBBING. 
NIX Hush... 
Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED. 
NIX I said hush. 
GIRL Please.  Let me go. 
From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal. 
NIX (to Baboon) What is it? 
INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY 
Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us. 
JENNIFER Don't be afraid. 
The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl, of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged. 
BARBARA I'm not... want to see? 
She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer retreats to the door, and exits back out into -- 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from his white-knuckled fingers. 
PIMM He's going to kill us all... 
JENNIFER Where did Swann go? 
Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY 
Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. He turns the door handle. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY 
Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 
On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth. 
Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching! 
He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 
Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum. 
QUAID Stay the fuck away! (yells) Pimm!  Get over here! 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY 
PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the ground beside her. 
SWANN You're going to be okay. 
Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque altarpiece. 
The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her face.  Swann turns. 
NIX I knew you'd come. 
He reaches down to Swann. 
NIX I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg. 
SWANN Fuck you. 
NIX You don't think I've got it to give? 
SWANN No! 
Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying gravity. 
NIX You're wrong. 
He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back against the wall. 
NIX I could eat your fucking soul, Swann. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's hand.  BLOOD SPURTS. 
JENNIFER Fuck! 
She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY 
Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient. 
NIX You want to know what the world really looks like? 
Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 
And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt. 
SWANN Binding you. 
He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his hands on the side of the mask, and  LIKE MAGIC -- his touch makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs from the screw-holes. 
NIX Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you! 
Now the second piece, over his MOUTH. 
NIX Sw 
He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into place. 
Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 
And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies. 
GIRL (quietly) Is it finished? 
SWANN It's finished. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat, their confidence and courage gone. 
Pimm steps into the Sanctum. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY 
The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl. 
PIMM Dead? 
QUAID Dead. 
PIMM What now? 
SWANN We bury him so deep no one will ever find him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK 
The wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield dashes towards camera, then halts. 
HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 
ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY 
The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments. 
ON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER" 
EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY 
The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but it has a certain charm. 
INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY 
A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his name. 
BLONDE GIRL How'd you spell that again? 
HARRY D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour. 
BLONDE GIRL D'Amour. 
HARRY Right. 
BLONDE GIRL Isn't that French for something? 
ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door. 
BELLBOY Mister D'Amour? 
HARRY (to Blonde) Yeah.  It's French. 
BLONDE GIRL For love, right? 
BELLBOY Mister D'Amour? 
HARRY (to Blonde) Right. 
BLONDE GIRL (grinning) That's so cool. 
BELLBOY Mister D'Amour? 
From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN. 
QUAID (V.O.) Ahh. . . 
Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the shadows. 
His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and goes for his throat. 
Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 
Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the Fortune Telling Room. 
MILLER Fuckhead. 
INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT 
A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED. 
Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room. 
HARRY What the fuck!? 
Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the door. 
HARRY Shit! 
Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 
As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes - one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL. 
HARRY (to Butterfield) Don't touch him." 
Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs in pain. 
BUTTERFIELD What are you going to do about it? 
Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through. 
BUTTERFIELD (to Harry) Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it. 
QUAID Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm. 
BUTTERFIELD Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home. 
As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the table.  Behind it a WINDOW. 
BUTTERFIELD So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you? 
QUAID Yes. 
BUTTERFIELD And are you afraid? 
QUAID Yes. 
Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 
Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the scalpel from his hands. 
Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window, which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 
Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already making his escape.  Harry starts after him. 
QUAID (to Harry) Don't leave me. 
He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the stairs. 
HARRY You need an ambulance. 
QUAID (in pain) Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading? 
Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand. 
HARRY NO ... I... 
Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers. 
QUAID (quietly) My God. 
HARRY What? 
QUAID You've taken some strange journeys in your life. 
HARRY Yeah.  You could say that. 
QUAID You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you. (looks at Harry) You don't like that. 
HARRY Not much. 
QUAID You can't change it.  You have to walk... (coughs) ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it. 
Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in pain.

On screen:  Philadelphia 
A suburban street.  Early morning light. 
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - PHILADELPHIA - MORNING 
CLOSE-UP of a PHOTOGRAPH of the Cultist with the Painted Face, from the opening scene, standing outside Nix's house in Nevada.  His name is Norman Sanders. 
ON NORMAN, thirteen years older, looking down at the photograph.  He lays it down, beside a letter, on which two words are written: "Homecoming Time." 
Norman smiles to himself.  Goes to the wardrobe.  Gets out a small suitcase.  His WIFE'S BODY is slumped in the wardrobe, glassy-eyed.

On the screen:  Miami. 
BARBARA - the blonde girl who carved the cult's sigil into her chest - is washing her hands.  She casually dries them, and picks up the letter, walking past her HUSBAND and SON, both DEAD at the breakfast table, BLOOD spreading around their heads.  When she gets to the door she steps over the body of her DAUGHTER, who has also been shot trying to escape her mother's murder spree. 
ON THE RADIO, George Harrison sings "My Sweet Lord."

On screen:  San Antonio. 
A ZOO-KEEPER wanders into the darkened interior of the Reptile House. 
INT. REPTILE HOUSE - DAY 
The Zoo-keeper's benign expression changes at the sight of the chaos inside.  The glass cases have been SMASHED. Another KEEPER lies on the ground, his face pulped.  A few SNAKES slither around his body, but most of them have gone.

EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - DAY 
It's early morning in Bel-Air.  The sun shines down on a millionaire's paradise:  a huge house surrounded by a jungle of trees and blossoms. 
EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - DAY 
The blue water glitters in the noon-day sun.  And a WOMAN -- her body perfectly proportioned -- glides under the surface, emerging at the shallow end, where the housekeeper CLEMENZIA is setting a tray on a table. 
CLEMENZIA Coffee, Mrs. Swann? 
Mrs. Swann's name is DOROTHEA.  She is a beautiful and sensual woman. 
DOROTHEA Thank you. 
She dries off. 
DOROTHEA Where's Mr. Swann? 
CLEMENZIA In his study. (a beat) He got something on his mind? 
DOROTHEA Why? 
CLEMENZIA Bad mood today. 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - DAY 
Venetian blinds shut out most of the sunlight, but a lamp burns on the desk (huge), showing us the furniture (leather), the books (innumerable), and the figure of SWANN, sitting behind the desk smoking a CIGAR.  He's lost some hair and some colour over the years, but he still has the same hypnotic eyes. 
He studies the L.A. TIMES in front of him. 
ON THE OPEN PAGE 
"Fortune Teller Brutally Murdered," the headline announces. Underneath, a PHOTOGRAPH of Quaid's wrecked room.  WE CLOSE IN on the photograph, and catch a glimpse of Harry, standing looking at the chaos.  CAMERA. MOVES DOWN to the text beneath, and on to the name "Harry D'Amour." 
ON SWANN, pensive as he studies the paper. 
DOROTHEA (V.O.) (softly) Hey... 
He looks up, startled. 
HARRY What? 
LOOMIS Who is she? 
Harry can't help but smile to himself. 
LOOMIS I thought so.  'Night, Harry. 
Click.  Harry puts down the phone.  Glances at himself in the mirror.  Raises a rueful eyebrow. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT 
CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the theatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they file in. 
The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. He makes his way inside. 
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a conventional stage show.  Security people with walkie- talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely controlled hysteria. 
Harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit CURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea, already in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him. 
DOROTHEA I'm glad you could make it. 
Harry takes a seat beside her. 
HARRY Hey, this is a big deal for me. You know what seats like this cost in New York? 
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT 
Center-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for the opening of the show.  TECHNICIANS buzz around him like flies. 
SWANN Valentin! 
Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is waiting there. 
SWANN (irritated) Valentin! 
VALENTIN I'm here. 
SWANN The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who I think it is? 
Valentin nods. 
ON SWANN, his expression unreadable. 
SWANN He's young. 
MUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin hurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused. 
1ST TECHNICIAN (to Swann) Ready? 
SWANN Ready. 
Swann rises up into the flies. 
1ST TECHNICIAN How the fuck does he do that? 
2ND TECHNICIAN It's wires, man. 
1ST TECHNICIAN I never seen no wires. 
2ND TECHNICIAN (sarcastic) So what is it?  Magic? 
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT 
The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea, whose gaze is intent. 
The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride into mystery. 
SWANN (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen.  You are standing on the threshold of a miracle... 
A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the stage. 
The vortex BLAZES -- 
And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 
Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 
A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper. 
SWANN My friends ... come with me...into the Great Beyond. 
A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. 
The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly. 
ON HARRY and Dorothea. 
The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both? 
MILLER Psst! 
Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage. 
Butterfield enters. 
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT 
Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry examines the mechanism of the wheel. 
DOROTHEA (softly) Swann... 
A DOCTOR appears. 
DOCTOR I'm a doctor.  Let me through. 
The Doctor checks Swann's body. 
DOCTOR (to Dorothea) I'm sorry... 
Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the cable as he goes. 
WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT 
It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted and echoing. 
The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been taken. 
A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy FIGURE ducking away. 
HARRY Hey! 
He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and listens for movement. 
Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of wood and smashes it into Harry's face! 
Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket. 
MILLER Got you, fucker! 
Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. 
BUTTERFIELD Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed Swann? 
Harry is barely holding on to consciousness. 
HARRY You did. (a beat) Didn't you? 
BUTTERFIELD Why would I do that? 
HARRY Beats me. 
Butterfield is a foot from Harry now. 
BUTTERFIELD You don't have a clue what you're into, do you? 
HARRY Deep shit? 
Butterfield hits him. 
BUTTERFIELD Who did this? 
HARRY I told you -- 
Butterfield hits him again. 
BUTTERFIELD Who did this? 
HARRY (raises his hand) All right.  It was... 
Butterfield comes a little closer. 
HARRY (feigning a near collapse) ... it was... 
Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls -- literally -- rising as he does so. 
BUTTERFIELD Aah! 
Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 
He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW MECHANISM. 
Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 
-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 
Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet. 
HARRY Deep shit... 
HARRY (not a clue) Sure.  Vivovich. 
WILDER He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit. 
HARRY I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys. 
WILDER People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know? 
HARRY For what? 
WILDER For an introduction. 
HARRY Well... nobody. 
Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude. 
WILDER (magnanimously) You do now. 
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK 
The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. 
Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is knotting a newly-bought tie. 
HARRY I only wear ties for funerals. 
WILDER You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen. 
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT 
The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with illusionists' posters. 
Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms where illusionists are performing close-up magic for audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the stairs and towards the bar. 
HARRY Are they all in the business? 
WILDER It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation. 
Wilder points to a locked door. 
WILDER That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room. 
HARRY Have you been in? 
WILDER No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. (beat) He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer. 
CUT TO 
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT 
Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his 40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown, overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin, waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. 
In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group. 
VINOVICH It's more than entertainment. We're opening people's heads up.  Putting miracles back into their boring little lives. 
BILLY But they're fake miracles. 
VINOVICH Houdini believed he had spirit guides. 
HARRY You believe that? 
VINOVICH I think we walk a narrow path, between... between... 
HARRY Heaven and Hell? 
Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether he's being sarcastic or not. 
VINOVICH Trickery and divinity. 
HARRY Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real? 
VINOVICH No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists. 
HARRY So could you walk on water? 
VINOVICH (deadly serious) I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation. 
HARRY What about Swann's miracles? 
The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny smile. 
VINOVICH They weren't worth a damn. 
HARRY (goading) I heard he was the best. 
VINOVICH If he was so good why's he so dead? 
Vinovich begins to look suspicious. 
HARRY You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory. 
SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS. 
BACK TO: 
INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
HARRY sits up, shocked awake. 
HARRY Shit! 
He picks up the receiver. 
HARRY This is D'Amour. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall opposite the bed. 
DOROTHEA Harry... I know it's late. 
INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION 
There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and touch them. 
HARRY That's okay. 
As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed. 
DOROTHEA How did it go today? 
HARRY I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in. 
DOROTHEA (V.O.) They were jealous of him. 
HARRY (V.O.) Why?  Because he had you? 
BACK TO: 
INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN 
DOROTHEA He... didn't have me..  I told you- 
HARRY You didn't marry him for love. 
DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM 
She's a little uncomfortable now. 
HARRY So why did you marry him? 
DOROTHEA That's my business. Harry. 
HARRY Just curious. (a beat) Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix? (silence) Dorothea? 
DOROTHEA Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name. 
HARRY What about Jennifer Desiderio? 
DOROTHEA It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go. 
HARRY Okay.  I'll keep digging. 
DOROTHEA (uneasy) Yes.  You do that. 
She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks up the phone again. 
INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS. 
CUT WIDE:  The room is empty. 
EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of Quaid's Waiting Room. It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the locks. 
INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT 
Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS, Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the blood-spattered table: 
BUTTERFIELD (V.O.) If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. 
Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc. 
Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves. 
HARRY Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is? 
BILLY Nope. 
Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING. 
BILLY What did I tell you?  So fucking hokey. 
Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS. 
HARRY What have we got here? 
Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 
two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 
Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his sinews straining. 
HARRY Grab the files! 
Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a CLANG! 
BILLY Jesus! 
He slams the files down.  He's trembling. 
BILLY I could have lost my fucking hands. 
HARRY That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. (he studies the files) Which was presumably the idea. (a beat) These are about Nix. 
Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy. 
HARRY You go through these.  Go on! 
Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY -- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for that) - is NIX. 
HARRY Wait a minute... 
He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different colours. 
HARRY That's Butterfield... 
BILLY (points to nan in) doorway) And who's that? 
ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 
ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure. 
HARRY At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix. 
Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH of another man's HEAD. 
BILLY Take a look at this. 
HARRY (looking at it) A Nix specialty? 
Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series.  We glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating DARKNESS. 
BILLY I don't know any of these tricks... 
Harry studies the etchings. 
HARRY (a slow burn) Maybe they're not tricks. 
BILLY (mystified) I mean, there's no instructions-- (realizes what Harry said) What do you mean, they're not tricks? 
HARRY What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between -- 
BILLY Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time. 
HARRY That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew. 
BILLY Knew what? 
Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 
Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed. 
Harry takes out his gun. 
Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry goes after the apparition. 
The TRACK is completely silent. 
Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up, its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 
It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who backs away. 
BILLY Harry! 
HARRY Jennifer Desiderio, for one. (he watches her for a response) She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon. 
Dorothea can't disguise her distress. 
DOROTHEA Oh Christ. 
HARRY (a beat) Why don't you tell me the truth? 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT- 
Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table. 
HARRY Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal? 
DOROTHEA It was more than that, I think. 
HARRY He was the real thing, right? 
DOROTHEA Swann said he could do stuff, yes. 
HARRY Stuff? 
DOROTHEA He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire. 
HARRY He taught all this to Swann? 
DOROTHEA Some or it. 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT 
Valentin is listening at the door. 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT- 
HARRY So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? (Dorothea nods) And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions. 
DOROTHEA I told you -- 
HARRY Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours. 
DOROTHEA No. 
HARRY You said you weren't with him for love. 
DOROTHEA I wasn't. 
HARRY What then? 
DOROTHEA I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it. 
HARRY He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he? 
Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass. 
DOROTHEA Shit! 
They are very close to each other. 
HARRY (reassuring) It's okay. 
DOROTHEA No it isn't.  You can't help me. 
HARRY (tenderly) I'm here, aren't I? 
He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard. 
HARRY Nothing's going to happen to you. 
DOROTHEA (seductive) Nothing? 
HARRY (smiles) Nothing you don't want. 
They kiss again, passionately. 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT 
Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses to the phone and dials. 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm, flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor. 
It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling. 
INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT 
Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The palms churn against the night sky... 
INTERCUT 
Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies of Harry and Dorothea. 
He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and pulls. 
Inside, Swann's corpse. 
VALENTIN Are you satisfied now? 
HARRY No. 
Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger into the corpse's mouth. 
DOROTHEA Harry? 
HARRY It's all right.  It's not hurting... 
He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw.  It cracks -- 
-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex. 
HARRY ...plaster doesn't bleed. 
He tosses the jaw to Valentin. 
HARRY (to Dorothea) It looks like you're not a widow after all. 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT 
Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea binds Harry's hand. 
HARRY You rigged the illusion to fail, right? 
VALENTIN Yes. 
HARRY You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes? 
VALENTIN Yes. 
HARRY And then... because I was getting too close to something -- (at Dorothea) --or someone, you called Swann 
VALENTIN I tried to pay you off. 
HARRY Was that Swann's idea? 
VALENTIN No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after. 
HARRY Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake. 
VALENTIN Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter? 
ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe Nix's resurrection is plausible. 
HARRY I want to see Swann face to face. 
VALENTIN Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over? 
DOROTHEA What about me? 
VALENTIN Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann. 
A beat. 
HARRY (to Dorothea) Maybe Valentin's right.  We should let it alone. 
A BELL starts to TOLL- 
HARRY (con't.) He went to all that trouble to be dead.  Maybe we should let him stay that way. 
The TOLLING carries over into 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY 
WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom, to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 
Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden) from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of condolesence. 
EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY 
The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces. 
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY 
The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. 
Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann "died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage. 
EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY 
THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee down into the street. 
1ST WORKER Watch out! 
On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. We don't see who. 
SWANN (V.O.) They'll never find out. 
Harry looks up. 
Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of concentration. 
HARRY Look, Ma, no wires. 
SWANN You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. 
HARRY How the fuck do you do that? 
SWANN Now I'm going to have to kill you. 
HARRY I don't think so.  You need me alive. 
SWANN Why?  So you can fuck my wife? 
Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun. 
HARRY Be careful.  Funerals make me trigger-happy. 
Swann stops, inches from the ground. 
HARRY You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick. 
SWANN Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned. 
HARRY Or murdered, like Nix. 
SWANN He deserved it. 
HARRY Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it? 
SWANN I did it for Dorothea. 
HARRY Oh yeah? 
SWANN Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her. 
Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his posturing, is afraid. 
HARRY So Nix won't come looking for her? 
SWANN It's me betrayed him. 
HARRY And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix. 
SWANN (despairing) I don't know what else to do. 
HARRY Help me. 
On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear. 
HARRY Listen.  If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god. And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are. And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history. 
ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea. 
EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. SNAKES seethe out of the open car door. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON 
We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 
We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix, floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 
Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath, Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman grins. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him. 
INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap brandy. 
SWANN Is this the best brandy you've got? 
CASHIER If that's what's on the shelves. 
Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air. 
SWANN Can you change a thousand for me? 
CASHIER (amazed) You're shittin' me. 
HARRY Can we go? 
SWANN No. (a beat) At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit... 
HARRY And you believed him? 
SWANN I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth. (he looks at Harry) Are you ready for that? 
Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann. 
SWANN Hey! 
Harry drinks. 
SWANN Thought not. 
EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT 
PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front door. 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT 
Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom. 
HARRY Dorothea? 
Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below. 
SWANN She's not here. 
Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet. 
HARRY Did she know where Nix was buried? 
SWANN No. 
HARRY Who else did?  Did Valentin? 
SWANN Yes. 
HARRY Jesus! 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of stars. 
INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT 
Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. Dorothea is handcuffed. 
He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on, confounded. 
BUTTERFIELD Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free. 
DOROTHEA Why did you wait so long? 
BUTTERFIELD I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time. 
DOROTHEA And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years? 
BUTTERFIELD If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not. 
DOROTHEA What is he? 
BUTTERFIELD Maybe he'll show you. 
ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes. 
EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house. Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES. 
There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house. 
It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. We DRIFT towards the front door. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room. 
Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked ears and scalps. 
And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS... 
NORMAN He will come!  He will come! He will come! 
EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT 
Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. 
The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness, illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. 
ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole, watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him. 
INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not to help? 
HARRY (V.O.) Swann! 
He decides.  Gets out. 
EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT 
Swann goes to the graveside, terrified. 
HARRY Give me a hand.  I got Valentin. 
Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and lay him in the blaze of the headlamps. 
VALENTIM He's got Dorothea. 
SWANN And Nix? 
VALENTIN Him too. 
HARRY We've got to get you to a hospital. 
VALENTIN Don't bother. 
HARRY Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already. 
VALENTIN I'm sorry, D'Amour... 
HARRY What about? 
VALENTIN ... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more. 
Valentin dies. 
HARRY (despairing) ... no... 
SWANN He's better off this way. 
HARRY (furious) Nobody's better off this wav! 
SWANN You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour. 
He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into Nix's grave. 
SWANN That's where we're all going. 
HARRY In my time, and nobody else's. 
ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS. 
EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The house is silent now. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT 
We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum. 
ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing WHITE now. 
BUTTERFIELD Do you wish him to be amongst us? 
CULTISTS Yes... 
BUTTERFIELD Will you come to him on your knees? 
CULTISTS Yes... 
BUTTERFIELD Be ready. 
Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor sharp pieces of GLASS. 
ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT 
HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 
ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision. 
DOROTHEA Listen.  You've got everything you want.  You don't need me. .. 
A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude. 
BUTTERFIELD No, but he will.  After what you did to him. 
He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth. 
BUTTERFIELD He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS that. 
HARRY (to Dorothea) I've got to help him. 
DOROTHEA You can't. 
HARRY Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot. 
A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly -- 
Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's still very much alive. 
BUTTERFIELD Bastard! 
He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the Passageway. 
Nix has Swann in a bear-hug. 
NIX Will you help me? 
A beat.  Then Swann nods. 
SWANN Yes. 
Nix lets him go. 
NIX You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to. 
SWANN Yes. 
NIX But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was. 
SWANN Yes. 
Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange. Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns. 
NIX Wait... you still feel something for that bitch? 
SWANN No! 
NIX Liar! 
Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall, pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground. 
NIX Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!? 
With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them, they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs, one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards Dorothea. 
NIX She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you! 
He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground, broken. 
SWANN Harry! 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 
The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues. 
SWANN (V.O.) Harry!  Stop him! 
Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and running off into the darkness. 
Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe, and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 
Harry looks down at the body.  Then -- 
NIX (V.O.) Where is she? 
Harry turns. 
Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's body as he comes at Harry! 
NIX Where did she go? 
Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful. 
Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's temples.  As before, there's no blood. 
NIX You've got Swann's disease. You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right. Wrong! 
His fingers slide all the way in! 
HARRY Oh God! 
Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him. 
NIX Tell me where she is... and I'll make it go away... 
Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare. 
HARRY'S P.O.V. 
The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 
Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE. 
NIX (to Harry) What are you looking at? 
ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room and now slips inside. 
ON HARRY, staring up at Nix. 
ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her. 
HARRY (points to his brow) There... there! 
ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 
ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 
The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees, BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE used to be. 
ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the wall, shaking. 
DOROTHEA Harry? 
HARRY I'm okay.  I'm okay. 
Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her. 
HARRY'S P.O.V. 
The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they embrace. 
Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him -- 
-- it isn't over. 
One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his forehead -- 
NIX One... last... illusion... 
-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of the bullet wound. 
DOROTHEA Oh my God. 
Harry and Dorothea start to get up... 
Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS, stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an utterly inhuman SHRIEK! 
SWANN (V.O.) ... D'Amour... 
Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room. Swann is on the threshold. 
Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 
He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into the Meditation Room. 
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT 
The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is backed towards it by Nix. 
When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is DEMONIACAL. 
NIX I am the purest of the pure.  I am the darkest of the dark... 
Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix. 
SWANN Harry.  You can't kill him. 
Harry crouches beside Swann. 
HARRY (whispers) He did something with the ground. 
SWANN Yes? 
HARRY Can you do it? 
SWANN I don't know. 
HARRY Try. 
ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now. 
NIX (V.O.) I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond Hell.

Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over the edge of the pit.

EXT JERSEY CITY- DAY 
Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON: 
INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY 
An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners... 
MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR. Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face. 
INT OFFICE- DAY 
A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen. MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink- stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have time for office parties, she's working. 
Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle. 
CASS I'm working, Stewart. 
STEWART Come on, take a break. (enticing) I've got Kahlua... 
Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head. Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering: 
CASS Cassidy Daley. Talk to me. 
JIMMY (O.S.) It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me. 
CASS Depends on what you got. 
JIMMY (O.S.) I've got a confirmed place and time. 
Cass is on her feet, excited. 
CASS I love you! So, when? Where? 
JIMMY (O.S.) You think I'm gonna say this shit over the phone? I could get killed. Just meet me at the usual place. Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost an extra hundred. 
CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff. 
INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY 
Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels: 
STEWART Where ya going? 
CASS Hooters. I go there for the hot wings. 
STEWART Please. Nobody goes there for the hot wings. You got a tip. 
CASS You got a hundred bucks on you? 
Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's. 
STEWART Now are you gonna let me in on it? 
CASS Sorry. No can do. I have to protect my source. 
STEWART You know what? We need to talk about our relationship. 
CASS We don't have a relationship. We made out 3 years ago in the copy room. I was drunk. I was broken- hearted. I would have made out with the xerox machine. 
STEWART Yes, but you made out with me. 
CASS I have to go. 
She exits. He shouts after her: 
STEWART I want in on that story! 
EXT STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAY 
Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves: TRACKING A STORY... 
EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY 
MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK CORNER OF THE LOT... 
INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY 
RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB. 
INT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON 
The man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car. 
DWIGHT There you are, you dipshit. 
He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away from the curb, tailing the Cadillac. 
EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON 
MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a Broadway musical. 
A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing. 
RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst. 
Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd impatiently. 
Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for: 
MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who does a double-take. 
MILO Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you fucking ding-dong. 
Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM. 
DWIGHT We have to stop meeting this way. 
MILO Not now, Dwight. 
DWIGHT You owe my boss money. 
MILO (LAUGHING) Hey, I owe everybody money. 
Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up, gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch. 
The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL. 
All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for: 
MILO (BEAMING) I am so happy you did that. 
Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears: 
BOY That man is killing Rudolph! 
SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over- zealous) steps forward: 
GELMAN Release the reindeer! 
Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles: 
GELMAN Hands behind your head, asshole! 
MILO Take it easy, skippy, I'm just doing my job. 
Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes. 
GELMAN Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't you get a real job? 
MILO So I can be like you patrol boys and sit around all day with my thumb up my ass? 
Gelman turns bright red. 
GELMAN What did you just say? 
Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes one look at Milo and laughs. 
BOBBY Milo Boyd. I shoulda known. 
GELMAN Sarg, you know this asshole? 
BOBBY Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used to be one of us. 
RACK TO- DWIGHT, NOSE BLEEDING, MELTING BACK INTO SHADOW... 
EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER 
Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face. 
BOBBY Look, Milo, I know this is a tough time of year for you... 
MILO This isn't a tough time of year for me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't love Christmas? 
BOBBY ...and I try to be sensitive to your situation... 
EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING 
Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches. 
SID You gonna give me a hand, or just stand there killing your liver? 
MILO Is that a trick question? 
Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs part of the tree. 
SID So I told her, fine, I'd handle Xmas this year. I mean, what's to handle? You buy a tree, some gifts, cook a ham, hang some lights. An idiot could do it. 
MILO Well, we'll soon find out. 
Sid checks him out. 
SID You have plans for the holiday? 
MILO The usual. 
SID Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your fist through a wall? 
MILO Jealous? 
The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and Sid pulls out a small hand saw. 
SID Then forget it. 
MILO Forget what? 
SID I've got an open bond, but your thing sounds like more fun. I'll give it to Doug instead. 
Sid starts hacking away at the tree. 
MILO Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the fuck. I want the job, I'm in the hole. 
SID You're always in the hole. 
MILO What's your point? 
SID (SIGHING) The truth is, I'm not sure you're the right person for this job. It could be a total disaster. On the other hand, when one friend sees another friend stagnating in his own filth, he has to do something, right? 
MILO Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna shower. 
Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in. Phew. Sid slams the back shut. 
SID Ok. But remember: you asked for it. 
He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick look. A second look. A third. 
TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT. 
MILO No. 
SID Yes. 
MILO No. 
SID Yes. 
MILO No. 
SID Are we done yet? 
MILO Is this a joke? Because if it is, I'm gonna have to kill you. 
SID It's not a joke. 
MILO She got arrested? And then she jumped bail? 
SID Apparently the whole thing started with some reckless driving, and ended with her assaulting a police officer. 
Milo gives him a questioning look. 
SID (EXPLAINING) She bit him. 
Milo snorts. 
MILO Yeah. That sounds like her. But here's my question: why the hell did you post her bail? 
SID Hey, I know she dumped you... 
MILO Whoa. She did not "dump me". 
SID (QUICKLY) Ok, whatever, I... 
MILO No, not "whatever". I dumped her. 
A freshly showered and shaved Milo packs for the job, singing at the top of his lungs: 
MILO Luck be a lady... 
He puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it: MACE, PEPPER SPRAY, TASER GUN, HANDCUFFS... 
MILO Toooo....NIIIIIGHT! 
He stares at his collection and smiles: 
MILO (to his weapons) I told you this day would come. 
Milo zips up the bag. 
EXT MILO'S APT- DAY 
Milo tosses the duffle in the backseat. He pulls out the job sheet and inspects it. CASS' CELL PHONE NUMBER IS LISTED. Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. He glances around and sees a PAY PHONE ACROSS THE WAY. 
Pockets his cell phone and crosses to the pay phone. 
EXT STREET- DAY 
CASS, expensive leather jacket, boots, dark glasses, trying to be incognito. Hurrying towards her car when she sees SOME COPS EXIT A DINER up ahead. She slips into a doorway, waiting for them to pass, when her phone rings. 
She checks it ("PAY PHONE") and answers: 
CASS Jimmy? 
SPLIT-SCREEN 
Nope, NOT JIMMY. Milo doesn't speak. Cass listens for a moment. She can hear breathing. What the fuck? An evil grin crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale. 
Milo takes a step forward. Cass takes a step back. Milo LUNGES and CASS DROPS HER PHONE AND BOLTS OUT OF FRAME. 
EXT PAY PHONE- DAY 
Milo smirks at the receiver. 
MILO You better run, you crazy bitch. 
INT SID'S BAIL BOND'S- DAY 
Sid shuts his door, then speaks into his phone, low: 
SID Yeah. He took the job. But if this thing goes bad, I'm blaming you. 
He hangs up. 
EXT STREET- DAY 
Milo sips from a coffee cup and watches: 
MILO'S POV- THE FRONT DOOR OF A FANCY BROWNSTONE. A woman with a toy poodle emerges from the building, struggling with the heavy door.. 
EXT BROWNSTONE- DAY 
Milo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her: 
MILO Nice dog. Very compact. 
The woman exits and Milo enters. 
CLOSE ON- PANNING SHOT PAST DOORS: 301, 302, 303... 
INT APT HALLWAY- DAY 
Milo stops in front of 303, and knocks on the door. 
MILO Candygram. 
No answer. Milo glances around, then works the lock... 
INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- CONTINUOUS 
Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out. The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV. 
And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS, PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a successful and dedicated journalist. 
Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug. 
MILO Whoops. 
EXT APARTMENT/BACK DOOR- DAY 
Cass enters frame. Nervous looks all around as she tries the knob. Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. She hesitates. 
INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY 
CASS (recovering quickly) Oh. No. I'm looking for him. 
LANDLADY Under the sofa? 
CASS Maybe you can help. I'm his girlfriend. 
LANDLADY (SKEPTICAL) You're LaKeesha? 
Oh. Whoops. 
CASS Yes. That's my name. LaKeesha. 
LANDLADY Maybe I should call the cops. 
CASS Wait! Ok, look: Jimmy's in trouble. 
LANDLADY What kind of trouble? Money trouble? Drug trouble? (lower) Sex- change trouble? 
"Sex-change trouble"? 
CASS Something like that. All I know is, he's missing. 
LANDLADY I've had a lousy week, too. My cousin Linda fell off a cruise ship. 
CASS Oh. I'm sorry. 
LANDLADY Hey. A grown woman outta know how to swim. 
CASS I hear ya. Anyway. Mind if I take a quick look around? 
The landlady thinks this over. 
LANDLADY Jimmy's behind on his rent. I bet his girlfriend would want to take care of that. 
ON CASS- Dammit. 
CASS I bet she would. 
INT CASS' APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY 
Milo explains, as he pokes around: 
MILO The thing is, Stu, she'll make you think she's interested in you, when really all she's interested in is the case you're working on, because she wants to launch her big hot- shot career. 
It is just dawning on Stewart: 
STEWART Wait a second: you're Milo. She talks about you all the time. 
MILO (immediately interested) Really? 
STEWART Oh yeah, dude. She hates you. 
Milo turns an angry red. 
MILO Oh, she hates me? 
STEWART Yeah. She says you're the most selfish, immature, stubborn... 
MILO (INTERRUPTING) I'm selfish? I'm immature? You know what? Forget it. I'm not even gonna dignify this with...whatever. 
STEWART Hey, man, I'm on your team. 
MILO No you're not, Geraldo. I don't allow reporters on my team. 
Milo tosses some papers around on her desk furiously. 
MILO And for the record: I'm the one who hates her. Just so that's clear. 
He picks up the phone and checks the last dialed number: it comes up "CAESAR'S CASINO". Milo smiles. 
MILO (to himself) That figures. Run home to mommy. 
Milo erases the number, then heads for the door. 
MILO Well, nice meeting ya, Stu. 
STEWART Wait, where are you going? 
MILO I'm going to pick up your girlfriend. But don't worry, if she ever gets out of jail, I'm sure you'll be very happy together. 
Milo exits. Stewart hurries to the phone and checks it, but Milo erased the number. Shit. Stewart RACES to the window. 
STEWART'S POV: MILO EXITING THE BUILDING, HEADED FOR HIS CAR. 
INT JIMMY'S APARTMENT- DAY 
Cass is about to give up when she spots, peeking out from the bookshelf, A PLAIN ENVELOPE MARKED "CASSIDY DALEY". She slips the envelope into her pocket just as the landlady appears: 
LOIS How dare you...after what you did to my baby... 
Lois bursts into tears and collapses into Milo's arms. 
MILO Ok. What say we do this inside? 
INT CAESAR'S CASINO DRESSING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER 
Men running around in gowns and feather boas. A completely recovered Lois sits by a make-up mirror, adjusting a wig. Stuck to her mirror is a PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, SMILING. Milo gives the photo a dirty look. 
MILO What happened to the pirate show? 
LOIS I got sick of it. Now I'm a female impersonator. 
MILO But...you are female. 
LOIS That's why I'm so good at it. Help me with this. 
She stands and wiggles into an evening gown. Milo struggles with the zipper. 
MILO Where is she, Lois? I need to talk to her. 
LOIS Oh, Milo, where did it all go wrong? Do you have any idea what it means to waste a woman's child- bearing years? It's criminal. Every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like sailors abandoning a sinking ship. I mean, I know you were mad about that article... 
MILO I wasn't mad about that article. In fact: what article? 
LOIS Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be a strong independent woman on the outside, but on the inside she's just a girl who wants to be protected and loved by her man. What happened between the two of you devastated her. 
MILO Devastated her right to the top. 
LOIS (BEAMING) She has done well, hasn't she? (MORE) 
LOIS (cont'd) I must admit, it makes me proud to think that my little girl, whose only friend growing up was an imaginary orphan with a tin leg named Leslie, now gets invited to tour the White House... 
Milo's jaw hits the floor. 
MILO She got to tour the White House? 
Now he really wants to take Cass to jail. 
MILO Tell me where she is, Lois. 
LOIS Oh, who knows. She was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, said she was on the biggest story of her career. Said she was going somewhere to think. 
Milo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face. 
EXT CAESAR'S CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON 
Stewart has finally found a parking space, and is exiting his car when he sees Milo come out and jump into the Cadillac. 
STEWART Dammit. 
Stewart hurries back into his car. 
EXT ATLANTIC CITY RACETRACK- AFTERNOON 
Stands mobbed with people, horses galloping down the track, dust rising in their wake. MOVING IN ON... 
EXT STANDS- AFTERNOON 
Surrounded by people cheering, CASS IS HARD AT WORK. Notebook open, phone to ear, lap holding the plain envelope, ripped open, contents exposed: A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS: "ATLANTIC CITY. XMAS EVE. SPARROW." 
She has underlined "Sparrow" and made a list: "Person's name? Company? Hotel? Casino?" 
CASS (into phone) No one with that name? What about a casino? Nothing? Thanks. 
She clicks over to an incoming call, "PRIVATE CALLER": 
CASS Jimmy? 
SPLIT-SCREEN: 
STEWART, at the mobbed track entrance, lost and frustrated: 
STEWART No, who's Jimmy? 
CASS Look, Stewart, I'm busy. 
STEWART Ok. (casually) Where are you, by the way? I mean, exactly. 
CASS I'm in Miami, if you must know. I'm on the beach building a sand castle and drinking from a coconut... 
Someone taps her shoulder. She glances up and sees: MILO, SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HER, GRINNING. She slowly closes her phone, not bothering to say goodbye. 
MILO Hello, Cass. 
CASS Hello, Milo. 
CASS Chicken shits. 
Cass marches back over to Milo. 
CASS Ok, look: let's talk about this. 
MILO Ok. 
With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS INCHES APART. 
Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels weird. Confused. 
CASS (UNCOMFORTABLE) Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we should... 
Suddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR. 
CASS Hey, wait a minute! 
He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid. 
CUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels: FURIOUS: 
CASS (O.S.) Bastard. 
CHIRON: "2:00 PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 43 HOURS TO GO". 
And immediately: A PHONE RINGS. 
CASS (O.S.) Great. Perfect timing. 
A match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles for her phone. Trying to sound professional: 
CASS Cassidy Daley. 
SPLIT-SCREEN: 
CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face. PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER HIS CHIN. 
JIMMY It's me. Jimmy. 
CASS (exhaling with relief) Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were dead. 
JIMMY Don't be silly. (hurrying on) Listen: you didn't happen to go to my place and find that envelope I left, did you? 
CASS I did, but I don't really get it, what's "Sparrow"? 
JIMMY It doesn't matter. Did you tell anyone else about this story? 
CASS Are you kidding? You think I want to share a story like this? 
JIMMY Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there is no story. I made the whole thing up. So you should just drop it... 
CASS Uh-uh, no way are you backing out on me now, Jimmy. This story is way too good... 
Mahler nudges Jimmy. 
JIMMY (QUICKLY) Where are you? 
CASS I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex- husband's car. Long story. More importantly, where are you? 
JIMMY I'm... 
CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE. 
ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh: 
CASS Jimmy? Hello? 
Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS: 
MILO (O.S.) Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la laaaa... 
INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON 
Now Milo really is the happiest man alive. He pulls out his cell phone, dials: 
SPLIT-SCREEN: 
Teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers: 
TERESA Sid's Bail Bonds. 
MILO Guess who's in my trunk? 
TERESA Is that some sort of perverted innuendo? Who is this? 
MILO Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's me. Put Sid on. 
...and she BITES him. 
MILO OW... 
Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE. 
CASS NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle! 
Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She looks at him and she starts laughing too. 
CASS Dirty fighter. 
MILO Me? I'm the dirty fighter? 
They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as they look at each other. 
CASS Should we...I don't know...hug, or something? 
MILO Sure. What the hell. 
He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK. HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS. 
CASS Hey. I had to try, right? 
MILO Get in the car. 
INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON 
They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos as they head out of Atlantic City. 
CASS Your windshield's cracked. 
MILO Thanks, Captain Obvious. 
Cass turns to inspect him more closely. 
CASS And you look like shit, Milo. What have you been doing, sleeping on the floor? 
Milo has been sleeping on the floor. 
MILO I enjoy sleeping on the floor. Matter of fact, I love sleeping on the floor. I love everything about my life. Great job, good friends, hot girlfriend... 
CASS You have a girlfriend? 
MILO (he does not) Yes I do. 
Cass is skeptical: 
CASS Really? What's her name? 
MILO (the first name that pops into his head:) Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to cook pasta for me and perform strip- teases. 
CASS Wow. Is she missing a chromosome? 
MILO Oh, she has all her chromosomes, believe you me. 
Cass thinks this over, then counters: 
CASS Well, my life is great, too. 
MILO I can tell. You and Stewart make a great couple, by the way. You and me made a terrible couple. But you two? Like peas in a pod. 
About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this: 
CASS You know what I like about Stewart? 
MILO I can't imagine. 
CASS He's not you. 
MILO Not even on his best day. 
CASS Or his worst. 
MILO I'll bet he has a lot of those. 
CASS Still betting, huh? 
MILO You can't win if you don't play. 
CASS Or, in your case, even if you do. 
He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting. 
MILO I win all the time. 
CASS Really? I hadn't noticed. 
MILO (to the dealer) Hit me. 
CASS I'd really like to. 
The dealer deals the cards. 
DEALER Dealer wins. 
CASS Nice going, master. 
Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells like an ashtray) appears: 
WAITRESS And for the couple over here? 
MILO (QUICKLY) We're not a couple. 
CASS (just as quick) Why would you think we were a couple? 
MILO We used to be together. Back when I was young and foolish. 
CASS And I was confused. 
MILO And I was slumming. 
CASS And I was drunk. 
The waitress looks back and forth between them. 
WAITRESS (BORED) Great story. I have to get back to work now. 
MILO Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating. 
The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he has lost more money. 
MILO (under his breath) Son of a bitch. 
Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer: 
CASS Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom is in the hospital. 
Milo perks up. 
MILO Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par? 
CASS She might be really sick. That's why I had to jump bail. 
MILO (overly sincere) Taking care of her, huh? Putting aside your career for a loved one? Golly, that's so you. 
"Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing: 
CASS You've already been to see her. 
MILO Impressive. No wonder you got all those awards. So lemme guess: the real reason you jumped bail is cause you're on a story. 
Cass narrows her eyes: 
CASS Stewart. Stewart told you. 
MILO (CAUGHT) I would have figured it out on my own, trust me. 
CASS I wouldn't trust you if you were the last man alive. 
MILO You think about that much? Me being the last man alive? Am I naked in this fantasy? 
Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story. 
CASS Ok, you're right. I'm on a story. A very important story. It just so happens that I'm possibly about to uncover a whole ring of dirty cops. 
Milo snorts. 
CASS What? 
MILO Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop" thing kind of old? Maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in. Like internet porn. Or lesbians. 
CASS I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be big. And here's what I'm willing to do (magnanimous): I'm willing to credit you in the article. 
MILO Oh, sure, like you credited me in the 13th Street Article? 
Cass stares at him. 
CASS Why on earth would I have credited you? I worked my ass off for that story. 
MILO That's one way of putting it. 
CASS What's that supposed to mean? 
MILO Forget it. I don't want to be in your article. In fact, I would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in any way associated with one of your lousy articles... 
Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out. 
MILO Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to me. 
CASS (freaking out) Speed up! 
MILO Would you just calm down for a second and... 
CASS NO!! 
Cass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The car LEAPS forward... 
MILO Jesus christ... 
Milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle for the wheel. THE CAR DOES A CRAZY ZIG-ZAG BACK AND FORTH... 
MILO LISTEN, YOU MANIAC... 
CASS MILO... 
MILO ...LET GO... 
CASS MILO... 
MILO ...NO ONE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU... 
CASS MILO!!! 
She points past him. Milo turns to see MAHLER DRIVING BESIDE THEM, GUN POINTED AT MILO'S HEAD. 
MILO SHIT!!! 
They both duck as Mahler starts firing. GLASS SHATTERS ALL AROUND THEM. MILO PULLS OUT HIS GUN and STARTS FIRING BACK... 
EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING 
BOTH CARS VEER WILDLY FROM LANE TO LANE AS MILO AND MAHLER FIRE AT EACH OTHER... 
CLOSE ON- THE CADILLAC'S REAR TIRE, AS IT GOES FLAT FROM A BULLET... 
INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING 
MILO GRIPS THE WHEEL AS THE CAR STARTS TO DRAG AND LOSE GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited and frightened at the same time. 
Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR. Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE. 
EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING 
The cadillac SPEEDS away, leaving Mahler's car behind. 
EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING 
The Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed, EXCITED: 
CASS I told you they were trying to kill me! 
MILO Yeah, well, no one's killing you until I get you to jail. 
Cass whips her head around to look at him: 
CASS You're still taking me to jail? But it's the cops who are after me. 
MILO First of all: that guy was not a cop. Second of all, we just left him unconscious in a ditch. You'll be fine. 
CASS But...this is important! This is my job! 
MILO And this...(pointing between them) is my job. 
CASS Milo, you don't understand what's going on! 
Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up. 
MILO I'll lay it out for you: some loser with a minor sheet calls you up and says, hey, I've got a big story for you, you interested? It'll only cost you a couple hundred bucks, and I'll tip you onto some criminal activity, it's your chance to expose some bad guys and write the story of your life. Then the moron gets himself caught, he's probably in cold storage somewhere, and now you think the bad guys are after you. (beat) See? I get it. I just don't care. 
Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and heads back around to the driver's seat. 
Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy. 
CASS (CASUALLY) If only I knew exactly when and where this deal was going down. Course, if I can't figure out that part, then you definitely can't figure out that part, because we both know I'm much smarter than you. 
Milo flinches, then forces a laugh. 
MILO Please. My brain can dance circles around your brain. 
CASS I don't even know what that means. 
MILO Case closed. 
SID You are so full of shit. You don't want your job back. You just want to prove you're smarter than she is. 
MILO (instantly heated) I am smarter than she is. I would have cracked that 13th Street case way before she did if she hadn't... 
SID ...cheated, right, I know, you've told me a million times. Did it ever occur to you that a normal couple wouldn't compete the way you guys do in the first place? 
Sid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute shopper. They both reach for the toy. 
MILO This from the man currently trying to prove to his wife he can handle Xmas. 
SID (instantly heated) I can handle Xmas! 
Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper. 
MILO Just..trust me, Ok? 
SID Do I have a choice? 
MILO Nope. 
Milo hangs up and gets in the car. 
EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING 
The cadillac pulls a U-turn and HEADS BACK TOWARDS ATLANTIC CITY. 
CHIRON: "6:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 39 HOURS TO GO." 
MILO (O.S.) So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve... 
EXT HOTDOG STAND- EVENING 
Milo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next to him, handcuffed. 
MILO ...so what exactly are these dirty cops supposed to be doing? 
CASS Stealing evidence from property rooms. Then destroying it, for the right price. 
Milo stares. 
CASS What? 
MILO Nothing. It's just...it's a good idea. If it weren't, you know. Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan is to catch them red-handed before they can destroy the evidence, then write an expose for the paper and win yourself another big award. 
CASS Something like that. 
MILO Only, you don't know what Sparrow is. (thinking) Could be a nickname. Or the place where the evidence is stashed. Or a code word of some kind. But the guy who knows has gone missing, and you think the dirty cops got a hold of him. 
CASS (NODDING) When Jimmy called earlier, someone else was there. And they disconnected the call. 
Milo is staring at her. 
MILO So we find your source, we find the dirty cops. Gimme your phone. 
She hands it to him. Milo checks the record of incoming calls and smiles. 
CASS What? 
BOBBY (O.S.) Milo! Merry Xmas! 
SPLIT-SCREEN: 
EXT PADDY WAGON- EVENING 
Bobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of hookers being loaded into a van: 
BOBBY Here's one: why did the snowman pull down his pants? Cause he heard the snowblower was coming! 
MILO Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor. 
BOBBY Anything. 
MILO I need an address to go with a phone number. But I need it ASAP. Kinda got a guy on my tail... 
EXT GARAGE- EVENING 
A tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat: 
TOW TRUCK DRIVER The garage is closed for the night. Guess you'll have to wait til tomorrow. 
Mahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his seat. 
MAHLER Guess not. 
Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and BOOTS him out of the cab. 
EXT HIGHWAY- EVENING 
INT HALLWAY- EVENING 
Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK. 
MILO (LOUD) Godammit. Son of a bitch. 
The maid peeks out into the hall. 
MILO (to Cass) This is like the third card they've given me... 
CASS (playing along) Take it easy, honey... 
MILO Don't tell me to take it easy, now we have to go all the way downstairs again... 
Cass looks pleadingly at the maid. 
MAID What's the name? 
MILO Davenport. Room 2505. 
The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR. 
MILO You're an angel. 
Milo and Cass go inside. 
INT ROOM 2505- EVENING 
Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his heels. All is silent. 
CASS (WHISPERING) Wait a second: where's my gun? 
MILO (SAME) I don't know. Where is your gun? 
CASS I don't have one. 
MILO Then you've answered your own question. 
Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve. 
CASS Come on, give me something. You've got, like, a million weapons in the jacket. 
She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away. 
MILO Hey. These are not toys. You can't just give them to someone and have them know how to use them. 
CASS I seem to remember doing just fine with your taser gun. 
They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM. 
No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN KICKS THE DOOR IN... 
INT HALLWAY- EVENING 
Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the elevators... 
INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS 
Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room. The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom and peers in: EMPTY. 
Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees spots on the rug: 
CASS Oh, god, is that blood? 
MILO Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door. 
CASS I'm just trying to... 
MILO This could be a crime scene. There are clues all over this room that only a trained eye can find. And as I seem to recall, you were the one who was unable to figure this out by herself. 
Oooh. Cass grits her teeth. 
CASS (under her breath) He is unbelievable. 
MILO Who are you talking to, your imaginary friend Leslie? 
CASS (BLUSHING) Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary friends, despite what my mother believes. 
MILO Whatever. You wait by the door. And I'll handle this. 
CASS (PISSED) Fine. 
She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE. 
CASS So you're saying you don't want my help. 
MILO I'm saying I don't need your help. 
BOBBY Milo, don't fuck around with this. If there are dirty cops in the house, we all have a problem. So do me a favor: get off the strip, find somewhere to lie low and wait for my call. 
EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING 
The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly, dangerous Odd Couple. 
An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT. Dwight snatches the photo from Ray. 
DWIGHT Yeah, that's him. 
RAY Who's the chick? 
DWIGHT Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they can't be far. 
It's true. They aren't too far. They are: 
EXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING 
A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees, "Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door. 
CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO." 
The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic... 
CASS (O.S.) Ok. Kill me now. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago. 
MILO I'm sorry, it's the only place I know off the strip. 
CASS I'm not going in. What if they remember us? 
MILO They won't remember us. Why would they remember us? Just...try to act normal. 
INT LUXURY B&B- EVENING 
A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile: 
DAWN Can I help you? (realizing) Wait, it can't be... 
She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, DRINKING CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING. 
DAWN (to the back room) Edmund, come quick! 
A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and clasps both hands to his chest. 
EDMUND Be still my beating heart. 
MILO (LOW) Looks like they remember us. 
CASS (SAME) Ya think? 
EDMUND What a lovely surprise. It's been, what, 3 years? 
Milo and Cass both try to downplay: 
MILO Has it? 
CASS I don't really remember... 
DAWN (REALIZING) And you came back! To celebrate your anniversary! 
CASS Oh, no. No, no... 
EDMUND What an honor for us! 
CASS Actually, we're not... 
DAWN You know what? In light of this special special occasion: it's on the house! 
Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM. 
MILO Honey? Can I talk to you? 
He pulls her slightly aside. 
MILO (LOW) You have any money? 
CASS (SAME) No, as you recall, I gave you all my money at the blackjack table... (realizing) You blew all the money! 
MILO Hey! I would have won it back if someone hadn't tasered me in the bathroom! 
CASS So. Use a credit card. 
MILO Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours. 
CASS Mine's max'd too. (off his look) What, I like to shop. 
MILO Feels good, doesn't it? 
CASS Feels fantastic. 
MILO A platonic relationship. Working together. 
CASS Helping each other. 
MILO Trusting each other. 
Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward pause. Then: 
CASS Well. Mind if I shower? 
MILO Ladies first. 
Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS. 
INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT 
CASS IS PRESSED ON HER SIDE OF THE DOOR, ALSO LISTENING. She reaches over and turns on the shower. 
INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT 
As soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED WHERE CASS LEFT HER PURSE. HE STARTS DIGGING THROUGH IT. 
MEANWHILE: 
INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT 
Cass is seated on the toilet lid, HUNCHED OVER HER PHONE: 
CASS (LOW) Hey. It's me. 
MOM (O.S.) Sheryl? 
SPLIT-SCREEN 
Mom is at a gay bar, having a cocktail. 
CASS No, not Sheryl. Cass. (beat) Your daughter. 
MOM Jesus Christ, where the hell are ya, Niagara Falls? 
CASS No. You're not gonna believe this, but: I'm at Cupid's Cabin with Milo. 
MOM (GASPING) Oh my god... 
CASS Mom... 
MOM I always knew you two would... 
CASS Mom. We're not back together. 
Long beat. 
MOM Why the hell not? 
INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT 
Milo is looking through Cass' purse. HE KNOWS SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING FROM HIM AT THE CASINO. While searching through her wallet, he suddenly stumbles across A WEDDING PHOTO OF HIMSELF AND CASS. 
Huh. He glances at the bathroom door. She carries their wedding photo around? 
INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT 
Cass listens while Mom rants: 
MOM I mean, I just don't get it, you're in this romantic place, you have a perfect opportunity to win him back... 
CASS Why should I have to win him back? He should have to win me back! And who says I want him back, anyway? 
MOM I have never understood this competitive streak of yours... 
CASS (losing her patience) Look, the reason I called: I remember you worked at this one place where they had these bright green matches with, like, this silhouette of a horse on them? 
MOM (immediately defensive) That was a long time ago! And all I did was serve drinks... 
CASS I just need to know the name of the place. 
MOM Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I did a little dancing, but how often do you make 200 an hour in tips? 
CASS I gotta go. 
MOM I want grandkids! 
Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone. Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes. 
MILO No, I mean, tell me about your attraction to me. 
CASS Um...I can't stop thinking about you. 
MILO Really? What part of me? 
CASS Just...all of you. 
MILO Be specific. 
Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad... 
MILO (HELPFULLY) My great hair? My chest? Or...something lower like... 
He reaches down and WHIPS OUT: 
MILO My gun? 
THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights. 
MILO I knew I couldn't trust you! 
CASS I knew I couldn't trust you! 
MILO When were you gonna tell me about the matches you found back there in the hotel room? 
CASS When were you gonna tell me you have no intention of helping me with my story? 
MILO (SHRUGGING) You're right. I'm not helping you. This is my story now. This time I get to come out on top! Karma, babe. K-a-r-m-a. Karma.... 
CASS Oh my god, would you get over it already! So I cracked the case before you did, it was 3 years ago, it happened, stop being such a baby and move on! 
MILO Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm moving on? By cracking this case before you, then taking you in so you can spend this Xmas in jail, all alone. 
He rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the ceiling, fuming. 
EXT CHARLEY'S- DAWN 
A strip club on the boardwalk. MOVING IN ON THE BACK DOOR... 
INT CHARLEY'S STORAGE ROOM- NIGHT 
Jimmy, tied to a chair, watches nervously as MAHLER TAKES EVIDENCE BOXES THAT ARE STACKED ALONG THE WALLS AND MOVES THEM ONTO A MOVER'S DOLLY. 
JIMMY So this is your place, huh? Nice. Cozy. Probably more fun to sit where you can actually see the dancers, but... 
Mahler has all the boxes loaded up. He grabs a rag and approaches Jimmy. 
JIMMY Oh. Hey, listen, no need for that, I swear I'll be as quiet as a mouse. 
Mahler gags him, THEN PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE. JIMMY SLUMPS OVER. 
MAHLER I know you will. 
Mahler grabs the dolly, flicks off the lights, and EXITS OUT THE BACK DOOR. 
INT LUXURY B&B DINING ROOM- DAY 
CHIRON: "2:00PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 19 HOURS TO GO." 
Cass is in a booth, handcuffed, her mouth set, her face grim. No more Mr Nice Guy. She is scheming her way out. 
RACK TO MILO, SEVERAL PACES AWAY, ON THE PHONE WITH TERESA, keeping one eye on Cass: 
MILO I'm just curious. 
SPLIT-SCREEN: 
Teresa at her desk, sipping eggnog. 
TERESA No, I do not keep my ex's photo in my wallet. 
Sid passes through, kids in tow, and carrying A HUGE, TANGLED BALL OF XMAS LIGHTS. Sid looks like he wants to put a bullet through his brain. 
Teresa mouths "Milo". Sid picks up the other extension. 
SID What's the problem now? 
MILO No problem... 
TERESA She keeps their wedding photo in her wallet. He wants to know what that means. 
SID It means she's madly in love with you. 
MILO Really? 
SID No, you idiot, it means she hasn't cleaned out her wallet in 3 years. I'm pretty sure I'm still carrying around a condom from 1987. (to one of the kids) Son of a bitch, Jeremy, don't eat things you find on the floor. 
MILO Know where this place is? 
EMT Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk. And just FYI: when they say "don't touch" the dancers, they mean with with any part of your body, not just your hands. 
The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot. 
MILO (calling after them, SARCASTIC) Thanks for the ride, by the way. 
Milo starts trying handles of parked cars until he finds one that's open and SLIPS INSIDE. 
EXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON 
Cass pulls up, parks in a lot, and instantly spots CHARLEY'S GREEN SIGN WITH THE BLACK HORSE SILHOUETTE, squeezed between a burger place and a souvenir shop. She slips out of the car, takes a careful look around, then works her way towards the club. 
INT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON 
POV OF THE FRONT DOOR, OPENING A CRACK, CASS PEEKING IN. 
CASS' POV- WOMEN DANCING, MEN DRINKING. Seedy and cheesy at the same time. Cass thinks this over, then slowly lets the door swing closed. 
EXT BACK OF CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON 
Cass finds the back entrance. THE DOOR IS BOLTED. She is looking for a window to climb into, when she spots JIMMY'S METS' HAT ON THE GROUND. 
Shit. Cass stares at the hat: JIMMY IS HERE SOMEWHERE. She presses her ear up against the back door: 
CASS (SOFTLY) Jimmy? 
Suddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE. Or grunting. LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of it, and cautiously climbs up. 
The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass. 
She wobbles on trash cans and GRABS THE WINDOWSILL JUST AS THE CANS FALL AWAY, LEAVING HER DANGLING. 
INT CHARLEY'S STORAGE ROOM- AFTERNOON 
Jimmy is staring nervously up at the broken window. He can see hands and can hear someone cursing under their breath. The top of a head appears, then a face: IT'S CASS. 
Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come in. Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy and ungags him. 
JIMMY Untie me, quick, that psychopath is gonna be back here any second... 
EXT BACK OF CHARLEY'S- MOMENTS LATER 
Cass peeks out the door, then gestures for Jimmy to follow. 
EXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON 
Cass and Jimmy are hurrying to the Cadillac... 
INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON 
Cass and Jimmy climb in... 
CASS So what the hell is "Sparrow"? 
...but before Jimmy can answer: 
DWIGHT (O.S.) I have a better question... 
Cass looks in the rearview mirror. SHIT: DWIGHT AND RAY ARE IN THE BACKSEAT, POINTING GUNS AT THE BACK OF THEIR HEADS. 
DWIGHT Where the fuck is Milo? 
Jimmy almost bursts into tears. 
JIMMY You know what? I think I'll get a real job. Work at Kinko's. Or Burger King. That doesn't sound so bad anymore... 
RAY (INTERRUPTING) Hey. Who the fuck are you? 
JIMMY Nobody. 
RAY Right. So what the fuck are you doing in this car? 
Jimmy glances back at them. Do they mean he can just...? 
DWIGHT (spelling it out) Run, you jackass. 
Jimmy gives Cass a quick look ("sorry"), then exits the car and TAKES OFF RUNNING DOWN THE BOARDWALK. CASS CAN'T BELIEVE IT. She drops her forehead into the steering wheel in despair. 
EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON 
Milo is driving along in a stolen Volvo, cables hanging under the steering wheel from where he hot-wired it. He is just coming up on the boardwalk when his phone rings. 
MILO (ANSWERING) What do you want, you crazy bitch? 
INT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON 
Great. So far, so good. 
Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT? 
CASS Did you throw it? 
MILO Not exactly. 
CASS Well, what are you waiting for? 
MILO I'm waiting for a pig to fly in here and grab it. 
CASS (starting to panic again) Milo... 
MILO Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to jump. 
Beat. 
CASS What? 
MILO You know: "jump, jump, jump around, jump." 
CASS Are you serious? 
MILO No. I'm fucking with you. For fun. Just for my own personal enjoyment... 
CASS Ok, Ok. 
MILO Ok: 1, 2, 3... 
EXT PORTHOLE- EVENING 
We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR. 
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:11, 00:10, 00:09..." 
MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER... 
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..." 
This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS... 
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..." 
And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB OUT THE WINDOW... 
CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER... 
INT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING 
Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still, listening. Silence. 
CASS Think the water defused it? 
MILO Lemme ask you this? Has anything gone our way yet? 
SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES. 
Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE. 
CASS Nice job. 
MILO Hey. You, too. 
CASS Thanks. 
MILO Now lets find something to cut these ropes off... 
CASS Think we can catch that cop? 
MILO Trust me: we can definitely catch that cop. 
Because at this very moment... 
INT MOTORBOAT- NIGHT 
...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind him, and he paddles faster. 
EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT 
Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the motorboat. Calling out: 
MILO Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya... 
Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES: 
MILO What's the difference between a snowman and a snowwoman? (holding something up) The spark plug.

INT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY 
Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting patiently for this year's kids. A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun, right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY 
OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS. They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting. 
EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY 
SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm. She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic. No parents. She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring through the building's window at... Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces. 
INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY 
Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT smiles up at her. 
SARA Hi. Sara Matthews. She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple silver chain around her neck. 
R.A. Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover country. She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely. 
R.A. You're in room three-sixteen. Welcome. She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY 
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she... Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off. Sara stops in front of Room 316. 
INT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY 
She opens the door and looks in on: A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the hall; twin beds. Heaven. Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window. She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here. First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara. Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart. It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed. 
SARA Told you we'd make it. She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles off the other cart. 
GIRL Sorry! Bad driver. Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair -- clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl smiles sheepishly. 
GIRL In case of emergency. 
(BEAT) I'm Tracy. 
SARA Sara. 
Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands. 
EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY 
A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm windows. 
EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it. 
SARA Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met this really cool biker? He's taking me to Mexico this weekend. 
(BEAT) Hello? 
(BEAT) Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding. Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a work/study ad on the wall. 
SARA Uh oh. Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera phones stretch out above the crowd. 
SARA 
(SHOUTS) Tracy. Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd. 
SARA 
(LOUDER) Tracy. Don't. Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara gasps. 
STEPHEN Damn! Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd. Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up. 
STEPHEN Oh. Woops. 
SARA 
(ANNOYED) I have to go clean this up. She turns. 
STEPHEN Looks like my plan backfired. Sara turns back towards him. 
SARA What plan? 
STEPHEN To spill beer on you so I can start a conversation. 
SARA You spilled beer on me purposely? 
STEPHEN 
(NODS) You pissed? She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen. 
SARA I'll get over it. He laughs, making her smile. 
SARA I'm not sure how she's so wasted. All she's had is punch. Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand. 
STEPHEN Come on. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - BAR 
Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of the punch. 
SARA It's pretty good. She drinks some more. 
SARA It doesn't taste that strong. 
STEPHEN Exactly. He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of hers. 
STEPHEN Stephen. By the way. 
SARA Sara. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR: SOME TIME LATER 
Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup. Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs, grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her, bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her other hand. 
SARA Hey, why do you get to drink beer? 
STEPHEN Twenty-one. 
SARA Old man. 
STEPHEN Tell me about it. My back is killing me. They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against his chest. 
STEPHEN Besides, frat brothers don't have to wear those ugly wristbands. 
SARA Ugh. You're in this frat? He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing, Holding up a cup of punch. 
KIM 
SARA Who are you?! 
GIRL Rebecca. Your roommate. Sara calms, catching on. 
SARA What are you doing? 
REBECCA Taking your picture. 
SARA Why? Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach. 
SARA Oh shit. Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca smiles. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT: LATER 
Sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room, holding her head. The door is slightly open. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
It's dark. Rebecca's covers are pulled up to her neck. Her eyes are closed. 
SARA 
(WHISPERS) Rebecca? No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it, and turns toward the wall. Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go to sleep. 
EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY 
It's the middle of the day and students carry their books everywhere. 
INT. DORM ROOM - DAY 
Sara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through the window is way too bright. She slowly turns over to see... Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the light of day, we see that she's a knockout. Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that flank an awesome stereo system. Rebecca sees that Sara's awake. 
REBECCA Hey Sara. Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened last night? Rebecca smiles. 
REBECCA We met last night. 
SARA Right... (racking her brain) Starts with a... "T"? 
REBECCA Close. Rebecca. She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin. 
REBECCA Come on. It'll help, trust me. Sara washes down the aspirin. 
SARA Thanks. Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. 
SARA 
(SUDDENLY PANICKED) I didn't throw up on you, did I? 
REBECCA 
(LAUGHS) No. You made it to the bathroom. Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved to her side. Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca is staring straight back at us. No smile. 
SARA Did you do those? Rebecca nods. 
SARA They're really cool. 
REBECCA I just like capturing my moods. A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night before are coming back to her now. 
SARA Rebecca -- did you take my picture last night? 
REBECCA 
(LAUGHING) Yeah. It's just something I do. For my drawings. 
(BEAT) C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The walk will help your head. Sara rolls over, groaning. 
SARA It's too damn early for me. 
Rebecca sits on her bed, drawing. Sara is putting her books away on a shelf. As she reaches the end of it, she notices something out of the corner of her eye. 
SARA Oh my God. 
REBECCA What? 
Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER 
COLLECTION. 
SARA I am so jealous. 
REBECCA I know... I've got a lot of clothes. Mind if I put some on your side? 
SARA No problem. 
REBECCA Borrow anything you want. Really. I haven't worn half of them. Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta. Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some still carry their price tags. 
SARA Jesus, some of these I've only ever seen in Vogue. 
REBECCA My parents idea of bonding is to turn me loose in Beverly Hills with a Platinum card. 
SARA Oh, you here? 
REBECCA Pasadena. Off Sara's confused look. 
REBECCA (CONT'D) About 20 minutes away. 
SARA That's cool. You can go home on weekends. Free laundry. Free meals. 
REBECCA Not gonna happen. Sara gives her a puzzled stare. 
REBECCA It's a long story.. .Let's just say nothing's free in my house. She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods at Rebecca's drawing pad. 
SARA Can I take a look? She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest. 
REBECCA No. Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came across pretty harsh. 
REBECCA Not till it's done. Nothing personal. It's just my... process. 
(SMILES) I wouldn't want to show you anything unless it was perfect. 
SARA 
(SMILES BACK) Sure. 
EXT. CAFETERIA - DUSK 
Establishing shot of a big college cafeteria. 
INT. CAFETERIA - DUSK 
Sara and Rebecca have just finished their dinner. 
REBECCA I thought you were a design major. Why are you taking Calc and psychology? The girls get up with their trays. 
SARA (with a smirk) I am. I want to be well-rounded. (off her look) And they're requirements. 
TRACY (O.S.) Hey Sara. Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks over, but Rebecca doesn't follow. 
SARA Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my roommate, Rebecca. She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves her over. Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave. 
REBECCA Hi. 
TRACY RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can we call you? 
KIM How 'bout Reba? Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me. 
SARA Hey. Rebecca removes her earbud. 
SARA What's your Facebook page? I'll add you as a friend. 
REBECCA I don't have a Facebook page. 
SARA Myspace? 
REBECCA Nope. I don't spend a lot of time 
ON-LINE Sara stares at Rebecca. No way. 
SARA Come here. Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's shoulder. 
ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends. Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s. 
REBECCA Who's she? 
SARA Irene. She graduated from the Art Institute out here last year. 
REBECCA 
(INTRIGUED) She's an artist? 
SARA A design apprentice for Marc Jacobs. Hey, check out these posts. Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was amazing"... "Milan in the Fall"... "Off to Barcelona"... etc. 
SARA I mean.. .who doesn't have a Facebook page?! Rebecca laughs. 
REBECCA Okay, okay. I'll get one. Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches right in. 
TRACY Cancel those library plans. Guess who made the guest list at Rebar? 
(BEAT) You guys in? I trust you have fake IDs? 
SARA Of course. 
REBECCA I don't. 
TRACY Yes you do. Thanks to my badass self. 
Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it out to her. A peace offering. Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her sketchbook. 
REBECCA I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my scene. Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand. 
INT. CLUB - NIGHT 
A posh Los Angeles bar. Loud and packed to the gills with mostly young students. Sara and Tracy stand at the bar, getting jostled, looking like... two naive college kids. As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys check them out, smiling and mouthing "Hi." Sara tries to ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven. 
TRACY How great is this? No parents. No curfews. 
SARA No shit! They clink their empty glasses in a toast. 
SARA Can I? She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse. 
TRACY Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk about the life of the party. 
SARA Don't be mean. 
TRACY I'm just saying. 
SARA She's just a little hard to get to know. 
TRACY Yeah right... 
As Tracy rolls her eyes... The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods down the bar at... TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not so sure about this. 
SARA What do you think? 
REBECCA Thanks. 
(BEAT) So, where's Tracy? 
SARA No idea, I couldn't find her. Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table. 
REBECCA As long as I'm here... you hungry? 
SARA Starved. Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu. 
REBECCA I can't believe she ran out on you. 
SARA I know. Thanks for coming. Rebecca looks up from the menu. 
REBECCA Tracy had her shot tonight. Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show you the big city.. .the right way. And I promise I won't abandon you. Deal? Sara smiles. 
SARA Deal. 
INT. MOCA - DAY 
Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room. 
REBECCA These are the modern pieces. A little wilder than the old stuff. She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed. Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason". She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She buries her cell phone in her purse. Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it. 
SARA Okay, I have no idea what this is supposed to be. 
REBECCA 
(LAUGHING) Even I don't get that one. Come on, I want to show you something. 
INT. MOCA - LATER 
Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince exhibition. 
They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of Greenmeadow." It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask. Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her smock. 
REBECCA This is my favorite. Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her. 
REBECCA I love how he captures her personality through her eyes. It's like she really wants to help you. Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants Sara to like this painting. Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is actually pretty sinister. Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's hopeful expression. Sara brightens. 
SARA Amazing. I love it. 
EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY 
Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores. Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor. Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes. 
SARA That is so cool. 
REBECCA No graffiti in Des Moines? 
SARA Sure. "Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy loves Rick." Nothing like this. Rebecca pulls out her camera. 
REBECCA Hey, smile. Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in. 
SARA Both of us. 
They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo parlor in the background. 
REBECCA Now that's one "art form" I don't get. Needles into skin? No thanks. 
SARA I have a tattoo. Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes that she's serious. 
REBECCA Really? Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily". 
SARA My older sister. She died when I was nine. 
REBECCA Oh, I'm sorry. 
REBECCA Sorry. I was just trying it on. Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it protectively. 
SARA This was my sister's. 
REBECCA Oh. Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca. 
SARA You can borrow anything of mine. Except for this. Okay? It's the only thing I kept of hers. Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her. 
REBECCA I'm really sorry. 
SARA It's okay. You didn't know. 
REBECCA Were you two close? 
SARA Yeah. You're the first roommate I've had since she died. So, it feels a little odd. 
REBECCA In a good way or a bad way? Sara smiles. 
SARA A good way. 
EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - MORNING 
Establishing of life at the quads. 
INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
A cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of laid-back STUDENTS and... One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO- WORKER, clearly stoned, moves in slow motion. Not a care in his world. 
SARA 
(TO CUSTOMER) You wanted a mocha smoothie, right? O.K. Do you know what's in that? The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the lid, and... THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find... STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line. 
STEPHEN This seems like a pattern. Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc. She leans in and speaks quietly. 
SARA Just because I kissed you doesn't mean I'll let you cut in line. 
STEPHEN So what does it mean? 
She coyly shrugs. 
STEPHEN Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon are reviving a sacred tradition tonight. Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles. 
STEPHEN We're having another keg party. 
SARA I.. dunno. I'm still having flashbacks from the last one. Sara laughs. 
STEPHEN You know what? How about if I use you as my excuse not to go. Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY 
Sara walks off the elevator, still sky-high. She walks through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch. A television plays in the background. 
TRACY Hey. Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold. 
SARA Hey. 
TRACY Psi U. tonight? 
SARA So you can ditch me again? 
TRACY Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And a hot tub. 
SARA That's your apology? Tracy jumps up and walks over. 
TRACY What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry -- I totally screwed up. Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She watches Tracy and Sara. Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs. 
SARA I forgive you. Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder, she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile. Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca takes it. 
AERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks ten yards behind them, waiting until... Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down different paths. Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up. 
SARA Hey. How was the party? Are you still the beer bong queen? But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop. 
TRACY Listen... something is up with your roommate. 
SARA What do you mean? 
TRACY She was outside my room this morning. 
SARA Doing what? 
TRACY Waiting for me. I opened my door... and there she was. Just sitting there, staring. Like some psycho. 
SARA Are you sure? 
TRACY You don't believe me? 
SARA No, it's just... why would she do that? 
TRACY Why don't you ask her? I've gotta go...I'll see ya later. Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building. Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway. Tracy leaves in a hurry. 
INT. CLASSROOM / STUDIO 
Sara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each sporting a different fashion style. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS Contrary to popular opinion, beauty is not in the eye of the beholder. It's in the hands of the designer. Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes with a text message. She discreetly takes a look. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS Who can tell me the difference between fashion and style? FROM IRENE: "4th & ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the message. Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and calls on her. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS Miss Matthews? Without missing a beat, Sara replies. 
SARA Fashion's something you can buy, but style you either have or you don't. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS Exactly. All the money in the world can't buy you style. 
SARA But it can buy you a good stylist. The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles. 
EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she walks. Rebecca is waiting, holding two cups of coffee. 
SARA Hey. How'd you know when my class got out? Rebecca shrugs, playing it off. 
REBECCA I'm your roommate. Sara smiles and grabs a cup. 
SARA Thanks. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. QUADS - LATER 
They walk through the quads. Other students are around, some strolling leisurely, others rushing to get to class. 
SARA Listen... Tracy told me something kinda weird. She says you... scared her this morning. Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing. 
REBECCA What? 
SARA Yeah. 
REBECCA It's more like she scared me. She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl. She almost knocked me over. A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles. 
SARA The girl does like to party. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it. Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from Irene: "where r u?!?!?!" 
SARA I gotta go meet Irene. (raises her cup) Thanks for the coffee. Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip. 
EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY 
TRACY Sara thinks you're weird. She told me. She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off that shower, too. But she can still hear running water. She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed again. The sound of running water behind it. She walks over. 
TRACY Not funny, Rebecca. (under her breath) Bitch. She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the curtain open to see... Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around -- no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower. 
TRACY Freak. Just as the warm water starts to relax her... THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca. The curtain comes right off the rings. Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both. 
Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down. Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca. 
REBECCA So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me tell you what I think. I think you're a little whore, and a bad influence on her. And I think that if you tell anyone about... what I'm about to do... you'll regret it. Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further. Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain. A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face. Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor, Rebecca looks down at... The bloody ring in her hand. 
REBECCA Nice belly ring. She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Sara and Stephen are sitting on a couch. His arm around her shoulder, lightly playing with the ends of her hair. 
STEPHEN I'm going to flunk my test tomorrow, thanks to you. 
SARA Then let's make sure it was worth it. She gives him a slow, lingering kiss. 
STEPHEN Duh, joke's on you. I was going to flunk anyway. She smiles. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Rebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She smiles -- must be Sara. She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara. She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her cell phone and dials. 
INT. DORM LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Sara and Stephen step off the elevator. Time to say goodbye. 
STEPHEN Thanks for helping me... not study. 
SARA Anytime. He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca. Standing just five feet away. Staring at them. 
REBECCA Where were you? 
SARA Oh, hi. 
REBECCA I kept calling and calling. 
SARA Oh. I turned my cell off at the library and forgot to turn it back on. 
(FRAZZLED) Rebecca... this is Stephen. He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him. 
REBECCA I'm going to bed now. I'm glad you're okay. She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara bites her lip, as if to say: "What can you do?" 
STEPHEN You got a curfew? 
SARA Well, she's right...I shoulda called. He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more kiss. The doors close. Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door and sighs. 
EXT. QUADS - MORNING 
Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees. Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman. As they reach the fork in the path... 
SARA I guess I'll see you later. 
REBECCA Sara... 
(SHE TURNS) Last night. I was just worried about you. 
SARA You don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself. Okay? Rebecca slowly nods. 
REBECCA Sara. We're good, right? A beat. Sara nods and smiles. 
INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
Sara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them. Stephen is reading Rolling Stone. Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page. She gets a message for adding a new friend... from Rebecca. She clicks to add her. 
SARA So...let's go back to your place. She gives him a seductive grin. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Rebecca sketches in her bed. She looks at the clock: 1:00 a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away. She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial button. She starts to dial... but kills the call. She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly: A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen: 
"JASON". A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens. 
JASON (O.S.) Sara? 
REBECCA Mmmm? 
JASON (O.S.) Sara, you answered. Thank you. Can we talk... about us? Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor. And now she lies down. 
REBECCA 
(WHISPERS) I miss you. She moves her hand across her stomach. 
JASON (O.S.) 
(RELIEVED) You do? 
REBECCA I want you, Jason. 
JASON (O.S.) I.. . want you, too. But... Rebecca's hand moves toward her panties. 
REBECCA I miss touching you. Do you miss touching me? 
JASON (O.S.) Like you wouldn't believe. 
REBECCA Prove it. 
INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Sara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever. Kissing madly, missing each other's mouths. At his door... he cracks it open and peeks inside. His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes. 
STEPHEN Just give me thirty seconds. 
SARA You're kidding. 
But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him. Sara leans back against the wall. Flushed, breathing hard. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - SAME 
Stephen is a whirlwind. He tosses everything -- beer cans, clothes, study papers -- into one big garbage bag. 
STEPHEN Almost there. 
SARA (O.S.) (through the door) I'm going to start taking my clothes off out here. 
STEPHEN Yeah, right. He's not quite buying it... but he's cleaning faster. 
SARA (O.S.) Oops! There goes my shirt... She's got his attention now. He speeds up. 
STEPHEN You know I don't believe you. 
(WORRIED) Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to be my strip tease. 
SARA (O.S.) There go the jeans. He's popping breath mints... while clearing off his bed. 
STEPHEN I'm just going to put your clothes back on and make you strip again. 
SARA (O.S.) Hmmm. What's next? Top or bottom? Stephen stops and stares at the door. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME 
Sara stands there, fully dressed. She looks down the empty hallway. 
INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER 
Sara whips up a latte for a customer, her cell phone to her ear. She's really got the hang of this job now. In charge, moving with a purpose. She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand and points him toward the sink. He starts washing blenders. 
SARA 
(INTO PHONE) Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez. Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink and walks away. 
SARA Well, actually, I was thinking I'd do Thanksgiving here and see you guys for Christmas. She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what she's hearing. 
SARA Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm really getting slammed... There isn't another customer in sight. 
SARA I'll call you later, okay? Tell Dad I said hello. Bye. She hangs up the phone and sighs. 
INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK 
Rebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag. As she carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on Sara's bed. She scoops her up. 
REBECCA Looks like it's just you and me tonight. 
INT. DORM BASEMENT HALLWAY - DUSK 
Rebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry room. 
INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER 
Rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying. Cuddles plays with a sock on top of a nearby washer. Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles. She pets her gently. She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside. 
REBECCA 
(BABY TALK) See how nice and warm it is in there? Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass. She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and gets back up. Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time. Cuddles stumbles. Flips over. The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca, wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her last quarter. She gently places it in the slot. ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the glass at the kitten. She fingers the button. Before she pushes it -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DORM ROOM - LATER 
Sara walks in to find Rebecca sprawled on her bed, crying. She rushes over. 
SARA Hey, what's wrong? Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed. 
REBECCA Cuddles got out. 
SARA Oh no. In the dorm? 
REBECCA Outside. 
SARA What?! 
REBECCA I was doing laundry... I took her with me... She jumped out of the bag and ran outside. I went after her, but... 
(WHIMPERS) I'm so sorry. Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca... but the girl's so distraught, so fragile. 
SARA Maybe she'll come back. 
REBECCA 
(EMPHATIC) She won't. 
SARA I'm going to go find her. 
REBECCA Do you want me to help? But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her. 
INT. CAFETERIA - MORNING 
Sara and Rebecca sit alone at a table. Eating quietly. 
SARA Maybe it's... just karma or something. We weren't allowed to keep her anyway. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS I'd like to see more danger in your work. Your designs are always crisp; they're always clear. But they're a little... safe. That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face. Roberts walks over to her. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS Don't be afraid to go to some of the... He delicately taps her temple. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D) darker places in here. 
SARA Okay... He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks into her eyes. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS The best designers push the boundaries of what's... acceptable. They take chances. Do you like to take chances, Sara? 
SARA Sometimes. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS So do I. He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her chair. She stands in front of him, shaking. 
SARA I can't believe you just did that. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS I took a chance, that's all. With a student that I trust. 
SARA I better go. Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door... 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't blow the chance of a lifetime. She hurries out of the office. 
INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables. Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans over, concerned. 
REBECCA What's wrong? 
SARA My design professor just kissed me. Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next to Sara. 
REBECCA Are you alright? Sara nods. 
SARA Yeah, it just really creeped me out. And I think the asshole's married. 
Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's. 
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT 
Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He tosses some design sheets into his briefcase. He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips it onto his finger. He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop at his door. Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him. He opens the door, revealing: Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her shoulder. Roberts swallows his surprise. 
REBECCA Professor Roberts? 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS That's right. 
REBECCA I'm glad I caught you. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS Actually, I was just... But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels snapping on the worn hardwood floor. 
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT 
Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her back inside. They face each other. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS You're not one of my students. 
REBECCA Not yet. That's why I'm here. 
She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner is disarming. A beat. 
REBECCA I'm failing Intro Pysch. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS And why is that? 
REBECCA Because I'm bored. I thought it would be all about Freud, and deep dark secrets. But it's brain chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay awake in class. 
PROFESSOR ROBERTS I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not sure what I can do to help. 
REBECCA Tomorrow's the last day to drop a course without penalty. Unless I can add another one in its place, I'll fall way behind in credits. Daddy won't take that very well. He might even pull the plug. Which means... 
JEFF That's not what I meant. She looks down at the table. 
REBECCA I'm making friends. Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat. 
JEFF Rebecca, look at me for a second. Now she looks at him. 
JEFF Your mother and I are very fond of you. 
REBECCA I know. He doesn't know what else to say. Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall. Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture. 
JEFF I just wanted to make sure. Good night, I'm heading back to bed. He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs. 
INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY 
Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in. 
ALISON Hi Sara. 
SARA Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some of her high school hangouts. 
ALISON Wonderful. Alison peers up the stairs. 
ALISON Rebecca seems to be doing well. 
SARA Uhhh, yeah. I think she is. 
ALISON Is she taking her medication? 
SARA Medication? Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs. Did she hear them? She walks down. 
ALISON Hey sweetheart. She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed. 
REBECCA 
(TO SARA) Ready? Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words. Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully. 
ALISON Have a great time, you two. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 
It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street. Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca. 
REBECCA Is everything okay? 
SARA Yeah. It's just... She wants to ask her about that medication. 
SARA Nice to see where you come from. 
REBECCA 
(EMBARRASSED) Come on. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY 
Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca. She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee. 
SARA Thanks. The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out. What's she doing with Rebecca? The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work. 
REBECCA 
(TO SARA) I used to come here like every day after school. The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting. One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks. Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches. The chatting girls all fall silent. 
SARA You know them? 
REBECCA They went to my high school. 
SARA Friends? Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye contact with the Brunette. The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves. Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance. As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible. The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances at Rebecca as they order their drinks. Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls. Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette. Suddenly, Rebecca gets up. 
STEPHEN Your door was open. 
SARA Oh my God. 
STEPHEN Sorry. Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her tight and speaks, muffled by her neck. 
STEPHEN What are those? A beat. Should she bring him into this? 
SARA That's what I intend to find out. 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT 
Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around. Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks up and we see what she's been staring at: Irene. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer. Sara googles "Lithium and APD", and clicks on an entry. 
SARA 
(READING) APD -- anti-social personality disorder. Also known as sociopathy. They look at each other. 
STEPHEN Jesus. I thought she was just weird. 
SARA It says lithium can control the condition. (nodding at the bottles) Maybe these are refills. Maybe she's been taking it all along. 
STEPHEN Certainly doesn't seem like she's been taking them. He's right and she knows it. A beat. 
SARA I think it's time I moved in with Irene. 
INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT 
A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic martinis and watching the dance floor. And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca. Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE 
THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS 
IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? 
INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in. Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene. She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms. Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find Rebecca's in the mirror. 
IRENE I'm sorry to stare, but you are so beautiful. 
REBECCA SMILES 
REBECCA Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it? 
IRENE It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl never knows how late she's gonna party. Rebecca smiles. A beat. 
REBECCA Can I try it? Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips. 
REBECCA You're right... cinnamon. Irene smiles. This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's. 
REBECCA Why don't we get out of here. I'd invite you to my place, but I have a roommate. 
IRENE As luck would have it, I'm only two blocks away and...no roommate. 
REBECCA What are we waiting for? 
INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm.. 
IRENE Shit. She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table. 
CUT TO: 
SARA Let's see it. Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just under her collarbone: 
"EMILY" Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her. 
REBECCA 
(SWEETLY) Think of me as your sister. Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara. 
REBECCA If you want... you can call me Emily. Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves toward Rebecca, whose grin fades. 
REBECCA What's the matter? Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone. Her eyes search Sara's for an answer. Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY 
The elevator doors open. Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps out, carrying a box of her things. Stephen waits by the door. 
STEPHEN This is all you're taking? 
SARA I'll get the rest of my things when Irene comes back to town. He takes the box. Then notices -- 
STEPHEN Where's your necklace? She instinctively rubs the base of her neck. 
SARA I can't find it. It's okay. 
STEPHEN Sara... 
SARA I'm not going back up there. He hands her the box. Time to man up. 
STEPHEN Wait here. I'll go look for it. She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Sara walks out to the cab. Pauses. She's tempted to look back at her dorm room window... but she doesn't. Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down. Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank. 
INT. DORM ROOM - DAY 
Rebecca still sits at the window. She holds her camera up, taking a picture down below. She turns as Stephen enters. She puts the camera down. 
STEPHEN Have you seen Sara's necklace? Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca watches him. 
REBECCA What did I do? He stops searching. Looks at her. 
STEPHEN She just needs to move on. 
REBECCA With you? He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up. 
STEPHEN If you do find it, can you let me know? Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps out of it and walks out the door. She watches him go. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - DAY 
Sara is cleaning, trying to make a dent in a world-class mess. She doesn't mind -- a big weight's off her shoulders. 
STEPHEN You should call someone. The dean's office. Or at least your R.A. She keeps cleaning. 
SARA And tell them what? What has she really done to me? No one can do anything. 
(BEAT) It's the weirdest thing, Stephen. The girl's own parents are afraid of her. 
STEPHEN Well, she sure scared the shit out of me. Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of his t-shirts. 
SARA Are these dirty or clean? Stephen sniffs the shirts. 
STEPHEN Somewhere in between. She throws the t-shirts at him. 
EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - DAY 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the elevator. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Rebecca stares at the note for a moment. She walks to the door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note. 
SARA - I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until... however long it takes. Please. Love, 
JASON Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash. 
INT. DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT 
Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain. 
INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long pair of shears. Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal. She gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears, still looking at it in the mirror. She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter. Just above her shoulders. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing. Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain. Which she caresses in her hand. 
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book. Enjoying the silence. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT GIRL smiles at him. 
GIRL Help me find the keg? 
STEPHEN Sure, I have to go look for my girlfriend anyway. She walks away. "Jerk". He grins... and now checks his watch. Where's Sara? 
INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara? The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her. 
As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers. She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an open room. She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now plucks the master key card off the cart. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed. The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep. Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the floor. She's in just bra and panties now. She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake. 
JASON 
WHA-- 
REBECCA Shhhh. She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts kissing the back of his neck. 
JASON Sara? 
(BEAT) You got my voicemail. 
REBECCA Mm-hmmm. Kissing his back now, moving lower. 
JASON Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good. She works her way back up to his ear. 
REBECCA 
(WHISPERING) Turn over. 
Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees... The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable "Emily" tattoo. 
REBECCA 
REBECCA Stop it. Stop saying things you don't mean. I protected you. From that whore Tracy and that nasty little kitten... and That scumbag of a professor... 
(BEAT) Even that loser ex-boyfriend of yours. 
SARA What're you talking about? What'd you do to them? What'd you do to Jason? 
REBECCA I got rid of them all. And how do you repay me? By leaving me. Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment. She looks at Irene. Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in the eye. She puts everything she has into this. 
SARA Rebecca, please forgive me. A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up. 
REBECCA Now we can start all over again. Let's make things the way they were, Sara. That first day. Just the two of us. Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands. 
SARA Rebecca... 
REBECCA After all... you can only have one best friend. 
SARA No! Don't! Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her... 
REBECCA Lay still bitch. 
SARA Please. Don't do this... Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die. She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun. 
REBECCA Stop! I mean it. Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming. Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor. She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair from Sara's face. 
REBECCA 
(GENTLE) Shh... I'm so sorry. Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It skitters across the floor and out the door into the living room. Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a chokehold. Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again. Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip. She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara rises... Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of her. As Sara gasps for breath... Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun. Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it. Rebecca turns around and goes for the door. 
Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's head. IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But... Rebecca bangs the door. 
REBECCA (O.S.) Don't do this Sara! 
INT. BEDROOM 
Sara takes the scarf out of Irene's mouth and pulls against the steel handcuffs. Useless. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Rebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door. 
REBECCA Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I just want to be your friend. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Sara and Irene are frantic. 
IRENE My phone. My phone. She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table. She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut! 
SARA Shit! 
IRENE The window! There's a fire escape. You can reach it. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Rebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and furniture around. She finds it. Picks the gun off the floor. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Sara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options. 
EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT 
Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires.

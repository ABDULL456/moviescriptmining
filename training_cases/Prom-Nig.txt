FINAL DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 
SUPER: April 27, 1973 All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children. Two faded yellow buses stand ready. 
The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL. A swarm of children pours out the door and down the broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward the cars and the buses. 
Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND, nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway.. Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub- dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old, two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister. 
ALEX C'mon, Robin. 
ROBIN 
(STUTTERING BADLY) W-w-where's D-d-daddy? 
ALEX He's got a meeting at the high school. We're supposed to walk home with Kim... (sees Robin watching the young couple) She's too busy. Let's go by ourselves. 
ROBIN N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait. 
ALEX Why? Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands. He's angry. 
ALEX 
(CONTINUING) You're crazy, I'm not waiting. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim. Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking towards her and Nick is bicycling away. 
KIM Okay, let's go. The sisters start to walk across the lawn. 
ROBIN Y-you 1-1-like him? 
KIM Who? 
ROBIN 
(SMILES SHYLY) Y-you know. 
KIM Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess. They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at her big sister. 
ROBIN 
(FINALLY) Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him? 
(MALICIOUSLY) Now you've done it, you idiot! The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the "killers" rush towards the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es- cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face. 
WENDY 
(CONTINUING; SLOWLY) Kill, kill, kill... Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin. Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room, bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy in pursuit of Robin. Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, "KILL, KILL ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap- pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out blindly, escapes the "killer." 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3 
Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up- right near the opening are several sheets of window glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad- der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in the doorway, a vicious look on her face. 
WENDY Killers, here! Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away. 
ROBIN N-n-n-no! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting "Kill, kill." Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening. Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates. But as Wendy and her fellow "killers" close in on her, Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and grabs the ladder. 
ROBIN 
(CONTINUING) P-p-please! Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and send it hurtling down directly at Robin. The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the glass slices through her neck. She is instantly decapitated. Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally, he manages to speak. 
NICK 
(WHISPERING HOARSELY) We gotta get somebody quick! Nick starts to go. Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his arm. 
WENDY Are you crazy? They'll put us in jail! Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow silent. 
WENDY 
(CONTINUING) If we tell anyone, they'll say it's our fault. Who'd believe it was an accident? Nick starts to protest. 
WENDY 
(CONTINUING; 
INTERRUPTING) Listen to me! 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
WENDY (C ONT D ) We'll go home now and never ever tell anyone. They'll think it was an accident. 1,10 one but us will ever know. She looks at each of them. They are still too numb to respond. 
WENDY 
(CONTINUING) Everybody swear never to tell! Wendy glares at Jude. 
WENDY 
(CONTINUING) Jude? 
JUDE 
(SOFTLY) I swear. 
HATIOND (after a pause) I've learned to live them.. Vivian seems worse this time. 
FAIRCHILD 
(NODS) The persistence of Vivian's trauma. I wonder if there isn't something more serious at work here? 
HAMOND Something more serious than her daughter's death? 
19 INT. OFFICE - DAY 19 
Vivian fidgets in her chair. She seems very small and vulnerable in the large, somber office. 
20 INT. CAR (MOVING) DAY 20 
Alex is seated opposite his father in the front seat. Kim is in back. Easy listening MUSIC PLAYS softly on the car RADIO. Alex fiddles with the tuning dial, searching for music more to his tastes. Lost in thought, Hammond does not see the young girl skipping through the pedestrian crossing. 
KIM 
(SCREAMS) Daddy! Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against the dashboard. 
21 EXT. STREET - DAY 21 
The CAR SCREECHES to a halt inches away from the terri- fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the crossing. After a moment, realizing she is safe, the girl giggles nervously and skips away. 
22 INT. CAR - DAY 22 
Hammond lets out a sigh and turns to his children. 
HAMMOND You all right? They both nod. Alex massages his wrist. Hammond slips the car into gear and cautiously continues driving. 
KIM You're worried about Mom? 
HALMOND I was... He is interrupted by DISCO MUSIC ON the RADIO. Play- ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass over the music. 
KIM Hey, keep that! Alex groans but does as she asks. 
ALEX Disco sucks! 
HAMZMOND 
(REPROVINGLY) Alex! 
(CONTINUED) 
22 CONTINUED: 22 
ALEX Sorry, Dad... (turns back to 
KIM) Disco bites it! 
HAMMOND 
(DRYLY) That's much better. The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot. They pile out. 
23 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 23 
Hammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot towards the school. Suddenly, we HEAR a loud GRATING SOUND coming from nearby. The sudden noise startles Kim and she huddles against her father. A seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing a pair of electric hedge clippers. 
HAM 0ND (taking her hand) What happened? 
WOMAN (ADELE) Well you see, Mr. Hammond, the, air conditioner fan was set for high but... 
HAP-MOND 
(INTERRUPTS) Please, Miss... Adele, 
ADELE 
(INTERRUPTS) Cooper... Ms. Cooper. 
HA MOND Whatever! I have some important calls to make. Please see that I'm not disturbed... (wades through the papers to his inner 
OFFICE DOOR) , and put all this back where it belongs! He enters his office. 
26 INT. HA,1NI OND' S OFFICE - DAY 26 
Hammond tosses his briefcase onto the desk and drops into his chair. He stares at the telephone for a long moment, drumming his finger on the desk. 
CUT TO: 
27 INT. BEDROOM - DAY 27 
A pink TELEPHONE RINGS. The plush bedroom is empty; suddenly Wendy Richards rushes in. Now eighteen, Wendy is a raven-haired beauty with a full figure, accentua- ted by a low-cut black blouse and tight designer jeans. Tossing her books onto the bed, she eagerly grabs the receiver. 
WENDY 
(BREATHLESSLY) Nick? A long pause, followed by HEAVY BREATHING. Wendy is about to respond when the inhuman VOICE speaks in an eerie, androgynous stutter. 
TELEPHONE VOICE W-Wendy? T-t-tonight it's m-m-my t-turn! Wendy's shock quickly turns to anger. 
WENDY Screw you, Lou! Wendy slams the receiver into its cradle. Grabbing her books, she storms out of her bedroom. 
28 INT. FRONT HALL - DAY 28 
Wendy hurries do-in the ornate staircase. Waiting at the bottom holding the girl's sweater is MAUDE, the Richards' elderly housekeeper. 
MAUDE You be home for dinner, Wendy? Wendy angrily grabs her sweater from the woman. 
WENDY How the hell do I know? She exits. 
L3. 
29 EXT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - DAY 29 
The expansive residence sits back off the road in this upper-middle-class suburb. Wendy climbs into her white Mustang and starts the engine. TIRES SQUEALING, she ROARS out of the driveway with the RADIO BLASTING. 
30 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 30 
Kelly Lynch is just finishing breakfast when the TELEPHONE RINGS. The petite blonde eighteen-year-old stuffs a last bite of toast into her mouth and picks up the receiver. 
KELLY 
(MUMBLING ) Hullo? A pause, then HEAVY BREATHING. Kelly's eyes grow wide as the dreadful voice speaks. 
TELEPHONE VOICE K-K-Kelly? T-tonight it's m-m-ï¿½IZ Horrified, Kelly drops the phone. The DOORBELL RINGS. Frightened, she gasps, hugging the wall. The DOORBELL RINGS again. Very slowly she moves out of the kitchen. 
33 INT. HALL - DAY 
Jude Cunningham is leaving her house when the TELE- PHONE RINGS. The chubby, brown-haired girl rushes back into the hallway. A plump, middle-aged woman hurries out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on an apron. MRS. CUNNINGHAM eagerly watches her daughter snap up the receiver. The pause, the HEAVY BREATHING and the strange, terrifying voice. 
TELEPHONE VOICE J-Jude? T-t-tonight it's my-my t-t-turn! A disappointed Jude slowly replaces the receiver. Mrs. Cunningham looks on sympathetically. Still no date? 
JUDE (shakes her head) Getting closer, though. 
33 CONTINUED: 33 
MRS. CUNNINGHAM A boy? 
JUDE 
(SMILES) An obscene call... and not very obscene at that! Mrs. Cunningham starts to say something. 
JUDE 
(CONTINUING) Sorry, Mom, gotta run. Giving her mother a quick peck on the cheek, Jude exits. 
34 EXT. CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE - DAY 
The small house appears almost identical to the other dwellings in this lower-middle-class neighborhood. Jude pulls an apple from her large purse, munching while she walks to the bus stop. A gaudily-painted van pulls up alongside her. The win- dow slowly rolls down and a young curly-haired GUY wearing glasses sticks out his head. 
GUY Hey, beautiful, need a lift? Jude continues walking, the van moving slowly alongside her. 
JUDE No thanks. 
GUY C'mon, I won't bite. Jude chomps down hard on her apple. 
JUDE So who are you? TheGuy leans further out the window. 
GUY Seymour Stone but.. He's cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk. Jude shrieks. The flustered boy steers the van quickly back onto the road. 
(CONTINUED) 
34 CONTINUED: 27 
GUY 
(CONTINUING) but they call me Slick! Jude laughs, almost choking on her apple. 
JUDE I can see why... How old are you, Slick? 
GUY (SLICK) Old enough... 
JUDE I've heard about guys like you... running over girls on the sidewalk... 
SLICK Just some girls... If they're good lookin' I give 'em a ride. 
JUDE 
(SMILING) Can you stop that thing? Slick jams on the brakes. The van jerks to a halt. He opens the passenger door. 
JUDE 
(CONTINUING) I'm going straight to Winston High, understand? 
37 CONTINUED: 37 
JUDE 
(BRIGHTENING) Yeah? Well, as a matter of fact.. 
(THINKING FURIOUSLY) My date is uh, not that certain... Something might be happening, he's not sure, you know? 
SLICK 
(NODDING SOLEMNLY) Yeah, right... Jude watches him. He's slow picking up her hint. 
JUDE So I guess we're both maybe not going... 
SLICK Yeah... too bad... He looks at her. 
SLICK 
(CONTINUING) Hey, you think... 
JUDE I'd love to! She kisses him on the cheek. 
JUDE 
(CONTINUING) See you at eight, same spot! She exits, hurrying across the parking lot as he grins foolishly after her. Suddenly, it dawns on him. 
SLICK 
(CALLS OUT) What's your name? 
38 INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY 38 
A tall rugged-looking man wearing a police uniform stands in ,the center of the room checking over his revolver. He's DARRYL McBRIDE, forty-eight years old and a veteran Sergeant on the Police Force. Satisfied with the condition of the gun, he jams it back into its holster, turns, calls out. 
(CONTINUED) 
38 CONTINUED: 
MCBRIDE Let's go, son! A handsome dark-haired boy of eighteen emerges from a back room. He's Nick McBride. His father pulls open the front door. 
MCBRIDE 
(CONTINUING) For a guy who moves so fast around a disco floor, you are the slowest goddamn thing... Nick nods sleepily, yawns. 
NICK Right, I know... McBride steps out into the hallway. Nick grabs his books and follows. The TELEPHONE RINGS. Nick hesi- tates. Shaking his head he exits, shutting the door. 
39 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
The TELEPHONE keeps RINGING. McBride looks at his son. 
MCBRIDE Why didn't you answer i 
NICK It's just Wendy. She's pissed off. She wants me to take her to the prom tonight. 
MCBRIDE I thought you two broke up. The TELEPHONE continues to RING. 
NICK Three months ago... you can't tell Wendy anything she doesn't want to hear. 
WENDY It's not who you go with, honey... it's who takes you home. 
KIM I'll try and remember that. 
WENDY Wait and see, bitch... Just wait and see... 
43 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 43 
The corridor is packed with students -- flirting, gossiping, fighting, a few even studying. We PICK UP Kim and VICKI CANTRELL, eighteen, moving down the crowd- ed hallway through the various conversations. 
KIM : So then she threatened me. 
VICKI Wendy's a jerk! 
FIRST MALE (V.0.) She didn't! 
SECOND MALE (V.0.) Swear to God! 
FIRST MALE (V.0.) 
(INCREDULOUS) In the teachers' lounge? 
OTHER VOICES Dual headers... thinks he's a fox... Dust'll run you... long and slinky and tight... swings like my mother... how much for half a lid? Jude joins Kim and Vicki as they walk. 
JUDE guys. 
KIM Jude. 
(CONTINUED) 
43 CONTINUED: 43 
VICKI Missed you on the bus today. 
JUDE I didn't ride it. 
VICKI I thought you were too big to hide. 
KIM 
(CHIDING) Vicki... 
JUDE 
(IGNORING VICKI) I got a ride. 
VICKI Who with? 
KIM None of your business. 
JUDE 
(BLASE) A guy. Vicki and Kim are left hanging, waiting for more. 
VICKI 
(FINALLY) Jude! Jude can hold it back no longer. 
KIM Shhh! 
VICKI Oh no you don't... (turns back and calls to Nick) She's smiling, Nick. Big grin spread all over her face. Kim punches her friend but the damage is done. Nick grins broadly. Blushing, Kim turns back, flashes him a quick smile and disappears around a corner to the hoots of Vicki and Jude. 
44 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 44 
A tall dark figure walks quickly down a concrete cor- ridor. From somewhere nearby, loud VOICES, SPLASHING water, can be HEARD. 
45 INT. POOL GALLERY 45 
A shadow moves behind the opaque glass plate of a heavy door. 
(CONTINUED) 
45 CONTINUED: 45 The door edges open. Raymond Hammond appears. Prop- ping the door open with his shoulder, he starts down across the narrow gallery to the pool below. 
46 INT. POOL 46 
A class of senior male students occupies the water, among them Nick McBride and Drew Shinnick. With no Phys. Ed. instructor in sight, it's a general goof-off period. Nick walks out onto the diving board. Drew is treading water below him. 
47 ANGLE ON HAMMOND 47 as he watches Nick intently from the gallery door. 
48 INT. POOL 48 
Nick launches himself out over Drew in an apparent belly-flop. At the last moment, he tucks in and hits the water in a flipped over cannonball. He surfaces to a chorus of whistles and cheers. It was a close shave. 
DREW You wanta take care of yourself, man... Kim's expecting a lot from you tonight... Nick laughs. 
49 INT. GALLERY DOOR 49 
The door is easing shut. Hammond is nowhere to be seen. 
50 INT. GYM - DAY 50 
A side door opens. Hammond steps in, gazes around. The gym is empty, silent. He walks to the stage steps, climbs up, pushes through the thick curtain. 
51 INT. GYM - BACKSTAGE 51 
It's a dark cluttered area broken up by tall partitions, discarded flats from old student productions, banks of lights. Hammond crosses to a rear door, tries it. It's locked. He turns back. As he does so there's a sudden WHIRRING SOUND. A row of spotlights flashes on right in front of him, almost blinding him. He tries to shield his eyes. 
(CONTINUED) 
51 CONTINUED: 51 He spins around. Another bank of lights flares at him. He staggers downstage. The curtains begin to swing open. Startled, he jumps away from them. His foot lands on a package of photo-flood bulbs.. There's a LOUD POP. Then a VOICE. 
ALEX (O.S.) Who's there? Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's an elevated platform where the electronic control panel is located. Alex peers down. 
HAMMOND Alex?... What the hell're you doing? 
ALEX I'm testing the board... I didn't hear you... nobody's supposed to be here yet... 
HAMMOND No, well'... He looks around. He's still trying to get himself together. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING) I'm.. I'm thinking we might have a fire hazzard here, all these extra lights. He looks awkward, as if he'd been caught at something. H.A1 ll4OND 
(CONTINUING) all right... He turns, climbs down the stage steps and starts back across the gym. At the other end of the floor a door opens, Sykes looks in. Hammond sees him. 
KIM But, Mr. Weller, tonight's the prom... 
WELLER 
(DISDAINFULLY) Tell that to your... 
(SNIFFS) hunk! He spins on his heel and marches back to his desk. The three girls hurriedly exit. 
53 INT. ROOM (SCHOOL) - DAY 53 
A hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston High yearbook, the back pages where the individual photographs of graduating students are placed. The hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head shot of Nick McBride. The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures -with similar torn edges. The other pictures are of Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards. The yearbook is slammed shut. 
54 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 54 
Kim, Jude and Vicki enter the crowded room. MUSIC from several portable RADIOS can be HEARD above the clamor as the girls move into the long lunch line. Kim spots Alex seated nearby and waves to him. 
(CONTINUED) 
4L. 
54 CONTINUED: 54 
VICKI 
(NUDGING JUDE) Here comes the incredible hunk himself. Jude looks up to see Slick slowly making his way down the line towards them. He is carrying a tray piled high with snack food: potato chips, cookies, candy. Jude smiles as he passes her, grinning. 
KIM Looks like a party. 
JUDE Yeah -- I don't think he's gonna be too good for my diet... Slick moves down the lunch line. Suddenly he is bumped from behind, sending the tray and the snacks flying across the room. Looking around, Slick jumps back, startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask. 
SLICK 
(ANGRILY) Hey, clown, what the... Three of Lou's gang quickly step up behind the masked figure. 
LOU Say what? 
SLICK 
(SHRUGS) Forget it, Lou. 
LOU 
(SMIRKS) That's what I figured. Slick bends over to pick up his lunch. 
SLICK 
(SOFTLY) Asshole! Lou and his friends shove ahead in the line until he is standing behind Kim. Lou nuzzles Kim's neck. 
LOU (muffled by the mask) Like me better now? 
(CONTINUED) 
54 CONTINUED: (2) 54 Startled, Kim spins around. Her fear quickly becomes anger. 
KIM It's an improvement! She turns her back to him. 
LOU You like it so much... (spins her around to 
(EXASPERATED) No, Vi. I didn't forget. I told you we'd go to the cemetery... The door opens and Adele Cooper's head peers around the corner. Seeing Hammond talking on the phone, she nods toward the outer office. Hammond gestures for her to wait. She persists until he angrily takes the receiver from his ear and covers the mouthpiece. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING) What is it? 
ADELE 
(WHISPERING) There are some gentlemen here to see you, Mr. Hammond. 
HAMMOND Can't it wait? 
ADELE I didn't ask... But one looks a little like that child in the picture on your desk. Hammond automatically glances at the photograph of Robin framed alongside one of the rest of his family. 
HAMMOND (into the receiver) I've got to go now, Vi... We'll be there within the hour... There's a loud CLICK on the other end of the line. 
HAIIOND 
(CONTINUING) Damn! 
(CONTINUED) 
56 CONTINUED: 56 Frustrated, Hammond slams the receiver into its cradle. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING) All right, send them in. The two Male Teachers enter first, followed by Lou and finally Alex. Hammond gives his son a sharp look, then turns to glare at Lou. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING ;WEARILY) You again? 
TEACHER 
(NODS) Brawling in the cafeteria... both of them. He places Lou's ski mask on Hammond's desk. The prin- cipal glances at it. 
HAMMOND 
(FINALLY) Thank you. I'll handle it. The Teachers exit. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING) Explanations? He looks at Alex. The boy stares at the floor and says nothing. Hammond holds the mask up to Lou. 
HAIIOND 
(CONTINUING) Halloween? 
LOU I was just foolin' around with this girl... 
ALEX 
(INTERRUPTS) Kim! Hammond frowns. 
LOU when this -- your son tackled me and... 
HAMMOND 
KIM 
(SMILING) On the prowl! 
58 EXT. STREET - DAY 
Wendy's white Mustang streaks through traffic, dodging in and out of lanes, running yellows, burning around corners. 
59 INT. MUSTANG 59 
Lou sits pinned to the passenger seat, eyes wide, staring straight ahead as if he can't quite believe this trip. His bravado seems to have left him. He glances over at Wendy in the driver's seat. She's puffing on a cigarette, handling the wheel almost casually. She's in control, 
60 EXT. DRIVE-IN 60 
The Mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left turn, narrowly beating a horn-honking oncoming van. The big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps into the end slot at a sprawling fast-food drive-in. 
61 INT. MUSTANG 61 
Lou's still pinned to his seat. Wendy shuts off the engine, looks at him. He looks at her, lets out a long deep breath. A cute little CAR-HOP in a cut-off costume and roller skates glides over. She leans into Wendy's window, talks through a wad of gum. 
CAR-HOP Ready to order? 
WENDY 
(TO LOU) What do you want? Lou's shifting around in his seat, pulling himself together. 
LOU I'm uh... a little short on cash.. 
WENDY You can owe me. 
LOU Yeah? Okay then, a couple of burgers, a large fries... what kind of beer you got? 
CAR- HOP C'mon man, this is a drive-in not a bar. 
LOU All right, all right... don't get nervous... Gimme a coke... 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
61 CONTINUED: 
LOU (CONT'D) (nods to Wendy) She'll have the same. 
WENDY A small diet cola. 
WENDY That ' sit. The Car-hop shrugs, wheels away. Wendy turns to Lou. 
WENDY I'll buy you one for Christmas, all right? Now, how do I know you're serious? 
LOU Whatta you mean, serious? I hate that school, Hammond and his asshole family... 
WENDY I don't want anyone hurt... not badly. 
LOU You got it... anything your little heart desires... 
WENDY Lou, shouldn't we go over this. Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her. 
KIM 
(SHRUGS) Let him. 
KELLY I'd die if he did... The girls wrap towels around themselves and walk to- wards the showers. 
Sa . 
69 INTT. SHIER AREA - DAY 69 A girl (MELANIE) is leaving as Kim and'Kelly enter. Wendy is standing in front of a mirror drying her hair. Kim ignores her and Wendy returns the compliment. 
MELANIE See you outside, Wendy. 
WENDY Just be a minute... Kim and Kelly hang up their towels and step into the showers. 
KELLY What about you and Nick? 
KIM What about us? Wendy finishes brushing her hair, shoots Kim.a dark look, exits. 
KELLY What.happened when he asked you? Kim smiles. 
KIM Maybe I asked him... Kelly looks at her friend. 
70 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 70 
Wendy finishes buttoning her blouse. She's pulling on her jeans when she hears a SCUFFLING SOUND. 
WENDY I'll be right there, Melanie. No answer. Curious, Wendy moves around the lockers, investigating. The room appears empty. There's a sudden LOUD CREAKING. Wendy whirls around. A locker door is swinging slowly open. 
WENDY 
(CONTINUING) Melanie?... Still no answer. Shaking her head, Wendy returns to her locker. 
(CONTINUED) 
70 CONTINUED: 70 She's about to shut it when she sees something, a pic- ture, taped to the side of the door. It's her photo, torn from the School Yearbook. She rips it from the door, looks at it. 
WENDY 
(CONTINUING) What's this for, Melanie? Her voice echoes through the empty room. She gazes around, fear creeping into her face. She quickly finishes dressing, grabs her books, turns to leave. Suddenly she screams. 
71 INT. SHOWER AREA 71 
Wendy's SCREAM is all but DROWNED OUT by the SHOWERS. Rinsing off, Kim and Kelly hear nothing. 
KELLY I think I'll let Drew do it. The door to the locker roor slowly opens behind them. 
KIM Let him? She looks at Kelly. Neither girl hears the SQUISH of RUBBER SOLES moving across the wet tile floor. Suddenly there are LOUD VOICES. Melanie comes through from the locker room, laughing. Behind her, Wendy's ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE. 
WENDY (O.S.) If you ever try anything like that again, you cow! Melanie thinks it's hilarious. 
MELANIE (to Kim and Kelly) You should've seen her jump... Nadia Comenici never did better... Wendy storms in. She's got the photo in her hand. She waves it at Kim and Kelly. 
WENDY What's this supposed to mean? 
(CONTINUED) 
vv. 
ADELE Another Hammond? 
KIM 
(AGITATED) Is he here? 
ADELE No, he's not. He said he'd be back but... She trails off. Kim is obviously upset. 
ADELE 
(CONTINUING) What's urrong? 
KIM Oh... There was... Somebody broke a mirror in the shower room... There was somebody in there... 
ADELE A mirror? Seven years bad luck... She tries to smile. Kim just looks at her. 
79 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 79 
Kim turns a corner, heading for class, and almost runs into Sykes, cleaning the floor. Sykes turns. For a moment their eyes lock. Then Kim hurries away, almost running. Sykes stares after her. 
80 INT. HALLWAY (WELLER'S CLASSROOM) - DAY 80 
Kim comes down the hallway and stops at the door. There's a piece of paper with a hastily scrawled mes- sage taped there. It heads: "Detention Postponed Until Monday -- EMERGENCY! Weller." 
VICKI (O.S.) Did it work? Kim is startled, turns. Vicki and Jude and approach- ing. Vicki hurries to the door, reads the note. 
(CONTINUED) 
ai. 
80 CONTINUED : 80 
VICKI 
(CONTINUING) It worked! She lets out a whoop, embraces Jude. Kim stands back, somehow less impressed. 
81 INT. GYM - DAY 81 
Several students are putting last-minute touches on the decor as Kim comes in. Huge speakers are being hoisted on pulleys to hang from the ceiling. A vast, raised platform covers much of the gym floor, its plexiglass surface designed to be illuminated from below. Perched on a ladder, Weller is hanging shimmering silver strips while Henri-Anne Benton supervises from the disco floor. 
HENRI-ANNE Careful, Monty... A little higher... (sees Kim and 
SMILES) I'm glad you could make it! 
KIM Something came up... (looks at Weller) 'Afternoon, Mr. Weller. 
WELLER 
(EMBARRASSED) Oh, hello, Miss... Hammond. I was just... uh... Henri-Anne mercifully interrupts him. 
HENRI-ANNE Let's get started. 
(CALLS OUT) Nick! Nick pokes his head out of the sound booth set on a platform near the stage. 
HENRI-ANNE

85 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 85 
Jude approaches her locker, stops. There's a picture taped to her locker door, her picture, ripped out of the Winston High Yearbook. She looks at it, reaches up and pulls it off the door. She winces, looks at her finger. It's bleeding. She looks at the picture. There's a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it. Jude hears SOMEONE COMING. She turns to see Kelly com- ing toward her. 
KELLY Jude... look... She has something in her hand. It's a photo of her, a, Yearbook photo with the same torn edges. Jude holds up her version. 
KELLY 
(CONTINUING) Why? 
86 INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY 86 
The DOOR CREAKS open. A light is flicked on. Sykes stands there, a broom and a big waste-pan in his hands. He stares at the broken mirror with its center hole and its missing wedge. He shuffles across the floor and starts to clean up the debris. 
87 EXT. HAMMONDS' HOUSE - DUSK 87 
The split-level suburban residence sits on a tree-lined street in an older, middle-class neighborhood. Walking up the driveway, Kim hears a LOUD THUD from behind the house. As the SOUND CONTINUES, Kim walks around back to investigate. 
88 EXT. HAMONDS ' BACKYARD - DUSK 88 
Stepping around the corner of the house, Kim sees her father furiously chopping an old stump in the flower garden. 
(CONTINUED)

89 INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 89

Vivian is arranging fresh roses on the mantel shrine when Kim enters. The girl stands for several seconds watching her mother before she speaks. 
KIM Hi, Mom. 
(CONTINUED) 
90 CONTINUED: 90 
VIVIAN 
(WITHOUT TURNING 
AROUND) Hello, Robin. Don't eat anything. Dinner's almost ready. Disturbed, Kim frowns and slowly crosses the room to her mother. 
KIM Nothing's cooking, Mom. You must've forgotten. Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to face Kim. 
VIVIAN Oh.. I don't know what I was thinking. 
KIM 
(SMILES) It doesn't matter. 
VIVIAN 
(EXCITEDLY) Have you seen the new satin pantsuit I'm wearing? Vivian smiles at her daughter. Kim studies her for a long moment, then leans over and kisses her on the cheek. 
KIM You'll be beautiful. 
91 INT. HALLWAY - HAMMONDS' HOUSE - DUSK 
As Kim walks down the hallway, she notices that Alex's door is closed. She enters her bedroom. 
92 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 92 
Kim crosses the room and switches ON her RADIO. ROCK MUSIC is HEARD as she tosses her books onto the desk and moves to the closet. She carefully pulls out her prom dress, a mid-length, off-the-shoulder gown in a white, clinging material. Holding it up against her body, she inspects the gown in the full-length mirror on the closet door. Watching her reflection, Kim twirls around, hugging the gowm to her body. Satis- fied, she gently lays the go%.m on her bed. 
(CONTINUED) 
92 CONTINUED: 92 Kim begins to undress. Outside, the twilight shadows deepen. THROUGH the VINDOM, a slight movement is SEAN among the trees; suddenly, a dark figure becomes VISIBLE, ap- proaching.the window. Kim does not notice the figure as she finishes undressing. She wraps herself in a robe and sits at her dressing table. Putting her hair up, she does not see the shadowy figure peering inside. When Kim stands up, the figure slips away from the window. As she crosses the room, the face reappears, hidden by the shadows, watching her enter the bathroom. 
93 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 93 
Wearing only a bra and panties, Wendy is sprawled across her bed, talking on the telephone. A black silk gown is draped across her legs. 
WENDY (into the receiver) What I'm wearing now?... Oh, tonight! (smiles, gently stroking the gown) You'll find out soon enough. 
(STIFFENS) Now, are we all set?... It better. I don't want her to ever forget tonight!... Okay, 'bye. Wendy hangs up the receiver and glances at her night table. A photograph of a grinning Nick McBride stares back. Wendy smiles and caresses her gown.

VIVIAN I'm going back to change. She turns back to the house. Hammond holds on to her arm.

We can't let the... terrible memories of this day affect us... That may seem cold and... insensitive to you, but it's the way it has to be.. He pauses, staring down at his wife. She's holding his gaze. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING) Now, Vi, if you think it's going to be too difficult for you... 
VIVIAN You don't want me to go.

VIVIAN Then why are you saying these things? 
HAMMMOND Vi... I just.. He's trying to stay calm, to keep the lid on. She's on the verge of tears. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING) I'm sorry... I didn't mean to upset you... 
VIVIAN You treat me like a child! I'm your wife! She glares at him. He releases her from his grip, ges- tures toward the car.
